TPConnects is adapting a modular approach along with the three phases of the project that will eventually cover NDC schemas end to end with live NDC transaction reported to IATA’s Bank Settlement Plan (BSP).\nKristine Fernandez, Director Business Development at TPConnects said; ‘As airlines work with their travel partners to bring IATA’s NDC to life in a bid to ensure their products are fully visible and can be distributed across all channels, TPConnects have moved a step further bringing a new paradigm that would eventually give airlines adopt an Amazon.com type retail model with personalization.\nAs one of the first aggregator using IATA NDC standard, we ensure that the participating airlines products are fully visible and can be bundled across all channels, enabling Travel Providers to maximize revenue not only by selling seats and ancillary sales but also through other commission based products like hotels, car, transfer, activity and duty free (pre order and onboard). TPConnects enable airlines and travel providers to sell all products related to air travel and not only the seats and limited ancillaries.\nTravel Sellers will be able to compare products, maximize their revenue by selling ancillary revenues in addition to the airline seats. They will be able to buy products like Wi-Fi (which in most cases are available onboard or during check-in), Duty Free and earn commissions out of this in addition to event and show tickets. The basic package of TPConnects comes with Flight, hotel, car, insurance and ancillary revenue integrated with multiple aggregators, Global Distribution systems and Airline Passenger Service Systems. The merchandising engine enables airlines to list their ancillary products which are not available currently.\nIn 2014 air travelers spent an estimated $28.5 billion on ancillary options such as onboard food and beverages, checked baggage, seat assignments etc. according to research conducted. While an estimated 50% of airline tickets are sold via brick and mortar travel agencies and online travel sites, the vast majority of ancillary products and services are sold by airlines on their own websites. With TPConnects aggregator platform customers are able to view detailed product information as it is being presented on airline websites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T21:18:08.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
