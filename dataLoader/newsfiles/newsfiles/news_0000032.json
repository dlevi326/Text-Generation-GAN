We are going because we want to take the next step on our journey to international growth.\" \nThe move, although a blow to Dublin's economy, will come as little surprise as Cosgrave has previously raised the prospect of moving from its Dublin base. \nHe last year threatened a move after a row over the quality of wireless Internet connection at the venue while Dublin hotels have been slammed for raising prices during the event. \nThe company which owns Web Summit has meanwhile launched spin-off conferences in Las Vegas and Asia in recent years.
