Chief Executive Officer Ma Huateng raised HK$3.2 billion ($414 million) selling portions of his shareholdings in China’s largest Internet company this month.\nMa sold a combined 23.85 million shares in four transactions between Sept. 17 and Sept. 22 at prices ranging from HK$133.365 to HK$135.495 apiece, according to a filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange. That reduced Ma’s stake in Tencent to 9.37 percent from 9.62 percent.\nMa, China’s third-richest man with a net worth of $16.8 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, built Tencent from a desktop-messaging service into China’s biggest Internet corporation by market value. The Shenzhen-based company’s businesses span social media, online commerce and gaming.\nIts WeChat mobile application counts more than 600 million monthly active users and competes with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in online retail, financial services and media and entertainment.\nShares in Tencent closed 1.1 percent lower at HK$130.90 on Wednesday, curbing its gain to 16 percent this year.
