Leaders of the project, code-named Titan, have been given permission to triple the 600-person team, the people familiar with the matter said. \nApple has hired experts in driverless cars, but the people familiar with Apple’s plans said the Cupertino, Calif., company doesn’t currently plan to make its first electric vehicle fully autonomous. That capability is part of the product’s long-term plans, the people familiar with the matter said. \nA recent report from The Guardian said that Apple recently discussed plans for an autonomous vehicle with the California DMV. Apple has reportedly been eyeing specific locations in the state to test its car, codenamed Project Titan. \nWhen and if Apple debuts a self-driving car, it’ll likely be behind the likes of Google and Uber – both of which have already begun road testing of such technology. Apple’s been working on a car for quite some time, and it’s not exactly a secret. But the new timetable means that you may see an Apple Car before you see the iPhone 11 … or iPhone 11s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T03:12:50.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
