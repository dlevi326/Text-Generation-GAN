The increase became a poster child for high drug prices, which have been attacked by drug-benefit managers and some Democrats.\nOver the last few days, privately held Turing and Chief Executive Martin Shkreli have resisted criticism over Daraprim's price hike, saying the drug had been underpriced and the higher returns would fund research into a new and better treatment.\nMr. Shkreli had also rejected cutting the drug's price, while lashing out at critics on social media. Mr. Shkreli didn't respond to requests for comment.\nThe company expects to finalize the amount of the price reduction over the next few days, the person familiar with the matter said. News of the price cut was reported earlier by NBC News and ABC News.\nThe company also plans to announce other steps to make it easier for patients to obtain the drug, the person said. Turing already had offered to help subsidize out-of-pocket costs and provide the drug free to the uninsured, according to the person.\nDaraprim is a half-century-old drug used to treat an infection from the toxoplasma parasite that affects more than a million people a year in the U.S. It can be life-threatening in those who have weakened immune systems, such as pregnant women and HIV patients.\nThe price hike was the latest example of how some drug companies are buying rights to medicines they view as underpriced and then charging significantly more, the subject of an article in April in The Wall Street Journal that prompted two Democrats in Congress to start an investigation.\nDaraprim's higher price prompted an outcry from some patient advocates, especially those representing people infected by the HIV virus.\nAfter a New York Times article on the price hike, Hillary Clinton, a Democratic candidate for president, tweeted on Monday about such \"price gouging\" and vowed to issue a plan for curbing high drug prices, which she did Tuesday. Analysts said the tweet contributed to a big drop in biotech company share prices on Tuesday.\nWrite to Jonathan D.
