A research team, led by Haitao Xu of the College of William and Mary and Haining Wang of the University of Delaware , discovered that only 89 (2.2%) of the 4,109 sellers on a Chinese e-commerce platform identified as faking transactions, were detected and penalized . As the world's second largest economy, China's trade and investment with the world continues to grow at a fast rate. For a foreign buyer, the price of Chinese goods, especially from an online platform, is competitive and attractive, but can you detect danger when a fake company is approaching you? With the help of LegalMall, we can identify the risks in your trade and investment decision. \nMr. Yi, founder of Legalmall, is a P.R.C. lawyer and a member of Foreign Lawyers Association of Hong Kong . He realized there was a better way to overcome these kinds of obstacles when doing business in China , so he and other lawyers established LegalMall, an online legal services platform to provide legal solutions to a diverse range of businesses, including company verification, legal documentation, business registrations, trademark registrations, and other background screening and due diligence services.\n\"Our group aims to build the first international legal services platform in multiple languages and nations. We unite professional lawyers from various countries to serve globalized markets with localized, efficient and cost-effective services. Our goal is to take legal services online to better cater to an international clientele,\" Mr. Yi said.\nOne of LegalMall's clients, Mr. J was about to close a deal and transfer money until he ran across LegalMall's website. After a moment's doubt, he decided to reassure himself of this \"verified supplier\". Two days after purchasing LegalMall's comprehensive company verification, Mr. J received a business report covering the Chinese supplier's detailed registration information and essential enterprise information. LegalMall found out that the company in question's phone number and address actually belonged to another company. Eventually Mr. J wisely withdrew from this fishy transaction, saving himself a large amount of money that otherwise would have been lost to fraud.\nWith an expanding scope of business services and cooperation with local enterprises, LegalMall is better able to serve worldwide clients who are growing in Chinese and Singaporean markets. LegalMall provides local expertise to give our clients peace of mind in unfamiliar territory. For more information on LegalMall, please visit www.legalmall.net .
