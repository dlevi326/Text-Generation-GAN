(until 2050) are $1.07 trillion per year, so more than meet the costs of the required investment,\" said a Greenpeace statement. \nThe world's nations are seeking to curb rampant emissions of climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to slow global warming, but the cost of the transformation is often held up as a major obstacle, especially for poor and developing countries. \n\"The solar and wind industries have come of age, and are cost-competitive with coal,\" said the report's lead author Sven Teske of Greenpeace, and warned the fossil fuel industry was \"moving rapidly into irrelevance\". \n\"Every dollar invested in new fossil fuel projects is high risk capital which might end up as stranded investment.\" \nThe report highlighted that as many as 9.7 million people could have jobs in the solar power industry by 2030—more than 10 times as many as today and equivalent to the current number of jobs in the coal sector. \nWind industry jobs could increase tenfold to nearly eight million. \n'Economically favourable' \nThe researchers based their forecasts on UN estimations for economic development and population growth, and assumed the world's energy system would be completely \"decarbonised\" over the next 35 years. \nThey also considered rising energy demand in fast-growing Africa and Asia, offset by lower demand in rich nations resulting in a peak of global demand by about 2020. \nAnd the study assumed that renewable energy costs come down as the technology and availability improves. \nIn the short term, electricity could become slightly more expensive—by about $0.02 per kilowatt hour, said the authors. \nBut \"as prices rise for conventional fuels, these costs will become economically favourable across all world regions by 2030, and by 2050 the fuel cost savings will be 1.7 US cents/kWh,\" said the report. \nLast week, environmental advocates including wildlife documentary filmmaker David Attenborough and climate economist Nicholas Stern, called for investment in research and development to make renewable energy cheaper than coal within 10 years. \nAnd a recent study in the journal Science Advances warned that if mankind burns all the fossil fuel left on Earth, releasing some 10,000 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, virtually all of Antarctica's ice would melt, sea levels would rise by tens of metres to flood entire cities, and temperatures would skyrocket to unbearable levels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T09:00:27.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
