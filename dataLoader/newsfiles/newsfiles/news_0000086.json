Manufacturers include a margin on this value to allow for small variations in manufacturing and measurement. The possibility to tighten this margin (typically few percent) brings an economic benefit to them and to investors. \nOn the R and D side, reducing uncertainty increases the possibility to clearly identify the impact of new materials and processes. For these measurements both industry and the photovoltaics research community rely on a calibration chain ultimately traceable to the SI (Systeme International d'Unites) irradiance scale. \nFor instance the JRC has traditionally calibrated its primary reference devices against the instrument group maintained at the world radiometric centre (WRC) in Davos, Switzerland. \nRecent updates to the world radiometric reference values to take account of improved instrumentation prompted scientists at the JRC's European Solar Testing Installation (ESTI) labs to re-analyse the data of their five primary reference cells (highly stable crystalline silicon devices). \nUsing a rigorous analysis of the uncertainties resulted in the more accurate assignment of calibration values. The uncertainty of 0.23% is a factor of two below that of any single method. \nThe unique ESTI reference cell set made this possible, drawing from its 20 years of calibration history, well controlled maintenance and regular stability checks, as well as collaboration with the world leading solar reference laboratories in Japan, USA and Europe. \nThe results open the way to cheaper and faster calibration of secondary reference devices for industry and research to the same level or even lower uncertainty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T11:40:16.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
