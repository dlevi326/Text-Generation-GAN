The company risks alienating not only fans of the “People’s Car” but dealers, the local face of the brand, who feel blindsided by the scandal.\n“The most important thing is that VW comes out and tells the public what happened, who was involved and make sure that it doesn’t happen again,” said Jeremy Robinson-Leon, principal and chief operating officer at New York-based corporate and crisis PR firm Group Gordon.\nThat communication needs to happen soon, says Michael Jackson, CEO of AutoNation, the largest auto dealership chain in the U.S. He says VW diesel owners are angry and dealers don’t have enough details to share with them. Jackson gives VW a week to explain its actions or he feels the brand value will be damaged.\nIn the four-county Dallas-Fort Worth area, Volkswagen had sold a total of 4,397 vehicles through August for a 1.7 percent share of total sales (260,120), according to the Freeman Metroplex Recap of new-vehicle sales.\nBeing an environmentally friendly company is in Volkswagen’s DNA. Back in the 1960s, its first U.S. ads urged people to “Think Small” in an era of gas-guzzling cars. More recently, Volkswagen launched a global “Think Blue” campaign in 2010 with the aim to “become the world’s most ecologically sustainable car manufacturer” by 2018.\n“They had a brand image that is very straightforward, honest and in recent years dependent on being a leader on environmental standards and pushing those,” said Kelly O’Keefe, professor of brand management at the VCU Brandcenter. “Now it appears they’ve been cheating to get there, which is a devastating revelation.”\nRecent ads have promoted its “clean diesel” technology, which provides high fuel economy, in its Passat, Jetta and other cars. One campaign shows older women in a Passat bickering about whether diesel fuel is “sluggish” or “stinky.” A Jetta ad says the car’s engine is “painstakingly engineered without compromise.”\nThe scandal broke Friday in the U.S., and the last “Clean Diesel” ad ran Monday, according to iSpot.tv, which tracks TV ads in real time. Volkswagen appears to have pulled the ads from its YouTube channel, although they remain on some dealer pages and elsewhere on YouTube.\nVolkswagen should now focus on its cars with gasoline engines and be very aggressive with pricing promotions, said David Kiley, author of Getting the Bugs Out, the Rise, Fall and Comeback of Volkswagen in America .\n“This really shoots to pieces the diesel business,” Kiley says.\nIn fact, YouGov BrandIndex, which tracks a brand’s perception, said news of the scandal has brought the carmaker to its lowest U.S. consumer perception levels in more than 61/2 years.\nVW may also need to pull back on the whimsical side it cultivated with Super Bowl ads like “The Force” in 2012, showing a young boy dressed like Darth Vader using his pseudo-powers on a Passat; and a 2013 ad depicting a man so happy driving a Volkswagen he started speaking in a Jamaican accent.\n“It’s really hard to do cute when people don’t trust you,” VCU Brandcenter’s O’Keefe says.\nVolkswagen and Audi, which is controlled by VW and is also part of the emission scandal, spent $721.9 million on advertising in the U.S. in 2014, according to Kantar Media.\nBut VW will travel a long, painful road before the scandal is behind it, experts say.\n“If VW manages this crisis properly, they can get past this with the customers in the marketplace fairly soon,” says AutoNation’s Jackson. “With the regulators, it’s going to be a longer story.”\nThe Associated Press,\nstaff writer Terry Box", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:44:20.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
