Developed by PES Productions and published by Konami, the game has made quite a name for itself.\n\nNow, with Brazil’s Neymar on the cover, and the same FOX engine featured in Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom, PES is all set to take the crown as one of the most efficient football simulation games. From what we have seen so far, there has been a lot of improvement in terms of animation and visual fidelity as well as offering control of player movements. PES 2016 will be releasing on September 18 on PC, PS4, PS3, XBox One and XBox 360\nNBA 2K16 and NBA Live 16 \nSeptember 29 \nIt’s rare that you hear of two competitive games releasing at the same time. This September will be an exciting month for all NBA fans, as EA Sports’ NBA Live16 and Visual Concepts’ NBA 2K16 hit the shelves on the same day, that is September 29.\n\n\nThough, EA Sports has been talking confidently about NBA Live16, it would be interesting to see how it matches up against NBA2K16, especially since EA Sports’ past record with the Live series hasn’t been great.\n\nWe aren’t talking of just the stars on game jackets (NBA2K16 has three — Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis and Jame Harden — against NBA Live16’s solo star, Russell Westbrook), but actual performances and hands-on efficiency with player movements. While NBA 2K16 will be available across platforms including PS3, PC, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox 360, NBA Live 16 wille be releasing only on PS4 and \nXbox One.\nAlso releasing in 2015 \nOct 13: Tom Clancy’s Rainbox Six Siege\n\nOct 22: Just Dance 2016\n\nOct 23: Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate\n\nOct 30: WWE 2K16\n\nNov 1: Fallout 4\n\nNov 26: Track Mania Turbo \n\nDec 1: Just Cause 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:45:51.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
