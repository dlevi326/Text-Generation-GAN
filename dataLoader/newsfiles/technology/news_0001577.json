It is in no way degrading!\n— Melissa Berry (@Melissavoice) September 29, 2015 @mediaguardian @RNIB What on earth?! I was very proud to do the voiceover for this ad & am stunned that FB have deemed it too hard hitting!\nOn Wednesday, Facebook contacted the RNIB to say that it was reversing its decision explaining that a review had shown that the “language used in the copy and video are compliant”.\n“As the previous correspondence mentioned, we do not allow ads to directly assert the physical condition of the audience,” said a member of the Facebook team in an email to RNIB. “This ensures that ads promotes a safe community and we maintain the trust of the audience on Facebook. However, in this case, the intent is not to assert that the viewer is struggling with blindness, thus the language used in the copy and video are compliant. The ad has been re-approved, and you are able to set them back to active.”\n— RNIB (@RNIB) September 30, 2015 We can confirm that Facebook have reversed their decision to ban our ad! Thank you all for your support! https://t.co/Ifpyi0zx2b #SeeTheNeed\nFacebook offered an apology to the RNIB admitting it had made a mistake in implementing its policy.\n“Facebook is a place for people and organisations to campaign for the things that matter to them, and the Royal National Institute of Blind People’s video ad is a great example of that,” said a spokeswoman. “In this instance we made a mistake, and have contacted the charity to let them know and to apologise for any inconvenience caused”.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RNIB", "https://twitter.com/RNIB/statuses/649142158331617280", "https://twitter.com/RNIB/status/649142158331617280", "https://twitter.com/Melissavoice/status/648802007072002048", "https://twitter.com/Melissavoice/status/648802447180365824", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SeeTheNeed?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/mediaguardian", "https://twitter.com/Melissavoice/statuses/648802447180365824", "https://t.co/Ifpyi0zx2b", "https://twitter.com/Melissavoice/statuses/648802007072002048"], "published": "2015-09-30T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:48:06.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
