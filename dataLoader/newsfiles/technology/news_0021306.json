The 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose throughout the week before settling at the current rate. \n\"Mortgage rates avoided the erratic movement of the stock market and rose steadily last week on improving domestic economic data,\" said Erin Lantz, vice president of mortgages at Zillow. \"This week, we expect rates to be volatile as markets look for further improvements in the economy's health - especially Friday's jobs report– that will influence the Fed's decision to raise rates later in the year.\" \nZillow's real-time mortgage rates are based on thousands of custom mortgage quotes submitted daily to anonymous borrowers on the Zillow Mortgages site and reflect the most recent changes in the market. These are not marketing rates, or a weekly survey. \nThe rate for a 15-year fixed home loan is currently 2.92 percent, while the rate for a 5-1 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is 2.73 percent. \nPurchase Mortgage Application Activity \nZillow predicts tomorrow's seasonally adjusted Mortgage Bankers Association Weekly Application Index will show purchase loan activity did not change from the week prior. Zillow combines loan requests made on Zillow Mortgages last week with the previous week's Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) Weekly Application Index to predict the MBA's Weekly Application Index for purchase loans, which will be released tomorrow.
