The entire center is \"Internet of Things\" enabled, equipped with advanced technology to enhance the learning experience of the engineers. It uses digital-age learning concepts, dividing students from diverse ethnicities and varied cultural experiences into cohorts of eight to foster collaboration.

Mindtree Kalinga, with an investment of $20 million in the construction of its first phase, is designed to reflect a blend of the digital future of man with ancient Odishan architecture at the core. It is landscaped with local flora comprising of endangered species. The smart campus uses digital technologies effectively for efficient consumption of resources through sensors that span all areas. Unique construction methods have been used to make it an inspiring example of sustainability.\nMagic B ricks - The campus has been built using one million bricks created from the earth dug out of the ground when excavating the site. The bricks were made without using fire, ash and additional water. Eternal Pond - The entire construction has been done with overflow rainwater. Rainwater is harvested in to a 14.7 million liter pond. Going forward, the Eternal Pond will make the campus largely water-neutral. Passive C ooling S ystems - The living space on the campus is fitted with a passive cooling system which provides a constant flow of refreshing air in the building, avoiding the need for air conditioners. Midday Meals for School Children - Mindtree Kalinga's kitchen is run by the Akshay Patra Foundation. Every meal that a Mindtree Mind eats here, generates a surplus that contributes to midday meals for the children studying in the government schools of Odisha. This sum will be matched with a contribution from the Mindtree Foundation and by Mindtree Founders to help distribute 5 million meals among school children every year. The Sun Dial - This is a 1600 square feet image in tile, meant to be a tribute to the Konark Temple in Odisha.
