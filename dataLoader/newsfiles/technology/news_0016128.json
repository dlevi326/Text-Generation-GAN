SWEET NOTHING!!! They think they are above the law as we have seen so many times. If ANC were so concerned about alienating South Africa from other African countries or the Chines or Russians, why did it allow Al-Bashier into South Africa in the first place. What about alienating ourselves from other ICC member countries as well as the USA? Then of course there is the issue of the Dallai Lama, a good man, not being allowed not the country, only to appease the Chinese. Why are they considering inviting or allowing Bashier in again!!! What is wrong with these people? They are arrogant. The ANC feel hard done by because they are taking criticism from the media and logical thinking people, but they only have themselves to blame. They have provided an abundance of reasons for the criticism and continue to do so. Let's wait for the elections where hopefully the DA will weaken this bunch of crooked morons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:04:36.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
