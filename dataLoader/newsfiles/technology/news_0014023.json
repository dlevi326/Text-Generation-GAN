( www.dispersivetechnologies.com ), a leading innovator in software-defined networking (SDN), will demonstrate its virtualized network solutions at the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo October 4-8, 2015 in Orlando, Florida. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150928/271490LOGO \nTo showcase differences for both streaming video and large file transfer, the company will run Dispersive(TM) Virtualized Networks (DVN) and a standard virtual private network (VPN) in a side-by-side comparison. Both systems will run on a local area network into which a 25ms latency has been introduced. This will simulate the real-world conditions of a wide area network sending traffic between Chicago and San Francisco. \n\"We want people to see a real, working virtualized network that takes a different approach,\" says Robert W. Twitchell, Jr., founder and CEO of Dispersive. \"And we want them to see how it compares with VPN, a system most enterprises use today to protect data-in-motion.\" \nTwitchell, who is also a Department of Defense cyber and mobile warfare expert, will deliver a speech at the symposium entitled \"Dispersive(TM) SDN: Control at The Edge.\" The presentation will outline the advantages of Dispersive's solution over not only VPNs, but SDNs as well. \n\"With control at the edge, our integrative design delivers traffic with speed, security and reliability over the Internet,\" Twitchell explains. \"This works especially well in federated IT environments, where our solution does more than protect critical data. It also improves application performance, creates a more productive mobile workforce and eliminates reliance on high-priced proprietary hardware and private networks.\" \nDispersive's DVN vs. VPN demonstration will be at Booth 26 in the Emerging Technologies Pavilion at the symposium. Twitchell's talk will be at 1:30 p.m. ET on October 7 at the pavilion theater. \nFor more information about Dispersive Technologies and its innovative solutions, visit www.dispersivetechnologies.com . \nThe Gartner Symposium/ITxpo is an industry-wide conference for top CIOs and their teams, showcasing the top technology solutions providers from around the globe. \nAbout Dispersive Technologies, Inc.
