The Vendasta Wholesale Marketplace allows agencies and media companies to easily provision products and immediately begin marketing them to current and prospective customers.\nThis single consistent user interface—combined with training, marketing, sales management and streamlined support—make it easy for Vendasta partners to sell a wide array of products profitably and at scale. From a single platform, agencies are able to provide a consistent user experience for their admins, sales personnel, support and business customers.\nThe Vendasta 10X marketing automation platform integrates seamlessly with the Marketplace, using unique data about businesses—such as reviews, listing accuracy and social cues— to market specific products. As businesses interact with the marketing collateral, the 10X platform identifies which products the businesses are ready to buy and provides hot leads and sales management to the agencies, drastically reducing their cost of sales.\nFurther, because the platform supports DIY (Do It Yourself), DIFM (Do It For Me) and DIWM ™ (Do it With Me) models, partners have an automated system to profitably sell DIY products at low price points. These products and services are the thin edge of the wedge, allowing the platform to identify which business are ready to spend more and require a higher level of service. Partners maximize their share of wallet with current and new local businesses and keep them out of the hands of companies like ReachLocal, Yext, Yodel, Main Street Hub and Signpost, which have been encroaching on their business.\n“We are allowing our partners to be a one-stop shop selling local SMBs the products they want in the manner and model they want it. We reduce our partners’ cost of sales and provide real leads and ROI they can measure from day one,” says Vendasta CEO, Brendan King.\nBy implementing Vendasta’s easy-to-use APIs and webhooks, vendors and service providers are easily able to integrate into the Vendasta Wholesale Marketplace and gain access to thousands of agencies and media companies, tens of thousands of in-premise salespeople, and hundreds of thousands of their local business customers at a fraction of the cost they would spend on traditional or direct marketing efforts.\n“We’re already seeing tremendous demand from solutions providers wanting to integrate into our Marketplace,” said Jed Williams, Vendasta Vice President of Business Development and Strategy. “There’s great value in the network of partners—and associated sales teams and local business customers—that utilize Vendasta’s platform and will be able to seamlessly provision top-quality third parties. By enabling both sides of our Marketplace to generate incremental revenue, we’re creating a true win-win, with local businesses ultimately winning as well.”\nAbout Vendasta\nVendasta's 10X platform empowers agencies and media companies to grow their sales of both digital and non-digital marketing solutions for local businesses. Through this platform, Vendasta combines a streamlined sales CRM and marketing automation system with a white-labelled marketplace to identify when business owners are ready to buy, providing a 10X lift in sales and a 10X decrease in cost of customer acquisition. Beyond a DIY interface for local businesses, Vendasta’s suite of tools are fully integrated with an agency Concierge system for \"Do It For Me\" and \"Do It With Me™\" services.
