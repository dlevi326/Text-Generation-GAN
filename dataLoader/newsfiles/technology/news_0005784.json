The program, designed by Educational Testing Service (ETS) and the TOEFL program, inspires students to practice and improve their English-language skills in the classroom under the guidance of their English-language teachers. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150826/261215 \nThe 2015 campaign -- \"Your Culture. In Your Words.\" -- is designed for students to share the celebrations, legends, landmarks or traditions unique to their culture. Working together as a class over the course of a few months, students will be using their English-language skills to create a video, radio, poster or newspaper announcement. Creativity is encouraged and students will showcase their knowledge of the English language to effectively communicate their messages. \n\"Thousands of students representing more than 20 countries submitted creative advertisements about their hometowns in the 2014 campaign,\" said David Payne, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Global Education at ETS. \"With the increasing role of the English language globally, we are committed to providing opportunities for young learners to develop their English skills in the classroom.\" \nAll classrooms are welcome to submit projects for the 2015 campaign by March 31, 2016. Participating classes will receive promotional items, educational materials, certificates and a plaque, and will have the opportunity to be featured on the TOEFL Young Students Series GO English! website.
