The clinical trials, BALANCE-I and BALANCE-II, achieved ACR20 at week 12 across all dose levels, except the lowest dose in BALANCE-II. BALANCE-I and BALANCE-II evaluated patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis with inadequate responses to prior anti-TNF (TNF-IR) or methotrexate (MTX-IR) treatment, respectively.\n\"We believe ABT-494 has the potential to become a best-in-class therapy, particularly in the most challenging patient population of TNF-inadequate responders,\" said Michael Severino , M.D., executive vice president, research and development and chief scientific officer, AbbVie. \"We are encouraged by the results of our Phase 2 studies and we will advance ABT-494 to Phase 3 studies with a once-daily formulation.\"\nBALANCE – I\n(TNF-IR)\nACR20\nACR50\nACR70\nBALANCE – II\n(MTX-IR)\nACR20\nACR50\nACR70\n3 mg, twice-daily\n56% *\n24%\n13%\n3 mg, twice-daily\n65%\n40% *\n23% *\n6 mg, twice-daily\n63% **\n37% *\n27% ***\n6 mg, twice-daily\n73% *\n49% **\n31% **\n12 mg, twice-daily\n73% ***\n44% **\n22% **\n12 mg, twice-daily\n82% **\n50% **\n16% **\n18 mg, twice-daily\n71% ***\n40% **\n22% **\n18 mg, twice-daily\n77% **\n45% *\n28% **\nPlacebo\n35%\n17%\n4%\n24 mg, once-daily\n82% **\n44% *\n25% *\nPlacebo\n50%\n20%\n7%\n*p\nOverall rates of discontinuation and serious adverse events were Mark Genovese , M.D., professor of medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, Division of Immunology and Rheumatology. \"The consistency of response and the overall safety profile of ABT-494 in these two patient populations offer the potential for significant benefit and support advancing this compound into Phase 3 studies. In particular, the TNF-IR population is increasing and represents those failing current standard of care. Anything we can do to better help these patients would represent an important advancement to the field.\"\nBALANCE-I enrolled 276 patients, approximately 30 percent of whom had an inadequate response to two or more anti-TNF agents and 20 percent had an inadequate response to treatment with a non-TNF biologic. BALANCE-II enrolled 300 patients with an inadequate response to prior treatment with methotrexate.\n\"The levels of ACR response across the ABT-494 studies are impressive and warrant further investigation, particularly in treatment-refractory patients with the highest unmet need,\" said Joel Kremer , M.D., director of research, The Center for Rheumatology in Albany, New York and a clinical investigator on BALANCE-I.\nAbout BALANCE-I study\nBALANCE-I is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 2b study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of four doses of ABT-494 in adult patients with moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to anti-TNF biologic therapy. Doses tested included 3, 6, 12, and 18 mg BID. The primary endpoint is the percentage of subjects achieving an ACR20 response after 12 weeks of treatment using an LOCF approach. Secondary objectives include safety and tolerability, as well as other efficacy assessments, such as the percentage of subjects achieving an ACR50 and ACR70 response.\nAbout BALANCE-II study\nBALANCE-II is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 2b study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of five doses of ABT-494 in adult patients with moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to prior treatment with methotrexate. Doses tested included 3, 6, 12, and 18 mg BID, and 24 mg QD. The primary endpoint is the percentage of subjects achieving an ACR20 response after 12 weeks of treatment using an LOCF approach. Secondary objectives include safety and tolerability, as well as other efficacy assessments such as the percentage of subjects achieving an ACR50 and ACR70 response.\nAbout ABT-494\nABT-494 is an investigational oral agent that selectively inhibits JAK1, which plays an important role in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid arthritis. A Phase 2 trial of ABT-494 for the treatment of Crohn's disease is ongoing.\nAbout AbbVie\nAbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories.
