With the Indian cap up for grabs for the top performers, perhaps the importance of India ‘A’ is often underplayed. Following a surprising loss against Bangladesh ‘A’ in the second game , India ‘A’ will look to get back to winning ways and clinch the unofficial three-match series in the final ODI to be played at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Sunday. The decider could be crucial in more ways than one as the national selectors, having watched the first two games, will choose the squad for the T20 and ODI series against the visiting South Africans, on Sunday. With both matches being decided by a handful of exceptional individual performances, a repeat of one such may well be what the teams will be looking for. Add to the fact that the team chasing ended up on the losing side in both the previous encounters, the toss might play an important role in the decider. The Rahul Dravid-coached side will hope for openers Mayank Agarwal and Unmukt Chand to convert their starts into big innings and for Suresh Raina, to pick up some steam to tackle the opposition’s tricky spinners along with Sanju Samson.
