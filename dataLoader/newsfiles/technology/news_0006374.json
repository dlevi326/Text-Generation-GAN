ACL received awards in the Technical Innovation category for its ScriptHub, Interpretive Visual Remediation, and mobile Scan-to-PDF innovations. The three awards were the most received by any company . The 4th Annual GRC Innovation Awards recognize technology innovations and user experience in governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) programs and processes. The ACL solutions awarded cover a wide range of GRC platform functionality in three award categories: Automated Controls : ACL's ScriptHub content platform is a growing library of pre-written data analysis scripts that enables users of all skill levels to easily build complex data analytics used for operational risk management, internal control monitoring, or automated auditing. Audit Management : Scan-to-PDF is a feature of the ACL™ GRC mobile app for iOS and Android that allows audit, risk, and compliance professionals to capture hard copy documents as electronic evidence in support of audits, risk analysis, or control testing quickly while conducting fieldwork or collecting information on-site. Internal Control Management : Interpretive Visual Remediation helps ACL users quickly identify trends, patterns and outliers in an organization's transactional data and easily engage stakeholders in analyzing what those mean or trigger remediation actions and workflows. “We're excited to be recognized in this year's GRC 20/20 awards for innovations spanning four things that we're really proud of: mobile apps, cloud technology, risk analytics and expert content,” said Dan Zitting , VP , Product Management & Design at ACL . “These are exactly the kinds of technology innovations that are structurally revolutionizing the GRC professions, and pushing all of us to the next level of delivery in helping organizations nail their objectives.” “ACL has demonstrated GRC innovation in three categories: script writing, mobile scanning and data visualization,” said Michael Rasmussen , Chief GRC Pundit for GRC 20/20 and internationally recognized expert. “It is imperative that we recognize today's successes as a milestone toward advancing GRC maturity, which elevates its position in an organization's strategy and operations. When supported by a range of technology, knowledge and services, GRC enables organizations to achieve greater efficiency, effectiveness, and agility across business operations.” A complete list of award categories and recipients can be found on the GRC 20/20 blog .
