Josh Robenstone Share on twitter by John Stensholt It's the sports deal that looks like something out of a movie: the behemoth that is the AFL, armed with a recently signed $2.508 billion TV deal, crushing a small but fast-growing Australian technology company.\nIt has AFL clubs up in arms, and has led to accusations of conflict of interest, claims and counter-claims about rival technologies, and an unhappy high-profile US billionaire.\nAll that and a share price roller coaster this week in what has been one of the year's best-performing stocks on the ASX.\nCatapult Sports International, which manufactures GPS-tracking devices for athletes, has contracts with all 18 AFL clubs to provide the tracking devices – worn in games and training – and help manage the data collected. It also has a contract for the AFL umpires and junior development teams.\nOn Monday, Catapult announced that those deals could be in jeopardy as the AFL was on the verge of awarding its tracking and data-services contract to Champion Data. This rival company is 49 per cent owned by the League and counts AFL general counsel Andrew Dillon and the league's general manager of broadcasting Simon Lethlean as directors.\nCatapult shares plunged by as much as 12 per cent before recovering, but fell again as the week came to a close. The company says it was blindsided by the decision – and claims its technology is superior to that of Champion Data's consortium, which includes US giant Zebra Technologies, which has contracts with the US NFL, and Irish firm Stats Sports.\nOne business identity less than impressed is Catapult shareholder and Dallas Mavericks billionaire owner Mark Cuban. \"I personally think they [the AFL] didn't make the choice based on technology,\" Cuban told AFR Weekend . Catapult is understood to be considering its legal options.\nCatapult shares up Despite this week's 12 per cent share slide, Catapult stock is up nearly 160 per cent since January 1, proving that home-grown technology companies can be a success for investors as they push into offshore markets. Catapult has 85 per cent of its elite sports customers overseas.\nWhether that is good enough for the AFL is another matter. Sources insist the league would have chosen Catapult if its proposal been more compelling than that of Champion's consortium, and the two bids were close enough for the league to be comfortable to choose the latter.\nIn a memo sent to AFL clubs, league football operations manager Mark Evans said Champion Data's proposal was \"value for money\" and would integrate with Champion Data's current statistics service.\nSome AFL clubs are uncomfortable with the decision and have voiced their opposition.\nIt remains to be seen if Catapult and the AFL can reach a compromise, something Catapult chairman Adir Shiffman hopes for. \"Our hope is to very much work with Champion Data, another successful Australian tech company, to continue to deliver a world-leading solution to the AFL.\"\nAn AFL spokesperson said a decision had been made and that the decision stands.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-09-04T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:23:38.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
