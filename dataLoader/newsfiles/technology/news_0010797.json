One of their major areas of focus has been pioneering rare earth mineral bases non-thermal FAR Infrared production. \n\"We have been developing our rare earth mineral mixture since 2010,\" said Matthew Ryncarz. \"We have worked with the best doctors in the world to formulate the strongest non thermal infrared solution in existence.\" \nIn order to validate FAR Infrared output, Fusion IONZ commissioned The Wuhan Product Quality Supervision and Test Institute. WHQT is headquartered in Wuhan, China and are considered a world leader in FAR Infrared testing. They were specifically instructed to test the FAR Infrared output of the proprietary Fusion mineral mixture. The tests showed conclusively that the Fusion mineral mixture emits very high levels of nourishing FAR Infrared rays. The actual test can be found on Fusion's web site. \nCurrently, Fusion IONZ is blending their proprietary mixture in several types of wearable FAR Infrared producing devices. Notably, non-thermal FAR Infrared was reviewed by Harvard Medical and Boston General in a 2012 technology review posted on the National Institute of Health. \n\"Since day one we have led with science before marketing. We have invested a lot into our research and development, and this is just another step in that process, but we feel it is important information to supply to our current customers and prospective customers,\" said Matthew Ryncarz. \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/matthew-ryncarz-announces-successful-far-infrared-lab-testing-results-300151283.html \nSOURCE Fusion IONZ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T13:28:13.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
