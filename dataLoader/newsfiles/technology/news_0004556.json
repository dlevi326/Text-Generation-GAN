This may well have damaging environmental impacts on important habitat-forming marine species, with implications for fish populations. We will now seek to identify areas of high conservation value, then identify how these areas may best be conserved.” \nProfessor Davis, a member of the Centre for Sustainable Ecosytem Solutions at UOW, said the project is the first of its kind to research the impact of anchors on the marine environment, with the aim of creating sustainable anchoring practices throughout the world and working closely with the shipping Industry to achieve this goal. \n“There is a huge knowledge gap in the impact of deep-water vessels on environmental habitats. Even the shipping industry’s code of practice fails to recognise anchor scour as an important environmental threat. We are focusing on Port Kembla to begin with, but as each port and region is different, the impact on the ocean floor may vary dramatically from port to port,” he said. \nProfessor Davis and his team have already been liaising with government, both state and federal, members of the shipping industry, and environmental agencies to examine how much damage results from the 11,000 vessels that visit Australian ports annually and how impacts may be mitigated. \nIt is hoped the project will develop universal frameworks for environmental stewardship that can be adapted for coastal environments around the world, in both tropical and temperate latitudes. \nUOW’s Global Challenges Program is a major research initiative designed to address the complex problems facing the world through multidisciplinary research. Sustaining Coastal and Marine Zones is one of the central challenges, focusing on how the world’s precious coastal and marine environments can be better preserved and protected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T13:35:44.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
