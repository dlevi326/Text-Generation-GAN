Like smaller droplets, the contact line of this reservoir will oscillate in response to vertical vibrations of sufficient amplitude. As the vibration amplitude is increased over a second threshold, the morphology of the contact line will shift from a nearly perfect circle to a trigonal planar shape 32 , 36 . The alternating circle pattern distorts or modifies this contact line, which introduces instabilities at the “vertices” of the contact line 36 . As the contact line expands across the surface texture, the vertices become pinned on the mesas. When the contact line retracts, a “pinch-off” occurs as the contact line is sheared over the trench ( Figure 2b ). With this design, the resulting droplet size is dependent on the initial size of the reservoir, and droplets as small as 0.1 µL have been generated 36 . Switching \nSwitching is the process of selectively moving a droplet from one path to another. This function is essential for sorting droplets and increasing the throughput of downstream processes. Switches are relatively simple to implement with DMF systems that move droplets by modulating surface tension because a surface tension gradient can be created in any direction within the droplet. On an EWOD or OEW device, a droplet will move in the direction of an activated electrode. With an array of individually addressable electrodes, a droplet can be switched by activating an electrode next to the current path of the droplet 7 , 25 , 39 . The droplet will be pulled onto this electrode and can be subsequently directed to a new path in any direction. Microheaters are also organized in individually addressable arrays to move droplets, but unlike EWOD electrodes, individual microheaters can only move droplets along a single axis 40 . However, microheater switches have been achieved through the use of specially designed “intersections”. These intersections can switch a droplet by turning it 90 degrees onto a new track ( Figure 2c ). The intersection accomplishes this by creating a heated region that pushes the droplet in the direction of the new path while inhibiting movement on the direction of the original path 40 . With photosensitive surfaces, as in electrowetting, droplets can be directed in any direction or pattern depending on the location of the light-activated chemical gradient relative to the droplet 21 , 31 . \nImplementing switches on contact line driven systems has been proven to be more of a challenge. ARC systems have been developed that use EWOD electrodes to pull droplets onto a new path of rungs ( Figure 2d ) 41 . However, a switch that selectively moves droplets solely through geometric modulation of the contact line has yet to be developed. Interestingly, ARC systems are able to selectively move specific droplet sizes based on the frequency of applied vibrations 42 . This ability is likely present in nanostructured Parylene ratchets and TPAs as well, as the amplitude threshold for contact line oscillation is based on droplet volume 43 . As mentioned previously, the direction of droplet motion is also dependent on the feature size of the TPAs. Such phenomena could eventually lead to the production of a switch that relies only on the geometric control of the contact line. Droplet fusion \nThe fusion, or merging, of two droplets is a simple function for DMF systems to perform. With no encapsulating liquid, two droplets will spontaneously merge when they come in contact. Surface tension driven systems can accomplish this by creating surface tension gradients in two droplets that are directed towards each other, which causes the droplets to converge ( Figure 3a ) 39 . Droplet fusion can be accomplished on contact line driven systems in a similar fashion by transporting droplets along two converging paths 22 . Fusion can also be performed along a single path with two different sized droplets ( Figure 3b ). This is accomplished by using a vibration frequency that modulates the contact line of only one droplet. One droplet will be transported along the path while the other remains static. When the moving droplet reaches the static droplet, the two will merge, and the resulting droplet can then be transported using a different vibration frequency 22 .
