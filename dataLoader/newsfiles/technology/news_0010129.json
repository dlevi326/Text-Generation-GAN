The firm has contributed $320m to the deal, and a portion of that will be used for constructing the new facility. \"SunEdison power plants put hundreds of people to work, create real and lasting benefits for local residents, and deliver clean energy to Utah.\" \nAccording to 20-year power purchase agreements for the project, its energy output will be forwarded to PacifiCorp (A-/A3), which is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. \nConstruction works for the now fully financed project is underway. \nExpected to be commissioned in mid-2016, the solar energy facility will be able to meet power demands of more than 36,000 homes. \nSunEdison has already placed its 50% share in the Four Brothers and Three Cedars projects on the call right projects list for TerraForm Power. \nSunEdison EMEA and Americas executive vice-president Paul Gaynor said: \"We are excited to expand our partnership with Dominion to a total of 685MW of solar in Utah. \n\"Our joint ventures with Dominion demonstrate the market appetite for SunEdison's high-quality, long-term contracted assets. \n\"SunEdison power plants put hundreds of people to work, create real and lasting benefits for local residents, and deliver clean energy to Utah homes at a competitive price.\" Follow Us:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T14:40:27.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
