Together, CSG and Media-Saturn Germany have enabled the retailer to extend its physical store experience, expand revenue sources and build on its solid brand to become a trusted digital provider. \nMedia-Saturn’s new JUKE service includes a comprehensive range of products with over 30 million songs, more than 15,000 movies and TV series, 1.5 million e-books, as well as 2,400 PC games and PC software applications, launched by using free apps or via the JUKE website. CSG Ascendon brings video and music together in one service, available anytime and anywhere with a single login across smartphone, tablet, PC/notebook, smart TV or set-top boxes. \nCSG’s digital service platform enables Media-Saturn to offer more robust, flexible services, based on customer interests. The platform enables JUKE to include multiple services including purchase (EST) and on-demand rental (TVOD) for TV programming and movies. CSG Ascendon integrates a powerful, smooth customer experience across all consumer devices including PC and Mac, iOS, Android Devices, Samsung TV, LG TV, Humax STB, and Chromecast. In addition, CSG manages the video content management system, entitlements, supply chain integration, customer care application, analytics and reporting. \n“Media-Saturn is focused on not only delivering a robust catalog of services, but also offering its customers a cutting-edge, personalized experience. This combination accelerates any digital content strategy,” said Kent Steffen, president of digital services at CSG International. “While many consumer brands are extending their core business to become digital service providers, we find that they are often challenged by their existing infrastructure. We are proud to help companies like Media-Saturn transform their systems and services through CSG Ascendon.” \nCSG Ascendon is a digital services platform that allows communications service providers (CSPs), content producers and retailers to launch, scale and monetize new digital services such as movies, music, games, home security and more.

Media Markt and Saturn, Germany’s and Europe’s number one consumer electronics retailers, are united under the auspices of Media-Saturn-Holding GmbH. The success of the two retail sales brands with currently 1,000 stores in 15 countries is based on a unique selection of low-priced brand-name products, expert advice, excellent service, a distinctive advertising presence and a decentralized organizational structure. Each store manager is a shareholder in their own store and is thus responsible for the product mix, pricing, personnel and marketing. Media Markt and Saturn are managed independently and compete with each other. Both retail brands are currently being expanded internationally into multichannel retailers. The Media-Saturn Group was joined in July 2011 by online retailer redcoon, which operates in eight European countries, and in July 2012 by Russian online retailer 003.ru.
