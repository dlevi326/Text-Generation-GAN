It may even be possible to take control of the devices in a way that they are used \" as a platform to conduct malicious operations beyond the device\" according to Tangible Security who discovered the vulnerability. \nThe affected devices in question are the following ones: Seagate Wireless Plus Mobile Storage Seagate Wireless Mobile Storage LaCie FUEL \nThe drives are affected by two additional vulnerabilities. The first attack is carried out if the default drive configuration is not modified. It allows attackers with (wireless) access to affected devices to download files from them without authentication. \nThe vulnerabilities exploits improperly protected resources on the device which can be accessed without authentication. \nThe third and final vulnerability provides attackers with the means to upload files to affected devices under a default configuration. \nThe three vulnerabilities give attackers full access to files stored on these wireless hard drives, often without the owner of the device knowing about them. \nSeagate has released a new firmware for all affected drives that patches these issues. End users and administrators who want to download these patches need to enter one or multiple serial numbers on Seagate's Download Finder website to display the downloads. \nThe easiest way to reveal the serial number of a Seagate hard drive is to use the company's Drive Detect software. \nNote: It is recommended to back up data on affected drives before upgrading the firmware. \nSeagate was informed about the vulnerabilities by Tangible Security on March 18, 2015 while the vulnerability itself dates back as early as October 2014. \nClosing Words \nThe vulnerabilities exploit rookie mistakes that should not happen, especially not by one of the largest storage manufacturers of the world. \nSeagate device owners should head over to the official site right away to download the latest firmware for their device to patch all three vulnerabilities.
