Visit booth 4005 and get familiar with Innodisk's \"Competitive Edge.\" \nStaying Competitive \nInnodisk's desire to provide absolute service was the driver behind the optional write protect feature specifically tailored for one of our customers for its unique use in the gaming industry. A jumper was used as a security insert that prevents copying, deleting, or writing new data to a thumb drive. This feature allowed the USB drive to be in read only mode when the jumper was removed. Technology continues to grow and develop needing products to transform and shape all aspects of the gaming industry. As pioneers and service and solution focused hardware technology innovators, Innodisk provides products to support current needs and looks toward the future as visionaries that maintain a competitive nature in the market. \nThe SATADOM(TM) \nInnodisk maintains their \"Competitive Edge\" and continues their market growth in the gaming industry with the SATADOM(TM). Innodisk pioneered the SATADOM(TM) because there was no other product on the market that could simplify a system's overall design better. Innodisk's SATADOM(TM) was designed with our patented Power Pin 7 or Pin 8 to simplify our customer's system design. Since this design will require no external power cable it is more robust and enhances the disk functions of various industrial and enterprise applications. Touting the highest capacity and fastest performance, it also comes in over seven mechanical sizings to fit anyone's application. \nIndustrial DRAM Products \nInnodisk continues to display the versatility and strength of their portfolio by presenting its unbuffered industrial memory products that include DDR4 modules. Innodisk DDR4 operates at 2133Mhz with capacities up to 16GB. DDR4 is 30% more power efficient with lower voltage requirements. To support the gaming industry's further need for industrial environments, Innodisk's DDR3 provides wide temperature products that allow -40 degrees C to +85 degrees C usage. Unbuffered DRAM is a necessity for most user applications and Innodisk delivers with their standard DDR3 and DDR4 series, coatings, and other specialized products. \nIndustrial Flash Products \nInnodisk doesn't just stop at highlighting SATADOM(TM) products. There is a rich portfolio of products on display. The strong line of Compact Flash products include; iCF1SE, iCF1ME and iCF9000.
