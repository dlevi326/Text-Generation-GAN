Nandre wanted to gift the tab to his sister and had kept it in a packed condition for two months before he opened the package. However, he found that the touch screen of the equipment was not functioning.\n\nSince March 2014, Nandre referred the defective tab to the company's authorized distributor for repairs but did not get any satisfactory response. He eventually moved the district consumer forum on September 29, 2014 alleging deficiency on part of the company in selling him a used and defective tab. The company contested his claim during the hearing and argued that the tab was repaired to Nandre's satisfaction but he refused to take it back.\n\nThe forum relied on documentary evidence like receipt of purchase of tab, correspondence between Nandre and the firm and oral submissions and observed that the company had failed to produce any evidence to support its claim that the tab had been repaired.\n\nIt held that the company has caused deficiency in service by selling a defective equipment to the complainant and hence was liable to refund the purchase amount with penalties for causing mental and physical agony.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T04:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:38:12.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
