Osterfeld will be part of the “App-solutely Enterprise” sessions at CTIA Super Mobility 2015 in Las Vegas September 9 – 11. \n“When it comes to Internet-connected devices, it’s things like smartphones, TVs and appliances that get all the attention,” Osterfeld said. “But the truth is, the real game-changers are coming from networks of devices in communication with other machines, not people. They're doing everything from fertilizing crops and running factories to directing traffic and trading stocks. The Internet of Things might be invisible, but it is rapidly becoming the critical component of the global economy,” he said. \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) discussion is featured during the CTIA’s App-solutely half-day sessions which focus on taking advantage of mobile and “smart” devices within the enterprise. Osterfeld, whose company specializes in big data analytics for mobile and IoT, will join executives from three other technology firms from various sectors of the industry. The panel is scheduled for 2:15 PM in the Lido Ballroom of the Sands Expo and Convention Center. \nWith more than 35,000 participants, CTIA’s Super Mobility is the largest wireless and mobile conference in the Americas. It will be held at the Sands Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, and runs September 9 - 11, 2015. Tickets and more information on the conference can be found on the CTIA Super Mobility 2015 website at http://www.ctiasupermobility2015.com . \nAbout Sysorex \nSysorex develops the systems and solutions that power the data-driven enterprise.
