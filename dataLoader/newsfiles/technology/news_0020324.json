Now, just as venture investing has begun to rise and a new VC fund has launched in Dallas, the stock market has turned south in a big way.\nLast week’s 1,000-point drop in the Dow prompted even wealthy investors to have second thoughts.\n“I was watching hard, thinking if this gets deeper, I’ll need to pull back,” said David Hunt, a Dallas oilman and frequent investor in tech firms.\nAfter the stock indexes rebounded a bit — they’ve regained almost half the value lost in that turbulent week in August — Hunt decided to stay the course and keep investing in startups, including the new Hangar Ventures fund in Dallas.\n“I can stomach swings just as long as they’re going back and forth, and not just one way,” Hunt said.\nHis comments say much about the challenge for venture operators. Wealthy families and institutional investors tie up their money for five years and longer, so in theory they shouldn’t be too concerned with daily swings. But investing remains an emotional business, even for the pros.\nWhen asset values fall 10 percent, it’s natural to tap the brakes. In addition, there are fears that Wall Street will be less receptive to initial public offerings, the most high-profile exit for VC-backed firms.\nPrivate sales and follow-up funding also may be delayed or reduced. Those attitudes ripple down to the youngest startups.\n“This volatility influences every stage of the [investment] ladder,” said Sam Hamadeh, CEO of PrivCo, a New York research firm that specializes in private companies. “The reality is this isn’t good for anyone. And it will affect the ability to raise money in Dallas.”\nThe timing of the stock swoon hurts because dozens of young companies are scheduled to go on “road shows” between Labor Day and Thanksgiving. Those meetings with analysts and investment firms are precursors to public offerings, and some already have been delayed, Hamadeh said.\nLifeline of cash Most startups keep needing outside money for hiring, office space and growth plans. So even if a public offering is years away, VC funds can’t rest.\n“The first thing they’re thinking about is raising the next round at a higher valuation,” Hamadeh said.\nDallas has been a laggard in venture funding since the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. Within a few years, total VC investments declined over 90 percent here. Local firms never got close to clawing back to the peak, according to the MoneyTree Report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association based on data from Thomson Reuters.\nTexas hasn’t performed any better despite pockets of strength in Austin. In the second quarter of 2015, Texas firms landed $237 million in venture funds, the lowest amount in nine of the 10 previous quarters, according to the MoneyTree report.\nIn contrast, venture funding nationwide has grown strongly since 2013, especially in California and New York. VC investments in the second quarter totaled $10.6 billion in California and $2.1 billion in New York, roughly triple the levels of two years earlier.\nLocal supporters believe Dallas is poised for a growth spurt in venture capital. The startup scene has added dozens of business accelerators, incubators and co-working spaces, and many new angel investors have emerged.\nIn the first half of 2015, Dallas firms attracted $95 million in venture investment. That’s the highest first-half result since 2001, according to MoneyTree.\nStartup investing The Hangar fund is led by Jason Story, a 29-year-old entrepreneur who cashed in two companies, and Jeff Williams, a 15-year veteran of the VC business. They are raising $50 million and have commitments for about half the money, they said last week.\nThe fund also closed deals with its first investors in August, Story said. The fund plans to invest in startups on Oct. 1, with an eye on Dallas and Texas companies.\nFor the last year, Story has talked up opportunities to invest in local startups. He’s met with wealthy individuals and family businesses, and urged them to invest beyond traditional areas.\n“In Dallas, being diversified often means being in commercial and residential real estate,” Story said.\nWall Street volatility can make private investments more attractive, even if they aren’t liquid. At least that’s the view of John Jaggers, a longtime leader at VC firm Sevin Rosen.\n“Wouldn’t I rather deploy my capital in a place that’s not subject to the vagaries of Russian and Chinese economics?” said Jaggers, who invested in the Hangar fund. “At the end of the day, the stock market that [Hangar] cares about is five years from now.”\nHunt has a similar take, and he’s been dealing with a sharp decline in oil prices.\n“Every time I write a check, I’m thinking it’s a five- to seven-year deal,” he said about backing tech firms. “I look at it as diversifying away from oil and gas.”\nThe question for Dallas startups is how many others see the same opportunity.\nOn Twitter:\n @mitchschnurman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mitchschnurman"], "published": "2015-09-01T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:02:59.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
