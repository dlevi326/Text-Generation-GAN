Credit: KU Leuven - Ludmila Carone \nThe quest for potentially habitable planets is often interpreted as the search for an Earth twin. And yet, some rocky planets outside our Solar System may in fact be more promising candidates for further research. Scientists from KU Leuven, Belgium, have run 165 climate simulations for exoplanets that permanently face their 'sun' with the same side. They discovered that two of the three possible climates are potentially habitable. \nMost exoplanets orbit relatively small and cool stars known as red dwarfs. Only exoplanets that orbit close to their star can be warm enough for liquid water. What is more, being close to their star also makes these potentially habitable planets relatively easy to detect and observe for research purposes. \nMany exoplanets that orbit closely to their stars always face that star with the same side. As a result, they have permanent day and night sides. And yet, the climate on these planets is not necessarily scorching hot on one side and freezing on the other. This is due to a very efficient 'air conditioning system' that keeps surface temperatures within the habitable range. \nDr. Ludmila Carone, Professor Rony Keppens, and Professor Leen Decin from KU Leuven, Belgium, have now examined the possible climates of these exoplanets in unprecedented detail. \"On the basis of 3D models, we examined exoplanets with different rotation periods and sizes,\" Ludmila Carone explains. \"We discovered that these rocky planets have three possible climates, two of which are potentially habitable.\" \nOn exoplanets with rotation periods under 12 days, an eastward wind jet known as superrotation forms in the upper layers of the atmosphere along the equator. This wind jet interferes with the atmospheric circulation on the planet, so that its day side becomes too hot to be habitable. A second possible wind system is characterised by two weaker westward wind jets at high latitudes. The third climate option combines weak superrotation with two high-latitude wind jets. These last two wind systems do not interfere with the 'air conditioning system', so that the planets remain potentially habitable. \nThe findings provide valuable input for future space missions. Specifically, KU Leuven researchers are currently involved in the preparation of the James Webb Space Telescope mission (2018) - the Hubble successor - as well as the planet-finder mission PLATO (2024). Not only will the study help identify the most promising candidates for further research in our solar vicinity, it will also help avoid the premature discarding of potentially habitable planets that are worth investigating despite their 'un-Earth-like' appearance. Kepler marks five years in space March 7, 2014 \n(Phys.org) —Five years ago today, on March 6, 2009, NASA's Kepler Space Telescope rocketed into the night skies above Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida to find planets around other stars, called exoplanets, in ... Planets outside our solar system more hospitable to life than thought January 15, 2015 \nA study by astrophysicists at the University of Toronto suggests that exoplanets - planets outside our solar system - are more likely to have liquid water and be more habitable than we thought. Some habitable exoplanets could experience wildly unpredictable climates March 12, 2015 \nAs telescopes of ever-greater power scan the cosmos looking for life, knowing where to look—and where not to waste time looking—will be of great value. Kepler's six years in science (and counting) May 13, 2015 \nNASA's Kepler spacecraft began hunting for planets outside our solar system on May 12, 2009. From the trove of data collected, we have learned that planets are common, that most sun-like stars have at least one planet and ... Seeking Earth-like planets with the James Webb Space Telescope July 8, 2015 \nAlmost 2000 exoplanets have been discovered to date, ranging from rocky Earth-like planets to hot-Jupiters, and orbiting every type of star. But how many of these distant worlds are habitable? Today's technology means that ... ARIEL mission to reveal 'Brave New Worlds' among exoplanets July 16, 2015 \nAn ambitious European mission is being planned to answer fundamental questions about how planetary systems form and evolve. ARIEL will investigate the atmospheres of several hundred planets orbiting distant stars. It is one ... Recommended for you Shocks in a distant gamma-ray burst September 14, 2015 \nGamma ray bursts (GRBs)—flashes of high-energy light occur about once a day, randomly, from around the sky—are the brightest events in the known universe. While a burst is underway, it is many millions of times brighter ... Astronomers peer into the 'amniotic sac' of a planet-hosting star September 13, 2015 \nAstronomers have successfully peered through the 'amniotic sac' of a star that is still forming to observe the innermost region of a burgeoning solar system for the first time. Mysterious, massive, magnetic stars September 11, 2015 \nA Canadian PhD student has discovered a unique object – two massive stars with magnetic fields in a binary system. Matt Shultz of Queen's University, Ontario, Canada found the system – Epsilon Lupi – and will publish ... New Pluto images from NASA's New Horizons September 11, 2015 \nNew close-up images of Pluto from NASA's New Horizons spacecraft reveal a bewildering variety of surface features that have scientists reeling because of their range and complexity. Astronomers discover how lowly dwarf galaxy becomes star-forming powerhouse September 9, 2015 \nA nearby dwarf galaxy poses an intriguing mystery: How is it able to form brilliant star clusters without the dusty, gas-rich environments found in larger galaxies? The answer, astronomers believe, lies in densely packed ... Ceres' bright spots seen in striking new detail September 9, 2015 \nThe brightest spots on the dwarf planet Ceres gleam with mystery in new views delivered by NASA's Dawn spacecraft.
