Beginning Oct. 1, Hulu subscribers will get films from Lionsgate, MGM and Paramount, the companies announced late Sunday. That includes \"Hunger Games: Catching Fire,\" \"Wolf of Wall Street,\" as well as new titles, library films and Epix original programming. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. It's a \"huge expansion\" for Hulu's premium programming, Senior Vice President Craig Erwich said in a printed statement. Netflix plans to improve its lineup through original films and licensing arrangements with movie studios, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos wrote in a blog post. He said that many of the movies Netflix received through its Epix agreement also were widely available through other subscription platforms. \"We know some of you will be disappointed by the expiration of the Epix movies,\" Sarandos wrote. \"Our goal is to provide great movies and TV series for all tastes, that are only available on Netflix. We're confident you'll enjoy our ever-improving catalogue.\" Shares of Netflix Inc., based in Los Gatos, California, fell nearly 2 percent, or $2.31, to $115.32 Monday morning, while broader indexes slumped around 1 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T06:53:53.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
