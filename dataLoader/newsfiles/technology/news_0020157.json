When users visit the search engine's homepage, an animation shows the old logo being gradually erased, and a transformed emblem being drawn with crayons.\nAlthough the lettering remains in blue, red, yellow and green as before, the classic serif typeface has been abandoned in favour of a more modern sans-serif alternative.\nOne of the biggest changes will be for mobile users - who will be accustomed to seeing a small, blue \"G\" on their screens.\nNow, it will be multi-coloured, in a move which designers believe will create consistency across platforms.\nPlay video \"Major Reboot For Google\" Video: Major Reboot For Google In an official blog post, Google said it probably won't be the last time it changes its look - and the new design will be gradually rolled out across all its products in the near future.\n\"We think weâ€™ve taken the best of Google (simple, uncluttered, colourful, friendly), and recast it not just for the Google of today, but for the Google of the future,\" the company wrote.\nThe logo refresh follows a major shake-up which will see Google become part of a new parent company called Alphabet. \nIt will house Google's main businesses, including YouTube, its search engine unit, and mapping software.\nNewer entities will be run separately - and Google is expected to be \"slimmed down\" as part of the surprise reorganisation.\nAs you would expect, Google's new logo has polarised opinion on Twitter.\nSome believe the rebrand was long overdue, as the same font has been used in Google's branding since 1999.\nHowever, others have described the latest logo as \"unfriendly, uninspired and unapproachable\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:11:34.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
