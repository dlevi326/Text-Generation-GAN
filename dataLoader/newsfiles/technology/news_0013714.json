One tablet of Daraprim used to cost $13.50; now, after its acquisition by Turing, it costs $750 per tablet.\nThis could have significant effects on patients’ ability to afford treatment, though Turing’s CEO Martin Shkreli has said that Daraprim will be free for anyone who can’t afford it. According to the Times, some hospitals may not be able to afford to keep the drug in stock, which could keep patients from getting treatment in a timely manner.\nThe Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) wrote a letter to Turing earlier this month, asking them to reconsider the price increase.", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/a-huge-overnight-increase-in-a-drugs-price-raises-protests.html", "http://www.hivma.org/uploadedFiles/HIVMA/HomePageContent/PyrimethamineLetterFINAL.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-22T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:21:09.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
