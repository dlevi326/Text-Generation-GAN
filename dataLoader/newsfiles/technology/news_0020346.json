It takes usually more than 10 weeks to complete manufacturing process. However, 3D super-NAND takes only 5 days to complete advanced 3D non-volatile memory cells thanks to parallel manufacturing,” said Dr. Yohwan Koh, former senior vice president and head of NAND business at SK hynix, and recently joined advisor at BeSang Inc.\nCompared to 48-layer 3D NAND, BeSang expects its 1-layer 3D super-NAND to have 5 to 10 times better ‘Cost-per-Bit.’ BeSang plans to bring 3D super-NAND to the market along with industry partners in 2016.\nAbout BeSang Inc.\nBeSang is a pioneer in the design, development, and delivery of unsurpassed three-dimensional (3D) IC solutions, providing unmatched process and design technologies for TRUE 3DTM IC as well as technology licenses to customers. BeSang provides high-value intellectual properties related to its proprietary TRUE 3DTM ICs. The fabless semiconductor company is headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon, USA.
