New Horizons' best shots of Pluto are arriving Updated 1452 GMT (2152 HKT) September 11, 2015 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon This picture is a synthesis of new high-resolution images downlinked from New Horizons. The broad icy plains have been nicknamed Sputnik Planum. This image is from a perspective above Pluto's equatorial area. Astronomers began downlinking a data dump from the space craft over Labor Day weekend, September 5 to 7. Hide Caption 1 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon Scientists say that what looks like mountains could be huge blocks of frozen water suspended in frozen nitrogen. On the new photos, taken on July 14 and released on September 10, a pixel is 400 meters (440 yards). New Horizons' closest pass by Pluto took it about 50,000 miles from the surface. Hide Caption 2 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon Pluto's landscape has lots of variety -- plains, mountains, craters, and what looks like they might be dunes. The smallest details on the photos are about 0.5 miles wide. The area with the craters is ancient, scientist say. The smooth frozen planes are relatively young. Hide Caption 3 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon Just before its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft snapped this photo of Charon, Pluto's largest moon. The photo was shot at a distance of 290,000 miles away. Charon's north pole region is markedly dark. This photo was released on September 10. Hide Caption 4 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon This new image of Pluto is stunning planetary scientists. It shows the small world's atmosphere, backlit by the sun. NASA says the image reveals layers of haze that are several times higher than predicted. The photo was taken by the New Horizons spacecraft seven hours after its closest approach to Pluto on Tuesday, July 14. New Horizons was about 1.25 million miles away from Pluto at the time. Hide Caption 5 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon Images taken of Pluto's heart-shaped feature, informally named \"Tombaugh Regio,\" reveal a \"vast, craterless plain that appears to be no more than 100 million years old,\" NASA said on Friday, July 17. The frozen region \"is possibly still being shaped by geologic processes.\" NASA's New Horizons spacecraft was launched in 2006 and traveled 3 billion miles to the dwarf planet. Hide Caption 6 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon Close-up images of a region near Pluto's equator revealed a giant surprise: a range of youthful mountains. NASA released the image on Wednesday, July 15. Hide Caption 7 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon Remarkable new details of Pluto's largest moon, Charon, are revealed in this image released on July 15. Hide Caption 8 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon The latest spectra analysis from New Horizons' Ralph instrument was released on July 15. It reveals an abundance of methane ice, but with striking differences from place to place across the frozen surface of Pluto. Hide Caption 9 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon NASA team members and guests count down to the spacecraft's approach to Pluto on Tuesday, July 14. Hide Caption 10 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon This image of Pluto was captured by New Horizons on Monday, July 13, about 16 hours before the moment of closest approach. The spacecraft was 476,000 miles from Pluto's surface. Hide Caption 11 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon The colors in this image of Pluto and Charon are exaggerated to make it easy to see their different features. (These are not the actual colors of Pluto and Charon, and the two bodies aren't really that close together in space.) This image was created on July 13, one day before New Horizons was to make its closest approach to Pluto. Hide Caption 12 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon This image of Pluto was captured by New Horizons on Sunday, July 12. The spacecraft was 1.6 million miles from Pluto at the time. Hide Caption 13 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon New Horizons snapped this photo of Charon on July 12. It reveals a system of chasms larger than the Grand Canyon. The spacecraft was 1.6 million miles away when the image was taken. Hide Caption 14 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon New Horizons was about 3.7 million miles from Pluto and Charon when it took this image on Wednesday, July 8. Hide Caption 15 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon Do you see a heart on Pluto? This image was taken on Tuesday, July 7, by New Horizons when it was about 5 million miles from the planet. Look to the lower right, and you'll see a large bright area -- about 1,200 miles across -- that resembles a heart. Hide Caption 16 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon New Horizons took six black-and-white photos of Pluto and Charon between June 23 and 29. The images were combined with color data from another instrument on the space probe to create the images above. The spacecraft was 15 million miles away when it started the sequence and 11 million miles when the last photo was taken. Hide Caption 17 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon Pluto is shown here along with Charon in images taken on June 25 and 27. The image on the right shows a series of evenly spaced dark spots near Pluto's equator. Scientists hope to solve the puzzle as New Horizons gets closer to Pluto. Hide Caption 18 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon New Horizons took a series of 13 images of Charon circling Pluto over the span of 6Â½ days in April. As the images were being taken, the spacecraft moved from about 69 million miles from Pluto to 64 million miles. Hide Caption 19 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon Look carefully at the images above: They mark the first time New Horizons has photographed Pluto's smallest and faintest moons, Kerberos and Styx. The images were taken from April 25 to May 1. Hide Caption 20 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon New Horizons used its color imager to capture this image of Pluto and Charon on April 9. This was the first color image taken by a spacecraft approaching Pluto and Charon, according to NASA. The spacecraft was about 71 million miles away from Pluto when the photo was taken. Hide Caption 21 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon In August, New Horizons crossed the orbit of Neptune, the last planet it would pass on its journey to Pluto. New Horizons took this photo of Neptune and its large moon Triton when it was about 2.45 billion miles from the planet -- more than 26 times the distance between the Earth and our sun. Hide Caption 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon New Horizons captured this image of Jupiter and its volcanic moon Io in early 2007. Hide Caption 23 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon On its way to Pluto, New Horizons snapped these photos of Jupiter's four large \"Galilean\" moons. From left is Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Hide Caption 24 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon A white arrow points to Pluto in this photo taken in September 2006 from New Horizons. The spacecraft was still about 2.6 billion miles from Pluto. Hide Caption 25 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon Pluto was discovered in 1930 but was only a speck of light in the best telescopes on Earth until February 2010, when NASA released this photo. It was created by combining several images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope -- each only a few pixels wide -- through a technique called dithering. NASA says it took four years and 20 computers operating continuously to create the image. Hide Caption 26 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon This was one of the best views we had of Pluto and its moon Charon before the New Horizons mission. The image was taken by the European Space Agency's Faint Object Camera on the Hubble Space Telescope on February 21, 1994. Hide Caption 27 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon A Hubble Space Telescope image of Pluto and its moons. Charon is the largest moon close to Pluto. The other four bright dots are smaller moons discovered in 2005, 2011 and 2012: Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx. Hide Caption 28 of 29 29 photos: Pluto on the horizon New Horizons launched from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on January 19, 2006. The probe, about the size of a piano, weighed nearly 1,054 pounds at launch. It has seven instruments on board to take images and sample Pluto's atmosphere. After it completes its five-month study of Pluto, the spacecraft will keep going deeper into the Kuiper Belt.
