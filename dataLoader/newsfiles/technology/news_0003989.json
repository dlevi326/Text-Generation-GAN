Everything taken under it posted online. \n\nIt has been extensively used in the United States, Canada and many European countries, its applications in India have been limited so far. \n\nGoogle has launched Street View in some of the tourist sites like Taj Mahal, Red Fort, Qutub Minar, Varanasi river bank, Nalanda University, Mysore Palace, Thanjavur temple Chinnaswamy stadium besides others in partnership with the Archaeological Society of India. \n\nIndian security establishment is wary of allowing such image-capturing given that planning for the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai is believed to have involved photographic reconnaissance of targets by Pakistani-American David Coleman Headley. \n\nGoogle Street View is a technology featured in Google Maps and Google Earth that provides panoramic views from positions along many streets in the world. \n\nIt was launched in 2007 in several cities in the United States, and has since expanded to include cities and rural areas worldwide. Streets with Street View imagery available are shown as blue lines on Google Maps. \n\nGoogle Street View displays panoramas of stitched images. Most photography is done by car, but some is done by trekker, tricycle, walking, boat, snowmobile, camel, and underwater apparatus. \n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi will be visiting Google headquarters during his tour to the US beginning tomorrow.
