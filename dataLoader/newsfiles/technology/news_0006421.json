(AFP) Sept 21, 2015 - Burkina Faso's interim president Michel Kafando voiced reservations Monday about a regional proposal to end the crisis sparked by last week's military coup in the west African country.\n\"I have serious reservations about this draft agreement\" which leaves \"deep-rooted problems\" without solutions, he said in an interview with RFI radio. \nKafando said he was \"not a part of the negotiations\" mediated by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) that came up with the plan. \nBurkina was plunged into turmoil on Wednesday when soldiers from the powerful presidential guard regiment loyal to ex-leader Blaise Compaore, who was ousted last year, detained Kafando and prime minister Isaac Zida, himself a former deputy commander of the unit. \nThe RSP, an elite unit of 1,300 men, officially declared a coup the following day and installed General Gilbert Diendere, a close ally of Compaore, as the country's new leader. \nFollowing the coup, Senegal's President Macky Sall, the rotating head of ECOWAS, undertook three days of mediation in a Ouagadougou hotel and on Sunday drafted a 12-point plan to end the crisis. \nThe deal provides for presidential and parliamentary elections to be held by November 22 at the latest, and, crucially, would allow for pro-Compaore candidates to take part after they complained about being excluded from elections planned for October. \nThe regional body also wants Diendere's regime \"to restore the transitional institutions and president Kafando\". \nBut civil society activists who played a major role in the uprising that toppled Compaore have condemned the proposals, with the main \"Balai Citoyen\" (Civic Broom) group branding the deal \"shameful\". \nKafando was also sceptical that any solution to the crisis would be achieved during an ECOWAS summit in Abuja on Tuesday. \n\"It would be difficult anyway given everything that has been proposed,\" he said, adding that he had \"not been invited to this summit.\" \nKafando said he remained in his usual residence but \"guarded by the presidential security\" unit who were behind the coup. \nHe added he was visited by two ECOWAS mediators on Saturday but has not been contacted since then and only received a copy of the peace plan on Monday morning. \nKafando was not asked about the movements of loyalist troops on Monday from the provinces toward Ouagadougou and whose leaders had urged the coup leaders to \"lay down their arms\". \n\"Let me thank the Burkinabe people, and especially the young people, for their patriotism,\" he said. \"They knew to say no to the coup carried out against the democracy of Burkina.\" \nGroups of youths on Monday began putting up barricades and burning tyres in the outlying Ouagadougou districts of Zogona and Tampouy, shouting \"Down with ECOWAS!\" and slogans hostile to the presidential guard and its commander. \nBurkina Faso's army chiefs and French President Francois Hollande on Monday ordered coup leaders to lay down their arms as troops headed from the provinces towards the capital Ouagadougou. \nThe stark warnings came as anger grew over a west African-mediated peace deal to end the latest crisis in the landlocked former French colony, which was triggered by last week's military coup in the west African country. \n\"All the national armed forces are converging on Ouagadougou with the sole aim of disarming the presidential guard (RSP) without any bloodshed,\" an army statement said. \n\"We ask them to lay down their arms,\" it said, advising members of the powerful presidential guard behind the coup to go to the Sangoule Lamizana military barracks west of the capital, saying they and their families would remain safe. \nThe French president also weighed in, urging the coup leaders to disarm or face the consequences. \nIn a statement, he demanded that \"all those involved in the putsch to immediately lay down their arms and hand over power to the legitimate authorities -- or face the consequences.\" \nAnd he warned that France, which still wields significant influence in its former African colonies, could also \"apply sanctions to those opposing the holding of regular elections.\" \nA similar call was also issued by the presidents of Niger and Chad, who called on the renegade soldiers to \"return to the barracks\" and hand back power to the transition administration they toppled on September 17. \nA military source said soldiers were headed for Ouagadougou from Bobo Dioulasso, the country's second city which lies in the west, from Dedougou, Kaya and Fada N'Gourma in the east, and from Ouahigouya in the north. \nBurkina was plunged into turmoil on Wednesday when soldiers from the powerful presidential guard regiment loyal to ex-leader Blaise Compaore detained interim president Michel Kafando and prime minister Isaac Zida, himself a former deputy commander of the unit. \nThe RSP, an elite unit of 1,300 men, officially declared a coup the following day and installed General Gilbert Diendere, a close Compaore ally, as the country's new leader. \nAt least 10 people were killed and more than 100 injured in protests sparked by the coup, which came just weeks before what would have been the first elections since Compaore was ousted in a popular revolt last October after trying to extend his 27-year grip on power. \n- 'Serious reservations' - \nFollowing the coup, Senegal's President Macky Sall, the rotating head of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), undertook three days of mediation and on Sunday came up with a 12-point plan to end the crisis. \nThe ECOWAS deal provides for presidential and parliamentary elections to be held by November 22 at the latest, and, crucially, would allow for pro-Compaore candidates to take part after they complained about being excluded from October's vote. \nThe regional body also wants Diendere and his fellow putschists \"to restore the transitional institutions and President Kafando,\" who was freed by the coup soldiers on Friday. But the prime minister is still under house arrest. \nECOWAS mediators said the fate of the RSP should be decided by a future Burkinabe leader. \nAnd they have also proposed an amnesty for those behind the coup in a suggestion which has sparked widespread anger on the streets. \nDiendere on Monday said he would honour the ECOWAS proposal and hand over power. \nBut Kafando told France's RFI radio he had \"serious reservations\" about the ECOWAS peace deal and was sceptical that any solution to the crisis would be achieved during the Abuja summit on Tuesday. \nHe said he had not been invited to attend. \n- 'Shameful' amnesty proposal - \nIn Ouagadougou, residents were highly critical of the ECOWAS proposal and furious at the suggestion of amnesty for the presidential guards. \n\"We don't trust ECOWAS any more. We want to get out there and take our destiny in our hands,\" said Adama Traore, an office worker in his 30s. \n\"The bodies are not even buried and (they want) an amnesty. We shall barricade everything,\" he said. \nCivil society activists who played a major role in the uprising that toppled Compaore have also condemned the ECOWAS proposals, with the main \"Balai Citoyen\" (Civic Broom) group branding the deal \"shameful\". \n\"Down with ECOWAS!\" shouted a group of angry youths as they milled around barricades at the entrance to the western suburb of Tampouy. \"Down with Diendere!\" \n\"We cannot accept the amnesty. There are comrades who have fallen and ECOWAS is telling us to extend an manesty,\" cried Mady Ouedraogo, a spokesman for Balai Citoyen. \nAlthough the streets of the capital were filled with traffic and many shops were open on Monday, banks, petrol stations, supermarkets and government offices remained closed, and Internet access was barely available and several mobile phone networks were not working. \n\"They're trying to prevent people from communicating,\" said Issouf Ouedraogo, 25. \nMany of last year's demonstrations against Compaore were organised through social media. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:43:52.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
