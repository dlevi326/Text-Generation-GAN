Now, the Duchess   is set to carry out an engagement to the Anna Freud Centre in London this month. \n“The Duchess to visit the Anna Freud Centre @afcevents on 17 Sept to see their work in children’s mental health care,” the Kensington Palace announced on Friday on Twitter.

He and his brother, Prince Harry, are known to be interested in this field. \n“The Duchess has being doing work in children’s mental health for quite a while now,” a royal source told People in August. \n“Mental well-being is an area which both the Duke and Duchess and Prince Harry are interested in. It is an area which the Duke is starting to explore as to whether he can help in any way in that sector, while recognizing that there are an awful lot of people doing a lot of great work around it already. So it is quite exploratory at the moment,” the source also told the publication. \nSince giving birth to her and the Duke’s second child, Princess Charlotte, in May, the Duchess has kept a low profile as she has been focusing on raising their two young children. \nOne of her rare recent outings was at the America’s Cup World Series in Portsmouth in July, where she talked about her passion for sailing with the children present at the event. \nApart from these causes, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are set to tour overseas in 2016, but their two adorable children are unlikely to join them. Until then, more royal engagements are likely to be confirmed by the Palace.
