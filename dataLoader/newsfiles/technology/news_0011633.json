Earlier this year, H-P sued former Autonomy CEO Michael Lynch and former Chief Financial Officer Sushovan Hussain for $5.1 billion.\nThe documents include a KPMG LLP analysis of the deal that was commissioned by H-P. The analysis stated that Autonomy didn't furnish half of the information KPMG sought including details on Autonomy's revenue recognition, expenses and management forecasts.\nMr. Apotheker didn't read that document, according to the Proskauer report. If he had, H-P's chief would have had a clearer idea what he was getting into, Andy Kanter, Autonomy's former chief operations officer, said in an interview.\n\"H-P had no knowledge of Lynch and Hussain's contrived sales to value-added resellers and other improper transactions and accounting practices, all of which artificially inflated Autonomy's reported revenues, misrepresented its rate of organic growth and overstated its gross and net profits,\" H-P said in an emailed statement on Friday.\nMr. Lynch, via a spokesman for him and Mr. Hussain, on Friday said: \"HP clings to its false and baseless allegations, even as their own documents, which for years they have tried to bury, undermine their claims of ignorance.\"\nIn the weeks after the deal, the new documents show, Mr. Lane emailed Mr. Apotheker to say he was concerned that Autonomy was a so-called roll-up, a company whose growth was dependent on acquisitions rather than organic growth. \"I'm still haunted by Autonomy itself,\" he wrote. \"I don't think it's the panacea we think it is. I don't think the board thought that [at least I don't remember that discussion] this was largely a roll-up when we contemplated the price.\"\nA few weeks later, H-P fired Mr. Apotheker. Mr. Lane stepped down as board chairman in 2013. He remains an H-P director.\nAutonomy's Mr. Kanter blamed H-P's issues on a strategic shift away from software within the company rather than any problems with Autonomy itself. \"When we set out to do this transaction, we did this with a [H-P] CEO who was extremely software-focused,\" Mr. Kanter said in the interview. \"We could have never envisioned that, weeks after the deal, that vision could have been torn up.\"\nWrite to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com\n 25, 2015 17:25 ET (21:25 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T11:48:26.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
