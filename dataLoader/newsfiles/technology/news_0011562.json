However, the list of these devices is yet to surface. \nAccording to The Korea Herald , that quotes officials at Samsung, the contactless payment system will be rolled out gradually to multiple Samsung budget smartphones. Currently, owners of the Samsung Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge and Galaxy S6 Edge Plus can use the mobile payment system. \nSamsung Pay is aimed at competing with contactless mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Android Pay. Samsung Pay is slated to be released officially in the US on 28 September in association with major financial institutions such as Bank of America and Chase, and in collaboration with credit card companies such as Visa, Discover, MasterCard and American Express. \nSamsung has hinted that Samsung Pay will be rolled out to the UK, Spain and China. Debit and credit cards issued by banks partnering with Samsung can be synchronised with users' smartphones to make cashless payments \nApple Pay vs Samsung Pay \nThe major difference between the mobile payment systems of Apple and Samsung is while Apple Pay is designed to work on card machines with contactless card reader, Samsung Pay also works with magnetic stripe readers in addition to synchronising with contactless card readers. Samsung Pay uses Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) technology that enables retailers to use their existing hardware without upgrading to receive payments from customers.
