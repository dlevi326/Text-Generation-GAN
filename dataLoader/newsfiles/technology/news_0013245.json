By the end of the third quarter, AzDOT executed another 20 retrofit upgrades based on the quality and performance of the trial project on several lessons learned: Cost. Savings would result in an excess of $2,000,000 over the sign replacement original plan on the first phase alone. Sign performance. Notably brighter than existing signs Support. Provided new sign warranty. Parts availability Engineering expertise. On site diagnostic support and adaptation to AzDOT hot climate applications Energy efficiency. Up to 80% more energy efficient than the signs updated. Thousands of dollars in electrical use savings per year Weight reduction. Weight reduced by over 300lb. no structural replacements / changes needed \nEntering 2015, the commitment was made to replace the other 23 signs eligible for a retrofit upgrade in the Phoenix metro area. The rural retrofit replacement signs to begin in October. \nAll told, of the over 100 signs qualifying for replacement will a result in an estimated savings of over $5,000,000, depending on the type of replacement and structural elements involved. \nSESA can provide a brief rundown on how states and municipalities have upgraded their DMS at substantial savings. With the ability to upgrade over 21 different models and growing, let SESA provide an on-site survey at no obligation. \nA site survey will benefit your agency solely by having all the options available at your discretion for both immediate and future considerations.
