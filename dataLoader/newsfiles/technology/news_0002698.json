The accessory provides a new input device for the newly announced iPad Pro. (Photo: Stephen Lam, Getty Images)\n11 CONNECT 62 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Did Apple really just try to sell us a pencil? Yes, Apple really did.\nAfter weeks of teasing and taunting from Siri, we were prepared, thumbs at the ready, to pick up whatever these tech gurus were going to put down.\nA new iPad? Sure! An updated iPhone? Duh, yes. But a new pencil-like stylus? Color us surprised.\nThis was just one of the \"curveballs\" we didn't see coming from Apple, which brought some wow and some meh to our afternoon.\nHere are a few more times we stopped for a second to say, \"what the phone?\"\nApps and straps for the wrist\nIt's been just a few months since the launch of the Apple Watch, so naturally it was time for an upgrade. Cue the lights because ... it's getting more apps and a few designer straps, including a leather one from Hermes.\nThe #AppleWatch has new gold and rose gold aluminum Sport models, and a leather band #Hermes collection ðŸ’° https://t.co/8QZLXkaKtW\nâ€” Mashable Tech (@mashabletech) September 9, 2015 Holy super-sized iPad, Batman!\nApple's sage advice of the day: size matters, at least when it comes to iPads . We have small one, we have the original and now we've got one in super-size! The iPad Pro boasts a longer battery life, a bigger screen and well, some possibilities. Ed Baig, USA TODAY's tech expert, calls it \"potentially the first large tablet that matters.\" Why? Well, it could maybe be a laptop-slayer. More here . (Others, you can gather, were less impressed.)\nThe new iPad pro be like.. #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/6ZVOPIKWzK\nâ€” purplemiami (@purplemiami) September 9, 2015 All pencil, hold the lead\nA pencil ? Wait, is that actually a stylus in disguise? OK, kind of cool, especially for the artist in the fam. The tool also links to the Mail app through a markup feature â€”just imagine those doodles. Where's the Apple Eraser though?\nHate to brag, but i am the first person to get my hands on the new #Apple #Pencil pic.twitter.com/LfaekHlfWh\nâ€” Daddy (@LifeisSavage) September 9, 2015 Speaking of gadgets, Apple TV is worth talking about\nAnd you can talk about it with Siri, because the new device has the robotic helper built into the remote . It also has a touch surface that lets you control the screen with just a swipe of a finger. Still want a little more? It also comes with a tricked-out gyroscope and accelerometer so you can get your game on, a' la Wii.\nThat Apple TV remote can be used like a Wii. That's going to hurt Nintendo. pic.twitter.com/pZTITiVebh\nâ€” it me (@ow) September 9, 2015 Maybe not such a great idea to Photoshop a woman's smile\nThe best Photoshop example Apple could think of apparently was digitally manipulating a woman to smile more. Viewers took note, and were not pleased . The event was definitely dominated by mostly white male executives. But! Apple broke with tradition, and featured three women on stage .\nThe woman in question (Photo: Apple)\niPhone 6S and 6S Plus ... the big moment we all were waiting for\nWhat can you say? At least it comes in rose gold. There are some new tricks: A new camera, faster hardware and even a somewhat-promising app called 3D Touch, a feature that's built for swiping. Tech guru Jefferson Graham was left feeling like McKayla Maroney here â€” he was not impressed . But Ed Baig reminds us just how much of our attention Apple really captures . (Hint: basically all of it.)\nWhole bunch of 3D-enabled Quick Actions on the iPhone 6s Plus. #AppleEvent https://t.co/IfNf5APxyS\nâ€” Lance Ulanoff (@LanceUlanoff) September 9, 2015 Oh yeah, OneRepublic was there\nWere you hoping for Taylor Swift ? Well, you got OneRepublic. Yep.\nNo @taylorswift13 , but we did get @OneRepublic . #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/fFH3k94g6c\nâ€” Lance Ulanoff (@LanceUlanoff) September 9, 2015 11 CONNECT 62 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1EW0EWS TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://t.co/6ZVOPIKWzK", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/purplemiami/status/641684006400978944", "https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/641689498108084224", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hermes?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/taylorswift13", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EW0EWS&text=So%2C%20it%27s%20pink%3F%20The%20most%20%27what%20the%20phone%27%20moments%20from%20Apple%27s%20big%20event&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EW0EWS&mini=true", "http://t.co/LfaekHlfWh", "https://t.co/IfNf5APxyS", "https://twitter.com/LifeisSavage/status/641672259887828996", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pencil?src=hash", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f8a8a933ffd2623f98eecef2f87dd31dd502092f/c=67-0-703-478&r=x383&c=540x380/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774158716678235-rubyred.png", "https://twitter.com/OneRepublic", "http://t.co/fFH3k94g6c", "https://twitter.com/mashabletech/status/641674395807784960", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774158716678235-rubyred.png", "https://twitter.com/ow/status/641676434159837184", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e05e55f7a223acd82195a722babe84231d1111d5/c=264-0-4394-3105&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774030725321125-Applevent-029.JPG", "https://t.co/8QZLXkaKtW", "https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/641710145832120321", "http://usat.ly/1EW0EWS", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleWatch?src=hash", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774030725321125-Applevent-029.JPG", "http://t.co/pZTITiVebh"], "published": "2015-09-10T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:54:39.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
