Supermoon plus eclipse equals rare sky show Sunday night 1 / 1 Back to Gallery CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) â€” Get ready for a rare double feature this weekend, starring our very own moon.\nA total lunar eclipse will share the stage with a so-called supermoon Sunday night or early Monday, depending where you are. That combination hasn't been seen since 1982 and won't happen again until 2033.\nWhen a full or new moon makes its closest approach to Earth, that's a supermoon. Although still 222,000 miles away, this full moon will look bigger and brighter than usual.\nThe full eclipse of the moon will last more than an hour and be visible, weather permitting, from North and South America, Europe, Africa and western Asia.\nShowtime on the U.S. East Coast is 10:11 p.m.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/51/8677956/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/51/8677956/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-23T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:47:11.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
