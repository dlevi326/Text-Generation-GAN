As part of its commitment to educate and encourage more students to consider STEM-related careers, Randstad US has partnered with Nepris to virtually connect STEM professionals and other experts with K-12 classrooms throughout the United States . Through a dedicated portal on the Nepris website, Randstad's network of clients and talent have the opportunity to register as subject matter experts and volunteer to present interactive, cloud-based sessions with students on their areas of expertise. \nIn addition to providing a platform for industry professionals to serve as virtual career experts, Randstad's pilot program will sponsor 50 Atlanta and Philadelphia -area teachers by offering complimentary access to the platform during the 2015-2016 school year. Randstad North America Chief Marketing Officer Kristin Kelley explains how the Nepris partnership allows Randstad to directly impact the future workforce by contributing to the nationwide effort of closing the STEM skills gap: \n\"As a leading human resources provider, Randstad is acutely aware of the talent shortage in high-growth fields such as engineering, information technology, healthcare, life sciences and some areas of finance and accounting. This partnership aligns with our long-term goal of bolstering America's STEM talent pipeline by integrating our networks' real-world xpertise with students' STEM-based curriculum. We're excited to introduce our experts to classrooms and to provide invaluable learning opportunities uninhibited by barriers of distance, time or cost of field trips,\" said Kelley. \nOver the past 10 years, growth in STEM careers has been three times greater than that of non-STEM careers, and constitutes 80 percent of the fastest growing occupations in the U.S. The Nepris partnership showcases Randstad's commitment to corporate social responsibility by providing educational opportunities to address a critical need in an ongoing effort to shape the world of work. \nAs a global industry leader, Randstad plays a key role in contributing to the simultaneous promotion of all interests, social and economic growth, and the general well-being of societies around the world.
