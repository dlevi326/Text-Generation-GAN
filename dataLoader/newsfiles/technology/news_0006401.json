They all shed symbols of worldly materialism, a state known as \"ihram\". Women forgo makeup and perfume for loose fitted clothing and a head-covering while men wear seamless terry cloth white garments meant to symbolise the equality of human beings before God, regardless of wealth, race or status.\nAll able-bodied Muslims are required in Islam to perform the hajj once in a lifetime.\nPilgrims begin the hajj in Mecca, before heading to the nearby tent city of Mina.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:18:33.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
