(Nasdaq: CDTI ) (\"CDTi\" or \"the Company\"), a leader in advanced emission control technology, will participate at the 6 th Annual Global Congress of Catalysis 2015 (GCC-2015) being held September 24 th to 26 th in Xi'an, China. CDTi's Chief Technology Officer, Dr. Steve Golden, has been invited to give a keynote speech titled \"Development of Spinel™ Mixed Metal Oxides for Zero-Precious Metal and Ultra-Low Precious Metal Next-Generation TWC.\" Dr. Golden will present CDTi's new Spinel technology and the potential to use Spinel in tandem with low platinum group metal (PGM) levels to achieve very low emissions. Also, he will discuss initial engine test results demonstrating the potential for an ultra-low PGM option for catalysts. \n\"Spinel and our other next-generation technologies offer cost-effective solutions for vehicle manufacturers to meet increasingly stringent vehicle emissions standards,\" stated Dr. Golden. \"GCC-2015 is an ideal venue to promote CDTi as a partner to China's domestic OEMs and partners working to attain cleaner emissions. We look forward to building awareness of the benefits of our advanced technologies for the China market.\" \n6 th Annual Global Congress of Catalysis 2015 (GCC-2015) Who: Dr. Steve Golden, CDTi's Chief Technology Officer What: Keynote speech: \"Development of Spinel™ Mixed Metal Oxides for Zero-Precious Metal and Ultra-Low Precious Metal Next-Generation TWC\" When: September 24 th at 10:00 a.m. Where: Han Yuan Junior Ballroom, 2 nd Floor, Sheraton Xian North City Hotel (SXNCH), Xi'an, China \nGCC-2015, sponsored by BIT Congress Inc. (BIT Group Global Ltd.), is a dynamic forum for all experts from academia, industry and national labs who are actively involved in the catalysis science and technology to exchange information and ideas, and to share breakthroughs and promising solutions to the most important issues in the field. The conference features a technical program focused on recent progress in catalysis, novel catalysis technology, design, preparation and characterizations of catalysts, catalyst separation, recovery and recycling, catalysis for environmental, energy, and industrial applications in the next decade. \nCDTi's presentation and the Chinese version of this press release will be available via CDTi's website at www.cdti.com/spinel . \nAbout Spinel \nThe Spinel platform is a family of proprietary materials using various base metals that replace costly platinum group metals (PGMs) and rare earth metals in coatings on standard catalytic converters. Spinel works across a wide range of engine and vehicle applications – both gasoline and diesel – and has the potential for significant cost savings for OEMs by dramatically reducing or eliminating expensive PGMs and rare earth metals. The technology promises to enable early, cost-effective compliance with stricter emissions standards in the U.S. and around the world and to mitigate OEM exposure to supply uncertainty and price volatility in the PGM and rare earth markets. \nAbout CDTi \nCDTi manufactures and distributes vehicle emissions control products that leverage its advanced materials technology. CDTi utilizes its proprietary patented Mixed Phase Catalyst (MPC®) technology and other related technologies to provide high-value sustainable solutions to reduce emissions, increase energy efficiency and lower the carbon intensity of on- and off-road combustion engine systems. Reflecting its continued focus on innovation, CDTi is developing and commercializing proprietary advanced low-platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts including synergized-PGM (SPGM™), as well as zero-PGM (ZPGM™) catalysts. CDTi is headquartered in Oxnard, California and has operations in the U.K., Canada, France, Japan and Sweden.
