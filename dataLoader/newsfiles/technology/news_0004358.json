The document says Williams bought a gun June 19, two days after authorities say Dylann Roof killed nine people inside a black church. Police have called the massacre a racially motivated hate crime. The document also cites the Virginia Tech and Columbine High School killers as influences.\nThe TV station in Virginia has said that Flanagan alleged that other employees made racially-tinged comments to him and that he filed a complaint.
