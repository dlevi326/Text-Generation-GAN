The total number of payment cards in the U.S. stands at approximately 1.2 billion, which includes credit, debit, charge and other forms of payment cards.\nU.S. retailers are investing $8.65 billion for upgrading their payment terminals and some including Target Corp ( TGT.N ) are prepared to accept the new cards. It is not entirely clear at the moment how many U.S. retailers have upgraded their payment terminals.\n\"Retailers are making an enormous investment in order to upgrade their terminals to accept these cards,\" said Brian Dodge, executive vice president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association.\n\"But the level of security in these cards is not what it should be and it is not equal to what is available in the rest of the world,\" Dodge said.\nU.S. banks and card companies will not issue personal identification numbers (PINs) with the new credit cards, an additional security measure that would render stolen or lost cards virtually useless when making in-person purchases at a retail outlet.\nInstead, they will stick with the present system of requiring signatures.\nAnalysts predict that credit card fraud at brick-and-mortar retailers will fall after the introduction of chip-enabled cards, but that online fraud will rise, as has happened in other countries using the technology.\nResearch and consulting firm Aite Group estimates U.S. online card fraud will more than double to $6.6 billion from $3.3 billion between 2015 and 2018.\n(Reporting by Nandita Bose in Chicago; Editing by Bernard Orr )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T03:49:23.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
