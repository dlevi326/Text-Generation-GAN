Not that I had ever used it myself, but as an observer and firm appreciator of the discussion forum it sure felt as a loss to me. The first time I arrived on the comment section, shock was the only reaction I experienced.\nSurely, when one is inside a car the language and personal expressions towards our fellow people are of a more harsh nature, but never in public would you say the things you say inside the safe space of your own vehicle. There is a sense of expressive freedom that comes with not being heard, and if I’m not too busy dodging traffic, my roadside conversations with the other road-users regularly result in sarcastic opinions and assumptions of other drivers.\nSome of those engaging on the comment section of News24 however, somehow lifted that barrier and unashamed opinionated banter was suddenly visible on a public platform. As a kind of shallow sensationalist, I read the surreal comments section with great entertainment. The News24 comments were capable of turning any generic topic into vast personal escalation. Never have I seen such leaps of direction taken from on-topic suggestions to completely ridiculous off-topic personal vendetta. This was my Friday night soapie.\n‘Heavy rain threatening the Western Cape’ could suddenly turn into a discussion about language, race or even genitals. ‘Largest ostrich record holder on this continent’ would escalate into an argument about sexual preference, foreigners and politics. I kid you not. Surely, there were those innocents who would post the lovely \"oh I hope everyone’s ok\" or \"well that’s nice\" comments. They were clearly not aware of the warzone they were getting themselves in to.\nI would not argue that by disabling comments, anyone has lost their freedom of speech, We live in a time where individual voices matter and personal opinions are easily expressed. Similar freedom existed when the news was only delivered to your doormat, but discussions were done via written post and take weeks to arrive. News24 has simply taken away a bit of convenience, but luckily anyone can express their views on many different digital media. As for me, I’d have to go and find them now. Otherwise I’ll just read the news which I’m sure, eventually, will do just fine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T11:23:33.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
