AkrutoSync is the only Windows® PC software that can automatically, wirelessly and privately sync Outlook Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, and Notes with the new iPhones’ built-in Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, and Notes apps. It does not require iTunes and none of the information is stored on iCloud or any cloud-based service. The two-way sync Windows® PC software moves data directly between computer and devices including those running Windows 10 with Outlook. This ensures Outlook PC, iPhone 6S, and any other devices have the same updated information, no matter where the user makes changes.\n“Customers need a reliable way that can sync Outlook with iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, and any other devices they own without worrying about their privacy or missing data,” says George Tatar, founder and CEO of Akruto, Inc. “Unlike competing products, Akruto transfers Outlook data straight into the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus’s own built-in apps. They’ll be able to use the new iPhone 6S’s integrated features such as sharing a contact in a text message. AkrutoSync does not install any apps on smartphones or tablets.”\nAccording to “ Connected World: The Internet of Things and Connected Devices in 2020 ,” a report from Strategy Analytics, currently the average person carries 1.7 devices. By the end of 2020, that will double to 4.3. Users don’t have time to manually and repeatedly enter appointments and contacts for every device. Owners of the new iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S Plus will most likely own other devices. One license of AkrutoSync works with unlimited iOS, Windows Phone and Android devices for no extra charge.\nUsers can get a full-seven day trial of AkrutoSync from http://www.akruto.com/get-akruto-sync/ and learn more about synchronizing Outlook with iPhone 6 . Anyone — including those in the middle of the trial — needing help can contact 24/7 support at support@akruto.com.\nA single license — available for a one time price of $34.95 or a subscription of $2.99 per month — covers one PC and unlimited use with iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, older iPhones, iPad, iPod Touch, Windows Phone, Windows Surface, and Android devices and tablets.\nAbout Akruto, Inc.\nAkruto develops software for individuals and small businesses that want to synchronize Microsoft Outlook with smartphones and other mobile devices.
