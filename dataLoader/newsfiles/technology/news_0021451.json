More Apple aims to keep momentum via iPhone 6S \nHe told an audience in Beijing on Tuesday that Uber was creating 100,000 new jobs every month in China and added that he “welcomed” forthcoming government regulations on car-hailing apps as the company pushed into 100 cities in the next year. \nMr Kalanick, speaking at Baidu World, an annual forum hosted by Uber’s largest Chinese investor, Baidu, emphasised the subtle evolution in the US group’s strategy in an effort to cozy up to Beijing. “Coming into China we’ve had to relearn everything that we do,” he said. \nUber, which launched in San Francisco in 2010, is a veteran of battles with regulators and protests by cabbies in cities from Paris to New Delhi as it expands at breakneck speed. But the ambitious taxi disrupter has been less pugnacious in China owing to Beijing’s lack of patience for upstarts and outlaws. \nCar-hailing apps are a legal grey area in China as transport laws have lagged behind technological advances. Domestic media have reported that Beijing is planning later this year to unveil national regulations that could either formally legalise the expanding industry or strangle it. \n“National regulations are something that are on our mind, but we’re actually welcoming these regulations,” Mr Kalanick said. Old rules “have to start to bend towards this new innovation, and at the same time the innovators have to bend towards those new rules, and we’re in that process”. \n“We’re in almost 20 cities today but we’ve go 100 cities to go in the next 12 months,” he said. \nWith the spectre of unemployment growing as China’s economy slows, Mr Kalanick sought to play up the positive role of car-hailing apps in creating jobs, rather than putting licensed taxi drivers out of work. “Every month we’re creating a hundred thousand [driver] jobs,” he said, noting that in the city of Chengdu alone Uber has created 42,000. \nPrivate taxis are illegal in China but many in the upper reaches of the government see ride-hailing services as an ally in the battle against city traffic congestion and smog. \nHowever, municipal authorities have been cracking down in response to pressure from local taxi companies. In December, police in Chongqing raided a training session for Uber drivers and in May Uber’s office in Guangzhou was raided by police. \nLocal authorities have been kinder to Didi Kuaidi, which in May joined a pilot programme in Shanghai that would make it the first legal ride-hailing service in the city. Uber insists it is in full compliance with most Chinese regulations already. \nGoing head to head with Didi Kuaidi, Uber has said it would spend $1bn in China in 2015, much of it on subsidies aimed at boosting its number of drivers and riders. \nOn Monday Mr Kalanick confirmed that a funding round by separate affiliate Uber China had raised $1.2bn , while Didi Kuaidi raised $2bn at a valuation of about $15bn in July in a round that may yet increase. \nDidi Kuaidi claims to have 80 per cent of the mainland market. Mr Kalanick said on Tuesday that Uber now accounts for 30-35 per cent.
