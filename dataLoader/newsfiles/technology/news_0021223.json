Samsung has introduced two models of the 'Gear S2' smartwatch, which has a round face and is equipped with 3G connection, meaning customers can make calls without using a phone. The watch will be run on Samsung's operating system, Tizen, rather than Android and includes fitness tracking, mobile payment options and smart home control features. Users can also send text messages and receive email and calendar notifications. So far, Apple has a firm head start on the smart watch market, selling 3.6 million devices in the second quarter. Fitbit (FIT) continues its majority hold over the wearables market, shifting 4.4 million fitness trackers last quarter. Samsung has been working hard to win over Apple customers across the board, recently offering iPhone users a free 30 day trial of the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 or S6 Edge.
