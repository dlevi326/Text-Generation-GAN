The occupancy figure as of the third quarter was 96.1 percent, up slightly from 95.8 percent a year earlier. \nDemand for apartments across the nation’s 100 largest markets came in at 85,689 units during the third quarter, surpassing concurrent deliveries that totaled 69,299 units. Demand in the 12 months ending in September registered at 260,430 units, ahead of the 236,606 new units completed. \nProperties under construction in the 100 largest metros at the end of the third quarter totaled 436,407 units. That construction volume is on par with the average for the past 10 quarters, reflecting no meaningful change in building activity. \n“While new supply tends to slow rent growth historically, that hasn’t been the case as of late,” Willett said. “Construction of luxury units in the most desirable neighborhoods results in new product rents that are too high to pull many residents out of the existing stock. Nationally, the typical monthly rent for new communities is around $1,600, more than 15 percent above typical rents in the best properties built prior to 2010.” \nMPF Research forecasts that U.S. apartments will remain essentially full through 2016. “While overall occupancy should inch down very slightly, that slight shift really just reflects the volume of product moving through initial lease-up, rather than any real softening in the performances of most individual existing communities,” Willett said. \nRents will likely continue to rise, but at a slower pace than is seen now. “MPF Research expects annual rent growth for new leases to remain above 4 percent through the end of 2016,” Willett said. “Whether or not the western region metros can sustain their torrid price increases is the key question. While underlying fundamentals are very strong in the West, if the economy experiences an unforeseen stumble, there is perhaps greater risk of a price correction there.” \nRent growth and other key performance indicators for the U.S. apartment market are discussed by MPF Research analysts in this video . \nFor more information on MPF Research, visit www.realpage.com/mpf-research . \nAbout RealPage \nRealPage, Inc. is a leading provider of comprehensive property management software solutions for the multifamily, commercial, single-family and vacation rental housing industries.
