Teilborg upheld the jury’s verdict on post-trial motions and granted a rare permanent injunction last week. As a result, defendant Holland Electronics, a subsidiary of Amphenol Corporation, is prohibited from further infringement for the life of the asserted patent, and must immediately cease all sales of each of the 60 separate products found to infringe PCT’s patent rights. The infringing products include Holland’s SLCU 6 series coaxial cable connector and numerous connectors sold by Holland under the trade name Superlok . This Smart News Release features multimedia.

The order ensures that PCT is the only company selling coaxial cable connectors utilizing the patented technology. The order also denied in its entirety Holland’s motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, which sought to overturn the jury’s verdict on validity, including anticipation, obviousness, indefiniteness, infringement, and damages, and rejected Holland’s defenses of laches and estoppel. \nRobins Kaplan partner Christopher Larus led the team representing PCT in the four-week trial and during post-trial briefing. “This order emphasizes our strong commitment to safeguarding PCT’s valuable intellectual property,” noted Larus, who chairs the Intellectual Property and Technology Litigation Group in Robins Kaplan’s Minneapolis office. “We are grateful for the opportunity to represent such an inventive and emerging company.” \nRobins Kaplan attorneys John Harting , Jamie Kurtz , Bryan Mechell , Ryan Dornberger , and Mathew Yang also represented PCT at trial and/or during post-trial briefing. \nThe case, titled PCT International Incorporated v. Holland Electronics LLC , was heard by Judge James Teilborg in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The patent in dispute is United States Patent No. 6,042,422, titled “coaxial cable end connector crimped by axial compression.” Keith Beauchamp of Coppersmith Brockelman PLC served as co-counsel to PCT in the litigation. \nAbout PCT International, Inc. \nFounded in 1997 by Steve Youtsey, PCT International, Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and manufacturer of last mile and access network solutions for broadband communication networks.
