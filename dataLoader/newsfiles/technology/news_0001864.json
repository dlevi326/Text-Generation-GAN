(AMI), a global leader in BIOS, remote management tools, network data storage products and unique solutions based on the Linux(®) and Android(TM) operating systems, is pleased to announce that its AMI B.O.L.T Wireless Health Monitor has received CE certification, a critical step in bringing the product to market in the greater European Economic Area (EEA). \nCE is an abbreviation of \"Conformite Europeenne\" or \"European Conformity\" and indicates that a manufacturer has received a certificate from the European Commission (EC) for its product as tested and verified by a notified body from within one of the European Union member countries. This process involves testing the product for various safety standards prescribed by European Commission through harmonized standards across the participating member countries. \nIn the case of AMI B.O.L.T, the product was tested for compliance with 10 different standards by an ISO-17025 accredited test lab. After multiple rounds of technical reviews on the product's technical specifications and test reports, along with three days of onsite auditing on the manufacturing processes, American Megatrends was granted an EC Certificate for AMI B.O.L.T from ITC, an EC-authorized notified body from the Czech Republic. \nNow that AMI B.O.L.T has received its EC certification, the product may be packaged with the CE mark and ultimately offered for sale within the greater European Economic Area, which consists of 28 European Union Member countries and 3 European Free Trade Association countries without restrictions. The CE mark signifies that the product has been assessed to meet high safety, health and environmental protection requirements. \nAMI B.O.L.T is a stylish and compact wireless device used to monitor a range of key health conditions -- anytime, anywhere.
