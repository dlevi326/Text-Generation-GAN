The article, titled “Go To Jail And Your Finances Will Also End Up In The Tank,” takes a look at the financial components people need to go through when they go behind bars.\nThe article starts off by highlighting the fact that the United States incarcerates more people than any other country in the world and this is probably one of the worst experiences a person can undergo. But there are consequences that go beyond the cold walls and steel bars: Being taken in, even for a misdemeanor, can affect a person’s finances as well.\nThe article explains that one of the things consumers may go through is putting money together for bail. The amount will depend on the seriousness of the crime committed and usually needs to be gathered hastily. The graver the offense of the person, the more money they will need to post for bail.\nThe article by National Debt Relief also shares that even if a person is assigned a public defender, there is a chance that the said defender's attributes may work against them. For example, they may be too young, an inexperienced attorney or fresh out of law school. Even if a person sent behind bars gets a free lawyer, there are court proceedings and the arrest itself that consumers need to consider, all of which could add up to several thousand dollars in expenses.\nMore serious crimes or felonies can equate to longer criminal litigation, simultaneously increasing the expenses related to the crime. If consumers choose to hire lawyers, they should keep in mind attorney fees, as well expert witnesses or investigators, which can run up costs even higher.
