Legacy applications account for 38 percent of all integrations. And, 12 percent of businesses surveyed have more than 10 applications and data sources connected to Salesforce currently. Mission-Critical, Lack of Data Integration is Impacting Performance: Fifty-four percent (54%) of respondents indicated that application and data source integration is their most pressing challenge due to challenges around on-premise applications (48%), legacy applications (47%), connectivity (40%) and shared data sources (37%). Sixty-three percent (63%) stated integration difficulties result in slower Salesforce performance. Innumerable Benefits Reign Supreme: Despite current challenges, the benefits of Salesforce are plentiful, ranging from ease-of-use to cost effectiveness to competitive advantage. Fifty-six percent (56%) of respondents said Salesforce is intuitive and easy-to-use. In addition, 48 percent said, despite access to real-time data and analysis, Salesforce still increased the effectiveness of their sales teams. \nSurvey respondents included more than 200 users, professionals and administrators currently using or managing Salesforce. Participants spanned industries including technology (22%), manufacturing (18%), financial services (13%), services (11%) and healthcare (10%), with the remaining respondents in telecom, government, retail, utilities, education, non-profit and transportation. Job titles ranged from Corporate IT, sales, product and general management, manufacturing/production, finance/accounting and marketing.
