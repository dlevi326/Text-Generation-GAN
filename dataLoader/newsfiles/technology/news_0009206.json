The company’s chief business officer, Greg Bader, will receive a cheque for about $8.7m with the vesting of shares obtained through his long-term incentives, while the company’s chief operating officer, Maryna Fewster, will receive about $8m from the same bonus program.\nTPG’s billionaire boss David Teoh has wasted no time in purging executives from iiNet since taking full control of the company last month. Mr Buckingham was the first to go while iiNet’s long-serving head of NBN strategy and product, Rachel McIntyre, left the company last week. There are rumours circulating that other high-ranking executives in the company will also soon depart.\nThe exit of Mr Buckingham — who was also overseeing the duties of chief financial officer — has created a power vacuum at the head of iiNet.\nMultiple sources close to iiNet have claimed that Mr Teoh’s son and current TPG non-executive board member, Shane Teoh, has been appointed as the company’s new CFO.\nShane Teoh, 30, has been a TPG board member since 2012. He holds a bachelor of commerce and a bachelor of law from the University of NSW and is the managing director of accounting and taxation software developer Total Forms.\nBut TPG chief financial officer Stephen Banfield emphatically denied that Mr Teoh, or any other candidate, had been appointed as iiNet’s new CEO. “No, that’s not correct,” he told The Australian .\nThe company’s broader shareholder base will also receive ­proceeds from the $1.56bn sale to TPG, albeit in much smaller packets when they are paid out today.\nTPG’s takeover will see the bulk of iiNet’s shareholders receive a cash payment of $9.55 a share, consisting of $8.80 for the scrip and a 75c dividend. Shareholders who elected to receive TPG scrip will pick up 0.5533 TPG shares for each iiNet share they own and $3.82 in cash.\nThe total cash consideration for the sale of shares in the possession of iiNet’s three top executives came in at less than $9.55 a share each as they were awarded their performance rights in three tranches over three years. The trio also received performance rights under another long-term incentive plan that has since completed.\nThe executives landed their mammoth payday after successfully hitting the targets of their long-term incentive plans, which required that they deliver consistent and total shareholder returns of more than 20 per cent over the last three years.\niiNet chairman Michael Smith, who enthusiastically approved the TPG deal, is also set for a lucrative payday and will receive close to $2.6m for his 270,000 shares.\nBut the largest single payout will go to NBN Co board director and internet entrepreneur Simon Hackett whose three million iiNet shares will net him $28.65m. He accumulated his stake when he sold his business Internode to iiNet in 2011 for $105m. His sale to iiNet also gave him a 7.5 per cent stake in the company but that has been progressively sold down in the past five years to about 2 per cent prior to TPG’s purchase.\nThis article first appeared in The Australian Business Review", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mergers-acquisitions/tpg-to-pay-top-iinet-executives-25m-to-exit/story-fn91vdzj-1227515354366"], "published": "2015-09-07T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:55:18.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
