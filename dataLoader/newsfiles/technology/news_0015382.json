Amanda Forstrom, a technology expert and special reporter for NewsWatch, conducted the review and shared with viewers how this device was designed for people to comfortably hold a tablet while reducing the likelihood of it dropping. Tablets like the iPad and Samsung Galaxy Tab have afforded people a convenience in life that smartphones and laptops just can’t offer. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t come with its own set of inconveniences. Tablets can be a pain to hold for long periods of time and are easy to drop. The solution? The new G-Hold.\nMade in Scotland, this simple gadget will save a tablet from the user. With the G-Hold people will find themselves no longer lose their grip on the tablet, keeping it secure in their hand. There are two different versions: the megastick which is a permanent attachment to the back of a tablet or case and the microsuction which uses tons of little suction cups to adhere to a device.\nThe G-Hold technology in each version is the same – all users have to do is pull up the handle then slip it through their fingers for a solid hold. Users can hold it in any position because of its ergonomic rotation. Each version comes in 5 colors - pink, green, blue, yellow and black and is compatible with any tablet. The megastick goes for $24.95 while the microsuction fetches for $34.95.\nTo learn more, visit http://www.creativetechgadgets.com today.\nAbout NewsWatch\nNewsWatch is a weekly 30-minute consumer oriented television show that airs on the Discovery Channel and ION Network.
