(AP) â€” Two Nevada counties and some mining companies want a court to block new restrictions on mining, energy development and grazing that are meant to protect a declining bird species across millions of acres of the American West.\nThe case appears to be the first challenge to the Interior Department 's declaration this week that it can protect the greater sage grouse without hobbling the region's economy.\nThe lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Reno targets newly signed federal land-use plans covering portions of Nevada, Montana, Idaho, California, Utah and Oregon. But it has implications across the bird's 11-state range.\nTo help the grouse, Interior officials want to withdraw 10 million acres from future mining claims, prohibit oil and gas drilling near breeding grounds and impose new reviews on grazing permits.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-25T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T22:45:00.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
