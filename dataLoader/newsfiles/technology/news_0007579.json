Sperm whales produce a substance called ambergris which is used in the cosmetic industry. Picture: National Geographic Channel. Source: Supplied\nThe stinky product is used in the perfumery industry as a fixative and has made many people rich in the past.\nThe expensive vomit will be sold in an auction later this month.\n“Our vendor was out walking his dog when it ran over to this object and wouldn’t leave it alone,” Chris Surfleet from Adam Partridge Auctioneers told UK’s Metro .\n“The owner saw the dog was sniffing something and thought the object was far too light to be a rock or large stone and found it had a soft, soapy texture.”\nMistaken identity ... Ken Wilman found what he though was ambergris in 2013 on a UK beach. Picture: AFP Source: AFP\n“He took it home, did a bit of research and suspected it was ambergris and knew it had a value so he came to us.\n“We are 100 per cent certain it is ambergris. A number of people with experience with ambergris have studied it who have confirmed it.\n“It is a bit like gold in that it comes down to the price per gram.”\nIt’s expected to fetch close to AU$15,000.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/uk-dog-walker-is-about-to-make-15000-after-discovering-piece-of-whale-vomit-on-beach/story-fnjwkt0b-1227520885498?sv=9c99d5392463c2a6f2371a24b5198b7", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/uk-dog-walker-is-about-to-make-15000-after-discovering-piece-of-whale-vomit-on-beach/story-fnjwkt0b-1227520885498?sv=9c99d5392463c2a6f2371a24b5198b7", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/uk-dog-walker-is-about-to-make-15000-after-discovering-piece-of-whale-vomit-on-beach/story-fnjwkt0b-1227520885498?sv=9c99d5392463c2a6f2371a24b5198b7&h=The+most+expensive+vomit+ever", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=The+most+expensive+vomit+ever&c=A+HARDENED+lump+of+whale+spew+might+not+sound+very+appealing%2C+but+a+dog+walker+is+going+to+become+a+whole+lot+richer+because+of+his+strange+find.&u=http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/uk-dog-walker-is-about-to-make-15000-after-discovering-piece-of-whale-vomit-on-beach/story-fnjwkt0b-1227520885498?sv=9c99d5392463c2a6f2371a24b5198b7", "http://metro.co.uk/2015/09/09/dog-walker-is-about-to-make-7000-after-whale-spews-5382662/#ixzz3lHCLH7n2", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/uk-dog-walker-is-about-to-make-15000-after-discovering-piece-of-whale-vomit-on-beach/story-fnjwkt0b-1227520885498?sv=9c99d5392463c2a6f2371a24b5198b7&title=The+most+expensive+vomit+ever", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/uk-dog-walker-is-about-to-make-15000-after-discovering-piece-of-whale-vomit-on-beach/story-fnjwkt0b-1227520885498?sv=9c99d5392463c2a6f2371a24b5198b7&title=The+most+expensive+vomit+ever"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T05:10:36.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
