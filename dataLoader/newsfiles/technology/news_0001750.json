One year removed from a nearly total redesign, the 2016 Chevy Suburban in Naperville, IL arrives to the Chevrolet of Naperville inventory as the most fuel-efficient model built to this point. It features aerodynamic elements and a wholly modern engine with cutting edge technology to help conserve as much fuel as possible. One of these technologies is Active Fuel Management which can automatically disable cylinders in the engine to increase fuel economy and reactivate them when more power is required. \nAlso available in the Chevrolet of Naperville showroom is the 2016 Chevy Tahoe in Naperville, IL . While the 2016 Tahoe and 2016 Suburban share a number of elements, the former has a slight towing advantage over the latter. Owners of the 2016 Tahoe will be able to tow 8,400 pounds, just edging past the new Suburban. Both vehicles will be able to help drivers get more use out of their iPhones through the Apple CarPlay suite of applications. Also, the 2016 Tahoe features the Chevy 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot. This will allow up to seven devices to be connected simultaneously to the high-speed internet connection. \nAnyone can view the Chevrolet of Naperville inventory by visiting the dealership's website, www.chevroletofnaperville.com .
