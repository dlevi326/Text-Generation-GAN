This followed an even larger $27 billion increase in June, the biggest one-month gain in credit since November 2001. The June increase was revised up significantly from an initial estimate of $20.7 billion. \nEconomists believe strong job gains will support increased borrowing and consumer spending, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of economic activity. \nIn July, borrowing in the category that includes auto and student loans rose $14.8 billion, while the category for consumer card debt expanded $4.3 billion. \nThe Fedâ€™s monthly report on credit does not cover home mortgages or other loans secured by real estate such as home-equity loans. \nOn Friday, the Labor Department said employers added 173,000 jobs in August, and the unemployment rate dropped to a seven-year low of 5.1 percent.
