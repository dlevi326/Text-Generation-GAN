Known locally as the ‘old dock’, it opened for business on August 31, 1715, providing a blueprint for the development of other trading ports.\nFor the first time in history, the design of the dock allowed ships to load and unload whatever the state of the tide. It helped Liverpool to become one of the globe’s most important ports, with ships being able to turn around in under two days, rather than the two weeks needed previously.\n \n\n(Source: Peel Ports)\nThanks to the ‘old dock’, by the end of the nineteenth century, 9% of the world’s trade went through Liverpool.\nAble to accommodate up to 100 ships at a time within its 1.4 ha, the dock took five years to construct at a cost of US$19,000 at a time when the average labourer would have earned $30 per year.\nThe undertaking was a high risk commission for Liverpool as it would have led to bankruptcy for the city if unsuccessful.\nMark Whitworth, Chief Executive of Peel Ports, said: “The anniversary comes at a significant time as we progress with the construction of our new container terminal Liverpool2, which will help create a new chapter in our story by establishing a new international gateway between the UK and international trading communities.”\n\n(Source: Peel Ports)\nThe dock was filled in in 1826, having been superseded by larger and deeper ports built into the river Mersey, on which Liverpool sits.\nIt was rediscovered during excavations in 2001 and the remains of the dock have been preserved as part of Mersey Maritime Museum.\nFor all the latest on Peel Ports, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T18:31:11.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
