In addition, the growing need of real-time visibility, prerequisite for effective management process, and the reformist revolution within the demand-driven economy, is expected to boost the demand of the manufacturing execution system (MES), during the forecast period. Manufacturing execution systems (MES) are integrated with, product lifecycle management (PLM), supply chain management (SCM), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications to facilitate visibility, control, and synchronization in the manufacturing processes. The prime objective of manufacturing execution systems (MES) is to strengthen the overall manufacturing process capability, irrespective of the manufacturing production capacity. The conventional manual based operation is now being replaced with connected network of numerous manufacturing execution systems (MES). MES also offers high productivity, at lower cost, in a short turnaround time. North America has been the largest manufacturing execution system (MES) market in 2014, followed by Europe. The market dominance of North America and Europe is attributed to higher industrial production in these regions. Oil and gas, automotive, and food and beverages are some of the most dominant application segments of manufacturing execution system in the developed regions. Asia Pacific is the fastest growing market for manufacturing execution system (MES), due to the growing automotive manufacturing facilities, and food and beverage processing industries in the region. China, India, U.S., Germany, Italy, U.K., Spain, Canada, and Japan are the leaders of the manufacturing execution system (MES) market. The oil and gas based economy of Middle-East countries, such as UAE, Qatar, and Iraq are laying significant market opportunities for the manufacturing execution market owing to their increasing adoption in the region. The new crude oil manufacturing facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, along with rapid industrialization in Brazil are the major drivers for the MES market in South America. Based on the product type, the global manufacturing execution system market can be segmented, as inventory management, performance analysis, quality analysis, data collection and acquisition, document control, resource allocation, and others. Based on application, the global manufacturing execution system market can be categorized into process industry (including oil, chemicals, food and beverages, power, paper and pulp, water and waste water management and others), discrete industry (including automotive, aerospace and defense industry, medical devices industry, fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry and others. With the increasing number of mergers and acquisitions, consolidation in the manufacturing execution system has been observed, during the past few years. Siemens acquired Elan Software Systems, in 2010. Similarly in 2009, SAP acquired Visiprise, which operates in discrete manufacturing industries MES system, such as high technology, aerospace and defense, medical device, automotive, and others.
