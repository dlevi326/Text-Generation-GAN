According to the Verge, the company revealed that the update has no official release date yet and is said to be coming soon, along with a Japanese version of the new YouTube Gaming app. The announcement is made to capitalize on the popularity of mobile gaming in Japan and elsewhere.\nRyan Wyatt, global gaming head, YouTube, said in a statement that Japan's mobile games define its gaming culture, far more so than in other countries. This trend shows there is a real need for gamers to easily share what is on their screen with the gaming community, as it happens.\nYouTube Gaming faces tough competition from Amazon-owned Twitch, which has built a loyal following in the core video games community. YouTube Gaming launched last month in the United States and United Kingdom and Japan will be the first market in Asia to get the service.\n technology latest YouTube Also Read LG Sound Bar review: An elegant wireless home theatre Mangalagangothri campus Mangalore gives high-speed 1Gb/s Wi-Fi to students Googleâ€™s new trick will keep you entertained for hours Severe coal shortage at power plants hits industries", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/YouTube_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150918/technology-science-and-trends/article/youtube-introduces-live-streaming-android-games", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/YouTube_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-20T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T16:00:31.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
