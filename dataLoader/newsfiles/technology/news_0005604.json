I mean, it might be as much or even more than what we earn,” said Justice Mahomed Navsa, to laughter from the public gallery.\nHe wasn’t wrong.\nAccording to the 2013/14 determination by the commission for the remuneration of public office bearers, Motsoeneng’s salary increase would have seen him earning just a bit more than the chief justice and far more than an SCA judge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T17:31:35.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
