Credit: Macalady, Penn State \nOnly the microbes located above the water's surface contribute to the development of hydrogen-sulfide-rich caves, suggests an international team of researchers. Since 2004, researchers have been studying the Frasassi cave system, an actively developing limestone cave system located 1500 feet underground in central Italy. \nLimestone caves can form when solid limestone dissolves after coming in contact with certain types of acids. The resulting void is the cave system. \n\"We knew from previous research that microbes do play a role in cave development,\" said Jennifer Macalady, associate professor of geosciences, Penn State and co-author of a paper published today (Sept. 2) in Chemical Geology . \"What we were trying to assess was the extent of that contribution, which would help us understand how caves all over the world, as well as on other worlds, form.\" \nIn hydrogen-sulfide-rich caves, microbes \"eat\" the hydrogen sulfide through a process known as aerobic respiration, Macalady said. The byproduct of this process is the creation of sulfuric acid , which has the potential to dissolve limestone and contribute to cave growth. \n\"The main goal of our study was to investigate what happened to hydrogen sulfide in the cave, because when the microbes use hydrogen sulfide for energy, this, along with oxygen, leads to the production of sulfuric acid,\" said Macalady. \nThe researchers measured oxygen levels and the amount of chemicals degassing—changing from liquid to gas state—throughout several parts of the cave system . The Frasassi system has cave pathways that formed 10,000 to 100,000 years ago as well as currently actively forming cave pathways, allowing the researchers to compare their measurements and identify the factors contributing to active development. \n\"What we found is that in certain conditions, the hydrogen sulfide in the water escapes as a gas into the air above the water instead of being 'eaten' by microbes below the water surface,\" said Macalady. \"As a result, the underwater microbes only partially burned hydrogen sulfide. Instead of creating a byproduct of sulfuric acid, they created pure sulfur as a byproduct, which is not corrosive to limestone.\" \nIn contrast, the microbes above the water's surface completely \"ate\" the hydrogen sulfide. This process results in the creation of sulfuric acid, which dissolves limestone and contributes to cave growth. \nMacalady says that the results would apply to all limestone caves that are rich in hydrogen sulfide , which includes more well-known caves such as Carlsbad Caverns and Lechuguilla Cave in New Mexico and Kap-Kutan Cave in Turkmenistan. Life beyond Earth? Underwater caves in Bahamas could give clues January 26, 2012 \nDiscoveries made in some underwater caves by Texas &M University at Galveston researchers in the Bahamas could provide clues about how ocean life formed on Earth millions of years ago, and perhaps give hints of what types ... Cave dwelling nettle discovered in China December 28, 2012 \nSouth West China, Myanmar and Northern Vietnam contain one of the oldest exposed outcrops of limestone in the world. Within this area are thousands of caves and gorges. It is only recently that botanists have sought to explore ... New cave-dwelling arachnids discovered in Brazil May 22, 2013 \nTwo new species of cave-dwelling short-tailed whipscorpions have been discovered in northeastern Brazil, and are described in research published May 22 in the open access journal PLOS ONE by Adalberto Santos, from the Federal ... Brazilian zoologists discovered the first obligate cave-dwelling flatworm in South America September 25, 2014 \nTypical cave-dwelling organisms, unpigmented and eyeless, were discovered in a karst area located in northeastern Brazil. The organisms were assigned to a new genus and species of freshwater flatworm and may constitute an ... Going underground to understand Australia's past climate variability May 5, 2015 \nGiven the importance of water in Australia, surprisingly, there is relatively little information about the past variability of rainfall on this continent. Although there is a good annual record of the past 100 years in Australia, ... Yeast byproduct inhibits white-nose syndrome fungus in lab experiments July 21, 2015 \nA microbe found in caves produces a compound that inhibits Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome in bats, researchers report in the journal Mycopathologia. The finding could lead to treatments ... Recommended for you CT scan of Earth links deep mantle plumes with volcanic hotspots September 2, 2015 \nUniversity of California, Berkeley, seismologists have produced for the first time a sharp, three-dimensional scan of Earth's interior that conclusively connects plumes of hot rock rising through the mantle with surface hotspots ... Radioactive contaminants found in coal ash September 2, 2015 \nA new Duke University-led study has revealed the presence of radioactive contaminants in coal ash from all three major U.S. coal-producing basins. Evidence that Earth's first mass extinction was caused by critters not catastrophe September 2, 2015 \nIn the popular mind, mass extinctions are associated with catastrophic events, like giant meteorite impacts and volcanic super-eruptions. Three trillion trees: Study finds there are 7.5 times more trees than previously believed September 2, 2015 \nA new Yale-led study estimates that there are more than 3 trillion trees on Earth, about seven and a half times more than some previous estimates. But the total number of trees has plummeted by roughly 46 percent since the ... Explaining crocodiles in Wyoming September 2, 2015 \nFifty million years ago, the Cowboy State was crawling with crocodiles. Fossil records show that crocs lounged in the shade of palm trees from southwestern Wyoming to southern Canada during the Cretaceous and Eocene. Exactly ...
