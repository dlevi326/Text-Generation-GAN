The company specializes in RNA-targeted technology to develop antisense drugs. Antisense treatments are small, DNA- or RNA-like compounds that are chemically modified to create drugs.\nSeparately on Friday, AstraZeneca said it bought a Boulder, Colo., manufacturing facility from Amgen Inc. to support its growing pipeline.\nTerms of the deal weren't disclosed and AstraZeneca said the acquisition doesn't affect its 2015 guidance. The site is expected to be operational and licensed for commercial production by late 2017, the company said.\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com\n 11, 2015 08:15 ET (12:15 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:28:41.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
