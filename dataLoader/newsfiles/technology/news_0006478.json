Ask any military strategist.\nThe press, especially the S.A.B.C. has hyped up everybody in the country to a feverish extent, but because they lost one match, now they have to be treated like outcasts!!!!.\nIf this is the support we give our fellow countrymen then I think we ought to be ashamed of ourselves.\nThis will only exacerbate the outflow of South Africa's most promising rugby talent.\nAfter all who wants to be hung out to dry just because you lost one game.\nA far better option would be to support our guys and to put this loss behind us. We simply cannot continue like this; it is demoralising not only to the country but also to the players.\nIt cannot be condoned since it is not fair to anyone, not the supporters, nor the players.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T20:03:03.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
