The deer had been measured by Joey Thompson, official scorer for the N.C. Bowhunters Association, and was found to be 30 inches larger than the existing state-record archery kill.\nBut enforcement officers with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission visited Davis Sunday, and determined that the antlers were not from the Tar Heel State. According to agents, Davis had gotten the antlers from Pennsylvania and screwed them into the skull plate of a 3-point buck he had taken in North Carolina with a rifle. Davis covered the bases of the antlers with deer hide to make the set-up look more natural, Thompson told the website.\nIn the original story the website wrote about the supposed state-record buck, Davis shared elaborate details about jumping the deer while weed-eating on a farm he helps manage.\n\"I had three more bucks as big or bigger than the ones I killed last year, and I was actually going after those deer; I didn't know this one was around until two weeks ago,\" he told northcarolinasportsman.com. \"When I jumped him, I almost dropped the weed-eater. I've never seen anything like him before.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.northcarolinasportsman.com/details.php?id=5351", "http://www.northcarolinasportsman.com/details.php?id=5348"], "published": "2015-09-21T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:16:19.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
