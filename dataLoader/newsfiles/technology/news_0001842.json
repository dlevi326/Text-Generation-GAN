We are looking for someone to help build on and extend this program of research to apply quantitative MRI and spectroscopy to post-mortem imaging, to provide vitally needed non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers. The post holder will also help to support the development of rapid motion insensitive EEG-fMRI acquisitions to improve the pre-surgical evaluation of children with drug resistant focal epilepsy. \nThis post is focussed on the development and application of new advanced MRI techniques and their translation into the clinical arena with a specific emphasis on \nThe optimisation and development of quantitative MRI (i.e. multi parameter mapping of T1 / MT / T2* / PD / susceptibility mapping / diffusion) for post-mortem imaging (extending our existing program applying these methods in-vivo). \nThe development of rapid motion insensitive EEG-fMRI acquisitions to improve the pre-surgical evaluation of children with drug resistant focal epilepsy \nThis role benefits from the opportunity to see developments translated into clinical applications via our close links with the clinicians and patients at our partner Great Ormond Street Hospital, Europe’s largest paediatric hospital and with ICH Europe’s largest centre for paediatric research. \nThe post holder will have access to excellent research facilities with a new Siemens Prisma (3T, 80mT/m gradients and 64 channel receive coil, multi-nuclear capability) and a Siemens Avanto MRI scanners with dedicated and funded research time. \nIn addition we have a prospective motion correction camera ( www.kineticor.com ) that allows for real-time motion correction, an important aspect of this project. We also benefit from a wide range of MRI peripheral equipment including MRI compatible EEG/EMG/GSR/acceleration equipment and the support and technical input of brainproducts (GMBH, Gilching, Germany). \nThis post is initially funded for 24 months. \nPerforming analytical work in a highly numerate area of physics, medicine, computer science or allied field. \nIt is also expected that the applicant will have additional experience in practical MRI physics, but applicants with a strong background in applied natural sciences, mathematics, computer science or related subject will also be considered. A strong ability for scientific computer programming is required e.g. in C++, Matlab or R. \nApplicants must have, or be close to obtaining, a PhD in MRI physics, multivariate analysis or be an exceptional natural scientist with a keen interest in this project (publishing their work in respected scientific journals). \nApplicants will be expected to have experience of preparing and publishing scientific articles in relevant journal, commensurate with level of experience. \nUCL Reference: 1491838 \nApplicants should apply online.
