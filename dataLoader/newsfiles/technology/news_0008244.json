Klein of Outten & Golden LLP and Kelly M. Dermody of Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP, announce that a lawsuit filed today in federal court in Washington alleges that Microsoft has engaged in systemic and pervasive discrimination against its female professional employees. \nThe lawsuit, Moussouris v. Microsoft Corp. , Case No. 15-cv-01483 (W.D. Wash.), filed by Katie Moussouris, accuses Microsoft of engaging in a pattern and practice of gender discrimination against its female technical professionals. Microsoft, a global provider of software and software-related services, is a major employer, with a headcount of over 117,000 employees in 2015, many of whom are technical employees. In 2014, Microsoft generated $93.6 billion dollars in net revenue and $12.2 billion dollars in net income. \nThe plaintiff alleges violations of federal and state laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Washington Law Against Discrimination. The plaintiff class is represented by Outten & Golden LLP and Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP. \nAccording to the complaint, “[a]s a result of Microsoft’s policies, patterns, and practices, female technical employees receive less compensation and are promoted less frequently than their male counterparts. Microsoft’s company-wide policies and practices systematically violate female technical employees’ rights and result in the unchecked gender bias that pervades its corporate culture.” Plaintiff Katie Moussouris said, “What happened to me is not unique. This case will illuminate the broad patterns of decision-making against women. Fundamentally, this is about fairness and equality.” \n“The gender-equality issues raised by this lawsuit are all too familiar – Microsoft systematically undervalues the efforts and achievements of its female technical employees. This is an important step in our efforts to lift the glass ceiling for women working in what once were traditionally male-dominated professions,” said plaintiff’s attorney Adam T. Klein of Outten & Golden LLP of New York, New York. \n“This case challenges Microsoft’s practice of devaluing its talented female professionals,” said plaintiff’s attorney Kelly M. Dermody of Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP of San Francisco, California. “By coming forward, the plaintiff seeks to ensure a level playing field at one of the most important players in the technology sector.” \nThe complaint charges that, among other things, Microsoft compensates its female technical professionals less than similar men, disproportionately promotes men over equally or more qualified women, and evaluates female technical professionals less favorably compared to male peers. \nAttorneys Adam T. Klein, Cara E. Greene, and Ossai Miazad of Outten & Golden LLP and Kelly M. Dermody, Anne Shaver, and Sharon Lee of Lieff Cabraser Heimann and Bernstein LLP represent the plaintiffs. The case is Moussouris v. Microsoft Corp. , Case No. 15-cv-01483 (W.D. Wash.). \nPeople interested in the lawsuit may provide information by visiting microsoftgendercase.com or by calling 1-800-254-3079 to leave a message for plaintiffs’ counsel.
