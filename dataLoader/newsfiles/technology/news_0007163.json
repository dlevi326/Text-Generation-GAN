This would give it a 4K resolution - a standard that was only recently rolled out for high-end televisions.\n____\nSAMSUNG SURPRISE\nHaving already announced its latest range of Galaxy S phones last month, Samsung then jumped the gun on its own Berlin launch party by revealing a new smartwatch on Monday.\nThe Gear S2 will be round and come with a better battery life.\nIFA-watchers are hoping that the South Korean company has something else up its sleeve for its presentation Wednesday. The company is under pressure from Apple on the one side, and a growing number of Android competitors on the other.\n____\nTOUCH TYPES\nThe Apple Watch had it. Now smartphones are going to get it.\nForce Touch, a technology that allows users to transmit different commands to their smartphone depending on how strongly they press the touchscreen, is expected to make an entrance at IFA.\nHuawei has been tipped as the first company to introduce it in their new device, ahead of the launch of Apple's new iPhone next week.\n____\nALCATEL ATTACK\nChinese company TCL, which owns the Alcatel One Touch brand, is launching two new entry-level smartphones in Berlin.\nThe Pop 3 comes with either a 5-inch or a 5.5-inch screen - comparable to Samsung and Apple's high-end phones.\nAt under $200, these Android-powered phones will be competitively priced despite the large display.\n____\nROLLABLE KEYBOARD\nIFA isn't just about smartphones and watches though. Thousands of new gadgets, from drones to smart fridges are launched there each year.\nAmong the most eye-catching items previewed before the events is the Rolly, a Bluetooth keyboard that can be folded into a long rectangular box. Its manufacturer, South Korean company LG, hopes the Rolly will appeal to people who always carry their tablet around but prefer to type on a keyboard than a touchscreen.\nOther accessories that might catch consumers' eyes include a USB cable with a built-in LED light that manufacturer Hama says makes it easier to plug in your device in the dark.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
