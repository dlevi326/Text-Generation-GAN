The scientists say their analysis is important in understanding human shooting deaths. \nThe study was published in July in the International Journal of Legal Medicine. It describes how five pigs were shot from close range with a Glock semi-automatic handgun to record the back-spatter of blood, bone and brain material. \nJustin Goodman, from the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said Wednesday that the experiment was unnecessary. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
