Military spokesperson Colonel Sani Kukasheka Usman said schools are being reopened while troops continue to recapture territory from the insurgents.\nThe UN children's agency says at least 1.4 million children are currently displaced by Boko Haram's uprising.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T22:22:08.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
