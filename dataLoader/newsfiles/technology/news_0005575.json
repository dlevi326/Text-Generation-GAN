The cloud-based services and solutions provider expects to achieve three-digit growth for the next three years by acquiring a large number of new customers, he said, adding that Thailand is a large market and a key player in Southeast Asia. Dedenis said Thailand is an attractive market from a foreign investment and domestic standpoint. In a short span of 12 months, Thailand has moved into the top 10 Asian countries on the Cloud Readiness Index by the Asian Cloud Computing Association. The boom in cloud technologies in Thailand will create opportunities for Thai businesses to expand more rapidly to become regional and even global, he said. Now more than ever, the opportunity is here for companies to make decisions that will enable unlimited scalability to propel their businesses forward across geographies. Dedenis said the company recently began preparations for its launch in Thailand by completely customizing its modules into the Thai language in compliance with Thai tax and accounting laws. The company also provides consulting, implementation and post-sales support via its local partner, Lepcom Consulting. Before its official launch in Thailand, Acumatica have been serving some customers in the Kingdom via regional partners; for example, Calpis Group, which manufactures the energy drink M150 in Thailand. However, those offerings were still English-language based. \"We have a presence in every market in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos. We wanted to have a complete Thai version of the product with relevant customisations before going to market - that's the only way for a global platform to bring value to local markets,\" Dedenis said. Acumatica has a network of 48 regional partners that assist local customers by consulting on their requirements, customization, implementation and post-sales support. The company in turn has local and regional teams based in-country or at its Asian headquarters in Singapore to assist partners with product engineering, sales and marketing. The vertical industries of SMEs that the company targets include manufacturing, logistics, retail and distribution verticals, and project based businesses, Dedenis said. \"We will have a lot of experience to share with Thai customers in those verticals. Our target is to ultimately have hundreds of SMEs as our customers. Our licensing is built for SMEs in Asia and our subscription model enables small companies to use our platform at a starting price of US$10,000 (Bt359,800) per year while larger companies can subscribe to our more advanced platform for between $20,000 and $40,000 per year,\" Dedenis said. Acumatica's business direction is to continue focusing on the needs of local markets and to deliver market relevant solutions. As a company, Acumatica invests 40 per cent of its revenue in research and development for continued innovations. Acumatica is the cloud ERP vendor that offers users choice on the most suitable cloud - public, private or hybrid. \"This is a very important aspect that companies often overlook when it comes to cloud-based services or solutions - when you are locked into specific environments or vendors, you lose the ability to maintain data sovereignty and ownership of your own data. Only with control and freedom of choice in place, can users be assured that they can reap the full benefits of the cloud, which is scalability and unlimited migrations should their business needs change. In the case of Acumatica, data always remain the property of the customer,\" Dedenis said. 140 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T10:24:13.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
