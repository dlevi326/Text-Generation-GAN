The Blu Pure XL will be released in retail stores on September 29th 2015 for an amazing price of $349. - Advertisement - \nIf you are in the US, you probably have heard of the name Blu. If you are living outside the US, it goes by other names such as Gionee or Allview. On show today, we will take a look at some of the best that money can buy that doesn’t break the bank in anyway and is great value for money indeed. \nConsidering that the Pure XL does have flagship written all over it, it certainly doesn’t command a huge price to be able to own one. But does it have any drawbacks that you should know of? Read on then…. \nComing in with a body of 164 x 82.2 x 9.3 mm (6.46 x 3.24 x 0.37 in) and weighs 207 g (7.30 oz), it sure isn’t slim or lightweight. After all it is a 6-incher, what do you expect? It has a great design and a metal unibody that brings out the best in the look and feel department. \nTalking about screen, it comes with a 6-inch AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with 1440 x 2560 pixels or ~490 ppi pixel density that is simply stunning. Finally, we can see huge screens coming with huge resolution as well. Seldom have we seen the Quad HD resolution being paired with a screen this huge. There’s also the Gorilla Glass 3 to ensure you get the protection that you need. Not forgetting it also has a fingerprint sensor which further stamps its authority in the flagship category. It also has a built-in encryption file management system as an added security measure. \nWith a great screen comes great performance as well. Under the hood of the Pure XL is the Mediatek MT6795 Helio X10 chipset, a blazingly fast Octa-core 2.0 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, PowerVR G6200 graphics and 3GB RAM. Nothing short of spectacular and it speaks volume of flagship all the way. Trust me when I say you won’t face any issues to run all the latest apps and games in its full high resolution glory. - Advertisement - \nGreat screen, great performance – so what’s next?? Next you can expect a great camera with its 24 Megapixel primary camera with 5632 x 4224 pixels, optical image stabilization, phase detection autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash, 1/2.3'' sensor size, geo-tagging, touch focus, face/smile detection, panorama and HDR. It features 6 layers of custom lens that also comes with sapphire lens cover which ensures that you will be taking photos like a pro would. \nLike to take selfies? You will know that it also comes with an 8 Megapixel secondary camera to cater for all your needs. \nThe Pure XL also has decent storage available with its 64GB of internal storage. If that’s not enough, consider adding a microSD card into the expansion slot that can take in an additional 64GB. Nothing will stop you from taking the highest quality photos. \nIn terms of software, there has been a real issue with Blu that they are always late in coming out with updates. That won’t be the case as the Pure XL comes with Android Lollipop 5.1 right out of the box, which is a great complement to its hardware. \nBattery-wise, it is powered by a Li-Po 3500 mAh battery which should have no trouble powering up the device for at least a day or two in between charging. \nFinally, you are in for a real treat as it has dual sim capability and 4G LTE connection which adds more value to it. - Advertisement - \nThe Blu Pure XL is great in all aspects, but only if you are a fan of huge screen devices. Prepare to be greeted by its sleek metal body, great 6-inch QHD screen, great performance and an even better camera to boot. Expect it to get international recognition very fast once it hits the market on September 29 th . \nThe Blu Pure XL will be available on September 29 th for approximately $349 USD in the United States and will be available Black and Gold. Expect international release to follow suit, albeit using a different name.
