The merchant service providers who receive recognition have longevity in helping merchants reach their goals, as well as continued their growth and have achieved long-term development. The evaluation process consists of identifying the key strengths, weaknesses and competitive advantages of the top competing merchant service providers. They are then benchmarked across five key metrics crucial to success. In this case, the metrics were automation, accuracy, support, reporting and training. \nProcessing hundreds of thousands of cases monthly, CDRN's award winning chargeback prevention solution gives both merchants and Issuers unmatched protection through near real-time collaboration for both fraud and non-fraud chargeback disputes. CDRN's patented and proprietary \"closed loop\" process integrates directly with top card Issuers and redirects disputes from the Issuer to the merchant before they become chargebacks, so they can be resolved directly with the consumer. This proprietary integration provides timely dissemination of disputes and avoids paying for false protection that doesn't represent true chargeback disputes and results in lost profits due to over refunding. \n\"The result of Verifi's investment in quality and innovation is the only true end-to-end solution that fixes the entire chargeback problem. The chargeback problem has lots of moving pieces - it is more than just alerts. Fighting chargebacks requires vigilant attention to not only, preventing the occurrence of costly chargebacks but also the expertise to understand which disputes are unwarranted and worth pursuing to recover lost profits,\" said Matthew Katz, CEO of Verifi, Inc. \"We're proud to receive this recognition as it further validates our commitment to the highest quality for our clients and partners.\" \nThe Best Chargeback Prevention Companies included on the TopCreditCardProcessors.com list received a five out of five rating by more than 380 reviewers and customers. \nAbout Verifi: \nVerifi, an award-winning provider of end-to-end payment protection and management solutions, was founded in 2005 to help merchants effectively manage the payments challenges they face every day.
