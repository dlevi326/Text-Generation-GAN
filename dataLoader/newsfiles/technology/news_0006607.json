The remaining (task) is to keep this virtuous economic cycle going so people feel that a recovery in under way and that the exit from deflation will drive future economic growth,\" Mr Abe said before Tuesday's vote.\nIf he holds on to power until September 2018, Mr Abe will become Japan's longest-serving prime minister since Eisaku Sato, who served between 1967 and 1974.\nAbe served as premier for just one year from 2006 before he stepped down owing to ill health and a series of scandals in his party, setting off a string of short-lasting leaders until his re-election in late 2012.\nBut Abe is again facing declining popularity as public opposition swells over security bills that could put Japanese troops into combat for the first time since the end of the war.\nHe faces upper house elections next year, and he may decide to call a snap general election sometime between now and when his fresh three-year term expires.\nMr Abe's first major re-election challenge will be ramming the unpopular security bills through parliament, possibly as early as next week.\nThe changes have set off protests by tens of thousands of people and even a hunger strike by a group of Tokyo university students.\nUnder the proposed new rules, Japan's Self-Defence Forces could go into battle to protect allies - so-called collective self-defence.\nCritics argue that they could drag Japan into distant foreign wars even if there was no direct threat to the country or its people.\nMr Abe and his supporters say the bills are necessary to deal with a changing security environment marked by an increasingly assertive China and unpredictable North Korea.\nA constitution imposed by occupying US forces after World War II barred Japan's military from combat except in self-defence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:57:54.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
