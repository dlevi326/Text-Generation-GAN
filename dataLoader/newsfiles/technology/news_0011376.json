Some in the US claim this amounts to censorship. \nThe EU earlier this year unveiled an ambitious plan to overhaul Europe's fragmented tech landscape to create a \"single digital market.\" \nThe rules aim to make online services available on a similar basis in all EU countries, and also impose specific EU-wide regulations. \nOettinger said his ambition is to have \"one level of European general data protection regulation with some but not too many exceptions.\" \nHe added that this means having \"a smart level (of rules) which is good for privacy but which doesn't destroy big data services.\" \nOettinger said he hopes \"to come to a common understanding\" with the United States on the right to be forgotten, possibly in an international forum such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \nOettinger is on a five-day US visit where he planned to meet top executives at Facebook, Google, Apple and eBay. He later heads to Washington to meet policymakers and will then participate in the UN Broadband Commission for Digital Development meeting in New York. \nIn a blog post ahead of his visit, Oettinger acknowledged that \"many in the US are worried that our aim with the digital single market is to benefit only European companies\" but added that the plan \"is about adapting the European economy to the Digital age; Europeanizing our digital policies\" and achieving a \"level-playing field.\" \n\"I have never been shy to point out that the European economy needs to adapt to the new realities that the Internet and digital technologies have brought us,\" he said. \n\"There are questions that need to be answered, on the power of these platforms, the way they manage the enormous troves of data they collect, and the potential harmful effects on competition and innovation that dominant players can have.\" EU commissioner seeks to reassure VW on CO2 emissions October 11, 2012 \nEU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger has written to German car giant Volkswagen maintaining that proposed EU limits on auto carbon emissions were actually relaxed before they were finalised.
