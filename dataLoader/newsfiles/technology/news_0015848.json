Virtually unsinkable, the SeaGuard foam fender combines a durable, non-marking finish with extremely low maintenance requirements. \nMatthew Walker, Project Engineer at Trelleborg Marine Systems in Australia will join colleagues at the event, after being handpicked to join the Gastech Young Engineer Foundation (GYEF). \nGastech 2015 takes place at the Singapore EXPO, Singapore from October, 27-30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:38:32.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
