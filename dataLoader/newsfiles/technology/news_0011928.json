On Tuesday, he said he loved the Apple-Hermes deal because it shows that the smartwatch has cracked the luxury market.\n\"We were a little bit concerned about the price, because we're going to sell it at $1,800 ... and now we are quite reassured because Apple is telling us we can sell at $1,500 or even more,\" he said. \"I'm very, very pleased.\"\nThe midlevel Apple Watch tops out at $1,099. The top-tier Apple Watch Edition runs as much as $17,000.\nBiver said it would be \"ridiculous\" to try to chase Apple, which launched its watch in April.
