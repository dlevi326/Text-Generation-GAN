EnergyCAP will enable the State to measure, track, and report building energy, water, and solid waste in order to increase efficiency, save operating costs, and meet sustainability goals. Presented in 2013, the Governor's Ten Year Action Plan focuses on reducing energy use by 20% in state-owned buildings by the year 2023. In order to meet its goal, the plan includes energy auditing, building retrofits, and energy reporting at the building level through EnergyCAP software. The Department of Administrative Services will manage EnergyCAP for the State. \"We have found EnergyCAP great to work with and are excited to build our utility management program around the EnergyCAP database and reporting capability,\" said Mike Wirkkula, Energy Analyst for Department of Administrative Services. In addition to tracking use and cost for every utility meter, EnergyCAP will measure and verify the dollar savings attributable to energy conservation projects. Each month, EnergyCAP's Bill CAPture service will convert the State's 600 utility bills in PDF or scanned image format and import them into the software database. Two years of historical data will also be converted and imported during the initial implementation. \"This project is proof that Oregon state government is committed to achieving the efficiency and conservation goals in the Governor's Ten Year Plan â€“ they don't just say it, they act,\" said Steve Heinz, Founder and CEO of EnergyCAP, Inc. \"Oregon joins a number of other state governments in establishing energy reduction goals and using EnergyCAP to track their progress.\" State of Oregon's website is http://www.oregon.gov and EnergyCAP's website is http://www.EnergyCAP.com .
