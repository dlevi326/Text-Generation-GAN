For example, the phone isn't directly associated with a specific vehicle and the driver can easily disable or circumvent monitoring apps. In addition, smartphones aren't typically secured or properly mounted, which can result in the reporting of uncalibrated accelerometer data and make it difficult to differentiate between a dropped phone and an actual crash event,\" said Gower. \"The LMU-2010 solution offers the best of both worlds in a cost-effective feature-rich device.\" \nThe LMU-2010 features Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology and pairs seamlessly with the driver's smartphone, eliminating redundant airtime and related logistics costs. Featuring high-precision GPS and an embedded antenna in a small, easy-to-use form factor, the LMU-2010 is almost 50 percent smaller than CalAmp's equivalent cellular-equipped device. Its patented triple axis accelerometer technology with crash-grade accuracy and resolution settings support comprehensive driver behavior monitoring as well as extensive crash detection and discrimination capabilities. In addition, the LMU-2010 can directly monitor vehicle status to enable numerous value-added services such as diagnostics, roadside assistance and predictive maintenance. \nThe LMU-2010 leverages CalAmp's proprietary PEG (Programmable Event Generator), an industry-leading onboard alert engine that continuously monitors a vehicle's environment and responds instantly to predefined threshold conditions such as time, date, motion, location, geo-zone and directly instrumented inputs. It also incorporates CalAmp's PULS (Provisioning/Programming, Update and Logistical System), which is the industry benchmark solution for full lifecycle over-the-air device management and maintenance. \nThe LMU-2010 is currently available for trials and partner integration as well as smartphone application development and verification.
