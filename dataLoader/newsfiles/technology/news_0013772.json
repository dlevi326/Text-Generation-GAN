Authorities have been in contact with some family members of the girl, the official said.\nThe official was not authorized to release details of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nA spokesman for the Suffolk district attorney's office would say only that the investigation remains \"very active.\" A state police spokesman did not immediately return calls Friday.\nThe girl, named Baby Doe by investigators, was estimated to be 4 years old. Her body was found June 25 inside a trash bag on Deer Island in Winthrop by a woman walking a dog.\nPolice immediately appealed to the public for help in identifying the girl. Using photos of her remains, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created a composite image of what the girl might have looked like when she was alive.\nWithin two weeks of the discovery of her body, the image of the chubby-cheeked, brown-eyed girl had tugged on heartstrings around the world. By early July, the image had been liked on the Massachusetts State Police Facebook page by more than 50,000 people and shared more than 615,000 times, reaching an estimated 47 million people.\nAuthorities set up an anonymous text line and were flooded with tips. The tips led authorities to check on the well-being of dozens of little girls but did not lead them to Baby Doe's family.\nDespite the widespread publicity, investigators have been frustrated for months trying to figure out who she was and how she died. There were no obvious signs of trauma to her body. An autopsy performed by the state medical examiner's office did not immediately determine the manner or cause of her death.\nPolice chased down tips from around the world, but experts determined pollen on the girl's blanket and leggings and in her hair came from trees found in New England.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T18:45:29.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
