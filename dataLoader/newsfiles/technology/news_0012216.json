The devices go on sale September 25.\nShares of Apple are up 2.6% in pre-market trading.\nAlong with the new iPhones, Apple introduced an upgrade program that lets customers essentially lease a phone they can keep or trade in for the next model after one year.\nChina is playing a big role in the strong start for iPhone pre-orders, says FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives, citing room for growth with Apple's 15% market share in the region and rising demand for the App Store.\n\"With strong initial pre-sales indications and less than 30% of customers upgrading to the iPhone 6 to date, coupled with this innovative 6s model, we believe the stage is set for Apple to catalyze growth on the heels of this super-cycle product upgrade for the coming quarters,\" says Ives.\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .\n10 CONNECT 39 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1UQQ1qu TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774302639032683-AFP-544034883.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UQQ1qu&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/18b6850ecd1e7c167848c1a095f3c62acd352cdf/r=500x341/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774302639032683-AFP-544034883.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UQQ1qu&text=Apple%3A%20New%20iPhones%20on%20pace%20to%20top%20first-weekend%20sales%20record&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c36e0eaf83cfda85e08635cd289028d0ab612ffe/c=141-0-2973-2129&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774302639032683-AFP-544034883.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1UQQ1qu", "http://twitter.com/brettmolina23"], "published": "2015-09-14T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:51:25.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
