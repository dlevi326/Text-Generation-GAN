A year ago, IBM said it was starting to build apps for Apple gadgets, along with enterprise heavy tools like device management and security.\nRead More Best of Apple, Best of IBM\nWe've been hearing for years about the consumerization of the enterprise, referring to the way business technology is adapting the simpler interfaces and social functions that consumers use while at home and on the move. The most valuable enterprise technology companies, saddled with legacy products and struggling to find growth, are recognizing they need help from Apple, which clearly knows how to make products that people love.\nThe dynamic is changing the enterprise IT market, which Gartner estimates will be $3.5 trillion in spending this year.\n\"Companies like Apple, Amazon and Google bring ease-of-use enterprise deployments,\" said Amit Daryanani , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \"IBM and Cisco don't care what consumers use. They just want to provide the backbone.\"\nDaryanani has a \"buy\" rating on Apple and a \"hold\" on IBM.\nApple-Cisco partnership?\nCisco and Apple announce they will partnering to up device sales to corporate clients.

Legacy tech gets shut out\nWhat Apple and Cisco are actually building together is still a bit vague. The companies said they'll be integrating iOS devices into Cisco's network, and customizing collaboration and video conferencing tools like Cisco WebEx and Telepresence for Apple devices.\n\"Together with Cisco, we believe we can give businesses the tools to maximize the potential of iOS and help employees become even more productive using the devices they already love,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in the statement.\nConsidering Apple's tremendous run in the consumer world and its ongoing effort to win with watches, televisions and in the car while also growing in China, investors could question the company's strategy of taking on the enterprise and potentially losing focus. That's especially true given that corporations are buying Apple devices in droves even without formal partnerships.\nRead More New Apple TV and iPhone coming soon\nDaryanani isn't concerned.\n\"Apple is big enough that the company can go after both channels,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/it-spending-forecast/", "https://www.linkedin.com/pub/amit-daryanani-cfa/2/140/2a3", "http://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1715414", "http://www.webex.com/", "https://www1.good.com/about/press-releases/good-technology-q2-mobility-index-report.html", "https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/07/15Apple-and-IBM-Forge-Global-Partnership-to-Transform-Enterprise-Mobility.html"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:13:38.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
