President and CEO of CT-Payment. “Now, with this integration with the PowaPOS T25 platform, we are enabling more of these ISOs to be able to provide a fully integrated, advanced tablet-based solution to their merchant clients, with ‘plug and pay’ capabilities right out of the box.” \nPowaPOS is the first point of sale platform purpose built for tablet-based payments. Its fully integrated design rids merchants of the need for mismatched peripherals and provides industry-leading ease of set-up. Features include a built in thermal printer, 2D barcode scanner, universal tablet mount, orientation sensor, USB ports, as well as the optional PowaPOS Cash Drawer – all in a sophisticated, compact form factor and powered by a single cord. With its advanced PowaPOS SDK , it is the only tablet-based platform to easily integrate with all POS software applications across all operating systems: iOS, Windows and Android, and is the first to provide merchants with the option to use their choice of payment processor. \n“By integrating CT-Payment into our SDK, our companies have removed the burden from the ISV and ISO of becoming payments experts, and provided them with a value-added service they can use to get their merchants to market faster,” said Jeff Dumbrell, CEO, PowaPOS. “And, with CT-Payment’s Interac certification, we both dramatically simplify the transition to tablet POS that Canadian merchants are seeking; while also ensuring that the most advanced, secure payment processing is available.” \nWith CT-Payment, ISVs and ISOs gain access to Canada’s largest debit- and credit-card processing company to be fully independent of Canadian financial institutions and acquirers. The company is a member of Interac® and an experienced multi-acquirer service provider, offering transaction processing for point-of-sale terminals. Because PowaPOS was designed to work with any operating system and any mobile or tablet-based POS application, reaction from across the payments industry has been overwhelmingly positive. In the short time since the introduction of the PowaPOS SDK, more than 75 ISVs across the globe have successfully integrated their applications.
