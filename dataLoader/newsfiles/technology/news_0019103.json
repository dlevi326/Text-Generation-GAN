(Photo: GoPro Hero4 session, for USA TODAY)\n30 CONNECT 48 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE LOS ANGELES — With Labor Day weekend nearly upon us, millions of Americans are likely to squeeze in a last trip before summer is over.\nThe idea is to disconnect while relaxing, but it’s no surprise technology helps many unwind and make the most of an extended weekend. Whether you’re traveling by air or car, or staying in, here are a few of our must-pack gadgets and apps to bring along.\nTraveling? Check out the Flight Tonight app to plan a spontaneous trip and take advantage of last-minute deals. The iOS app provides travelers who want to find the most affordable flight leaving from a nearby airport in the next 24 hours.\nIf you want to remember your summer vacation years from now, you should invest in something other than your smartphone, especially if your summer vacation involves surfing, mountain biking, kayaking or\nother extreme/outdoor sports. Capture great action shots and video with the GoPro Hero4 Session, the smallest GoPro ever. The $400 camera is waterproof, portable and built tough.\nFor those soaking in some sun, it’s important to know when your skin is most at risk for sun damage. Luckily, you can turn your smartphone into a sun warning system. Wolfram Sun Exposure Reference, $1 on iOS, is a comprehensive app that can predict exactly how long you can stay in the sun before burning and calculates sunburn risks based on your skin type. The app calculates the UV index at that moment for your location.\nWhether you’re on the road or spending some time outdoors, you don’t want cumbersome tech to slow you down. The Karma GO hot spot makes WiFi so simple that you never have to think about connectivity again. Unlike most data plans, Karma’s provides pay-per-use LTE data, with no monthly plans and no charges for data you don’t use — though you can’t put a password on the WiFi network or change its name. Each Karma connection can also be shared with up to eight devices; either your own or the people around you. Best of all, each time someone hops on your Karma, both parties get 100MB of data — you for sharing, them to get started.\nStaying in? Get the party started and your guests in the mood with the Jawbone Big JAMBOX wireless portable speaker. At 2.7 pounds, the $200 speaker promises 15 hours of playback from a single charge, and it pairs easily with your smartphone, laptop or tablet. The superior sound quality will allow you to turn your backyard into a dance party.\nNow that you have the music playing, there's not much better than a barbecue. If you’re looking for a voice-enabled smart grill that can cook a T-bone to perfection, you might want to upgrade to the SmartGrill by Lynx. This is not your father's grill. The 42-inch stainless-steel connected gas grill that automatically cooks foods based on your preference.\nConnect your iOS or Android device, select one of hundreds of recipes from the SmartGrill app, and follow the on-screen instructions, which tell you where to place each item on the grill for the best result, and have everything ready to eat at the same time. It even supports voice commands, and can talk back, telling you when it's time to flip over a steak of perform the next step in a recipe. Just as with any properly grilled chop, there’s a flip side, too, the SmartGrill starts at $6,000.\nShopping. Labor Day weekend means some of the best shopping deals of the year, but forget clipping coupons or browsing through sales on the computer. The real secret weapon for Labor Day shopping success is your smartphone.\nStores change their prices all the time. Paribus is an iOS app that gets you money when prices drop. So if you buy something and it goes on sale later, Paribus automatically gets you the price adjustment.\nJawbone Big JAMBOX (Photo: Jawbone, for USA TODAY)\nRedLaser is an iOS and Android bar code-scanning app that is useful for discount shopping all year round. While you’re at any given store, use your smartphone to scan a product’s bar code and check prices on that item at other retailers. If you discover the store has the best price, or you find the product cheaper somewhere nearby, you’ll feel better knowing you didn’t pay more than you had to on Labor Day.\nFollow USA TODAY contributor Jessica Naziri on Twitter: @jessicanaziri.\n30 CONNECT 48 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1UvwlZ3 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768966644579949-Dane-Jackson-Session.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768968366964908-bigjambox-hires-001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6daacc71264e9dfe99c971267f3fe4b8e2255546/c=1426-0-5174-2818&r=x383&c=540x380/local/-/media/2015/09/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768968366964908-bigjambox-hires-001.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UvwlZ3&text=These%20gadgets%20will%20enhance%20your%20Labor%20Day&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aeceb7556da21dae2f5b0ef8c70e22827fd4c3a8/c=0-0-3000-4000&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/09/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768966644579949-Dane-Jackson-Session.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UvwlZ3&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1UvwlZ3"], "published": "2015-09-04T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:01:55.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
