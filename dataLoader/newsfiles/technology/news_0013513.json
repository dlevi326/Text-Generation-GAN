I would complain to my mother that I would not go school any more as I had to walk for three to four kilometres to reach there every day,\" he recalled, as students of class 11 and 12 listened with rapt attention. \n\"My mother then told me that since I didn't have any other option, I would have to study hard,\" he said. \nThe president also told the students that experiments with ideas of public interest were beneficial for the Indian democracy. \"Indian people are making experiments (with ideas).\" \nReferring to the concepts such as universal voting rights, free and fair voting mechanism, an independent election commission, he said people continue to question if the country had progressed and what more it could achieve. \n\"The powerful instruments are developing as offshoots of this thinking of the civil society, NGOs, social movements,\" he explained. \nRecalling social activist Anna Hazare's public movement, the president said people have the right to question. \"If people feel that the MPs and the governments were not doing their jobs, they cannot sit idle.\" \nAs a lot of youngsters these days are connected to social networking sites, the president said the sites such as Facebook and microblogging site Twitter were \"very powerful\" tools to generate public opinion on issues of public interest.
