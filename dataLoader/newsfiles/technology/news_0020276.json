So far the El Nino is the third strongest on record, behind 1997-98 and a weird one in 1987-88 that peaked early.\nMeteorologists said strong El Ninos usually dump heavy rains on southern California, but its four-year water deficit is too big to be erased in one wet winter.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-10T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:56:29.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
