The equipment will be deployed by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at over 400 airports in the continental U.S. as well as locations outside the continental U.S. \nThe awards are for a base-term of one year that commenced on September 28, 2015, with four one-year options. The first option year was partially exercised immediately. The awards are comprised of delivery orders totaling $15.5 million, which includes the base-term and partial exercise of option year 1, and stipulates delivery of the equipment within 180 days. The awards do not specify or guarantee the exercise of the remaining option years, which total $10.7 million. \nRELM President and Chief Executive Officer David Storey commented, \"This is a landmark win for RELM. We have worked hard to cultivate a relationship with the TSA for many years, building confidence in our products and service through a series of smaller requirements. We are very excited to receive the awards and view this as a signature moment that will further cement the reputation we have already established with our core public safety customers; a reputation for first-class quality, customer service and value. In today's world the mission of the TSA is critical to the safety and security of all Americans. We take that mission very seriously, and the entire RELM team is looking forward to getting started and making the program a huge success.\" \nAbout APCO Project 25 (P25) \nAPCO Project 25 (P25), which requires interoperability among compliant equipment regardless of the manufacturer, was established by the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials and is approved by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
