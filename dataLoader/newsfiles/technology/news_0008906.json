The phones must still be activated by a carrier, the company said in a statement.\nApple’s leap into phone financing gives consumers another option to buy the latest iPhone at a a low monthly cost, similar to offers by Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc., while Apple’s leasing program lets customers upgrade faster.\nThe Upgrade Program could yield a sales boost of 5 million to 7 million more iPhones a year, according to Macquarie Securities USA Inc. analyst Kevin Smithen, who wrote about the possibility of iPhone leasing last week.\nApple will gain more control over the recovery and resale of used iPhones in the U.S. and internationally, and the carriers would be relieved of maintaining inventory of the devices, Smithen said last week.\nThe benefit of leasing is that consumers can trade in their phone for a new one after a year. With financing, consumers end up owning a relatively good phone at the end of a payment period and are less apt to buy a new one, which has put pressure on sales at phone makers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:06:38.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
