Inhance Technology ( www.inhancetechnology.com ) is launching a 21st century solution to reinvent the problematic, low-tech trade-in market. The company today announced the first and only cloud-based smartphone trade-in solution, called “Inhance Trade.” It combines detailed analytics on in-use smartphones, accurate phone valuations and seamless content transfers from old to new phones. It has already gone live with its first U.S. wireless customer in 400 retail chain stores this month. \nInhance Trade starts with a cloud-based dashboard that provides visibility into the installed base of mobile smartphone customers, showing the age, condition and trade-in value of customers’ existing devices. The software also identifies when customers are most likely to buy a new phone and can push in-app mobile notifications directly to their devices, offering them an accurate trade-in deal. \nAfter customers select a new phone, Inhance Trade uses a wireless content transfer feature, which is already being used in more than 2,000 stores to facilitate the quick and secure transfer of contacts, images and videos between phones, including iOS and Android. \nAccording to Inhance Technology CEO Paul Prendergast, this new service will boost the volume of trade-ins by at least 20%. \"Inhance Trade adds a layer of sophisticated mobile analytics that gives carriers and wireless retailers a smarter way to reach out to customers and build connections by offering cash for old mobile phones and new enticing upgrades. \nInhance Technology is working with market-leading trade-in companies including Phobio, C- Exchange and Nextworth, and has recently partnered with electronics distributor Ingram Micro Canada. \nInhance Technology will unveil Inhance Trade for the first time at CTIA, Las Vegas on September 9- 11 booth #3768 (in the Networked Society area).
