The market is expected grow at a CAGR of 9.3% during the forecast period, to reach $5.8 billion by 2020. The growing demand in the Asia-Pacific region is the major driving factor.Asia-Pacific has the largest market for electronics adhesives, followed by North America and Europe. With advanced technological developments for end-users, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to continue its global dominance till 2019.The electronics adhesives market is anticipated to show high growth rate in the coming years. The market is technology-driven and there will be investments for the development of new technology and products. Being part of electronic chemicals and materials, the industry is moving towards consolidation as the major electronic chemicals and materials companies are acquiring other local and foreign players.Electronics adhesives are widely used in the manufacture and assembly of electronic circuits and products. They are used in bonding the surface-mount components, wire tacking, and encapsulating components. The most popular chemistries used in electronic adhesives are acrylics, epoxies, silicones and polyurethanes.The UV curing adhesives are expected to show a fast growth in the coming years. However, electrically conductive and thermal conductive adhesives are the leaders as they act as an alternative to tin-lead solders. The trend towards miniaturization of electronics components has also resulted in more use of adhesives for fastening. In addition, the demand for adhesives in automotive electronics is also growing. Overall advancement in technology and implementation of tighter safety standards will also contribute towards the growth of electronics adhesives market.Companies profiled in the electronics adhesives market report include 3M Corporation, American Chemical Inc., Ashland Inc., Avery Dennison Corporation, Beardow & Adams (Adhesives) Ltd., Bostik Inc., DOW CORNING Corporation, Nordson Corporation, H.B. Fuller, Henkel AG, Huntsman Corporation, Jowat AG and Sika AG. Challenges Volatility in feed stock price, and government regulations on limiting VOC emissions are projected to pose a great threat to global electronics adhesives market in the near future. Primary materials used in manufacturing of electronics adhesives such as polyurethane are mainly petroleum based and hence are very sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil prices.
