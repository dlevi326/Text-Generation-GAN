Continued improvement in U.S. employment conditions could help convince the Fed to raise rates for the first time since 2006.\nSeveral other Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to speak during the week, including Yellen on Wednesday.\n\"Investors are going to be looking at everything. They're going to be looking at every economic number to try and figure out what the Fed is going to do,\" Rick Fier, director of trading at Conifer Securities in New York said.\nNine of the 10 major S&P sectors were lower.

The Dow ended higher.\nAlcoa's shares were up 2.7 percent at $9.32 after the aluminum producer said it would split into two publicly traded companies.\nApple fell 1.8 percent to $112.63 despite reporting that it sold a record number of its new iPhones in the first weekend on the market.\nMedia General soared 23.19 percent to $13.73 after Nexstar offered to buy the company in a deal valued at $4.1 billion.
