Business Insider | 04 September 2015, 10:05 AM IST Share More than 20% of enterprises will have deployed security solutions for protecting their IoT devices and services by 2017, Gartner predicted at its security and risk management summit in Mumbai, India this week.IoT devices and services will expand the surface area for cyber attacks on enterprises, by turning physical objects that used to be offline into online assets communicating with enterprise networks. Enterprises will have to respond by broadening the scope of their security strategy to include these new online devices.Enterprises will need a combination of old and new security solutions and protocols to protect these IoT devices, as many of them will be connected both to online and offline networks, like industrial control systems. This will make securing IoT devices and services a complex task that requires assessing vulnerabilities in both legacy systems and online networks and databases. The number of different types of devices involved in the IoT - with widely varying computing power and memory space to run security software on the devices themselves - will make the task even more complex.Enterprises will have to tailor security to each IoT deployment according to the unique capabilities of the devices involved and the risks associated with the networks connected to those devices, Gartner recommended.

Get two weeks risk-free While this approach of tailoring security for IoT deployments is sound from a security standpoint, it will also likely increase the cost and time it takes for enterprises to deploy IoT devices and services. That may discourage enterprises from taking the necessary steps to defend the vulnerabilities associated with their IoT devices and their backend systems. Enterprises are more likely to take a blanket approach applying the same security to various IoT devices and systems wherever possible, and then filling in remaining vulnerabilities in those devices and systems over time with additional protections. BI Intelligence expects spending on solutions to secure IoT devices and systems to increase fivefold over the next four years.
