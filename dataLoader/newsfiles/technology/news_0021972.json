You will receive an SMS notifying you that you have reached your bundle limit,\" the mobile network explained. \n\"The WhatsApp Bundle wallet will not be consumed for any other data usage outside of WhatsApp. Access to other websites will incur data charges applicable at your normal tariff plan or will deplete from any existing data bundles.\" \nThe bundle is available to post-paid, prepaid and topup customers. \nCell C added that BlackBerry users not on BlackBerry 10 can't take advantage of the bundle. But in another interesting move, WhatsApp Calling isn't included either.
