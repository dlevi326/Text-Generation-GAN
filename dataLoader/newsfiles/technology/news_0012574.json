TECSYS opens European headquarters The Montreal-based supply chain management software provider is expanding its operations to Europe to meet customer demand for its transportation and warehouse management systems. By Eric Johnson | Tuesday, September 22, 2015 The supply chain management software company TECSYS has opened European headquarters, the Montreal-based company said Tuesday. TECSYS, which provides transportation, warehouse and distribution management systems, has also appointed Mark Hawksley to vice president global services and strategic initiatives for Europe. Hawksley has been with TECSYS for 10 years, most recently as vice president professional services, and is already a member of the company’s executive team. TECSYS said customer demand has driven its expansion in Europe, particularly for a global healthcare company. TECSYS said it will also open a U.K.-based customer care support center. “A number of TECSYS' customers today operate in geographically-dispersed multi-site supply chains, many of whom have the need for 24x7 support,” the company said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T04:32:18.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
