The new blowers, designated GDSuG9 146x188, include constant pressure, constant airflow, and standard pressure/airflow models. Constant pressure and constant airflow blowers can provide simple solutions to common air movement problems. Constant pressure blowers automatically adjust speed to maintain the same pressure at varying airflow conditions. This makes them ideal for ducted applications in which the opening or closing of duct vents could significantly impact pressures within the system.\nConstant airflow models maintain the same airflow at varying pressure, such as filtered applications. Filter elements will change in resistance to airflow over time as they become obstructed by dirt and dust. The new blowers’ electronics will detect this and increase motor power to maintain the proper level of airflow performance.\nThe new 146-mm x 188-mm blowers are powered by 150W electronically commutated (EC) motors in both 120 and 230 volt AC input, 50/60 Hz. EC motors allow for easy speed control, long life expectancy and low operating costs. They are UL-Recognized and meet the ErP 2015 efficiency requirements.\nThey run at speeds as high as 1,395 RPM and generate a maximum airflow of up to 529 CFM. They also are very quiet: sound pressure is 59 dB(A) at free air. Standard features include a black-painted steel scroll housing, ball bearings, IP44 protection, G2.5 balancing, Class F winding, and thermal protection. Finger guards are available as options.\nAbout Rosenberg\nThe Rosenberg family of companies is headquartered in Künzelsau, Germany and employs more than 1,000 individuals worldwide. Rosenberg fans and blowers can be found in HVAC systems, as well as industrial and portable air conditioning; in air cooling for variable frequency drives (VFD), wind power generators and power converters, solar inverters, uninterruptable power supplies (UPS), transformers, heat sinks, fan coils, telecom racks and other industrial equipment; in air handling units and fan filter units (FFU); and in railway, marine, military and avionics equipment.\nRosenberg USA is located just outside Charlotte in Indian Trail, N.C.
