The higher dividend will be payable November 16, 2015 , to stockholders of record on October 30, 2015 , contingent upon formal declaration by the board of directors at its regular meeting in October. The board of directors also authorized the company to repurchase an additional $7.5 billion of its common stock over time. This is in addition to approximately $1.8 billion of previously authorized repurchases that remained at the end of June 2015. Dividend increases and share repurchases are both part of TI's capital management strategy. The company has increased dividends each year for the past 12 years, and through consistent share repurchases has reduced outstanding shares by 40 percent since the beginning of 2005. TI continues to invest in growth, having made cumulative R&D investments of $8 billion in the past five years, along with investments in manufacturing equipment to support $6 billion in future growth. The company has gained share in its core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing each year over the same time period.
