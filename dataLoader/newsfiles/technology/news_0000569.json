The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has declared Sept. 27 World Tourism Day to highlight tourism’s power for environmental and social good.\nMany businesses have been proactive in adopting sustainable practices and even in helping frame the SDGs and COP21 goals. They also will be key actors in implementing them. Some travel businesses already are working together to assess and address the industry’s negative impacts, including the 5 percent of global GHG it emits, and to scale up the positive benefits to people and places worldwide.\nIndustry, destination and sustainability leaders met at the Travel and Tourism Collective Impact Summit in Portland this week to further that agenda and to mark the launch of 10 Million Better, an industry-wide effort convened by Sustainable Travel International aimed at improving the lives of 10 million people in destination communities by 2025, while protecting natural and cultural heritage.\nTravel and tourism is a $6.6 trillion industry. Its vast social and environmental footprint also provides enormous opportunity to leverage positive, global-scale change. If the whole industry worked together to adopt more sustainable practices, it no doubt could improve hundreds of millions of lives. But for tourism businesses and destinations to embrace that approach requires a compelling business case.\nFortunately, there’s a strong one. Working proactively and cooperatively to protect the environment and promote social and economic justice through travel and tourism reduces compliance risk and keeps businesses ahead of fast-changing regulations connected to the implementation of the SDGs.\nIt also reduces reputational risk, responds to consumer demand, builds customer loyalty, lowers costs, improves efficiency and employee retention rates, and helps protect destinations beyond the resort walls.\nSurveys show a majority of consumers are willing to pay more for products and services from companies committed to good. Havas’ “Meaningful Brands” report found the that businesses which integrate sustainability outperform others in KPIs by 100 percent, have a 46 percent higher share of wallet and outperform the stock market by 133 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T16:03:20.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
