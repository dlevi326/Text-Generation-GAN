Picture: BLOOMBERG Related articles Mobile operators splash out on networks Foschini | Standard Bank | MTN Companies and organisations: First National Bank | Cell C MTN VOD TELECOMS giant MTN has come out tops as SA’s most valuable corporate brand for a third consecutive year, and was followed by rival service provider Vodacom in second place.\nThis was noted at the announcement of the country’s top 50 corporate brands in Houghton, Johannesburg, on Tuesday.\n\"The reason we recognise these brands is because these brands are who we are, that’s how we express ourselves. But these brands also help to create jobs which keep us gainfully employed,\" said Thebe Ikalafeng, chairman of Brand Finance Africa.\nHe said the 50 brands, with a combined value of R1.5-trillion, came from a study conducted by Brand Finance Africa.\nMTN’s brand value is set at R54bn this year, with Vodacom coming in at second place at R20bn. Sasol scooped third place with R18.2bn.\nMTN’s brand and communications manager Pratiksha Jerison Singh said: \"It (the recognition) actually came as a massive and a welcome surprise, especially during the trying times that we’ve seen recently with the strike … that we’ve been faced with.\"\nShe said getting the top honour would also bolster the morale of MTN staff members, following the recent strike at the company.\nStandard Bank is the highest rated financial institution, coming fourth (R17.5bn), with the financial institution closely followed by FNB (R14.5bn).\nWoolworths is the highest rated retailer (R14.4bn), Castle (R9.3bn) has the highest product rating, while SAA is the only parastatal on the list (R2.6bn).\nWith a brand value of R1.6bn bread and flour company Sasko is last on the list, just below TFG (R1.8bn) and Cell C (R1.9bn).\nNext month Brand Finance Africa is due to release the results of a study of the continent’s top 100 brands.\nRhiannon Rees, an analyst at marketing strategy company Yellowwood, said having a top brands’ list was helpful as it pointed to which businesses to trust.\nMs Rees said that from a professional point of view, it was good to know which companies were the best at what they did. But she was uncertain as to how reflective the list was of consumer perceptions.", "external_links": ["http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=MTN", "http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=VOD"], "published": "2015-09-16T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T13:52:41.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
