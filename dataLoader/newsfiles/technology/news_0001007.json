So I'm interested in why we respond to some appeals and campaigns and not others, and in particular, whether there is anything special about the internet which makes people more or less likely to engage with a campaign. These results suggest that there is not,\" Scott noted. \n\nThe study was published in the journal International Communication Gazette.
