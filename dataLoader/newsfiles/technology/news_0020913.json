President Widodo and his high-level delegation, including Darmin Nasution, Coordinating Minister of Economics of Indonesia, Retno Lestari Priansari Marsud, Indonesian Foreign Minister, and Sofyan Djalil, National Development Planning Minister, inspected the technology-driven efficiencies that support the gateway facility, which has recently maintained its position as the world's most productive port.  \nSultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, DP Chairman, welcomed President Widodo to the (United Arab Emirates) UAE as part of his official visit to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar.\nThe DP World Chairman said: “DP World is a longtime partner of the Indonesian government through their joint-venture in PT. Terminal Petikemas Surabaya (TPS), the largest terminal in Surabaya Tanjung Perak and the second largest in the country.  \n“We are committed to our operations there and look forward to cementing our relationships. With our global experience we work closely with our partners to support the development and economic growth of the countries and communities in which we operate. The President’s visit builds on already existing amicable relations and lasting partnerships that benefit both countries.”\nBin Sulayem added that Dubai’s trade with Indonesia amounted to more than US$1 billion in the first six months of 2015.\nDP World has managed PT Terminal Petikemas Surabaya (TPS) terminal since its acquisition of P&O in 2006. It is a joint-venture with a 51% shareholding held by the state-owned company Pelabuhan Pelindo III and 49% held by DP World.\nFact File: The TPS terminal is located on the northern shore of eastern Java along the edge of Madura Strait and is the gateway to Eastern Indonesia, serving international and domestic trade for a wide-ranging hinterland.\nBy virtue of its geographical location close to cargo catchment areas with good connectivity to the hinterland by sea, rail and direct toll-way access, TPS is ideally located to act as an international and domestic transhipment point for all of Northern and Eastern Indonesia.\nFor all the latest on DP World, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T18:46:12.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
