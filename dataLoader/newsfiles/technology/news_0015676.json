Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 221,000 per month.\nIt was the last major jobs data before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed's policy arm, meets on September 16-17 to mull raising the key federal funds rate for the first time since 2006.\nRichmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker on Friday called the jobs report a strong number, saying that it did not change the picture for monetary policy.\nMany Fed officials, including Fed Chair Janet Yellen, has repeated that it is appropriate to raise the benchmark interest rate this year.\nThe recent world market turmoil, slower global growth and low inflation level in the US, have also left the Fed officials divided over the timing for the first rate hike in almost a decade.\nAt a Brookings event on Thursday, four former Fed economists agreed that the Fed is unlikely to raise short-term interest rate at its September meeting, and all of them expected a rate hike before year-end.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T00:25:34.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
