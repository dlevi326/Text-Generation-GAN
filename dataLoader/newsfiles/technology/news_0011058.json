Below is a list of recent activities from Prodways’ parent company Group Gorgé, which they say proves that this venture is bearing fruit: An international group based in North America, which ordered 3 machines, used in R&D and in production. This group is likely to renew other orders; A European 3D printing expert, which is now equipped with 3 machines; Several “Service Bureaux” have incorporated MOVINGLight technology as an alternative to conventional stereolithography techniques; they include one of the three leading Service Bureaux worldwide; Four key dental companies are using one or more machines for dental model applications, orthodontic devices, R&D, etc.; Several major groups in the aeronautical sector have purchased machines, in particular for R&D applications relevant to engines, with medium-term production prospects; Several R&D institutes have purchased machines and materials to develop new applications; Chemical groups have also purchased machines to explore the possibilities of MOVINGLight technology regarding the use of new materials in 3D printing; The jewellery industry (for which one customer is already using our machines) also has interesting production potential. \nProdways is bringing its MOVINGLight technology to this year’s TCT Show + Personalize (Booth B30), if you register here you might get chance to prise some more information out of the team. If you don’t catch the team in Birmingham Prodways is also exhibiting at this year’s formnext powered by TCT in Frankfurt, November.
