Contactless payment systems have become popular in an increasingly cashless society. Photo: Eddie Jim\nAs internet banking and tap-and-go cards become ubiquitous, Australians are beginning to reject businesses that operate on a cash only basis.\nNew research claims that a quarter of Australians now refuse to use cash-only businesses, while more than half say they find cash-only premises hard to deal with. Previously, processing transactions by card was much slower than paying with cash, but the advent of tap-and-go cards has apparently driven the shift.\nThe research says on average an Australian would save up to 3 hours and 54 minutes of transaction time every month by using tap-and-go compared to inserting a card and entering a PIN.\nPayPal's new device for small businesses and vendors is designed to move them away from cash-only sales. Photo: PayPal\nThe research was conducted by Edelman Berland from a sample of more than 1000 consumers. It was commissioned by PayPal, which has just announced the availability in Australia of its new device that lets vendors in shops or at market stalls accept payments from tap-and-go credit cards or smartphones.\nAdvertisement \"Our support for the 'little guy' is often at odds with our expectation to be able to pay via whichever method we choose. Consumers now expect the same level of technology from their local market stall as they experience at leading retailers\", said PayPal Australia's director of small business Emma Hunt.\nWhile contactless payments are very handy in an increasingly cashless society, concerns have been raised about new forms of fraud arising from tap-and-go's popularity. Earlier this month a parliamentary committee accepted police recommendations that banks give consumers the ability to opt out from contactless cards.\nVictoria Police said the ability to make purchases up to $100 without needing a signature or PIN was driving up the motivation to steal credit cards, and that up to 100 low-value transactions were being made with stolen tap-and-go cards each week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T09:43:13.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
