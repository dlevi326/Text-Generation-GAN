"text": "Japan factory output turns down in July as China demand slumps by Staff Writers Tokyo (AFP) Aug 31, 2015 China Construction Bank H1 net profit flat, hit by bad loans Shanghai (AFP) Aug 31, 2015 - China Construction Bank (CCB), one of the country's biggest state banks, said net profit for the first half of the year were flat, hit by rising bad loans.\nThe bank's net profit for the January-June period rose just under one percent year-on-year to 131.90 billion yuan ($20.64 billion), the bank said late Sunday, just a fraction higher than the 130.66 billion yuan for the same period last year. \nAt the same time, its bad loans rose to 144.40 billion yuan by the end of June, implying a non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of 1.42 percent, said the statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange, where it is listed. \nThe ratio was up by almost a fifth from the 1.19 percent at the end of last year. \n\"As economic growth slows down and certain businesses and industries suffer operational difficulties, the banking industry comes under pressure for maintaining asset quality,\" the bank said. \nChina's economy grew 7.0 percent in each of the first two quarters, slowing from a 7.4 percent expansion last year, which was its weakest since 1990. \nCCB said interest rate reform in China will also affect its performance in the second half as it brings greater competition. \nEarlier this month, China allowed interest rates for fixed deposits of more than one year to float freely though other deposit rates are still set based on guidelines from the central bank. \nThe government already allows banks to set their own lending rates, and banks say the moves towards greater liberalisation have cut into their profits. \nCCB shares fell 2.92 percent by lunch in Shanghai Monday, although they were up 0.37 percent in Hong Kong. \nChina's other \"Big Four\" state-owned banks have reported similar results for the first half. \nThe Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country's biggest bank, on Thursday reported a less than one percent year-on-year rise in net profit to 149.02 billion yuan for the first half. \nAgricultural Bank of China, which has traditionally served rural areas of China, said its net profit for the first half rose 0.3 percent to 104.32 billion yuan. \nBank of China (BOC), the country's main foreign exchange bank, said Friday net profit increased 1.14 percent year-on-year to 90.75 billion yuan in the first six months. \nJapan's factory output contracted a worse-than-expected 0.6 percent on-month in July, official data showed on Monday, owing to lacklustre demand at home and as a slowdown in China weighs on exports. \nThe reading published by the industry ministry was weaker than the median forecast for a modest 0.1 percent rise in a survey of economists by Bloomberg News. \nIn June, industrial production rose 1.1 percent from May. \nProduction cutbacks in the electrical components and transport equipment industries led the decline in manufacturing, according to the government, as firms tried to cut down on an inventory buildup. \n\"Production is sluggish because private consumption and exports remain weak,\" Toru Suehiro, an economist at Mizuho Securities, told Bloomberg News. \n\"Concern about China and emerging economies is posing a risk to output.\" \nJapan's overseas shipments have slowed, raising concerns about the fragile recovery in the world's number three economy as demand falls in neighbouring giant China. \nChina-bound shipments were off 1.3 percent in July from 12 months earlier in volume terms, outstripping a 0.4 percent fall to the rest of Asia. \nDespite a recovery in the US economy, a slowdown in China -- Asia's top economy and a major market for Japanese exporters -- has raised a red flag. \nJapan's economy contracted in the three months to June, boosting speculation the central bank will be forced to unleash more stimulus as Tokyo's \"Abenomics\" growth blitz stumbles. \nBank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said in New York last week that weakness in production and exports would pass and that leading indicators point to a pick up in business investment. \nBut \"the drop in industrial production in July suggests that economic activity will recover only slowly this quarter\", Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a commentary. \nAlso Monday, a survey released with the production data showed that manufacturers expected output in September would fall 1.7 percent after growth of 2.8 percent in August. \nHowever, Thieliant noted that firms tend to be \"too optimistic\" about future production. \nThe factory output data came after separate figures on Friday showed core inflation, excluding volatile fresh food prices, was flat year-on-year, as lower fuel and other energy costs weighed on Tokyo's battle to push up prices. \nHousehold spending also fell 0.2 percent in July after declining 2.0 percent in the previous month, the ministry said. \nThe two monthly drops followed a strong rise of 4.8 percent in May that offered some hope for spending after consumers snapped their wallets shut in the wake of a sales tax hike last year. \nThe consumption levy rise -- Japan's first in 17 years -- was aimed at taming a huge national debt but it slammed the brakes on consumer spending and pushed the economy into a brief recession. .",
