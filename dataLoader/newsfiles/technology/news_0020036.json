Archive Systems was named in the Digital HR Document Management solutions category, which Gartner defines as \" Digital HR document management tools enable enterprises to effectively store, access and manage HR documents while complying with multijurisdictional regulatory requirements for security and retention. Common functions include multilevel security, document tagging to enable search, notification and approval workflows, and robust auditing/traceability. Typically, these solutions integrate with core HR systems, but they may also link to other human capital management (HCM) apps and identity management solutions.”\nSince last year, Digital HR Document Management solutions such as FileBRIDGE for HR have matured and adoption is rising, thus the category is moving up the Hype Cycle.\nAccording to Gartner Research Director, Ron Hanscome , “digitization of HR documents can result in productivity savings of 15% or greater due to the time saved searching for information versus manually responding to information requests or compliance audits, and the delivery of secured access to data to HR staff to support HR processes.”\nRon goes on to state, “full compliance with complex document retention and storage requirements also has the potential for substantial additional savings due to avoiding both fines and potential litigation.”\nArchive Systems’ FileBRIDGE for HR integrates with an organization’s human capital management (HCM) and other information systems to link employee data to employee documents. It delivers a highly secure, collaborative environment with robust workflow, auditing/traceability, and information governance and policy compliance.\nClients benefit from dramatic efficiency gains in onboarding new employees, tracking job certifications and program elections, as well as overall human resources document administration.\nFileBRIDGE for HR also enables documents to be securely shared with internal and external stakeholders with audited links that automatically expire, and secure data rooms for bulk document reviews and audits.\n“We believe having been named as a sample vendor by Gartner is additional confirmation of the value that FileBRIDGE for HR brings to our customers,” said Gordon Rapkin , Archive Systems CEO. “In the past year we have delivered monthly client-driven product releases across all of the FileBRIDGE products. Most notably was the release of myFileBRIDGE a new HR Service Delivery component that brings self-service and kiosk access directly to employees and managers, eliminating many of the HR department’s time consuming tasks. The impact on our customers productivity and efficiency has been gratifying to see.”\n“Employees are empowered, Human Resources personnel are spending less time on mundane tasks, and instead focusing on key business initiatives. Internal document processes have been streamlined, thus giving employees and managers ownership in areas that affect them.”\nGartner, Hype Cycle for Human Capital Management Software, 2015, Jeff Freyermuth, Ron Hanscome, Yvette Cameron, Helen Poitevin, 04 August 2015\nGartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.
