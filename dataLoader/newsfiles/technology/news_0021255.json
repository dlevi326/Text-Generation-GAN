That conclusion was wrong,” the statement said.\nAvid Life Media said the male to female ratio of its clients is 1.2 to one.\nA hacker group calling itself the “Impact Team” earlier this month released information stolen from the company’s servers, as well as corporate emails and sensitive computer source code.\nGizmodo looked at the data and said it showed little if any activity from the purported 5.5 million female members of Ashley Madison, who were online with an estimated 31 million male subscribers.\nIt concluded that the vast majority of profiles of women on Ashley Madison were fake, or created by automated “bots.”\nGizmodo traced many of the IP addresses for females back to Ashley Madison itself.\nThe most popular female last name on the site also matched the name of a former employee.\nFirst Published on August 31, 2015 11:30 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T08:52:03.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
