Insight+ creates the ability to efficiently consider test and computer-aided engineering (CAE) data together to assist engineers in better understanding NVH contributions early in the design process. \n\"We are very excited about our partnership with Altair,\" said Alun Crewe, Vice President, Strategic Marketing at Brüel & Kjær. \"The combination of Altair's simulation tools and the capabilities in Brüel & Kjær's solutions creates an effective environment for subjective evaluation of vehicle NVH early in the vehicle design process. CAE analysts, NVH Evaluation teams and other decision makers, who may not be NVH experts, will be able to evaluate NVH design proposals at virtual prototype stage in the context of driving the final product. This enables improved, value-based decision-making, reduces the number of physical prototypes, ensures 'right first time' engineering and reduces time to market.\" \nInsight+ allows users to test and evaluate source strengths and transfer functions and contributions on a system level, taking into account an entire vehicle's interactions with its environment. The software makes it possible to listen to and analyze proposed engineering changes in the appropriate context in order to evaluate and rank design alternatives to assist NVH test and CAE engineers in sharing and developing ideas. \n\"Altair is thrilled to be adding Brüel & Kjær's software to its NVH portfolio,\" said David Mason, Vice President, Global Automotive at Altair. \"The powerful capability of Insight+ to evaluate NVH testing and simulation data together, especially listening to the result, will enhance our customers' ability to make critical decisions earlier in the design process.\" \nWhile mostly applicable in the automotive industry, Insight+ can help anticipate inadequate NVH conditions during the design process of any vehicle, resulting in quiet and comfortable experiences for all passengers and drivers. \nAltair will also be presenting at the Brüel & Kjær Sound and Vibration Conference today and will discuss the partnership and how the software complements the HyperWorks suite. \nTo learn more about Brüel & Kjær and Insight+, register for the introductory webinar taking place October 6, 2015 at 9 a.m. EDT and 1 p.m. EDT , or visit the Brüel & Kjær solution page . \nAbout the Altair Partner Alliance \nAltair's HyperWorks platform applies a revolutionary subscription-based licensing model in which customers use floating licenses to access a broad suite of Altair-developed, as well as third-party, software applications on demand.
