Allen Stanford Ponzi scheme “is a fair settlement amount.”\nU.S. District Judge David Godbey on Wednesday rejected claims by some of the victims that $40 million is not nearly enough in a financial fraud that cost investors $7 billion.\nThe average victim in the investment scheme will receive $1,500 as part of this agreement, according to court documents.\nStanford, a former Houston investment banker, was convicted in 2012 of wire and mail fraud and is serving a 110-year prison sentence. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a $6.7 billion disgorgement order against his financial institution, Stanford International Bank.\nLawyers appointed to recover money for the estimated 20,000 victims say the BDO settlement provides a precedent that will lead to additional settlements from other businesses that worked with Stanford and profited from his illegal activities.\nThe original lawsuit against BDO claimed the Chicago-based accounting firm’s “cozy relationship” with Stanford contributed to the fraud.\nBDO claimed in court documents that it never knew about and was never involved in any of Stanford’s illegal activities.\nThe San Antonio-based lawyers who handled the case on a contingency fee arrangement will receive 25 percent of the $40 million — or $10 million. The lawyers estimate they have spent about $2.7 million litigating the dispute during the past six years. If they had lost the case, they would have been paid nothing.\nFor a longer version of this article, visit TexasLawbook.net.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:47:58.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
