You may need to keep records of personal conversations made over the last 90 days and furnish them as and when demanded by law enforcement agencies, a move that cyber experts say completely violates an individual's right to privacy. \n\nThe draft national encryption policy - for which public comments are being sought till October 16 - puts the onus not only on private citizens, but also on government institutions (save for those engaged in sensitive and strategic roles), public sector undertakings and private business establishments to maintain separate records. Unencrypted records, say cyber experts, will leave much of the critical data of the government as well as business establishments vulnerable and at the mercy of hackers and foreign intelligence agencies. \n\nHowever, the department of electronics and information technology (Deity) thinks otherwise and says the policy is being worked out to ensure a more secure environment for the government, businesses and citizens. It says the vision of the draft policy is \"to enable information security environment and secure transactions in cyber space for individuals, businesses, government, including nationally critical information systems and networks.\" \n\nREAD ALSO: Deleting WhatsApp, Google Hangouts messages could become illegal in India \n\nThe policy proposes a series of government-controlled encryption measures for various kinds of electronic communications, while also asking the users to keep non-encrypted records of the same. It also says that encryption technology for storage and communications will be specified by the government. \n\nFor example, in case of citizen-to-citizen conversations, it says, \"Users within the group may use encryption for storage and communication. Encryption algorithms and key sizes will be prescribed by the government through notification from time to time. All citizens, including personnel of government/business performing non-official/personal functions, are required to store the plain texts of the corresponding encrypted information for 90 days from the date of transaction and provide the verifiable plain text to law and enforcement agencies as and when required as per the provision of the laws of the country.\" \n\nFor government and business communications, it prescribes similar procedures and says that \"protocols and algorithms for encryption, key exchange, digital signature and hashing will be as specified through notification by the Government from time to time.\" \n\nSurprisingly, the draft also says that service providers (located within and outside India) who use encryption technology - such as the various popular instant messengers like WhatsApp, Viber and Facebook - must enter into an agreement with the government. \n\n\"The draft policy is counter-productive to its proposed objectives. It also has grave ramifications on the digital rights and liberty and privacy of private individuals,\" cyber law advocate Pavan Duggal told TOI. \"You are stripping people of their expectations from a private space in electronic communications which is a complete violation of the right to privacy and the right to life.\" \n\nREAD ALSO: Draft National Encryption Policy put up online for public comment, experts worried \n\nHe also said that India's cyber security could be left vulnerable by the proposals as most of the crucial business and government data will need to be stored in unencrypted form to produce to the law enforcement agencies whenever demanded. \"Huge powers are being given to the state without appropriate checks and balances.\" \n\nThe registration of the service providers with the government will lead to a \"license raj\" era, Duggal added. \n\nPranesh Prakash from the Centre for Internet and Society also criticized the measure. \"It hampers the privacy of individuals. But the larger concern is that the policy does not end up in protecting national security, but rather harms it,\" Prakash said. \"It leaves us more vulnerable to foreign espionage and hackers, which is a big problem.\" \n\nOnline activist Nikhil Pahwa said that the draft policy, while making it easier for law enforcement agencies to intervene, ends up compromising the security of citizens. \"We all have messages and information that we want to keep secure, and this is legal. So why shouldn't we be able to keep that information private, away from the prying eyes of government officials?\" \n\nPahwa also raises the fear of the data being compromised at the hands of hackers and foreign intelligence agencies. \"There is also a possibility that the 'plaintext' data can be manipulated by hackers, or a government official with encryption keys can manipulate the stored data. How will an individual be protected against such attacks? An individual's right to privacy is a fundamental right under article 21.\" \n\nSurprisingly, while the government wants citizens to give their views on the subject, it is near impossible to find the draft on the home page of deity's website http://deity.gov.in/ \n\nFor those of you who are keen to send the views, here is the link to the draft (http://deity.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/draft%20Encryption%20Policyv1.pdf) which can also be accessed by going into the cyber laws section after clicking into the 'Divisions' icon on the home page of Deity. \n\nTimes View \n\nIt is obviously quite ridiculous to expect individual users of encrypted communication services like Whatsapp or Blackberry to store any messages they receive or send for 90 days. It is not practical and is an undue infringement of their freedom to delete messages they don't want to retain. We hope that this provision has crept into the draft policy due to an error and does not reflect the actual intent of the government. It is certainly a provision that must be dropped from the final version of the policy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T05:16:53.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
