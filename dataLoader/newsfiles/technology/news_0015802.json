The German additive manufacturing leader plans to exhibit a comprehensive machine concept under the title of “AM Factory of Tomorrow” along with the entire process chain of additive production. \nConcept Laser says the concept is about “intelligent networking of machines, a high level of automation and incorporating system technology into the production environment”. The AM Factory of Tomorrow is based around a decentralised approach to manufacturing with regional centres and service providers positioned across the globe. It also focuses on increasing productivity and exploiting the digital potential for industrial process and system design through three key areas; digital networking of systems, integration into the production environment and automation of processes. \n\"It is high time that the industrial dimension of additive manufacturing was revealed,” Frank Herzog, CEO & President and founder of Concept Laser, explained. “Great steps forward have been taken with build rates, process configuration and quality assurance. Now, users are focusing on digital networking and automation. And we're planning to address these points specifically at the formnext powered by TCT.\" \nIn addition to the new system concept, the company will also present the entire process chain of metal 3D printing from design, to production and quality insurance. The QMmeltpoool 3D will also be on show along with the M2 cusing multilaser and Mlab cusing machines. \nFrank, added: “Build rates have increased enormously with multilaser technology. The build envelope sizes have increased remarkably. Now, we intend to use an integrated system concept to show what possibilities exist for \"Industry 4.0\" approaches to change additive manufacturing as the production strategy for the future. There is a whole host of potential for boosting flexibility and the created value.\" \nformnext powered by tct takes place on 17-20 th November 2015 in Hall 3, Frankfurt Exhibition Centre, Germany.
