Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great. — President Obama (@POTUS) September 16, 2015 \nAs the #IstandwithAhmed hashtag trended on social media, many commentators also slammed the school’s response as racial profiling at its worst, as Ahmed — who said he innocently brought the clock to class to impress his teacher — was Muslim. \nIn a rant on Facebook , Ms Palin said Ahmed’s arrest was completely reasonable and school officials were justified for thinking the device, make out of a pencil box, was an explosive. \n“Yep, believing that’s a clock in a school pencil box is like believing Barack Obama is ruling over the most transparent administration in history,” she wrote, also sharing pictures of her kids’ pencil boxes. \n“Right. That’s a clock, and I’m the Queen of England.” Ahmed Mohamed, 14, with his homemade device at his home in Irving, Texas.

Kids humiliated and intimidated for innocent actions like those real examples are often marked the rest of their lives and made to feel really rotten. I expect they will have more to say tomorrow, but Ahmed's sister asked me to share this photo.

You need to show them your talent.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T14:30:01.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
