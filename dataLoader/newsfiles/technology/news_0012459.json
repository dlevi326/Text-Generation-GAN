As a CIO, how are you implementing new technologies like SMAC and what are the business benefits that you expect from them? Any IT initiatives be it SMAC or otherwise need to be justified on business benefits for implementation and adoption. Projects on Mobility are justified based on those applications that impact the business on productivity, agility, cost reduction or opportunity creation. If an interactive information by a sales executives help in pushing few more units, ROI is attained. Similarly, through Social networking the organization can be much close to the customer. Media spent can be sizably reduced if the products are promoted through social media. Speed of feedback brings agility in fine-tuning marketing strategy through usage of social medium. What are some of your key areas of concern as a consumer of technology? The main concern is the sustenance of any initiative. The second is the availability of network. Today even in metros continuous availability of 3G is a question leave alone semi urban or rural areas. The business ask from IT has changed in the past-half decade. Are CIOs equipped to handle the response adequately? CIOs need to be proactive in bringing new technologies to the business instead of being reactive. Perfect alignment of IT strategy to business and ability to predict what business will ask for is the key. What are your key IT priorities this year and what will be the major changes that you will drive from these IT solutions? Our key initiatives will be around further compressing product development time, introducing M2M & IoT in manufacturing for automation, process control and traceability, going closer to customer through mobility, digital marketing and social media are the priorities. Further enhancement in analytics and use of Bigdata in manufacturing are also on agenda. Based on your expertise, what ROI would you recommend to people evaluating a cloud solution? Cloud should make sense to the business. It is easier to adopt cloud if the processes are standardized or if it's a green field organization. ROI calculation becomes complex for existing organization where the investment on IT is already substantial. More than ROI, it is the strategy of the business to go in or not for the cloud as I thing Cloud is also subject matter of solicitation. Cloud over MPLS or cloud over internet- what's your take? It is contextual. For spread organization like sales or service internet will work whereas cluster of users in one roof like manufacturing MPLS will be the answer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T11:01:40.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
