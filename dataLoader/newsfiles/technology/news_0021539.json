And more than half of that time (55 per cent) was spent on mobile devices rather than computers. \nBritons used their smartphones to surf the web for one hour and nine minutes a day, and used tablet devices for 26 minutes, according the research by the Internet Advertising Bureau and the UK Online Measurement Company. \nOur top priority is checking up on friends and family on social media websites such as Facebook. We now devote nearly half an hour a day to social media – around a sixth of the time we spend online, up from an eighth two years ago. \nBritons also spent around 6 percent of their time online playing computer games, up from 3 percent. \nThe survey only measured ‘active’ internet usage and did not take account periods where someone had a web browser open but was working on something else. – Daily Mail Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:25:39.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
