The unit, into which Ola will initially invest 5 billion rupees, will lease the cars and give drivers the option to own them after three years, it said.\nBoth Ola, which counts billionaire Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group among its investors, and Uber have been taking steps to expand their presence in India where public transportation services in most cities and towns haven’t kept pace with the needs of a growing population. While Ola acquired smaller rival TaxiForSure in March, Uber in July said it would spend $1 billion to fan out to more cities in the country.\n“This is nothing but a means of scaling up our supply as the existing inventory isn’t enough,” Rahul Maroli, vice president for strategic supply initiatives, said in a telephone interview from Bengaluru referring to the leasing program. “We’re trying to make it as attractive for our drivers as possible, as loans are much more expensive.”\nThe cars leased to drivers will operate exclusively for Ola customers, Maroli said. The drivers will have an option to make daily payments that may be as little as 800 rupees, he said.\nThe subsidiary will seek to raise 45 billion rupees from “multiple sources” to fund its leasing program, Maroli said, without providing a time frame.\nOla, which expects 10,000 cars under the leasing program by December, is in talks with automakers including Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. to buy cars for the leasing program and will focus primarily on compact hatchbacks such as the Maruti Ritz and Mahindra Verito Vibe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T04:21:43.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
