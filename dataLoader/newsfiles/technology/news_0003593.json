He said, 'No, I'm tired.'\"\nWhereupon Noah asked him the big question: What was his stance on Noah as his successor?\nStewart's reply, according to Noah: \"Who do you think suggested you?\"\nA month later, he was tapped by Comedy Central.\n\"Then the whirlwind started,\" Noah laughs.\nWithin hours, a handful of Noah's old tweets resurfaced, lousy jokes that targeted women, Jews and Ebola virus victims. A social media firestorm erupted with the press fanning the flames.\n\"To reduce my views to a handful of jokes that didn't land is not a true reflection of my character, nor my evolution as a comedian,\" Noah tweeted in response.\n\"It's not like it didn't affect me, or hurt me,\" he says now, a lean, baby-faced presence clad in jeans, T-shirt and running shoes. \"But I understood it, which helped me get over it.\"\nDefying social-media admonishments, Noah argues that a smattering of dumb tweeted jokes, like anything unearthed from a person's digital past, serves usefully as evidence of what that person may have been and, more importantly, has moved beyond.\n\"Should we erase our history because someone will judge us by that now, in the present?\" poses Noah, and says no. \"I think history is a reminder of what not to repeat.\"\nThe uproar (including speculation that Noah might be pitched overboard) quickly subsided, but not before the story had been covered to death and, says Noah, too often driven by hearsay.\n\"It was a beautiful baptism of fire,\" he says. \"What better way to learn the purpose of my new job than to be at the epicenter of many of the problems of how the media covers news?\"\nROOTS OF NOAH'S HUMOR\nCertainly, Noah's new job is to quarterback the \"Daily Show\" truth squad as it lampoons news makers and the media that cover them in the context of the serious business of the comically fake newscast.\n\"Comedy is a very powerful tool,\" says Noah. \"The truest things are said in jest.\"\nHe jests from the standpoint of someone born to a black mother and a white father 10 years before apartheid ended (\"I was born a crime,\" he sums up) whose mother had to walk ahead of him as a toddler, pretending not to know him if she saw the police.\n\"I come from a crazy place,\" he says. \"When I was 25, my mother was shot in the head by my stepfather, an abusive alcoholic. I was so, so angry. But the first thing she said to me after she came out of the hospital was, 'You need to learn to forgive. Then you'll be setting yourself free.'\"\nHe found a certain freedom in comedy, which he pursued, he says, not to vent his spleen, as with many comedians, \"but because I made people laugh.\"\nA man of mixed race and a stormy childhood, he saw himself as a perpetual outsider. But he made himself at home globally, including the United States, where he toured comedy clubs and landed TV appearances (including \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" and \"Late Show with David Letterman\").\nFrom the beginning, he joked about things that were on his mind, but even when they touched on painful social issues he was never fueled by anger, he insists. Nor is he now.\n\"I come from a country where everything that happened was impossible! A place where there was a bloodless revolution, where Nelson Mandela, let out of jail after 27 years, made peace with his persecutors. And now I have an almost delusionally optimistic view of America. I see a lot of progress here. I see a lot of hope.\n\"It's often difficult to see progress when you look at it one day at a time,\" he muses. \"Like with a workout regime: Take a picture today, then take another picture not tomorrow or the next day, but after six or eight weeks. That will show you how far you've come.\"\nMaybe that's Noah's way of saying that to size him up as host after his first night, or his first week, can't address how far he plans to go.\nNonetheless, he has no doubts the media will pronounce an instant verdict. With their insatiable appetite for content, they treat each passing moment as a potential milestone, however specious it may be.\nSo Noah, reconciled to the foibles of the media, and eager to lampoon them for it, appears calm as he prepares for opening night.\nBut don't think he won't feel terrified, he says, \"the same way I feel now. I'm having nightmares! It's terrifying, it really is. But it's also extremely exciting. I'm trying to enjoy every moment of it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:02:40.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
