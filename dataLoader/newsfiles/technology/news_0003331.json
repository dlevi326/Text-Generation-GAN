(Hexis), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The KEYW Holding Corporation, and a provider of advanced cybersecurity solutions for commercial companies and government agencies, today announced that HawkEye G has been selected by Goodwill ® Industries of Greater NY and Northern NJ, Inc. for advanced threat detection and automated response. The organization is comprised of forty retail stores, four Attended Donation Centers, thirty program sites and three campuses with a cluster of offices. \nIndustry experts agree that traditional solutions like anti-virus and network perimeter are necessary solutions, but are not solely effective at detecting and stopping advanced threats. Security teams are struggling to properly handle the overwhelming influx of data and threat alerts, coupled with tight IT budgets and limited security personnel. Organizations can effectively and efficiently protect their network through a layered security approach to be actively positioned to defend themselves against attacks. \n“Companies, particularly those in the retail sector, are under constant attack from hackers, which means continuous monitoring, threat validation and immediate response is required,” said Chris Fedde, President at Hexis. “HawkEye G provides the benefits of adopting a comprehensive security strategy that incorporates detection, verification, and response capabilities while leveraging automation to increase security effectiveness and efficiency.” \nIn collaboration with Patriot Technologies Inc., a Hexis Cyber Solutions channel partner, Goodwill NYNJ selected HawkEye G to not only look at network traffic, but to also install host sensors on each endpoint. HawkEye G can detect and analyze even the smallest changes that occur on endpoints, verifying and eliminating malicious threats almost instantaneously. This can all be achieved without having to power down or lose the endpoint even temporarily for the repair – a huge requirement for retail organizations that rely on their point of sale systems to constantly generate income. HawkEye G also leverages real-time eventing to keep a record of every action, allowing security professionals to analyze attacks and create defenses against future assaults, all while the software does the heavy lifting. \n“Patriot Technologies Inc. is excited to team with a nonprofit organization like Goodwill NYNJ in order to bolster its cybersecurity initiatives with HawkEye G to keep their enterprise secure,” said Dewayne Adams, CTO at Patriot Technologies Inc. \nFor 100 years, Goodwill NYNJ has empowered individuals with disabilities and other barriers to employment to gain independence through the power of work. Today, with headquarters in Astoria, NY, the nonprofit human service organization serves individuals with all types of disabilities, children and youth at risk, unskilled and mature workers, U.S. veterans, welfare applicants and recipients, and any person with challenges to find work. Sales proceeds from Goodwill stores help to fund its programs. Goodwill NYNJ is one of 165 independent Goodwills nation-wide. \n“This security technology brings me peace of mind,” Andre Bromes, CIO at Goodwill NYNJ said. “HawkEye G mitigates threats at machine speed, whereas before it might take someone hours to analyze a single threat from one attack. And because HawkEye G is quickly eliminating threats, there is no danger of an analyst getting distracted by nuisance or decoy attacks designed to let a real threat slip through.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:06:22.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
