The Japanese had a big heart but they were clearly the underdogs and no match for the might and strength of the Springboks.\nAs I watched the game, the Boks were in disarray. It was clear that the Boks had no structure and their only intention was to 'moer' the Japanese.\nThe Japanese on the other hand, had a clear plan and they were determined to win. The Japanese performance was so great that we thought we were watching anime. But this was the reality and the wake-up call we needed to bounce back. So what went wrong in this instance?\nHere are my 2 main thoughts\n1. No development\n Many of the pro Heyneke Meyer supporters may say something about this but where are the fresh faces in today's squad. We have way too many players past its sell-by date. Players like Jean de Villiers, Ruan Pienaar and Victor Matfield should be playing cameo roles at their age. The Rudy Paige selection is also another issue that wouldn't have reared its ugly head if the right people were selected ( such as Faf de Klerk and Cobus Reinach).\nJuan de Jongh, Elton Jantjies, Warren Whitely are fresh modern players who would have made a difference. Yet, this coach just kept on selecting old players who had seen and won everything so they were not motivated at all. This became a problem when Heyneke selected overseas players.\nAlthough the argument was that Rugby is a global game, this stunted the growth of local talent and hence we really have a squad and not a squad that can convince us that we were world beaters.\n2. No plan\n\"If you fail to plan, you plan to fail...\" As Jake White stated when he plotted his success to the World Cup. Many Heyneke supporters may have this excuse of inheriting Peter de Villier's mess, but Rudolph Straeuli's mess was worse and while Jake White fixed the mess, Heyneke just continued with the mess.\nThere was no warm-up game, no experts drafted into the Bok squad. Heyneke had no plan in his squad selection, hewas not willing to experiment and his tactics were too predictable. It was clear Eddie Jones out-thought him. While Heyneke's game plan may have worked in the 80s, it was only a matter of time before figured it out.\nWell, let's hope that the Boks start playing rugby or else, it will be an early exit to hell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:11:58.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
