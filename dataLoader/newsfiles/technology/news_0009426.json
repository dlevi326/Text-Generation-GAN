These regulations were effective immediately, and potentially will have a dramatic impact on marketing nationwide. \nThese new regulations mean that companies must re-evaluate their marketing and collection practices to prevent violations and mitigate compliance risk. In the long run, it will pay off for companies to invest in verification and to implement outbound dialing strategies that are data driven. \nIn a recent infographic , Neustar , a real-time information services and analytics company, highlights what businesses need to know to avoid the dark cloud of costly TCPA violations and mitigate TCPA compliance risk. \nCompliance challenges are greater today as a result of connected, on-the-move consumers. Every year, some 2.1 million people legally change their names; 16 million people change addresses; 45 million people change at least part of their contact information; and 75 million people change phone carriers. \nNoncompliance or violation of the TCPA guidelines is expensive. Fines per unsolicited call, text message, or facsimile range between $500 and $1,000 and lawsuits can cost tens of millions of dollars. In 2014, TCPA violations were the top complaint to the FCC, and 2,336 lawsuits were filed. \nBy ensuring TCPA compliance, companies will build trust with their customers. The recent history of violations has led to an environment of distrust, with 91 percent of American adults believing that consumers have lost control over how companies collect and use their personal data, and 40 percent of consumers taking steps to avoid online observation. \nBy rebuilding trust, your company can retain control over customer data that can help improve brand loyalty and ultimate result in higher revenues. \nAs the infographic concludes, “the TCPA’s new regulations mean companies must carefully consider their marketing and collections strategies, but doing so pays off in dividends by implementing data-driven outbound dialing strategies and investing in verification. Reaching the right person is more than a legal TCPA best practice; it’s an investment in your operational effectiveness and brand reputation.” Like what you are reading?
