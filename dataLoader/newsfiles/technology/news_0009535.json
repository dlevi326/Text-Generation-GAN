High-def media and game streaming are big in the living room. The popularity of things like Netflix can't be understated, but a new breed of set-top boxes, including Nvidia's Shield, can stream the visuals and controls of a game running on a different computer to your TV screen. Naturally, you need enough Internet bandwidth to do this smoothly.\nSo, if your ISP can provide enough bandwidth, but you can't afford to run Ethernet cables everywhere, Asus may have an answer with its RT-AC5300 wireless router. Claimed to be the world's fastest, the AC5300 supports the latest 802.11ac standard, and has a max throughput of a whopping 5333Mbps - which it does so through eight antennae, also affording it the \"widest-ever\" wireless coverage of 500 square meters. \nThe RT-AC5300 is a tri-band router, and, with Broadcom's XStream technology, can apparently combine its 2.4Ghz band (1Gbps) with its two 5Ghz bands (2.17Gbps each) to get that 5.33Gbps number over one SSID. Naturally, the router is also backwards-compatible with the b (11Mbps), a/g (54Mbps), and n (600Mbps) WiFi standards. \nOther specs include the usual one WAN and four LAN ports on the back, the latter of which are all Gigabit. Two of the LAN jacks can be combined to produce a 2Gbps wired connection, according to Asus. There are also one each of USB 3.0 and 2.0; and the device uses 256MB of DDR3 RAM and a 128MB ROM internally. \nAsus hasn't mentioned pricing or availability for its RT-AC5300 yet, but it will apparently begin hitting stores sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:20:09.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
