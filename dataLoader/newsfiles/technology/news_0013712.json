As a global supplier of analog and mixed-signal solutions for automotive, industrial, medical, information technology and consumer applications, ZMDI is pleased to introduce a state-of-the-art sensor signal conditioner (SSC) capable of measuring full or half resistive bridge sensor signals and internal or external temperature sensors with analog output. With overvoltage reverse battery protection of ±40V, the ZSSC4151 is truly one of the most robust sensor signal conditioners available in the market today. With over 50 years of industry leadership, ZMDI has developed the ZSSC4151 as the first derivative of the new ZSSC415x Family within ZMDI’s existing ZSSC416X/ZSSC417X family of automotive SSCs, referred to as ZMDI’s Next Generation Platform ICs. ZMDI’s portfolio continues to evolve and expand in an effort to provide solutions to all markets.\n“The ZSSC4151 is the first of many highly flexible and dynamic derivatives that will result from our Next Generation Platform. The ZSSC4151 is designed with the customer’s application in mind and will enhance performance and lower overall system costs while providing the designer assurance that they are using one of the most robust sensor signal conditioners available in the market today,” stated Jamie Douglas, Global Product Marketing Manager for Multi-Market Sensor Platforms at ZMDI.\nKey Features\n• AEC-Q100 qualification: grade 0\n• Supply voltage: 4.5V to 5.5V\n• Extended temperature range: -40°C to 150°C\n• High accuracy: ±0.5% of full-scale output at 40°C to 125°C\n• External temperature sensor input or internal temperature sensor\n• 5V analog output, ZACwireTM single pin interface and I2C™\n• Safety and diagnostic functions supporting automotive (ASIL B) and industrial (SIL 2) safety critical applications, according to the ISO 26262:2011 and IEC 61508 standards\n• Robust electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) performance\n• Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) resolution: configurable from 12 to 16 bit\n• Large sensor offset correction using digital zooming with 14 to 18 bit resolution\n• Output resolution: 12 bit\n• Response time to 100% input step: 1.1ms\n• Overvoltage protection: ±40V on VDDE, VSSE and AOUT pins\n• Latch-up immunity: up to ±100mA\nTypical Applications\n• Pressure sensors\n• Strain gauges\n• PTC RTD temperature sensors\nAvailability\nThe ZSSC4151 is in full production.
