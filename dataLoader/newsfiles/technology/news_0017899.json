The Department has an excellent international reputation for high quality theoretical and experimental research funded by EPSRC, DTI, EU and manufacturing industry. \nThe Rolls-Royce funded Studentship is the result of the expanding machining activities sponsored at the Rolls-Royce UTC dealing with in-depth investigations of the response of difficult-to-cut materials to various machining operations in the scope of robust manufacture of safety critical aero-engine components. \nThe project will deal with the Finite Element modelling and experimental investigations of the influence of different machining operations correlated with metallurgical aspects of the workpiece to evaluate and understand the machinability of the new Ni-based superalloys for the use on the next-generation gas turbine engines. This will involve development of FE models for metal cutting followed by the use a wide range of sophisticated testing and analysis techniques including Scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) for residual stress measurements, Finite Element simulations to enable the prediction of machinability of new nickel-based alloys. \nThese project will involve, FE simulations, machining trials, workpiece surface quality analysis (e.g. metallurgy, integrity, residual stresses), followed by investigations on innovative methods to evaluate the machinability of new Ni-based superalloys. Internationally recognised Rolls-Royce specialists in the field will be available throughout the project to provide the PhD student with support and guidance if required. \nFor mutual interest the project can be offered to include: Appropriate training within Rolls-Royce for a period to be agreed. The training will enable the understanding of the technical issues related to the project, as well as developing a good partnership with the appropriate technical teams. Joint academic and industrial supervision. In this way, the student will develop both academic and industrial skills with multiple career opportunities at the end of the PhD study. For PhD students wishing to pursue an academic career, the opportunity to participate in teaching activities will be sought. \nThe bursary covers the tuition fees and provides a tax-free stipend of approximately £1,350 per month for the duration of the project (three years) – starting from October 2014. This is an excellent opportunity for an enthusiastic first or upper second class graduate in mechanical/manufacturing/materials science/physics to build strong knowledge in both manufacturing and material science while building strong relationships with both academic and industrial areas at international level. Due to the nature of funding only UK/EU applicants can be considered for this position. \nThe Research Group has excellent facilities in FE modelling, precision machining, process monitoring, metrology/surface inspection to support this research project. Students will benefit from the strategic partnerships with industry and collaborations with world-class specialists in manufacturing technologies. \nInformal enquiries may be addressed to Prof. D. Axinte, tel: 0115 951 4117 or Email: Dragos.Axinte@Nottingham.ac.uk . \nApplications, with a detailed CV and letter of application, together with the names and addresses of two referees, should be sent to directly to Prof. D. Axinte ( Dragos.Axinte@nottingham.ac.uk ). Share this PhD", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T03:17:05.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
