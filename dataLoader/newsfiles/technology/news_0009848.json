This unique website allows the user the opportunity to upload their selfie, along with thousands of others on to the supersonic rocket car as it attempts to break the current record which stands at 763 mph, and move it on to 1000 mph.\nFirst to upload his selfie was Red Bull F1 and Le Mans 24 hours star Mark Webber. The team are hoping that Mark will be the first of many Australian and international sporting greats, celebrities and fans to get behind the project and bring the World Land Speed Record to Australia for the first time in history.\nThe all volunteer Aussie Invader 5R team, led by Rosco McGlashan OAM have decided to take another path and not target large corporate sponsors, to embrace the power of social media and share their attempt with thousands of supporters and smaller corporate entities, rather than a few big sponsors or global brands.\n“The Aussie Invader 5R team want our attempt to be on behalf of the people, not just part of a big brands marketing strategy. SuperSonicSelfie is a way for everyone to be part of this great adventure and challenge” , says Rosco McGlashan, Team Principal and Driver.\nFor as little as $20 AUD SuperSonicSelfie allows the user to quickly and easily pay and upload their selfie onto the car from their mobile phone, and into history. They will be able to print a certificate and follow the team and their selfie through the sound barrier, right to the record and into history.\nFor more information please contact:\nMark Read\ne: This email address is being protected from spambots.
