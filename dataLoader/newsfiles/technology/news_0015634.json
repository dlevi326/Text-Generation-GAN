Its subsidiary Kayak, a so-called \"meta-search\" engine that takes listings from other search tools on the web, currently shows customers hotel and flight listings for Cuba.\nWhile Cafferty said Friday's regulations \"don't change much\" in part because U.S. citizens remain barred from leisure travel on the island, she said they could help pave the way for Americans to book travel directly on the group's largest and most global subsidiary, Booking.com.\nThe U.S. rules come as Washington and Havana inch toward normal relations after more than half a century of hostility that followed Cuba's 1959 revolution. The two countries restored diplomatic ties and reopened embassies earlier this summer.
