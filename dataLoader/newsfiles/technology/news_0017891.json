Hortonworks DataFlow is powered by [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQnpPaTh2Ym1sbWFTNWhjR0ZqYUdVdWIzSm5MMXdpSUhKbGJEMWNJbTV2Wm05c2JHOTNYQ0lnZEdGeVoyVjBQVndpWDJKc1lXNXJYQ0krUVhCaFkyaGxJRTVwUm1rOEwyRSt8]], a top-level open source project, and addresses the tremendous opportunity presented by the Internet of Anything (IoAT). HDF is designed to make it easy to automate and secure all types of data flows and collect, conduct and curate real-time business insights and actions derived from any data, from anything, anywhere. HDF is complementary to Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP™), the industry's leading Open Enterprise Hadoop platform. HDF provides the ability for more data to be delivered into HDP and delivers full fidelity analytics on all data for every Hortonworks customer. HDF with HDP will give customers a complete set of secure solutions to manage and find value in the increasing volume of new and legacy data types. Apache NiFi is based on technology previously called \"Niagara Files\" that was in development and used at scale within the NSA for the last 8 years and was made available to the Apache Software Foundation through the NSA Technology Transfer Program. Some of the use cases include, but are not limited to: Big Data Ingest – Offers a simple, reliable and secure way to collect data streams. IoAT Optimization – Allows organizations to overcome real world constraints such as limited or expensive bandwidth while ensuring data quality and reliability. Compliance – Enables organizations to understand everything that happens to data in motion from its creation to its final resting place, which is particularly important for regulated industries that must retain and report on chain of custody. Digital Security – Helps organizations collect large volumes of data from many sources and prioritize which data is brought back for analysis first, a critical capability given the time sensitivity of identifying security breaches. \"NiFi addresses dataflow challenges we have right now and provides upside for where we're heading,\" says Alexandar Ryabov , senior director of Data Engineering at Wargaming.Net. \"It is also a big win for us that it is designed for the global enterprise.\" \"HDF simplifies the process of collecting, conducting and curating the vast amounts of data currently being generated via the Internet of Anything. By flowing that data into HDP, our customers are able to rapidly bring these new data elements under management in a completely secure and purely open way,\" said Tim Hall , vice president of product management at Hortonworks. \"With the addition of HDF to our product portfolio, Hortonworks is well positioned to help customers deliver transformational business insights.\" Hortonworks will be at Strata Hadoop World, September 29-October 1 at the Javits Center in New York City . For more information about HDF or HDP, please visit the Hortonworks booth #409. Or hear more at the Open Enterprise Hadoop Roadshow, coming to 15 cities worldwide.
