But we will do fewer of them. We will be very disciplined and selective.\" \nThis plan comes after the 20% stake acquisition by Mitsubishi in Olam for $1bn. This move from Mitsubishi has signaled that the Asian commodity traders are forseeinging a spur in demand for high quality food in the coming years with the growth in population. \nThe Mitsubishi acquisition has also helped Olam to ward off an attack from Muddy Waters, a US-based seller, as well as settle doubts in the global market about its finances. \nIn August, the company raised $915m by selling a 12% stake to Mitsubishi, which acquired another 8% from current shareholders. \nThe cash injection is helping Olam to take advantage of the drop in global commodity prices and and go ahead with acquisitions. \nVerghese told the daily: \"The $100-$200 million range will be our sweet spot. But we will do fewer of them. We will be very disciplined and selective.\" \nThe firm acquired Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.'s cocoa unit for $1.3bn, which is expected to close by October. \nThe Singaporean firm's strategy reflects the Asian companies' bid to break the domination in the agricultural trading by US and European firms, especially the big four known as 'ABCD' for ADM, Bunge, and Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities.
