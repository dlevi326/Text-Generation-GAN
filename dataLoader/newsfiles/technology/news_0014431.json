With the introduction of group calling, Hike has also dropped the beta tag on VoIP (voice over Internet) officially rolling out the feature, the statement added. “Now with the tap of a single button, you can connect up to 100 people in one call.

Consumers can get this feature by upgrading to the latest version of hike, which is available on the Google Play Store now.
