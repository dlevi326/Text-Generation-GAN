We are thrilled to partner with RedDoorz as it expands its offerings across a market that is ripe for transformation,” said Amit Anand, founding partner at Jungle Ventures. \nMeanwhile, travel and hospitality industry veterans Philip Wolf, founder of Phocuswright, and Ajay Bakaya, executive director at Sarovar Hotels & Resorts, have joined the company’s strategic advisory board to help accelerate its growth and product success in its segment, it said. \nCommeasure has been co-founded by Amit Saberwal (CEO) and Asheesh Saxena (CTO). Both Saberwal and Saxena have previously worked with MakeMyTrip Ltd. \nSaberwal was chief business officer of MakeMyTrip based in Singapore. He was also sales and marketing director with The Park Hotels. Saxena was senior vice president – product development and engineering with online community for researchers Knimbus and also served as director (technology development – online hotels) for MakeMyTrip. He also has experience in delivering hotel and travel technology solutions to organisations like Lastminute.com, Zuji and British Midland. \n“Today budget accommodations offer fragmented and non-uniform experiences that affect the consumer satisfaction which can lead to negative reviews on social media and declining footfalls,” said Amit Saberwal, co-founder and CEO, Commeasure Solutions. \n“This is where RedDoorz has a strong value proposition. We not only help consumers receive standardised services across RedDoorz- enabled budget accommodations but also help the budget hotel owners with technology to distribute across multiple digital platforms. It’s a win-win for both the consumer and the hotel owner,” he added. \nSingapore-based Jungle Ventures is an active VC fund that has a good presence in India. \nJungle Ventures’ portfolio include India-based LivSpace, Pokkt and Zipdial (Acquired by Twitter); Singapore-based travelmob (acquired by NASDAQ listed HomeAway), GoVoyagin, Crayon Data and Tradegecko; Malaysia-based iMoney and CatchThatBus; Thailand-based Pomelo Fashion and Australia-based Edrolo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T11:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:05:29.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
