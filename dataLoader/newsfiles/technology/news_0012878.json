There are some new watch faces available, allowing more options or customization, and you can also select a photo album from which a random image will be selected and displayed every time the Apple Watch screen is activated. \nDictating replies to emails through the Apple Watch is now possible, so you don’t need to use your phone to send answers, and you can also accept or decline FaceTime calls. Beats Radio will now be accessible on the Apple Watch through the updated music icon. \nTime Travel allows you to navigate chronologically through your future calendar appointments by turning the digital crown so that you can view your schedule and upcoming events. If you need to plan a journey to any of these engagements you can ask Siri for travel directions, although this only works for select cities at present – London, New York City, San Francisco, Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Mexico City, Toronto, and Berlin. \n[Image via Apple]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T22:07:59.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
