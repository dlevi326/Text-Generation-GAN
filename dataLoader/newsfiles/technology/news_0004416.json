Similar to its connected car organization, AT&T is now focusing its resources and IoT expertise to create game-changing solutions for cities.\nUsing IoT technology, AT&T is already helping communities solve problems by connecting things like utility meters, street lights, and water systems. Smart City solutions range from detecting speeding cars, to conserving energy with motion sensor lights in parking garages, video monitoring, and intelligent transportation\nTwo examples of these solutions are:\nSmart Lighting: Maintenance crews can remotely manage a city’s entire street lighting system. An app shows every faulty light in a city so that maintenance crews no longer waste time and fuel driving around town to find and replace broken bulbs.\nSmart Water: Cities can help protect their water supply and prevent water waste. The technology uses sensors and acoustic technology to detect water pressure, temperature and leaks. Cities can use that data to make more informed decisions and extend the life of their water systems.\nRead Entire Article at: http://realstreettech.com/att-smart-cities-initiatives/\nAbout Us:\nTechnology’s impact on commercial real estate is moving at an exponential rate.
