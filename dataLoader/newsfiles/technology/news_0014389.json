Shares on Friday were up 7% at 141 pence.\nOn Friday, Lone Star announced it had bought 4.3% of Quintain shares in the market at 141 pence, a step that pushed the Texas-based investor over the standard level of shareholder backing needed to close the deal.\nBefore Friday's new offer, the deal had been accepted by 71.7% of Quintain's shareholders, short of the 75% threshold needed for it to succeed.\nThat gap opened the door for U.S.-based hedge fund Elliott Associates LP, best known for its hostile brand of activism, including a long-running battle with the government of Argentina over bond payments.\nElliott took control of a 12.9% stake of Quintain's voting rights, and earlier this week said the original 131 pence offer \"substantially undervalues the company.\" The firm declined to comment on the latest bid.\nThe intervention is the latest sign that U.S. activist investors are finding some success in Europe, where the market is viewed as less crowded and offering more opportunities. This brand of activism has historically proved less effective than in North America.\nDespite its success in bolstering Lone Star's offer, Elliott has a mixed record in Europe in recent years. It scored a partial victory in a battle over the appointment of independent directors with U.K. investment firm Alliance Trust earlier this year, but it has previously been defeated in its campaign at Swiss biotechnology group Actelion Ltd. In 2011, Elliott compromised over a boardroom shake-up with U.K. coach and train operator National Express Group.\nLone Star is set to use its deep pockets to speed up Quintain's building plans in London, which is in the midst of a surging property boom.\nQuintain owns a large chunk of land around Wembley Stadium, which hosts the England soccer team, rock concerts, and regular National Football League games. Quintain plans to build around 5,000 homes over the next 10 years.\nAn acute housing shortage and robust demand drove the average London house price in July up to £ 525,000, the highest on record, according to the U.K. Office for National Statistics. However, the pace of growth has been slowing, with prices in the capital city up just 4.4% from a year ago, lower than the national average of 5.2%, the data show.\nLone Star said it plans to delist Quintain from the stock market on or around Oct. 23.\nWrite to Art Patnaude at art.patnaude@wsj.com and Laurence Fletcher at laurence.fletcher@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"Alliance Trust Plc\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=GB00B11V7W98\n 25, 2015 11:35 ET (15:35 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=GB00B11V7W98", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T11:41:53.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
