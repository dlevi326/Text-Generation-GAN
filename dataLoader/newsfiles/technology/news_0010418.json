Tim Cook believes the future in TV is apps and there's plenty of those. Whether streaming movies and music, using Siri's voice search to find specific stuff like \"show me Kevin Bacon movies\" (why not?), gaming using the remote with its gyroscope and accelerometer or shopping. We particularly like the new remote with a touch sensitive trackpad, which makes scrubbing through shows SO much easier than before. The new-look tvOS interface is brighter than before and introduces games \nPrice starts at $149 for the 32GB version and $199 for the 64GB. Release date available at the end of October. Is the new Apple TV the future of television? \nApple iPad Pro: features, release date, specs, price The brand new iPad Pro \nThe biggest iPad ever has been revealed with the iPad Pro. The monster tablet, aimed at business users, features a 12.9-inch display – to put that in perspective the width of the iPad Pro screen is the entire length of an iPad Air – and 5.6 million pixels. Performance-wise it features a 64-bit A9X chip with twice the memory and storage of the iPad Air. It's a bit of a beast and it topped off with the announcement of the Apple Pencil – a stylus (would you believe it) with a pressure sensitive tip that will have graphic designers jaws dragging on the floor. There's also a Smart Keyboard case for typing. \nPrice starts at $799 for the 32GB model going up to $1,079 for the 128GB model and is available from November. The Apple Pencil costs $99 and Smart Keyboard $169 also available November. Everything you need to know about the iPad Pro \nApple Watch: features Facebook Messenger comes to Apple Watch \nApple Watch was the first on Tim's list as Watch OS 2 was unveiled for the device. A new Facebook Messenger app, GoPro integration, transit directions and a \"game-changer for healthcare\" in the form of Airstrip, which allows doctors to keep real-time tabs on patients through data such as heart rate gathered by the Watch. There are also new watch faces, more customisations options and a Time Travel feature (not literally) where you can check your schedule ahead and in the past. Apple Watch also got another fashionable upgrade as Apple flaunted brand new leather bands from fashion label Hermes, which come with the Apple Watch and an Hermes watch face.
