Damon Beres Tech Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 09/09/2015 12:23 PM EDT \nIt's now a bit easier to spot that special someone on Tinder. \nThe popular dating app on Wednesday announced a new \" Super Like \" feature that will allow you to swipe up or \"star\" people you're incredibly attracted to. When a person you've super-liked visits your profile in the app, they'll be notified of your extraordinary admiration, allowing them to super-like you back and create a match right away. \nBefore this new feature, Tinder let you swipe right to indicate a \"like\" and left to indicate a lack of interest. This old formula created blind matches: You never saw if someone swiped right on you until you also swiped right on them. \nThe addition of a third swiping option brings users more into the loop. Tinder \nYou'll only get one \"super like\" a day, so don't go slobbering all over the first person who strikes your fancy. \nAccording to Tinder's blog post , the feature is already available in Australia and will be coming to the rest of the world \"soon.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:45:12.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
