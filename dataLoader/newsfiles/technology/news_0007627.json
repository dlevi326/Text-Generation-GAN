Made. What a joke that was.\nI read a Quote: today from a unlikely source of information...a Zen book. I found it quite strange that I stumbled upon this book while fighting off the demon’s that like it or not live in everyone of us from the general man on the street to the perceived religious icon like the Pope!\nEveryone (even if you have had the fortune of not meeting) has that self destructive, tortured, hateful part of themselves hidden in some deep part of ones conscious.\nWhere this person comes from is unknown. Personally, I think it comes from built up rage and anger from the smallest to largest issues that have been thrown at you your entire life. The path you choose or are given defines yourself and this separate being (Second-self) within you.\nThe Quote: states ” Lose a flower and you can easily find another, lose integrity and you’ll wander for some time until you find it again”\nSuccess will come and go, but integrity is forever. Integrity means doing the right thing at all times and in all circumstances, whether or not anyone is watching. It takes having the courage to do the right thing, no matter what the consequences will be. Building a reputation of integrity takes years, but it takes only a second to lose.\nIt has taken 7 very long years to find myself again….a few successful ventures, hundreds of failures from friendships, to family, to studies, to my work life…the list goes on. The largest stumbling block I had to over come out of the millions that are behind and ahead of me was myself.\nFighting the person you think you are, fighting the person you think you need to be, fighting the person you think have to be and EVENTUALLY falling in love with the person you truly are.\nThis is when you will find TRUE self fulfillment. True passion in the things you love. Everything you touch will leave a legacy that will make people still fighting that inner battle jealous to the bone. You will destroy anything in your path and not look back.\nGood luck with the battle\nRantings from a madman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T01:11:37.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
