Virtually every element of the plan requires either concessions negotiated from creditors or legislation enacted in San Juan or Washington, suggesting a long and difficult road ahead.\nAmong the most striking aspects of the plan — and likely to be one of the most contentious — is the proposal to restructure Puerto Rico’s general obligation bonds, which were sold to investors with an explicit constitutional promise that timely repayment would take priority over all other expenditures on the island. Puerto Rico stunned investors this summer by defaulting on another type of bond, but failing to pay general obligation debt when due is almost unheard of.\nFor decades, general obligation bonds have been marketed as virtually default-proof, and a major restructuring of them now by Puerto Rico would raise unwelcome questions about the credibility of the time-honored “full faith and credit” pledge that stands behind such bonds. Puerto Rico is not proposing to walk away from its bonds completely, but to pay its investors less.\nDoing that could put its new economic plan at odds with its Constitution, but officials said there was no choice: If Puerto Rico continues to pay its bondholders on schedule, it will run out of cash by next summer, according to official projections.", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-09T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T11:35:46.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
