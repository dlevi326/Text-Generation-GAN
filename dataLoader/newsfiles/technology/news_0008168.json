Hours later, they left the courthouse applauding the sentence.\nExperts say the trial of Parnell and two co-defendants a year ago marked the first time US food producers stood trial on criminal charges in a food-poisoning case. The company went bankrupt following the salmonella outbreak.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:06:25.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
