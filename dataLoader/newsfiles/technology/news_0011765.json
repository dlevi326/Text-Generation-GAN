The app can be used by students to find a roommate, sublet their apartment, and buy or sell textbooks, electronics, class-notes, tickets, and furniture - anything students use at college. In addition to the peer-to-peer marketplace, Locolist is proud to partner with Amazon to give students the option of trading-in/selling their textbooks directly to Amazon. It is well known that campus bookstores give students pennies on the dollar for their used books. Now, with Amazon Trade-In, students can get a much higher price for their textbooks. Including textbooks, over one million CD/DVD's, games, and consumer electronics items are trade-in eligible. College students are always looking for ways to save money during the school year, and Locolist is revolutionizing the way students connect to buy and sell on campus. The app's goal is to make it easy and safe for students to meet and complete a transaction.\nTo ensure student safety, Locolist requires students to create an account using their college .edu email address. Accounts are only activated after the student logs in and verifies their email address. An in-app messaging feature facilitates direct communication between buyers and sellers.\nLocolist Features:\nCreates a safe environment for students to buy or sell products and services on campus Facilitates direct communication between buyers and sellers Enables student to trade-in/sell products to Amazon\nDevice Requirements:\nAndroid and iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch Optimized for iPhone (4s, 5, 5c, 5s, 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus) and iPod touch (3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th generations) Requires iOS 6 or later and Android 3.0 or later 6.7 MB\nPricing and Availability:\nLocolist - Your Campus Marketplace 2.1 is free and available worldwide through the App Store in the Social Networking category.
