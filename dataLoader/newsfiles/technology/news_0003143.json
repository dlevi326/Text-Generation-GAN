The gift will support the construction of the Smithsonian’s 19th museum, scheduled to open in 2016.\n“We are honored to have the support of MGM Resorts International as we draw closer to the opening of the museum,” said Lonnie G. Bunch III, Founding Director of NMAAHC. “The support of MGM Resorts International helps to ensure that our museum on the national mall will help the millions who visit, see and understand America’s history through an African American lens.”\nCurrently under construction on a five-acre site adjacent to the Washington Monument, the nearly 400,000-square-foot museum will be a place where Americans can learn about the richness and diversity of the African American experience. Since its start in 2003, NMAAHC has built a collection of more than 30,000 objects covering major periods of African American history, beginning with the origins in Africa and continuing through slavery, the civil rights era, the Harlem Renaissance, the great migrations north and west and into the 21st century.\n“MGM Resorts is proud to support the Smithsonian’s addition of this museum in honor and celebration of the unique role of African Americans in the evolution of America into the great nation that it is today,” said Jim Murren, Chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts International. “The NMAAHC is a living symbol of our company’s and country’s commitment to the foundation of diversity that is our national heritage, and the vision of inclusion that is our company’s aspiration for the future,” continued Murren, a recipient of CR Magazine’s Responsible CEO of the Year Award.\nMGM Resorts International is building a world-class destination resort in the Washington, D.C. area – MGM National Harbor – that is expected to open in the second half of 2016. Located on the Potomac River just south of the National Mall and the NMAAHC in neighboring Prince George’s County, Md., the fully integrated resort is designed to reflect the history and heritage of the Capital Region.\nOnce operational, the team of about 3,600 employees will embody MGM’s values and continue its deep commitment to the principles of diversity and community engagement. MGM is already off to a strong start in the region, and has more than 100 Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs), certified by the State of Maryland, engaged in the design and construction phase of the MGM National Harbor project. Also, the goals for MBE participation outlined in the Community Benefits Agreement with the County are consistently being met and exceeded. Furthermore, MGM National Harbor is investing in the local communities, with a philanthropic pledge to donate $1 million dollars to nonprofit organizations in the County before the resort opens.\nMGM Resorts International has shown a powerful commitment to the fundamental principles of diversity and philanthropy since its inception. From spending more than $3 billion with diverse-owned suppliers and contractors since 2002 to marshaling its employees to donate more than 1.6 million pounds of food last year, and volunteering more than 170,000 hours to community agencies, social responsibility is foundational to MGM Resorts’ culture.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T15:01:40.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
