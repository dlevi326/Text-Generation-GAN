Microsoft has officially released Office 2016 for Windows and it is available for consumer customers (Office 365 Home and Personal) immediately for download. Mac users have already been able to download Office 2016 for a few weeks already.\nOffice 365 will likely keep its name and could be joined by Windows 365 as Microsoft will apparently add a subscription option to Windows 10, and it has trademarked that name. Amongst the flurry of features added to Office 365 in recent times, the ones worth highlighting are:\nBranded sign-in which will allow customers to customise their sign-in page and access panel. The adoption of an international standard for protecting personal data storage on Microsoft's cloud infrastructure. The introduction of a self-service password reset feature that doesn't involve the system admins. The ability to build websites within Office 365 in partnership with Wix. Significant changes to OneNote including OCR capabilities and new features added to the free version. Outlook for iOS and Android getting enterprise features like pin locking and faster remove wipe execution. iCloud integration for Microsoft Office on iOS as well as Box, Citrix and Salesforce integration . Microsoft acquired Sunrise , a popular calendaring app for touch devices, which is likely to be incorporated into Office 365. Calendaring has been one of the areas where Microsoft hasn't devoted as much resources as many would have expected especially with the rise of mobility.\nMicrosoft also bought Acompli (which it almost immediately turned to Outlook), LiveLoop for to prep ip PowerPoint and 6Wunderkinder for its popular to-do-list application.\nThe company also announced that it was giving away 100GB of free storage for a year to existing Dropbox users to lure them away from the popular cloud storage provider – which incidentally is a close Microsoft ally.\nThat bonus is on top of a 100GB giveaway of OneDrive storage for two years if you subscribe to its Bing Rewards scheme. Your files will be read only after the subscription ends unless you buy a top-up and if you want to get a cheap one, Ebay seems to be the place to go with plenty of deals available for Microsoft Office 365 Personal available for less than £40.\nOkay, let's move on to the most recent developments over the past couple of months. Microsoft recently announced that it has updated Office 365 for Exchange Online , so that users will no longer have their emails automatically deleted after a period of 30 days. Previously, deleted items were shifted into the Deleted folder before disappearing from there after 30 days, but the new update allows the system admin to change this period to a different length, or simply to set all emails to be kept indefinitely.\nAlso on the email front, Microsoft has just updated Office 365 to allow users to send email attachments which are far, far bigger than was previously possible. In fact, attachments can now be six times as large , with the new size limit being 150MB (whereas Office 365 users were limited to 25MB before – that said, note that the 25MB limit will remain in place unless the administrator actually changes things).\nVideo content is an arena Redmond is moving to cover with its subscription Office suite, as well, with the creation of the Office 365 Video portal that allows businesses to distribute videos internally. This is a free additional service which is currently in the process of rolling out globally for Office 365 enterprise users, in order to provide a fully integrated solution for video sharing within an organisation with security in mind. Office 365 Video employs an HTML5 player so it can work across all devices from mobiles to desktop computers, although Microsoft is also producing an app for iPhone users.\nFurthermore, Redmond has bolstered Office 365 with the addition of mobile device management (MDM) again free of charge, at least for those on commercial plans. System admins will be able to use these features to manage access to data over a range of devices and platforms, from smartphones upwards and on Windows Phone, Android and iOS.\nThis will put in place measures such as the detection of jailbroken devices, and will allow for security policies to be set up to ensure that certain business emails or documents can only be accessed on approved devices. A selective wipe feature will strip corporate data off a device running Office 365, without touching any personal data on said piece of hardware.\nAnother major move on the security front which has only just happened is Microsoft and Samsung's announcement of an agreement, following settling their legal arguments over Android, whereby a version of the Office 365 suite will come to Samsung's Knox . In other words, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, OneNote and OneDrive for Business will be included wrapped up in the Knox container.\nRedmond has also just changed things with Office 365 so that documents can now be exported in the Open Document Format (ODF), to bring the suite in line with UK government guidelines on document sharing.\nThe rest of the review is on the next page...", "external_links": ["http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/applications/microsoft-bringing-beautiful-calendar-app-to-windows-10-and-office-365-1284456", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/applications/outlook-for-ios-and-android-delivers-on-update-promise-1285309", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/applications/microsoft-sheds-light-on-office-365-encryption-expansion-1285215", "http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/TRBC/onedrive-320-80.jpg", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/business-software/microsoft-adds-free-mobile-device-management-to-office-365-1289821", "http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/pc-mac/software/business-and-finance-software/office-2016-1290455/review", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/applications/office-for-ios-adds-box-citrix-and-salesforce-integration-1285174", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/internet/cloud-services/get-100gb-of-free-onedrive-storage-thanks-to-this-loophole-1284179", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/applications/office-for-ios-finally-supports-icloud-integration-1285023", "http://cdn0.beta.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/business-software/microsoft-extends-office-365-email-expiry-date-1285673", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/business-software/microsoft-turns-accompli-into-new-outlook-for-ios-and-android-1282752", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/applications/remember-frontpage-office-365-kind-of-revived-it-1284007", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/business-software/microsoft-office-365-video-is-a-private-youtube-for-your-business-1291325", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/applications/office-365-maximum-attachment-size-gets-six-fold-increase-1291329", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/applications/microsoft-s-turning-onenote-into-a-powerhouse-with-ipad-handwriting-update-1285351", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/applications/microsoft-allows-government-approved-odf-in-office-365-1289890", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/applications/better-powerpoint-collaboration-expected-with-liveloop-acquisition-1289650", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/business-software/branded-sign-in-coming-to-office-365-1285285", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/applications/office-365-flexes-its-android-enterprise-muscles-through-samsung-knox-partnership-1287779", "http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/TRBC/onedrive-650-80.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-24T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:13:53.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
