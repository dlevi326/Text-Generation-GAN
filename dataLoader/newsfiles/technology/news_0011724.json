The TITAN-AP instantly adds ultra-fast AC1900 Wi-Fi with ultimate coverage for any existing network in a home or office. It features true plug-and-play installation and upgrades Wi-Fi performance with extreme range and speed for all devices. Designed to add long range, superior Wi-Fi to demanding, multiple device households and businesses with existing routers, the TITAN-AP provides enough horsepower to easily manage music downloads, video chats, 4K content streaming and gaming all at the same time. The TITAN-AP can also be used to add Wi-Fi capabilities to networks that previously allowed only wired Internet connections.\nBuilt with a 1GHz Dual-Core Processor, 14 high power amplifiers, and 4 high gain antennas, the TITAN-AP delivers superior Wi-Fi performance with ultimate coverage. The blazing fast AC1900 Wi-Fi technology provides speeds that reach up to an impressive 1900Mbps, making slow downloads and video buffering a thing of the past. With advanced 4 Antenna-Rx Technology the TITAN-AP provides stable and strong connections for all of your network devices at once by using a four antenna design to add an additional receiving radio stream for increased Wi-Fi reception capabilities.\nThe TITAN-AP instantly adds ultimate Wi-Fi performance and coverage to any existing network by attaching to a router or network switch and blanketing a home or office with untouchable connection speeds. In addition to improved performance, users can create up to 8 networks for guests and restrict access to specific users for enhanced security. The TITAN-AP is built with a 4-port Gigabit switch for connecting additional wired devices to the high power network. This includes devices like printers, smart TVs, gaming consoles and more. And, users can attach a USB drive to either of the two USB ports for instant and fast file sharing throughout the entire network.\n“The demands for more Wi-Fi coverage and fast Internet speeds are always increasing. Add to that the rapidly growing number of Wi-Fi devices in a home or office connecting to the network and soon, your router that is just a few years old can no longer handle the load,” said Lacey Limbrick, Brand/Marketing Manager at Amped Wireless. “With its advanced design and engineering, the TITAN-AP can be added to your dated network to deliver a new Wi-Fi experience with ultimate performance, reliability and coverage. It can quickly update a router and improve Wi-Fi connectivity and coverage for even the most demanding users.”\nThe TITAN-AP Access Point is available for order today.
