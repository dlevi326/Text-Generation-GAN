Google says it has received 318,269 requests for removal, and accepted delisting of about 40 percent of the URLs evaluated.\nFacebook links accounted for the most of any single website, Google said.\nCNIL said Google must comply with the order or face possible sanctions.\n ", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-09-21T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T15:21:57.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
