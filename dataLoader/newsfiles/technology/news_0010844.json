The unit eliminates the need to plug the device into an outlet. It allows devices to be charged even when a conventional electrical outlet is unavailable. This ensures that you have the battery power needed to make calls, send texts, access the Internet, etc. The invention offers added peace of mind. Furthermore, it is ideal for use by busy, on-the-go individuals.\nThe original design was submitted to the Austin office of InventHelp.
