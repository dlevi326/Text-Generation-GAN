Furthermore, the M*Modal CDI solutions were recognized by KLAS in its CDI Solutions 2015: Moving Closer to Documentation Completion Report published on September 17. Featured in the Early Data Vendor category, M*Modal received favorable comments from clients reporting measurable gains and noteworthy support from the company. \n\"The timely and relevant feedback delivered by M*Modal is critical to physician engagement as it helps physicians work smarter and faster, not harder,\" said Dr. William Melahn, MD, CMO, VPMA at St. Claire's Regional Medical Center. \"The M*Modal CDI solution not only helps monitor and improve physician behavior through strong reporting capabilities, it gives us unprecedented insight into what physicians are thinking naturally, not when merely checking a box. M*Modal bridges the gap between physician minds and where EMRs should be.\" \nM*Modal uniquely addresses the issue of physician engagement and buy-in -- identified as crucial success factors by the KLAS report. By delivering real-time, automated, high-impact CDI and ICD-10 documentation assistance and education to physicians as they create the clinical note, M*Modal makes CDI an integrated and continuous process rather than a separate, disruptive event. \nThe effectiveness of this original approach is verified by an M*Modal client comment in the KLAS report that said, \"70% of our physicians are responding to messages triggered by the computer-assisted physician documentation.\" \n\"We are proud of our clients' continued support and confidence in us and are excited to have earned this recognition from KLAS for our CDI solutions,\" said Scott MacKenzie, CEO of M*Modal. \"Our CDI solutions take an innovative approach to address the increasing documentation burden on physicians and providers by embedding CDI into existing workflows, leveraging current IT infrastructure, and delivering context-specific information in real time for improved quality, productivity and sustainability.\" \nThe M*Modal CDI solution suite uses proprietary Natural Language Understanding technology to automate and streamline CDI processes while meeting clients at their state of readiness in three ways: M*Modal CDI Engage uses Computer-Assisted Physician Documentation (CAPD) to combine document creation, CDI and ICD-10 training into one seamless workflow for continuous improvement in the accuracy and timeliness of the note without compromising on physician workflow or productivity. M*Modal CDI Assess allows users to gain automated access to large volumes of patient data trapped in transcribed narratives on the M*Modal platform to find and prioritize CDI opportunities, minimize manual processes and identify physicians in need of support. M*Modal CDI Collaborate provides efficiency-enhancing functionality to automate the CDI Specialist workflow and looks across all encounter documentation to identify deficient documentation, deliver summarized evidence of clinical indicators, and close the loop with physicians on CDI queries. \nM*Modal's real-time CDI solutions can be seen at work in booth 1046 at the 2015 AHIMA conference, September 27-30 in New Orleans. \nAbout M*Modal M*Modal is a leading healthcare technology provider of advanced clinical documentation solutions, enabling hospitals and physicians to enrich the content of patient electronic health records (EHR) for improved healthcare and comprehensive billing integrity.
