These reports summarize Amazon® Best Sellers, serving as a proxy for current and future demand to toy brands, toy retailers, and mass merchants. The three roll-up reports for October, November, and December will analyze newcomers to Amazon’s top 100 best selling toys, as well as point out the biggest changes in rank and overall category volatility. Category and brand managers can keep track of which brands appear most in the best seller list, as well as identify “rising stars” to help with their holiday pricing and promotion decisions. The reports also come with a complete summary data file.\n“Toys are a critical category every holiday season and this year is especially interesting, given the shake-up caused by the Star Wars merchandise release, which disrupted the existing best seller rankings and essentially launched the toy shopping season into early overdrive,” said Jenn Markey, VP of Marketing and Product Management at 360pi. “As always, there is speculation as to which toys will be most popular this holiday, and we are happy to offer our subscribers this early indication of best selling toys.”\nClick here to subscribe to the free report offer.\nAbout 360pi\n360pi derives profitable insights from product and pricing big data to help leading omnichannel retailers, etailers, and brand manufacturers compete and win with shoppers. 360pi’s customer base accounts for over $US200 billion in annual product sales and includes Ace Hardware, Build.com, and Overstock.com, along with several Fortune 500 consumer products companies.
