By adding Google Cloud Platform as a fully supported cloud platform, NGINX offers enterprises additional choices of cloud platforms to deploy NGINX Plus to meet their application scalability and performance needs. This announcement takes place at the second annual NGINX user conference, nginx.conf 2015, where Google is a top sponsor. \nWith the explosion of cloud-native applications, as well as applications being moved to the cloud, it is important that organizations have access to application delivery tools that match the sophistication of the enterprise-grade traffic management devices in their own data centers. \nNGINX Plus includes full-featured HTTP and TCP load balancing, session persistence, application aware health checks, and monitoring, ensuring that web applications and services are both available and scalable regardless of spikes in traffic and demand. SSL offload, caching, and bandwidth and rate control also provide a predictable way for organizations to deliver content to users securely while blocking unauthorized users and defending against Denial-of-Service attacks. \n\"With all the advanced features of NGINX Plus combined with the ease of deployment from Google Cloud Launcher and Cloud Platform support, you can now more easily deliver, scale, and manage all of your applications on Google Cloud Platform,\" said Paul Oh, head of business development at NGINX, Inc. \"We are bringing the power and control developers and application owners need, allowing them to operate services and deliver content to the high standards their customers expect.\" \nNGINX Plus can operate standalone or can complement Google Cloud Load Balancing solutions, which reduces the costs for enterprises of delivering complex applications. \nNGINX is also extending the NGINX Innovators Program, launched in April of this year, to Google Cloud Platform. This will provide unlimited, free NGINX Plus subscriptions to qualified startups and entrepreneurs who are building next generation, high performance applications in the cloud. Google Cloud Platform's focus on performance and scalability and integration with NGINX Plus make it an attractive platform to go from development to production quickly and seamlessly. \nNGINX Plus is available now through Google Cloud Launcher. NGINX, Inc. provides full technical support for Google Cloud Platform users.
