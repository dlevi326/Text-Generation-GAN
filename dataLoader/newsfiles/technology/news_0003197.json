Any ideas or inspiration that occurred after hours could only be acted on by returning to the office. Those days are over. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150910/265265 \nApple's newly-announced iPad Pro's 12.9\" screen and increased compute and graphics power make it perfect for CAD users. As the only professional 3D CAD system that runs on iPads and iPhones, Onshape will be compatible with the business-focused tablet when it is released in November. \n\"We're excited about the new iPad Pro and its giant screen that rivals a laptop. It gives you the best of both worlds,\" says Dave Corcoran, Onshape's VP of Research & Development. \"It's perfect for CADding on the go - convenient and portable, yet spacious enough for detail-oriented work and multi-tasking.\" \n\"Onshape works on any mobile device,\" adds Corcoran. \"Engineers should be able to work where, when and how they want to - and not let their CAD system dictate those terms.\" \nMechanical engineer Christian Stark, who is using Onshape to create a precise 3D CAD model of the historic Schooner Zodiac in Bellingham, Washington, says he finds Onshape for iPad to be invaluable for his restoration effort. \n\"The original plans were lost in a fire. Using Onshape for iPad, I can take measurements and edit the 3D model as I crawl around the boat,\" Stark says. \"It's amazing what you can do. There isn't any other CAD system that lets you do this.\" \n\"Onshape also gives me the opportunity to quickly show and share the model with other team members\" he adds. \nTaking a fresh approach to CAD for mobile devices, the Onshape development team created a precise touch-screen interface that replaces traditional keyboard and mouse interactions. Every CAD command and action is controlled with a swipe or tap of your finger. The increased precision of the iPad Pro's touch screen makes it an ideal platform. \n\"Desktop-installed CAD systems are extremely limited on mobile right now,\" says Ravi Reddy, team lead for Onshape Mobile. \"We rejected the idea of providing a view-only version of CAD or just offering a subset of features. We were determined to build a full CAD product that can be used anywhere and from any device.\" \n\"We made sketching easy with touch-based finger offset tools,\" he adds. \"We also created intuitive lock and unlock modes to help with pan, zoom, and rotate operations for sketching and assemblies.\" \nOnshape is platform agnostic, working on Macs, PCs and Chromebooks, on MacOS, Windows, and Linux on all major browsers as well as natively on Android and iOS phones and tablets. Onshape for iPhone and iPad apps can be downloaded free now at the Apple Store. \nReddy says he's looking forward to seeing many more engineers and designers use CAD on a tablet: \"We believe Apple is going after enterprise and content creation apps with the iPad Pro and Onshape is well positioned to take full advantage of this development.\" \nCAD users interested in learning more about how to design on their iPad or iPhone can visit Onshape.com/Learn .
