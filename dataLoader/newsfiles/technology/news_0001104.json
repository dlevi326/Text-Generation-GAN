Most MVAS offerings in Europe consist of stand-alone services, and MNOs rely mainly on MVAS technology providers, local VARs and system integrators for MVAS planning, design and delivery. Some leading network providers such as EE, Swisscom, O2 and Telenor have developed integrated connectivity, IoT/M2M applications and VAS products for the enterprise market. EE and Swisscom have the most comprehensive MVAS portfolios in the region. Swisscom has developed its IoT/M2M, mobile applications and managed mobile services, accomplishing consistency across its footprint with global support and strategic partnerships. \nKey Findings - The European enterprise MVAS market is fairly evolved, combining technological innovation with demand forces that continue to facilitate the further expansion of services. The increasing penetration of LTE and smartphones, the adoption of MVAS platforms, IoT and connected devices and the emergence of FMC networks are the pivotal factors that will drive the growth of MVAS at enterprises over the coming years in Europe. - Enterprises in the region are prioritizing MVAS in order to empower their mobile workforces with collaboration and productivity tools that are available anywhere anytime. In a survey conducted Pyramid Research's sister company Current Analysis, 69% of European enterprise respondents expect their MVAS spending to increase in the near future, creating new prospects for MNOs and technology vendors in the region.- MNOs hold a strong position in the European MVAS market. The survey shows that enterprises in Europe often look to large network service providers such as Orange and BT to manage their MVAS. As a group, large ITSPs such as IBM and HP have the second largest share of the MVAS market, a share we expect to expand given IBM's partnership with Apple. \n- Operators initially developed MVAS strategies focused on multinational corporations and other large enterprises, only later developing plans focused on the SMB segment.- When it comes to winning MVAS deals with multinational corporations, local MNOs face strong competition from multinational operators such as EE, Telef√≥nica (O2), Orange and Vodafone that position their business services arms as full ITSPs.Synopsis'Mobile Value-Added Services in Europe: Forces Driving and Inhibiting Enterprise MVAS for MNOs,' report provides an in-depth look at the changing landscape of mobile value-added services for enterprises in Europe, covering the topic from M2M and the Internet of Things to application marketplaces and security. \n- The report analyzes the enterprise MVAS value chain and the role of MNOs in this expanding opportunity.
