One in three executives believe these emerging opportunities will improve their bottom line over the next one to two years. \nAt the same time, a number of concerns remain. Fifty-three percent of survey respondents believe the hype surrounding the IoT market has gotten ahead of itself, a rate comparable to the findings in CompTIA's 2014 survey. \n\"The data points to IoT advances on many fronts, but also confirms that like many markets for emerging technologies, it will take time for IoT to develop,\" said Tim Herbert , senior vice president, research and market intelligence, CompTIA. \n\"Many facets of IoT – standards, governance, security and privacy isues, skilled workers and other matters – need to fall into place before the market can truly blossom.\" \nHerbert will participate in an IoT panel discussion on Wednesday, Sept. 16 as part of the first ever Smart Cities Week Sept. 15-17 in Washington D.C. CompTIA is teaming with IDC for a panel session on the role of emerging technologies, the Internet of Things and smart cities in addressing drought. \n\"Fulfilling the Promise of a Blue Revolution: How Smart Cities and the Internet of Things Can Help Our Nation Cope with Drought\" is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. EDT on Sept. 16 at the Renaissance Hotel, 999 Ninth Street NW, Washington, D.C. To register, visit http://www.comptia.org/events/view/fulfilling-the-promise-of-a-blue-revolution-how-smart-cities-and-the-internet-of-things-can-help-our-nation-cope-with-drought . \nCompTIA's research identifies several areas where IoT is expected to have the greatest impact, including: Controlling and monitoring newly connected devices or systems. (Cited by 53 percent of survey respondents.) Collecting new streams of data. (46 percent) Adding intelligence to previously \"dumb\" devices or systems. (46 percent) Creating new value from connected systems. (42 percent) \nThe IT industry is at the center of much of the current IoT activity. But IoT's impact will be felt across virtually every sector of the economy as companies, government entities and other organizations explore innovative new ways to create business opportunities, deliver services and expand connectivity. \nCompTIA's Sizing Up the Internet of Things research brief is available free of charge with a simple registration at http://www.comptia.org/resources/sizing-up-the-internet-of-things .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T01:34:43.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
