Recent Data Dive partners include the Capital Area Food Bank and Apple Tree Institute. In addition, APT recently formed a 501(c)(3) non-profit ‘APT Charities,’ which provides funding directly to local organizations that have a demonstrated need and specific goals, including those that engage in or could benefit from data-driven solutions.\nJaime Nespor-Zawmon, President of SmartCEO Events, stated, “It’s no secret that Greater Washington is home to some of the region’s most impactful companies.
