Its simplicity is one of its most appealing features. \nThe Gear S2 is Samsung’s first smartwatch in a year, its first round smartwatch, and the first it has issued since Apple lobbed its Watch into the market like a consumer-generating grenade. \nSamsung has clearly been considering its response as the S2 shows the hallmarks of a more thoughtful device, as we discovered during hands-on testing before the IFA technology trade-show began in Berlin. \nIts form, for example, is a lot more like that of a typical wristwatch. From its analog style of navigation, to its traditional round face, to the standard-sized leather bands you can add to the S2 Classic, this device does not look like a shrunk computer. \nIt is a bit thicker than a standard watch, with a girth of 1.1cm, its body is just a fraction longer, and its arms stick out more than those of a traditional timepiece. \nNews_Image_File: The Gear S2 doubles as a fitness tracker. Picture: Samsung \nPut the S2 on your wrist, however, and it’s both light enough, at 47g, and comfortable enough to forget you’re wearing it. Until it buzzes with a notification, of course. \nIts apps have also been more thoughtfully organised. There are two buttons on this watch — a home key and a back key. Tap the back key and a circular list of apps appears. Users can scroll through them using that spinning top. \nThe home key can be customised to open a favourite app. \nIts screens are also easy to understand. Spin the bezel to the right and you can see your agenda, weather forecast, step count and more — each screen can be customised. Spin the bezel to the left and you can see recent notifications. \nIt’s powered by a dual-core 1GHz chip and 512MB RAM and, in our brief tests, they delivered a surprisingly responsive experience. \nNews_Image_File: Sitting on the dock, wasting time ... the Samsung Gear S2 smartwatch on its charging station.

Beneath the message, you tap an arrow to respond, and you can select from pre-prepared responses, a list of emojis, voice transcription, or a tiny keyboard. \nThat keyboard is clearly the less practical option of the four but, at a pinch, you can pick away at it and to get your message across. Given the restrictions of its 1.2-inch (3cm) round screen, letters are shown as they would be on a landline telephone, with three or four letters per button. \nThis watch can also be used to place calls, with contacts and a dialler available on its screen, and users can talk into the microphone on its right-hand side. \nSamsung has also bested its growing wearable technology competition in a few key ways inside this watch. \nFirstly, it promises up to three days of battery life. We have yet to test this claim, but it would be a significant improvement on current smartwatches. \nSecondly, this Samsung smartwatch will work with almost any Google Android smartphone thanks to its open-source Tizen software. Admittedly, some Android Wear phones will now work with Apple’s iOS, but this watch offers many more features and deserves credit for broadening its compatibility. \nNews_Image_File: Breaking now ... the Gear S2 puts the headlines on your wrist. \nThirdly, it is waterproof. Its IP68 rating means you can take this watch swimming, surfing or showering without fear it will not survive the outing. \nAnd fourthly, its apps already look promising. While Samsung smartwatches have suffered from a lack of apps, this watch has arrived with several promising offerings. \nThey include maps for easy navigation, Uber for quick private transport, Nike+ Running for fitness tracking, eBay for shopping, and, my personal favourite, The Wall Street Journal that delivers stories word by word in an uncannily effective speed-reading fashion. \nNaturally, this watch also has limitations. \nDespite the handy spinning navigation tool, you still have to tap the screen to make a selection, which seems counterintuitive, and even though this watch charges wirelessly, you must use the cradle it came with as it cannot be placed on a standard, flat Qi charging pad. \nIts body, while comfortable on the wrist, may be a little chunky for some dainty arms, and a 4G version that operates independently of a smartphone may take some time to arrive in Australia. \nQuibbles aside, Samsung’s first round smartwatch is its finest to date. It has more features, a better battery and superior waterproofing to its competition, and an addictive, spinning navigation system. The Gear S2 may turn more Australians into smartwatch fans when it arrives next month. \nJennifer Dudley-Nicholson travelled to Berlin as a guest of Samsung.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T02:23:19.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
