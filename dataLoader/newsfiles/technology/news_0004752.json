It restricts access to the mountain during certain nighttime hours and prohibits certain camping gear.\nThe rule was prompted by protesters' around-the-clock presence to prevent construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope.\nWork on the telescope has been stalled since April.\nProtesters say officers hauled them away while they were praying. In video provided by the state, officers are seen walking toward a group of people huddled in a circle and chanting.\nOfficers had to pull the arrested man, Bronson Kobayashi, off the roof of a wood-and-straw hut, where he appeared to be filming the arrests. Four officers carried him away. Kobayashi, 23, couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\nHis bail was set at $1,000 because he's a repeat offender of the rule, the state said. Bail for the women was set at $250.\nThe emergency rule, in place for 120 days, is intended to make the mountain safe for protesters, visitors and workers at the 13 telescopes already on the mountain, the state said.\nHawaii Attorney General Doug Chin told the land board that even though camping already was prohibited on the mountain, a targeted rule was necessary because of bad behavior by some protesters - ranging from putting boulders in the road to threats and harassment.\nThe Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a public agency tasked with improving Native Hawaiians' wellbeing, opposed the rule and urged the state to stop enforcing it.\nThe office condemned the arrests in a statement Wednesday.\n\"It is our understanding that the individuals were arrested this morning while they were in the act of pule, or prayer,\" the statement said. \"Native Hawaiians have constitutionally protected rights to reasonably engage in traditional and customary practices, and regulations cannot eliminate the exercise of these rights.\"\nThe rule restricts people's access to the mountain during certain nighttime hours, unless they're in a moving vehicle.\nJoshua Wisch, a spokesman for Chin's office, noted in an email that anyone who wishes is free to pray or protest in the restricted area between 4 a.m. and 10 p.m.\nThe nonprofit company building the Thirty Meter Telescope hasn't indicated when it will attempt to resume construction.\nWorkers were unable reach the site during two previous attempts, when they were blocked by hundreds of protesters, including dozens who were arrested.\nThis was the fourth time telescope opponents have been arrested on the mountain.\n__\nFollow Jennifer Sinco Kelleher at http://www.twitter.com/JenHapa .\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
