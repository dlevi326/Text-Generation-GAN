They had earlier gained as much as 4.5 percent.\nAlibaba said it now expects GMV to be lower in mid-single digits on a percentage basis from its earlier estimates.\nThe company was \"still in early innings in terms of mobile monetization,\" said Jane Penner, head of investor relations, at Citi's Global Tech Conference on Tuesday.\nGross merchandise volume is the total value of transactions made on Alibaba's platforms and is one of the most closely watched metrics for e-commerce companies.\nThe company also said its expects growth in its AliExpress business to slow to low double digits for the quarter ending September due to weakening currencies in markets such as Russia and Brazil.\nThe AliExpress business is a global online marketplace for shoppers to buy directly from China. A majority of Alibaba's international commerce retail business revenue is generated by AliExpress.\nWorries on margins, slower growth in China and a sell-off in tech ADRs have taken a bite out of Alibaba's shares, which now trade firmly below the IPO price of $68.\nUp to Friday's close, the company's shares had fallen about 39 percent this year.\n(Reporting By Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru and Vikram Subhedar in London; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T22:10:52.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
