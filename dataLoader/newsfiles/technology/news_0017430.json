Dan Briggs, the Founder and current CEO of Orbis, will become Chief Growth Officer focused on new business development and strategic growth initiatives. Hodownes joins Orbis from Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), where he was CEO of the College of Online & Continuing Education. His colleague Johnson Au-Yeung, CIO at Southern New Hampshire University, will also join Orbis as CIO. Under their direction, SNHU became one of the largest and fastest growing colleges in the United States, with more than 1,200 employees, 3,000 adjunct faculty and 70,000 students. Prior to Hodownes’ tenure at SNHU, he was President of Embanet, a provider of online program management services acquired by Pearson in 2012.\n“The talented management team at SNHU used cutting edge data analytics, student services and technology to deliver a superior online education experience, and it led to explosive growth for the university,” said Hodownes. “Orbis has similarly demonstrated its ability to be one of the highest quality providers in the online program management space with world-class outcomes for both students and its academic partners. We’re helping alleviate the largest nursing shortage in U.S. history by giving colleges and universities the resources to keep pace with demand and, together, graduating highly-skilled, job-ready practitioners. The company’s reputation for quality and focus on professions with significant employer demand are major differentiators that I’m excited to build on.”\n“We are excited to have Steve join the Orbis team,” said Briggs. “Steve will bring a significant level of experience and leadership to the team, allowing Orbis to continue toward its goal of being the premier Outsourced Program Management company in the healthcare education sector.”\nOrbis Education helps solve healthcare workforce shortages by creating collaborative partnerships between academic institutions and employers. The company’s expertise in hybrid learning and relationships within the academic and healthcare communities have made it the industry leader in managing clinically intensive healthcare programs such as nursing and occupational therapy. With the addition of Hodownes, Orbis will seek to expand its online program management offerings to help more partners and students reach their academic, employment and economic goals.\n“Steve is known throughout the industry as an innovative marketer who has helped reinvent online education. We are extremely fortunate to have him join the Orbis team,” said Doug Kelsall, Chairman of the Orbis Board of Directors. “His track record of building high quality, high growth businesses is unmatched and his ability to attract partnership interest from other schools can help Orbis continue to expand both within and outside of the healthcare space.”", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmJpc2VkdWNhdGlvbi5jb20="], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T16:15:42.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
