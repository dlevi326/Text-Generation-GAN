for the driver and even their horses.\n\"A permanent video feed through to the dashboard from the trailer has the potential to distract the driver from the road ahead.\n\"Instead we are developing a more intelligent system that is able to detect a problem with the horse in the trailer and warn the driver.\n\"The video is then available for owners to view the inside of the trailer and support a decision to pull over and check the horse.\"\nGetty Foal play: Transporting ponies can be perilous\nDr Emma Puntis, am associate of the British Animal Rescue and Trauma Care Association, is planning to study Land Rover's new system in a bid to \"better understand horse stress and distress during travel\".\n\"Whether it is to help prevent road accidents and injuries to horse and handler, or even to simply ensure your horse arrives at its destination stress free, I'm sure every owner would like to learn how to reduce stress for their horse during travel.\n\"Gaining a better understanding of the environment inside the trailer, and the horse's reaction to it, would make the animal more comfortable during travel and ensure the horse is capable of performing to the best of its ability.\"\nLand Rover's new technology will be shown off at the Burghley Horse Trials from September 3.\nPoll loading â€¦\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0CDwQFjAEahUKEwiN6a6SxNXHAhVta9sKHVBmC6w&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fall-about%2Fland-rover&ei=L3HlVc2VAe3W7QbQzK3gCg&usg=AFQjCNFSjOcz0nknlRbTiYHroTB0bycDew&cad=rja", "http://newsroom.jaguarlandrover.com/en-in/land-rover/news/2015/09/lr_cargo_sense_app_burghley_010915/", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/jasperhamill", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech"], "published": "2015-09-01T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:11:59.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
