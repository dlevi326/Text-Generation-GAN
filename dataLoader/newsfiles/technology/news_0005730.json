The company claims that it has deployed 2,000 public hotspots with 6,500 total access points, which includes private hotspots in educational institutions, hospitals and hotels. \nOzone Wi-Fi locations include McDonald’s, Costa Coffee, Oberoi Hotels, Barista coffee, Mumbai airport, Apollo Hospitals, KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, it said in the statement. \nOzone competes with some telecom players such as Bharti Airtel, Tata Teleservices, and Idea Cellular, which have also been in the wi-fi hub business. \nThe company had raised a seed round of funding in 2008 from New York-based Access Industries whose portfolio includes global telecom, media and television investments, chemicals, real estate, and the commodity business. \nIn November 2014, Ozone also entered into a ‘Wi-Fi as a service’ strategic partnership agreement with Ericsson to provide carrier-grade Wi-Fi network across 30 cities in India. \nPresently, there are about 30,000 commercial wi-fi hotspots in India – across 30 municipalities and 105 airports. By 2018, India is predicted to have about two million wi-fi hotspots, with around 400 municipalities likely to deploy wi-fi hotspots. \n“Public wi-fi is an affordable way for many people in India to access the internet, who might otherwise be excluded,” said New Call Telecom CEO Nigel Eastwood. \nNew Call had last year acquired Nimbuzz, an instant messaging platform boasting 210 million users including many in India. Recently, it announced that it is in talks with more Indian companies to acquire businesses over the next year. \nIn the UK, it operates the country’s fastest-growing residential broadband provider, Fuel Broadband, and a number of international calling services. Last year, it also acquired global voice wholesale and call termination company WaveCrest, which also operates voice calling apps for many major international brands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T09:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T09:56:28.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
