The 20-city index gained 5 per cent year-over-year.\nEconomists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 5.1 per cent increase in the 20-city index.\nDavid Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said the home-price index has risen at a 4 per cent or higher annual rate since September 2012, well ahead of inflation.\n\"Prices of existing homes and housing overall are seeing strong growth and contributing to recent solid growth for the economy,\" he said.\nMonth-over-month price gains were modest. Not seasonally adjusted, the US Index rose 0.7 per cent from June to July. The 10-city index and 20-city index both rose 0.6 per cent over the month.\nAfter seasonal adjustment the national index was up 0.4 per cent. The 10-city and 20-city composite were both down 0.2 per cent over the month.\nThe hottest markets in the country continued to show sharp price gains, with San Francisco recording gains of 10.4 per cent, Denver of 10.3 per cent and Dallas of 8.7 per cent.\nThe housing market has been slowing in recent months after a strong start to the year. Most economists view the cooling off as healthy because they note prices in many markets were increasing faster than incomes, making it difficult for younger buyers to afford to buy a home.\nMost recently, the National Association of Realtors said a forward-looking indicator of the housing market -- -- its pending home-sales index, which is based on signings for purchases of previously owned homes -- -- declined 1.4 per cent. The realtors blamed a lack of supply of homes on the market for stifling sales.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:35:46.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
