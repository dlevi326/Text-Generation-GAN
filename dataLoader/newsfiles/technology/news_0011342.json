The survival advantage was observed during an interim safety check in July, which prompted a halt to the study because of the significant benefit.\nIn the second study, a drug called cabozantinib from Exelixis Inc. kept kidney cancer in check for 7.4 months before it got worse compared with 3.8 months for Afinitor, a 42% reduction in the rate of disease progression. There was a trend toward improved survival, but researchers indicated longer follow-up is needed to determine what the advantage is.\nThe benefit from both treatments compared with Afinitor \"is unequivocal, \" according to an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where both studies were published. The findings were also presented Friday at the European Cancer Congress in Vienna.\nBut only a fraction of patients had what researchers consider an objective response to the treatments--25% for Opdivo and 21% for cabozantinib. Complete responses, in which doctors can't find remaining evidence of disease, were \"disappointingly elusive,\" the editorial said. Ways to better identify patients who might benefit or to combine the drugs with other treatments are needed to \"expand the benefit spectrum,\" it said.\nAbout 338,000 new cases of kidney cancer are diagnosed world-wide and more than 100,000 die of the disease each year, researchers said. In the U.S. there are nearly 62,000 new cases and about 14,000 deaths each year, according to the American Cancer Society. About 30% of cases are diagnosed after the disease has already metastasized or spread beyond the kidney. Several new treatments--Afinitor among them--have been approved during the past decade, but generally their long-term benefit is modest at best.\nOpdivo, a so-called checkpoint inhibitor that targets an immune-system brake called PD-1, works by enabling immune cells to attack cancer. In the new study, involving 821 patients, the drug improved survival even though it failed to statistically improve a related measure called progression free survival, or the time it took for the disease to worsen. That result was 4.6 months for Opdivo and 4.4 months for Afinitor. The finding may reflect the unpredictable ways tumors sometimes respond to cancer-immunotherapy.\nThe checkpoint inhibitors \"don't tend to hit progression-free survival endpoints,\" said Padmanee Sharma, scientific director of the Immunotherapy Platform at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and a principal investigator on the study. \"Overall survival is the gold standard. It tells you that patients are living longer, not just that tumors stopped growing\" for a while. Researchers said 19% of Opdivo patients reported serious side effects compared with 37% of those on Afinitor.\nBristol-Myers said last week that based on the data, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Opdivo breakthrough therapy designation under a program intended to hasten review of drugs that show early promise against serious illnesses. The company hasn't disclosed filing plans for kidney cancer. The drug is already approved for advanced melanoma and lung cancer.\nCabozantanib is approved in a capsule for thyroid cancer under the brand name Cometriq, but in a form different from the pill tested in the kidney cancer trial. In the trial, 60% of patients had to reduce their doses because of side effects compared with 25% on Afinitor; 9% of discontinued treatment because of the adverse events compared with 10% on Afinitor.\nThe drug also has breakthrough therapy designation status for kidney cancer and Exelixis said it expects to complete its regulatory filings for that indication by the end of this year.\nWrite to Ron Winslow at ron.winslow@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"Exelixis, Inc.\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US30161Q1040\n 26, 2015 01:40 ET (05:40 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US30161Q1040", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T11:43:07.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
