Glenn Hunt by Ruth Callaghan As MBA schools wrestle with just-in-time demands from students, the job market also has instant needs – including businesses that can see the value of an MBA graduate, just not on a permanent basis.\nIt has prompted the rise of freelance companies connecting MBAs with people who could use their expertise, including US-based HourlyNerd, which recently raised more than $US10 million ($13.9 million) for its model, sometimes dubbed \"MBAs on the cheap\".\nBritish-based MBA & Co started in 2009 and claims more than 20,000 consultants worldwide, including 2500 in Australia.\nChief executive Daniel Callaghan says the services of their \"vetted, experienced\" consultants are part of an international trend in which specialised skills no longer reside solely in large consulting firms.\n\"There's a huge migration of brilliant talent out of the large firms and they are operating as independents,\" he says.\n\"The on-demand economy in our view facilitates immediate access [to this group] to meet ad hoc need.\n\"If you look at the large FTSE100 companies and other organisations, about 30 per cent of HR professionals are now having to incorporate this movement into their talent plan. It's not a trend that is going away.\"\nFor MBAs, who must have a minimum five years of commercial experience and a postgraduate degree to join MBA & Co, there are personal benefits as well.\n \"We have professionals who like the excitement and passion around choosing the projects they get to work on and in the process earning the same amount or even more than if they were still in the corporate environment,\" Callaghan says.\nMBA & Co charges 15 to 25 per cent, with an average project value of $30,000, which might include 20 to 40 days of work.\n\"There's complete flexibility,\" Callaghan says of the range of projects MBA & Co takes on.\n\"We have projects that are roughly £250 ($540), which can be just an hour or so with an expert, but we also have our largest project, which has gone on for two an a half years with a team working across five European markets. \"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:04:24.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
