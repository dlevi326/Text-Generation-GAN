Within the context of these projects, innovative operational and planning models will be developed to assess the impacts and benefits of large scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy and different storage technologies in the UK power system. You will be responsible for: modelling PV energy output potential across the UK; assessing the impact of PV scenarios on reserve requirements; modelling the UK power system operation under different renewable energy scenarios (including primarily PV as well as wind) and different storage technologies considering state of the art unit commitment tools commercially available or purposely built; assessing the techno-economic impact of renewable energy sources and storage on conventional generation plants and relevant market implications; assessing the environmental benefits of PV and storage at the system level. \nYou should have or be about to obtain a PhD (or hold an MSc degree coupled with relevant industrial/research experience) in an area related to modelling and analysis of distributed energy resources. Proven experience of programming (e.g., in Matlab, etc) plus experience in development of computer codes for unit commitment models and/or use of commercial tools (e.g., Plexos) for techno-economic assessment of power system operation is required. \nYou should also have excellent communication skills with the ability to present results in technical reports, and prepare scientific papers for publication in international journals. Finally, you should have strong collaborative abilities and be able to work effectively under your own initiative as well as interacting with other members of the research team/project. \nThe School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering is committed to promoting equality and diversity, including the Athena SWAN charter for promoting women’s careers in STEMM subjects (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine) in higher education.
