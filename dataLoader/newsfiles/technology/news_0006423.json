Could not subscribe, try again later \nActor Nolan North, star of the hit games series Uncharted , has sensationally admitted that computer games are sexist. \nNorth, who is world famous as the voice of swashbuckling hero Nathan Drake, said games too often featured women with \"big boobs and bikinis\". \nSexism in games is a hot topic at the moment, with feminists demanding designers introduce characters with more depth than the typical scantily-clad damsels in distress. Publicity picture Sex Appeal: Nolan North is the actor who gives voice to Nathan Drake, seen here in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End \nIn an exclusive interview with Mirror Online, Nolan North admitted the industry had a gender problem - but offered a hopeful perspective on its future direction. \n\"For a long time, games were just, you could call it, sexist,\" said the father-of-two. \n\"It was just business, because what happens when teenage boys are your main audience? \n\"You design big, badass superheroes and women with big boobs and bikinis.\" \nHowever, he also predicted this sexism would disappear as gamers became older and more refined. \nUncharted 3: Drake's Deception \n\"Gamers used to be kids, stoned in the basement with their earbuds in, jamming out to rock music and playing video games,\" he continued. \n\"But as players get older, they are expecting better material.\" \nHe pointed to the redesign of Tomb Raider star Lara Croft as evidence sexism is \"getting better\". \nCover up: Lara Croft is a much more realistic character these days \nIn recent years, this famous female icon has been altered from a ludicrously pneumatic sexpot with massive boobs to a lithe, battle hardened explorer. \nThe campaign group Feminist Frequency recently claimed \"women’s bodies are employed as rewards for player actions, a pattern which frames female bodies and sexuality as status symbols designed to validate the masculinity of presumed straight male players\". \nIt also suggested just 9% of games showcased at this year's E3 show exclusively featured male protagonists. \nUncharted 4: A Thief's End, the next installment in the smash series, is expected to be released next year.
