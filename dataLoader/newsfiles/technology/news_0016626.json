The device, made by Lempesis' employer Suitable Technologies, was 15th in line in front of the Palo Alto store, according to ABC 7 News .\nWhile she acknowledged that she could have ordered the phone online, Lempesis told ABC 7 News that being in line is \"really an experience.\"\nLempesis told NBC Bay Area's Bob Redell that she got the OK from the store manager to pay for her new iPhone by credit card. After purchasing the device, she would have someone drop it into the robot's pouch, then have the robot locked in the store, according to NBC. She plans to pick up the phone in person on Monday.\nLempesis said she stayed awake and in front of her video camera for the entire time.\nApple fans lined up at Apple stores around the world this week, eager to buy the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus. The devices start at $199 or $299 with a two-year contract. Pre-orders began earlier this month. New features on the device include 3D Touch and \"live photos.\"\nLempesis told NBC Bay Area that she chose the Palo Alto store because Apple CEO Tim Cook might make an appearance, like he did for last year's release of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.\n\"This is the heart of Silicon Valley, this is where you want to be if you're waiting in line,\" she told Redell.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/apple?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/BobNBC/status/647380660651360256", "http://t.co/eOnJfUlX96", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/PaloAlto?src=hash", "http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/BeamPro-Robot-in-Line-at-Palo-Alto-Apple-Store-to-Buy-New-iPhone-329503841.html", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhone6s?src=hash", "http://abc7news.com/technology/people-robot-wait-in-line-for-new-iphone-6s-in-palo-alto-/1001082/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/iphone6splus?src=hash", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-25T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T21:49:45.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
