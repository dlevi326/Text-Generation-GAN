We can be sure that the future will bring a dizzying array of new technology, which our students will be expected to learn, as technology has created a new kind of literacy for students everywhere. \nOne thing is clear — the future will belong to those who can master the new technology, and not all students will have the opportunity to learn this technology at home. Educators must face the critical reality that the money must be found and the technology must be integrated to achieve success for all of our students. \nThroughout society, philosophies on the expansion and use of technology vary. However, the general agreement among educators is that technology must be integrated to prepare our students for competition in a global economy. Schools in the U.S. have lagged behind, partially due to budget and partially due to fear that technology will overwhelm the ability to teach skills and critical thinking. No teacher wants to sacrifice real learning and knowledge of subject matter at the expense of technology integration. In Santa Fe, the school district utilizes technology as a tool for enhancing teaching and learning without diluting the learning process. \nSanta Fe Public Schools’ five-year Digital Learning Plan represents a revolution in digital classroom learning and models how technology can be adopted to enhance learning, advance knowledge of the subject matter, and take teaching and learning to a new and powerful level. \nIn the SFPS Digital Learning Plan, which began implementation a year ago, technology will continue to be phased in over the next four years, with complete integration slated for 2019. Currently, teachers are provided with a Suite of Technology for classroom use which includes a tablet, a laptop, two desktops, an Interactive White Board (aka Smart Board), schoolwide Wi-Fi, and access to a classroom set of tablets for every student. Technology is a current-day form of literacy, much like reading, writing and math, and SFPS is committed helping students become literate in this new literacy medium. \nTechnology as a tool for learning provides an additional opportunity for students to master concepts. In some cases, students can write an essay and then create a PowerPoint presentation to accompany their essay and demonstrate their learning. Other students can shoot and edit videos as part of their assignments. \nFurthermore, technology has enhanced the learning experience in our bilingual and special-education programs as well. Multimedia expands the creative ways in which language can be taught and technology has made communication easier for some of our special education students. That use of technology is the future coming to life in the classroom. \nSanta Fe Public Schools is funding the program through a $55 million technology bond, which demonstrates the district’s and the community’s commitment to the Digital Learning Plan. \nIn the new high-tech classroom, subject matter learning and skills development become more important and more relevant to students, and they are motivated to master their subjects through the use of the technology. In this way they become captains of their own learning. The future is here — let us help our students navigate their futures and achieve the success they deserve. \nJoel Boyd, Ed.D., is the superintendent of Santa Fe Public Schools in Santa Fe, N.M. 3 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/1UtdCNK TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T13:32:13.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
