Predictive analytics pioneer and former SPSS chair Jack Noonan and former Oracle executive Chris LaBruna will join six existing advisors to guide Prevedere’s go-to-market strategy and position the company as an integral tool for developing accurate forecasts that drive more profitable business decisions. “I am thrilled to welcome Jack and Chris to our advisory team,” said Rich Wagner, president & CEO at Prevedere. “The combined 50+ years of experience in enterprise management, engineering and technology that Jack and Chris bring to our advisory board will help Prevedere set a new standard in business planning and economic intelligence.”\nWith more than 30 years of technology experience, including leading one of the top predictive analytics companies in the world, Noonan will leverage his expertise to provide strategic guidance as Prevedere expands its enterprise client base. As former chairman, president and CEO of SPSS Inc., he was directly responsible for taking the company public in 1993. In addition to his 17 years at SPSS, Noonan also spent 10 years in leadership and software engineering at IBM Corporation. Presently, he serves on the board of directors for Morningstar, Lionbridge Technologies and Fleetmatics Group PLC.\n“I was immediately intrigued by Prevedere’s ability to put real-time, complex data in the hands of corporate executives in a format that is immediately actionable,” said Noonan. “While we know that external factors have a significant impact on business performance, it’s previously been quite difficult for companies to quantify that impact and use it in business planning. I look forward to helping businesses realize the power of combining external insights with predictive analytics to drive their forecasts and decisions.”\nLaBruna also brings extensive technology experience to the Prevedere advisory board. He has been leading high performance field organizations for more than 20 years, and currently serves as chief revenue officer at Saama Technologies, Inc. Prior to Saama, he served as vice president for both Oracle and Hyperion.\nNoonan and LaBruna join Prevedere’s existing advisory board of technology and finance leaders: John Christman, Joseph Ellis, Dan Fishback, Don Fowler, Kevin McGuire and Michael Schuler.\n###\nAbout Prevedere\nPrevedere offers executives an unprecedented view of business performance, empowering smarter, more profitable decisions.
