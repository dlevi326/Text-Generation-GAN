The survey looked at four key consumer electronic categories including smartphones, TVs, laptops and tablets and – for the first time – wearable devices. \nThe survey results showed that 91 per cent respondents made a major electronics purchase over the last 12 months with smartphones (69 per cent) topping their shopping list followed by TVs (36 per cent), laptops (32 per cent), tablets (29 per cent), camera (18 per cent) and wearable devices (11 per cent) \nNearly half – 47 per cent – are willing to pay between Dh2,001 and Dh3,000 for a smartphone with brand and price remain the two dominant considerations driving smartphone consideration and purchase. \nOmar Abushaban, General Manager of Plug-Ins, said Samsung is still the leader in the market (41 per cent) followed by Apple (36 per cent) in the smartphone category together accounting for 77 per cent of the UAE market. HTC (3.8 per cent) and Sony (3.7 per cent) are the next highest. \nApproximately 42 per cent of respondents said they would replace their smartphone every two years with their primary motivation coming from a new model launches while 36 per cent of the respondents said they would consider buying a new phone when there were special offers and discounts \n“Survey provides useful insights about UAE residents shopping habits and patterns... We believe the insights derived from the survey can help shape the marketing and commercial strategies of retailers, vendors and other key stakeholders in order to further improve overall customer experiences at the stores,” he added. \nIn the television segment, the results showed that demand for 40-42 inch panel size leads with 43 per cent followed by 33.5 per cent for with 30-39 inch sets. \nNearly 45 per cent of the survey respondents said their next panel size would be 46-50” and a further 25 per cent said they would buy a 55-60” panel size indicating a preference to bigger screen sizes by UAE residents. \nBased on these trends, Plug-Ins’ Abushaban said the company will no more sell TV panels of 32-inch and smaller.
