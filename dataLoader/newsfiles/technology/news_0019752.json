The LYNX delivers 4G LTE capability for rapidly deployable communications to wireless operators and to support first responders for disaster recovery or humanitarian missions. Additionally, the LYNX has been specifically designed to address requirements for vertical market applications. Whether deployed on an oil platform, mining site, or for the enterprise, Tecore’s newest platform enables private operators to “Bring Your Own Network TM .” \nIn line with the industry evolution to LTE-A and LTE-U, the LYNX provides the requisite spectrum flexibility allowing configuration of the operating band, aggregation set, and parameters to match the requirements of the deployed location. The LYNX can change its operational configuration from site-to-site based on the available spectrum (licensed or not) while continuing to offer a consistent 4G LTE service to the users. Providing a complete LTE network in a package no larger than a shoe box, the LYNX addresses the needs for commercial and private networks to tactically deploy service and coverage as their operations dictate. Please visit http://www.tecore.com/product/lynx-network-in-a-box-nib/ for more details. \n“Whether you are a commercial or private network operator, Tecore is ideally suited to enable the deployment of a cost-effective, size optimal, adaptable platform anywhere in the world, including the most densely populated to the most remote and rugged locations,” said Casey Joseph, Executive Vice President. “While the requirements of any network deployment are distinct from one to the next, all users face the same basic challenges in providing reliable communications in non-permissive environments - our extensive experience in deploying networks in these types of areas make us the ideal solution provider for these customers.” \nAdditionally, the LYNX operates in a local virtualized machine environment allowing the incorporation of third party applications and services onto the same platform. By leveraging the power of Tecore’s Mobility Virtualized Platform ® (MVP) and the next generation software defined network capability, operators can locally incorporate custom application suites and security enclaves that match the requirements of the deployment. \n“The flexible operation of the LYNX allows for the incorporation of the local system into a larger network infrastructure making the local service an extension of the network,” added Jay Salkini, Tecore’s Founder and Head of Product Innovations. “In support of situations where reach back connectivity is not available, the LYNX provides the option for standalone local operation. We look forward to showcasing this in Las Vegas at the CTIA show.” \nTecore Executives will be available to discuss the many additional features and benefits of the LYNX and the complete product portfolio to address your network needs.
