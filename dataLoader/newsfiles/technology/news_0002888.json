(booth #501). Purpose built for the quick-service food industry, Clearview by Panasonic is a highly flexible and scalable web-based solution for financial management, food cost management, and labor management. \n“With the variety of POS solutions used by QSR operators today, they require a comprehensive back office solution that can easily adapt to meet their individual needs and POS solutions inventories,” said Jeff Pinc, Director of Food Services, Panasonic System Communications Company of North America. “Clearview by Panasonic back office software can integrate with multiple POS systems, providing a cost-efficient roadmap for upgrading POS solutions while providing a tool to help lower labor costs, employee turnover rates and food costs incurred by waste and human error. At Panasonic, we understand it’s about more than just hardware – we are a true partner with a wide breadth of technology solutions designed to help grow your business and increase ROI.” \nPanasonic recently finished the acquisition of a 51 percent share of Canada-based Quick Service Software Inc. (QSS), creator of the Clearview web-based solution. This acquisition further establishes the company as an industry leader and single-source solution provider for the food services industry. \nClearview integrates seamlessly with multiple POS systems, accounting packages, payroll vendors, and suppliers to create a sophisticated yet easy-to-use consolidated dashboard for complex multi-unit operations. The solution is used by thousands of restaurants to optimize and automate food orders, cash management, scheduling, financial tracking, reporting, and much more, maximizing profits from every dollar earned and providing unprecedented business insight for multi-unit operators and franchisors at both individual store and aggregate levels. \n“QSR operators face intense competition, price pressures and thin margins,” said David N. Jones, President, Quick Service Software Inc. “Our relationship with Panasonic will enable us to extend our reach and supply more operators with a back office solution that helps them manage their restaurants more efficiently and improve their bottom line.” \nThe company will also be showcasing a number of other technology at FSTEC including: \nRugged Tablet and Mobile POS Solutions \nAs the EMV mandate approaches next month, requiring operators to implement chip-and-pin technology or face fraud liability, Panasonic developed the Toughpad® FZ-R1 , the world’s first 7” all-in-one mobile POS tablet running Windows 8.1 for line busting and tableside ordering while providing secure transaction capabilities. With its integrated EMV reader with PIN pad, encrypted mag stripe reader and NFC compatibility, the Intel®-based Toughpad FZ-R1 can handle all forms of electronic payment, giving operators and their customers’ confidence that financial data is secure. \nPanasonic will also be demoing a number of other purpose-built tablet solutions for line busting, tableside ordering and workforce management. Rugged tablets, such as the 10.1” Toughpad FZ-G1 enable restaurant managers to come out of the back office and onto the restaurant floor, increasing ROI and productivity. \nFixed Point-of-Sale Solutions \nThe company will also highlight its latest POS workstation, the Stingray III . This enterprise-grade POS device features an all-in-one flexible, modular design, and is compatible with a variety of Microsoft Windows operating systems. The Stingray III’s versatile design features interchangeable touchscreens, allowing easy customization to meet individual retailer requirements with unlimited mounting options. \nDrive Thru Solutions \nIn an effort to increase efficiencies and sales in the drive-thru, Panasonic developed the fully-integrated Digital Drive-Thru . The solution combines scalable weatherproof, glare-resistant outdoor displays with outdoor mounting, integrated audio and video capabilities, including a built-in order confirmation screen eliminating the need for a separate, standalone unit. The Digital Drive-Thru creates a platform for digital marketing and real-time promotions, unifies menu management and improves the overall customer experience. \nPanasonic QSR Indoor Digital Signage Solutions \nPanasonic also offers indoor digital signage solutions for QSR applications, including menu boards, greeter boards, promotional signage, private network displays and self-service food ordering kiosks. These complete solutions include displays, media players, content creation, remote monitoring and content management, as well as installation and service. Panasonic digital signage provides rapid, measurable ROI, while reducing costs, driving higher ticket sales and improving the customer experience inside the restaurant. \nSecurity and Management Solutions \nThe company will showcase its Virtual Site Manager , an integrated solution designed to provide remote store management from anywhere with the click of a mouse or tap on a tablet PC screen. Combining the power of video surveillance technology with point-of-sale systems, the solution pairs recorded video footage with transactional data, giving operators critical insight that can improve store operations, reduce loss and bring incremental revenue. In addition to preventing shrinkage, video analytics can provide invaluable data that can be used to streamline procedures, enhance marketing efforts and inform merchandising strategy. With just a few clicks, operators can verify and control inventory, view traffic volume and patterns and confirm employee training. \nFollow Panasonic Solutions for Business \nPanasonic for Business Solutions can be followed on social media channels, including Twitter , YouTube and Panasonic for Business blog . \nPanasonic Solutions for Business \nPanasonic delivers game-changing technology solutions that deliver a customized experience to drive better outcomes—for our customers and our customers' customers.
