European regulators are still examining whether Google manipulated other types of search results to keep traffic away from sites that could diminish its advertising sales.\nGoogle has denied the allegations in Europe. If it loses the case in Europe, Google could be fined more the $6 billion.\nAntitrust regulators in the U.S. wrapped up a probe into Google's practices in 2013 without requiring that the company make any major changes to how it ranks websites.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
