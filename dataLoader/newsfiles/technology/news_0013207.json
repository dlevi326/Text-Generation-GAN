The eruption, which is classified as a gamma-ray burst, or GRB, and designated GRB 130427A, produced the highest-energy ... The frequency of high-energy gamma ray bursts September 22, 2014 \nIn the 1960s a series of satellites were built as part of Project Vela. Project Vela was intended to detect violations of the 1963 ban on above ground testing of nuclear weapons. The Vela satellites were designed to detect ... Strange supernova is 'missing link' in gamma-ray burst connection April 27, 2015 \nAstronomers using the National Science Foundation's Very Large Array (VLA) have found a long-sought \"missing link\" between supernova explosions that generate gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and those that don't. The scientists found ... Biggest explosions in the universe powered by strongest magnets July 8, 2015 \nObservations from ESO's La Silla and Paranal Observatories in Chile have for the first time demonstrated a link between a very long-lasting burst of gamma rays and an unusually bright supernova explosion. The results show ... 5 billion light years across—the largest feature in the universe August 4, 2015 \nA Hungarian-US team of astronomers have found what appears to be the largest feature in the observable universe: a ring of nine gamma ray bursts – and hence galaxies - 5 billion light years across. The scientists, led by ... Surprising giant ring-like structure in the universe September 7, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—Five billion light years is a distance almost inconceivable, even on a cosmic scale. To better illustrate the extent of this physical quantity, it's enough to say that 35,000 galaxies the size of our Milky Way ... Recommended for you Shocks in a distant gamma-ray burst September 14, 2015 \nGamma ray bursts (GRBs)—flashes of high-energy light occur about once a day, randomly, from around the sky—are the brightest events in the known universe. While a burst is underway, it is many millions of times brighter ... Astronomers peer into the 'amniotic sac' of a planet-hosting star September 13, 2015 \nAstronomers have successfully peered through the 'amniotic sac' of a star that is still forming to observe the innermost region of a burgeoning solar system for the first time. Mysterious, massive, magnetic stars September 11, 2015 \nA Canadian PhD student has discovered a unique object – two massive stars with magnetic fields in a binary system. Matt Shultz of Queen's University, Ontario, Canada found the system – Epsilon Lupi – and will publish ... New Pluto images from NASA's New Horizons September 11, 2015 \nNew close-up images of Pluto from NASA's New Horizons spacecraft reveal a bewildering variety of surface features that have scientists reeling because of their range and complexity. Ceres' bright spots seen in striking new detail September 9, 2015 \nThe brightest spots on the dwarf planet Ceres gleam with mystery in new views delivered by NASA's Dawn spacecraft. These closest-yet views of Occator crater, with a resolution of 450 feet (140 meters) per pixel, give scientists ... Astronomers discover how lowly dwarf galaxy becomes star-forming powerhouse September 9, 2015 \nA nearby dwarf galaxy poses an intriguing mystery: How is it able to form brilliant star clusters without the dusty, gas-rich environments found in larger galaxies? The answer, astronomers believe, lies in densely packed ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T15:14:38.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
