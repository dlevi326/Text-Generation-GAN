Unicomer, which operates more than 830 stores under various banners in 20 countries including the United States, is leveraging Starmount Engage and Connect, in conjunction with an existing Oracle Retail POS deployment, for 106 stores in El Salvador. The rollout is the first phase of an IT transformation project that tailors Starmount’s mobile solutions to Unicomer’s business model. Unicomer uses Starmount Engage as a platform for implementing its sales order process, while Starmount Connect handles the transfer of data between stores and back-end systems. Key benefits include improved financial accountability and audit capabilities, streamlined initiation and tracking of warranty service requests, and a standardized, single view of the business. Now that the first phase of the project in El Salvador is complete, the baseline has been established for the rest of the global rollout.“Starmount has expertly guided Unicomer Group through a complex IT transformation process, while helping us streamline and standardize our core business operations,” said Guillermo Siman, vice chairman and executive VP, Unicomer Group. “In addition to complex business issues, there were significant language and cultural barriers to overcome along the way, but working together, we overcame every challenge. Starmount’s innovations will enable our customers to have a single, seamless experience in the countries that we serve, regardless of where they shop.” Recommended stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T00:56:55.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
