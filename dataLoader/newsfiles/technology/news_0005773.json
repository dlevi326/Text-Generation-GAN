He also repeatedly said he could not “recall any of the specific details” about the case.\n“If there was any criminal activity that I was aware of I would have made sure it was appropriately dealt with. I feel confident this was the case,” he said.\nMr Morrow was Vodafone Australia chief executive when its Australian fraud investigator, Colin Yates, employed by Vodafone Group in June 2012, raised the hacking concerns — and other serious alleged legal breaches — with the telco giant’s global head of security in London.\nDespite those “very serious” ­allegations, Vodafone covered up the hacking of the phone, failing to report it to authorities or notify the journalist, Fairfax investigative ­reporter Natalie O’Brien.\n“Any details behind this really need to be referred to Vodafone, it’s not a matter for NBN nor is it a matter for me, Bill Morrow,” Mr Morrow said.\n“I reported nothing to the police, Senator, because I was not aware of any of the details that are being currently reported in the news. I had no specific discussions with anybody about any criminal activity outside of Vodafone.”\nThe January 2011 hacking of O’Brien’s phone by Vodafone — to discover her sources after a story she broke exposing major ­security and privacy concerns at the telco — was revealed by The Weekend Australian on Saturday .\nMr Morrow said Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull was not told about the incident prior to his appointment as NBN boss.\nThis story was first published in The Australian Business Review.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/vodafone-hacked-journalists-phone-to-trace-whistleblowers/story-fn9ymmvo-1227523487683"], "published": "2015-09-14T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T07:54:58.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
