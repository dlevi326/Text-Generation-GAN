Our belief is that no matter how many ideologies there are, there can be differences of opinion regarding them, but there should be debate on all ideologies,” Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, addressing the function.\nIf there could be a debate on (communist leader) Manabendra Nath Roy’s “radical humanism”, why can’t there be a discussion on Deendayal ji’s idea of “integral humanism?” he wondered. “If you can teach radical humanism in the text books, why integral humanism cannot be also discussed?”\nThe events to be organised during the year to mark the Jana Sangh leader’s birth centenary will give a “big opportunity” to the government to present his “personality and views” before the nation, said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.\nWhen asked why the NMML was chosen for the launch of centenary celebration of Jana Sangh leader, Union Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma told reporters that the mandate of the institution was not only limited to spreading the message of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru but to highlight contributions of other great leaders too.\n“I think it is fortunate if, as per the objectives behind this institution, apart from Nehruji, others who contributed to the freedom struggle or making of modern India also find place here,” he told reporters.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T06:25:55.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
