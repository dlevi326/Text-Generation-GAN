But the goal is to have all stakeholders involved in the development and administration of the system rather than having the Fed or some other governmental agency dictate the rules for and operate the system. \nMany other countries, most notably the UK, already have real-time payments systems that the task force is seeking to mimic or better. The UK system was developed and launched before some of the current payment technologies were unveiled. So one of the goals for the faster payments system in the U.S. is for it to have open technology that will be able to include not only today’s payment technologies, but also yet-to-be developed payment technologies. \n“Fifty-four percent of people prefer a P2P payment system that comes from their financial institution, but we’ve done a horrible job with this as financial people,” said Peter Gordon, senior vice president, payment strategy in enterpise product office at FIS, a member of the task force’s steering committee. \nGordon expects $30 billion in transactions to run over the new payment rails of a faster payments system, a figure that represents 1-2 percent of all business transactions. Of those transactions, 27 percent will be former check transactions; 11 percent ACH transactions; 5-6 percent payment card transactions and 1-2 percent cash transactions (i.e., payments to service workers or hourly workers who today tend to receive cash payments).
