In Indonesian waters alone, piracy incidents are up 700 percent in just the past five years. One-third of the world’s shipping trade flows through these waters, says Vice News , and the police forces that patrol are often too understaffed to stop them. \nAt the same time, a new region is becoming even more dangerous: the Mediterranean. In addition to the massive financial crisis that Greece is currently undergoing, piracy in the Mediterranean Sea has become the newest and most threatening scourge. Jaanus Rahumägi, the head of ESC Global Security, a certified security company with a primary focus on armed protection of vessels, spotlighted this problem in the wake of the terrorist atrocities in Tunisia and Europe’s escalating migration crisis, according to Splash247.com. \nTerrorists and fundamentalists will take advantage of the crisis, if they haven’t already, said Rahumägi. With thousands crossing the Mediterranean from Africa and the Middle East each month, the abolition of Europe’s internal frontiers will make it easier for terrorists to move across Europe undetected. But the identities of migrants can be verified before they reach land by security personnel, he added. In an article in the magazine Maritime CEO on July 1, 2015, Rahumägi said cybersecurity and terrorism would be the main challenges the maritime industry will face over the coming years. \n“The only way to combat terrorism on the high seas is to stay one step ahead of the technology the enemies are using,” says Gregory E. Sancoff, president and CEO of Juliet Marine Systems , a developer of innovative maritime technology based in Portsmouth, NH. “We can’t simply stand by and let pirates and terrorists reign over the world’s most crucial ports. Real pirates aren’t some Disney ride. They represent a real threat to life and limb and to international trade. There are billions of dollars as well as lives at risk.” \nSancoff is an expert when it comes to cutting-edge maritime technology. Juliet Marine has developed GHOST , a high-speed surface craft equipped with cutting-edge naval technology and capable of defending vessels in every body of water worldwide. \nGHOST is equipped to handle threats posed by the small arms usually carried by pirates. Its high speed—and the fact that it is virtually undetectable even at short range by radar—makes it an ideal seacraft for protecting civilian craft. \n“We won’t stand for piracy,” says Sancoff . “And neither should our friends in the Mediterranean.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T14:09:12.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
