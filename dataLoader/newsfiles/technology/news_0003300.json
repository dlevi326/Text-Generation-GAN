This software creates a place to build songs and musical pieces from tracks by anyone on the network, using a device with a browser.\nThe Open Source Music System can handle multiple standard formats, including wav, mp3, and even mp4 video, which gives a user a wide range of familiar standard options for how they record.\nPlus a special playback feature that lets anyone synchronize the playing of multiple tracks on multiple devices.\nFor those interested in trying the software, there is a test version at the 99Eggs website . However, before a production site can be available, they need help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $19,000 by October 8, 2015. The funds raised will go towards completing development, creating the website, and getting it up and running.\nTo help bring this innovative website to life, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered between December 2015 and January 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help Open Source Music System reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: John Smith\nTitle: Engineer\nPhone: 267-357-9071\nemail:\nWebsite: www.99eggs.com", "external_links": ["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/99eggs/open-source-music-system", "http://www.99eggs/OSMS/osmsstart.php"], "published": "2015-09-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T22:58:25.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
