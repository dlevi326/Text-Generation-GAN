But underneath it all, there’s something special about the latest smartphone coming out from China, built to target the European market. \n- Advertisement - \nZTE have announced that Nubia My Prague would be their thinnest smartphone as to date. The incredible attention that they paid into detailing the latest device is incredible. Yes, it may look a lot like iPhone 6 but as they say – looks can be very deceiving indeed. \nHaving a body measurement that stood at 148 x 72 x 5.5 mm (5.83 x 2.83 x 0.22 in) and comes in weighing in at 140 g (4.94 oz), it definitely looks ultra-slim and sexy. Design-wise they might have copied iPhone, but this one feels better. \nThe Nubia My Prague is sporting a 5.2-inch Full HD AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~424 ppi pixel density that certainly looks great. Browsing your favorite website and social media platform, watching videos, reading e-Books on the smartphone looks natural and your hands won’t feel tired due to its smallish size and lightweight. \nIt has all the looks but does it have the brawn to go with it? Yes indeed it has with the Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 405 graphics and an option to for either 2GB or 3GB RAM. I t carries all the firepower that it can to run all the apps and games smoothly. If you for the 3GB RAM variant, then you will be able to maximize its full potential and won’t feel limited any longer. - Advertisement - \nCamera-wise, the Nubia My Prague focuses more on becoming a selfie phone with its 13MP-8MP setup. The primary camera comes with the usual stuff such as autofocus, LED flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, panorama and HDR. It is the secondary camera that surprises us all, and the 8MP camera goes all the way in capturing the best selfie pictures around. The only missing link is the flash alongside the camera, but we’ve seen very few smartphones going this route anyway. \nBy snapping lots of photos and shooting lots of videos, the next thing you should keep in mind is on the storage capacity. There are 2 variants here – the 2GB RAM + 16GB storage and the 3GB RAM + 32GB storage. If that is not enough for you, go ahead and use the available microSD slot that can cater up to 128GB of storage. That is great but just a word of caution, though, by using the microSD slot; you will be sacrificing the 2 nd sim slot. \nIn terms of OS, the Nubia My Prague is powered by Android Lollipop 5.0.2 and comes with Nubia UI 3.0. Perhaps it is a matter of time before it gets the latest 5.1 update that will make it more awesome. - Advertisement - \nCall it an iPhone copycat but the ZTE Nubia My Prague is a solid smartphone on its own. Specs-wise it is very good and being one of the thinnest smartphones out there, it has all the good looks and the processing power to go with it. If you have the budget, by all means go and get the 3GB RAM model, and it will serve you well in the next couple of years. \nThe ZTE Nubia My Prague is currently available in Europe and is selling for approximately $379 USD for the 2GB/16GB model and $469 USD for the 3GB/32GB. It is available in White/Silver and White/Gold. News From", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T06:51:20.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
