The company is supporting the White House 's TechHire initiative and has created a free employer playbook that outlines best practices and tools employers can use to evaluate and improve their current technology talent hiring practices. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20131107/PH13083LOGO \nCompared to 2010, it now takes five additional weeks to fill the average job vacancy. The slowdown increases the risk of U.S. companies losing talent to competitors and costs an average of $8.55 million per 1,000 vacancies due to lost productivity and additional recruiting work. Forecasts suggest that any employers not already feeling pressure in hiring these roles will likely start to feel that pressure as demand increases . \n\"Technology is central to every sector of the economy, and this reliance has left organizations struggling to fill a shocking number of job vacancies,\" said Jean Martin, CEB Talent Solutions Architect. \"To fill these positions and ensure their success, employers need to look beyond traditional talent pools and candidate profiles. Progressive companies are identifying and transitioning promising talent from unexpected backgrounds to meet their needs, and we're excited to help the White House profile their strategies to bridge the tech talent gap.\" \nCEB is partnering with Opportunity@Work, a civic enterprise that is supporting the 31 TechHire communities to increase access to accelerated training opportunities and enable more employers to recruit and place applicants based on their skills. The employer playbook will directly help employers in these communities by featuring real-world examples of effective approaches to onboarding and retaining employees for tech positions who may not otherwise be considered. \nPreviously, CEB helped the Administration scope the size and scale of the tech talent gap --which currently stands at 500,000 open jobs--using data from its CEB TalentNeuron offering. Based on that analysis, the rate of IT job creation through 2018 will actually be faster outside the Technology sector than within it, so the playbook is designed to be broadly applicable across industry sectors including healthcare, manufacturing and banking. \nTo combat these challenges progressive practices from organizations like Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, PepsiCo and DuPont feature prominently in CEB's playbook and are complemented by prescriptive guidance on how profiled techniques can be replicated in other organizations. \nThe Employer Playbook is available for download on the company's website . Communities and employers interested in the TechHire Initiative should go to http://www.techhire.org/signup . \nAbout CEB CEB is a best practice insight and technology company.
