Based on the best-selling board game and set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Space Hulk is a 3D digital turn based strategy game that recreates the classic claustrophobic board game experience for single player and multiplayer hotseat play. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150903/263586 \nSpace Hulk is set in the isolated corridors and tomb-like chambers of an ancient vessel lost in the graveyard of space. Players lead a small army of fearless Space Marine Terminators to battle in a ferocious fight for survival against hordes of predatory alien Genestealers. Recreating the tense battles of the board game, multiplayer hotseat mode will allow players to go head-to-head as one player controls the Space Marines and their opponent the Genestealers, in the ultimate fight for domination. \n\"We are excited about bringing the SPACE HULK® experience of the Warhammer 40,000 universe to Consoles. As FULL CONTROL did on the PC, we can now finally bring that experience to life on console full of scary Genestealers and mighty Terminators!\" said Manny Granillo, CEO of HR GAMES. \"As huge fans of the Space Hulk board game and the Warhammer 40,000 universe in general, we are delighted that Games Workshop has given us the opportunity to work with this iconic license and bring this version of Space Hulk into the hands of all fans out there.\" \nAbout HR GAMES \nHR GAMES is the publishing arm of Hoplite Research, LLC.
