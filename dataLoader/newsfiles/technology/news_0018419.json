And the occasional fire there.\nThe image may soon change for coming generations with a sweeping restoration project scheduled to begin soon.\nResearchers from the University of Michigan's Biological Station and botanists from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History are teaming to invade the swampy 691-acre expanse with a pair of specialized amphibious marsh buggies.\nThe hydraulic machines are equipped with mowers and harvesters capable of chopping down dense stands of the non-native phragmites and cattails that dominate the marsh, the researchers said.\nThe project is being funded with federal money from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and the Sustain Our Great Lakes Initiative of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. It should be completed by the end of the year.\n\"I'm totally excited about this,\" said Jim Bissell, curator of botany and coordinator of natural areas for the natural history museum. \"There just seems to be more good news coming out all the time at the Mentor Marsh. Everybody seems to be coming to the table at the same time.\"\nThe marsh was Ohio's first state nature preserve and is owned and managed by the museum. It's located near Headlands Beach State Park. Since the mid-1950s, salt pollution has wreaked havoc on the marsh, which previously had a diversity of plants, animals, insects and migrating birds.\nThe contamination came from two industries that mined salt from an ancient vein that runs about a half-mile under the area. The salt killed native trees, shrubs and grasses, and facilitated the growth of the tall, invasive phragmites and narrow-leaf cattails that can survive in salty conditions and eventually overran the marsh.\nThe reeds and cattails form an impenetrable wall against native species and offer birds and mammals no sustenance. In dry seasons, the phragmites occasionally catch fire, sometimes caused by kids looking to cause trouble, sometimes by nature.\nThe last fire was in 2013. Ten acres burned. The worst fires were in 1992 and 2003, when 400 acres burned each time.\nBissell has overseen a mini-habitat-restoration project since 2008, applying herbicides to carve a swath through the phragmites along each side of a boardwalk that runs for about 100 yards into the marsh.\nThe new money is allowing expansion of his efforts and will take in all of the marsh overseen by the museum with the intent of removing the invasive vegetation, and opening the door for the return of native species.\nMassive seed banks that have lain dormant for decades are expected to reemerge from freshly exposed muck, with native marsh grasses, sedges, shrubs, bull rushes, bur-reed, smartweed, and arrowhead appearing.\nBissell said the marsh is too valuable a habitat not to rescue. He envisions a panorama of wide expanses of open water skirted by broad stands of native cattails, buttonbush, willows and water-loving maple trees.\nIf the wildlife now at the boardwalk is any indication, a rejuvenated Mentor Marsh should attract a variety of birds and mammals that haven't been seen there in decades.\nIn recent years, visitors to the boardwalk have documented such notable species as Le Conte's and Nelson's sparrows, sedge and marsh wrens, sora and Virginia rails, American and least bitterns, osprey and red phalarope. Reports of river otter have been received.\nThe Michigan-based researchers will employ a British-manufactured harvester called the Softrak that cuts the reeds and bales them into a storage cart.\nBissell's crews will use a reed-crushing tank-like machine known as a Marsh Master. The vehicle can penetrate peat swamps like the Mentor Marsh, chopping reeds in areas that would otherwise be unreachable.\nTo truly save the marsh, however, will require eliminating the source of the salt that leaks into the area at the mouth of Blackbrook Creek, Bissell said.\n\"The salt has to go,\" Bissell said. \"For the marsh to fully recovery we need to get rid of that.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZqgOhyUt734"], "published": "2015-08-27T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:11:42.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
