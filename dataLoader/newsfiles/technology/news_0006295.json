How do vision algorithms for SLAM and navigation change in this case? And how does the fact that we can be both selective and sending high level information down the processing pipeline benefit a tight integration with a control architecture? This post is part of an EPSRC funded 4-year project between the Universities of Bristol and Manchester in the UK. Jointly with a range of industry partners, we will explore novel vision algorithms with the aim of developing a step change in vision for robotics, control of micro air vehicles and novel vision chips. At Bristol, we will be looking for a top-class candidate to join the team and that can demonstrate great potential and a high quality research track record. This post is in the area of real-time computer vision. You will be based at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Bristol, with interaction with the Department of Aerospace Engineering and the Bristol Robotics Lab. Further interaction will be with project partners at Manchester University and Industry. You must have a degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics or closely related discipline. You should have experience in developing computer vision algorithms, SLAM, real-time vision, and or embedded programming. Please see the further particulars for details. This post is being offered on a full time, open-ended post with funding initially for 42 months. Informal enquiries can be made to: Dr Walterio Mayol-Cuevas, wmayol@cs.bris.ac.uk It is anticipated that interviews will take place during November 2015.
