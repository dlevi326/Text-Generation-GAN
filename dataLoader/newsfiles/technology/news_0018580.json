NASA is joining forces with the company in the hopes of using the technology in space. Arx Pax View Caption of \nIt's a vision of the future that may even have eluded Marty McFly: hoverboard tech in space. \nNASA wants to make this vision a reality, and soon. The space agency is teaming up with California-based company Arx Pax, which has developed a real-life hoverboard using a technology called Magnetic Field Architecture (MFA). \nThe collaboration — which takes the form of a Space Act Agreement — aims to find a way to manipulate tiny satellites called cubesats without actually touching them.

Take the quiz! \n\"Arx Pax and NASA will work together to design a device with the ability to attract one object to another from a distance,\" Arx Pax representatives said in a statement today (Sept. 2). \"The device will draw, as well as repel, satellites at the same time, meaning it will hold a satellite at a distance and won't allow it to move away or toward the capture device. This will enable the capability to capture, and possibly manipulate, microsatellites or other objects without making physical contact with them.\" [ Science Fiction or Fact? 10 Out-There Concepts ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T23:10:06.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
