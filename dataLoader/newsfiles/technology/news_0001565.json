The device, which costs $300 and now is only sold with new Montblanc watches, will be available as a separate accessory before the end of the year. Lambert declined to provide sales figures for the product, which reached the market in August and is available in Europe.\nA Montblanc E-strap\nSource: Montblanc Montblanc is one of the first luxury Swiss watchmakers to incorporate digital functions in response to this year’s introduction of the Apple Watch. The idea is that while the watchband may become obsolete, the timepiece won’t. The device allows wearers to read e-mails, track physical activity, and help take better selfies.\nTo avoid cannibalizing its market for luxury mechanical watches, Montblanc developed the product as an accessory that accompanies the brand’s TimeWalker watches, which cost $3,700 to $5,800.\n“It has all the advantages of the iwatch without being in the watch,” said Lambert.\nJerome Lambert\nSource: Montblanc Will the Apple Watch upend the Swiss watchmaking industry? Only time will tell, Lambert said.\n“It is still too early to say how disruptive it will be,” he said. “In the phone industry the lifetime of a product is 18 months, in watchmaking it is 180 years.”\nThe Montblanc brand is owned by Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, whose other brands include Vacherson Constantin, Piaget and IWC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T13:34:55.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
