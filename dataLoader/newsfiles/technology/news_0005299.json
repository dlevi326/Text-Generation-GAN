The market can be segmented based on efficient infrastructures adoption into IT equipment, power management, and cooling solutions. \nA green data center is a storage system that stores, manages, and distributes data using various methods that enable maximum energy efficiency with minimal environmental impact. It helps in optimizing the performance of every element in a data center and lowers the cost of operations associated with a computing system. Various advanced technologies and strategies are implemented in a data center to improve its performance. Concepts such as free cooling, use of renewable energy sources, consolidation, and waste recycling are some of the methodologies implemented in green data centers. \nThe report, Green Data Center Market in the US 2015-2019, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects in the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. \nMany data center operators are currently exploring various approaches to cut down power costs. Renewable energy sources include micro-hydro, biogas fuel cells, solar, wind, and geothermal sources. The use of these renewable sources mainly depends on the location of data center facilities. \nAccording to the report, in a data center environment, building the shell and the operation of IT servers, UPS, and cooling systems lead to the emission of CO2. Increased use of fossil fuels for electricity generation results in increased CO2 emissions. Data centers that are powered by coal-generated electricity emit more CO2 compared to others. \nFurther, the report states that many leading organizations such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Intel, and Apple have established data centers in the country that are powered by renewable energy sources. Many data centers consume megawatts of electricity and emit tons of carbon every year. Also, the cost of building a data center facility is up to 25% of the total IT budgets of an organization, including the installation of IT equipment. \nKey vendors", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T22:43:08.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
