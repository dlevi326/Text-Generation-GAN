\nIn the city of Mayadeen in Deir Ezzor, several hospitals were no longer receiving patients suffering respiratory problems after running out of oxygen tanks, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group. \nSyria's health minister urged citizens to \"avoid prolonged exposure to the outdoors\" and said hundreds of people had been treated for cases of asthma and other respiratory problems. \nThe dust cut visibility for government aircraft, which carried out relatively few strikes during the storm, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. \n\"The sandstorm has paralysed regime airplanes, there were only a few strikes in Damascus province,\" said Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman. \nThick haze was hanging over Jerusalem and much of Israel and the Palestinian Territories, with officials also warning the vulnerable to stay indoors. \nThe view from the Mount of Olives -- which normally offers a sweeping panorama of Jerusalem's Old City and the Al-Aqsa mosque compound with its golden Dome of the Rock -- was completely obscured by the dust. \nThe thick cloud also enveloped parts of the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus, where residents were told to limit their time outdoors. \nHealth officials warned that the concentration of dust particles in the air was many times above normal levels. \nSeveral flights were diverted from the coastal airport of Larnaca as visibility dropped to 500 metres (yards). \nThe island was also suffering from a heatwave, with inland temperatures hitting 41 degrees Celsius (106 degrees Fahrenheit). \nThe interior ministry said that dozens of Syrian refugees who had been rescued from a fishing boat off the coast of Cyprus on Sunday had been moved from a makeshift camp to a better-equipped facility because of the extreme weather. \nThe effects of the storm had also reached Cairo, where the city skyline was obscured by a thick haze. \nWahid Saudi, a top official at Egypt's weather authority, said the dust had blown in from the eastern Mediterranean region and was expected to clear after several hours. \nburs-sah/mm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:41:40.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
