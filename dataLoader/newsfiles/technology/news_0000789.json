(Getty Images file) Russia, China 'aggressively' identifying U.S. operatives More \nChina and Russia are aggressively using stolen data to identify members of the U.S. intelligence community, according to a top security official. \nThey have been looking at a range of data to determine \"who is an intelligence officer, who travels where, when, who's got financial difficulties, who's got medical issues, [to] put together a common picture,\" William Evanina said in comments to the Los Angeles Times on Monday. Evanina is director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. \nEvanina also said foreign intelligence services had \"absolutely\" already used the data against American operatives. However, the nature of that usage is classified. Just one network of U.S. engineers and scientists who provide assistance to undercover operatives has been identified as compromised, he said. \nThe security of personal information has been at risk since the U.S. Office of Personnel Management had its systems breached earlier this year. Hackers with apparent ties to China exfiltrated OPM files containing information on more than 22 million applicants who had sought security clearances with the U.S. government dating back fifteen years or more. Russian hackers linked to the Kremlin breached an unclassified e-mail server belonging to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in July. More from the Washington Examiner â€¢ 08/31/15 2:05 PM \nAdditionally, hackers earlier this month released data from the extramarital dating website Ashley Madison. Those files included data on more than 13,000 clients who had used government e-mail addresses. The Pentagon is currently appraising how many of those were military personnel who violated policies that prohibit extramarital affairs. \nThe hacks grant China and its allies a nearly unprecedented ability to identify and blackmail U.S. security personnel, he said. Russia is chief among those allies; the two countries signed 32 bilateral agreements earlier this year that included provisions for cooperating on cybersecurity. \nElaine Korzak, a cybersecurity fellow at Stanford, says the U.S. has deferred from making similar agreements, partially because of the difficulty of applying them to non-state actors. Countries like the U.S. \"have moved away from the focus on an international 'cybertreaty' of sorts and are taking a broader approach to agree on norms, rules and principles that would govern the behavior and actions of different actors in cyberspace,\" Korzak told the Examiner . \nKorzak added that Russia has more in common with its neighbor in the East on a cultural level, which has been particularly helpful in coming to agreement on matters of cybersecurity. She said Western countries have been more inclined to shy away from cybertreaties \"and have instead argued that current international legal frameworks should be applied.\" \nThe relationship that Russia and China have on cybersecurity may be the deepest between state actors on the issue to date. China has no such kinship with India, for instance, in spite of the duo's substantial economic ties. India has been a prominent target of cyberattacks originating in China; most notably, it was reported earlier this month that the Chinese have been penetrating India's systems as far back as 2012. India has been exploring a deeper relationship with the U.S. on cyberissues.
