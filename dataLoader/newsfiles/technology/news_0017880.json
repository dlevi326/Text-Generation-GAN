After consulting with consumer, marketing, privacy and technology leaders at health plans across the country, Leverage Health and Ghostery are ideally positioned to bring market-leading solutions to the healthcare industry. Ghostery is an industry-leading, global technology company empowering consumers and businesses globally to create safer, faster, and more trusted digital experiences. As health plans increasingly turn to the web to attract, retain and serve customers, the challenges are as significant as the opportunities. Ghostery’s technology is used today by leading brands and financial institutions around the world, and by over 40 million consumers who have installed Ghostery’s browser extension to manage the information they share with companies online.\n“The convergence of digital marketing in key segments of the consumer health businesses, such as Exchange and Medicare Advantage, as well as security challenges evidenced in recent health plan data breaches, demands a solution. Leverage Health has partnered with Ghostery after stringent market due diligence. Any health plan or healthcare entity that runs a website is handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI) and could unknowingly put that information at risk,” says Richard Lungen, Managing Member at Leverage Health. “Ghostery can immediately improve website ROI by giving health plans the tools they need to manage the complex online issues unique to healthcare.”\nGhostery’s Marketing Cloud Management (MCM) software will enable healthcare organizations to best manage digital marketing efforts in real time, improving data governance, site performance, and vendor management. Ghostery’s MCM also facilitates privacy governance, ensuring transparency with customers and compliance with industry standards.\n“The new healthcare landscape provides great opportunity for health care marketers, but without total visibility and control over the digital experience, a site can quickly become slow, vulnerable and out of compliance. We chose to partner with Leverage Health due to their extensive knowledge and relationships in the payor and provider markets,” says Scott Meyer, CEO at Ghostery. “The Leverage Health team will accelerate Ghostery’s entrance into healthcare and enable us to deploy Ghostery MCM to payors and providers before they have a serious issue.”\nLearn more about digital experience management in the healthcare space at AHIP’s Consumer Experience & Digital Health Forum October 12-14 in Chicago, Illinois.
