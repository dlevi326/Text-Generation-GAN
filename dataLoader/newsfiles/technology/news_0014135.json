Visit http://www.BioConnect.com for more information on the biometric software.\nToronto, ON (PRWEB) September 28, 2015\nLast week marked a significant one for Entertech Systems as they advanced their impact on the “Bring Your Own Identity” (BYOI) movement on the horizon with an update to their BioConnect identity management solution.\n“Our society has built a system on the basis of keys, cards and PINs - approximation technologies for identity verification. The challenge with these tools is that they are not us,\" said Rob Douglas, Founder & CEO of Entertech. \"The basic idea of BYOI is that with the influx in different types of biometric technologies flooding into the market, in the near future individual employees will decide the biometric type that they will bring into their workplace, whether that be biometric mobile devices, biometric wearable devices, or biometric fingerprint fixed devices. We created BioConnect 5 years ago because we fundamentally believe that the 7 billion of us on the planet no longer wish to use approximations of our identity to prove who we are.”\n“This platform is going to make things simple, scalable and secure for the enterprise,” said Douglas.\nEntertech’s long standing partnership with Suprema marked the beginning of the journey as a critical step in facilitating BYOI with the integration of Suprema fixed biometric access readers to Entertech’s access control partners via BioConnect.\nAs of September 23rd, an update for their BioConnect identity management system (v3.5) is available for download which adds a new Suprema device, the BioStation 2 to the full suite of Suprema devices in the integration. The newest release supports a new total of 19 of the leading access control systems as listed below (previously 16), and also includes improved performance and reliability to enhance the overall user experience. Full capabilities of BioConnect can be found at http://www.BioConnect.com .\nThe newest device in the integration, the Suprema BioStation 2 is an evolution of the BioStation biometric fingerprint device with a sleeker design, larger display screen and refreshed UI. A very versatile device, it can be utilized in both indoor and outdoor settings with virtually real-time authentication and time and attendance capabilities. Its high-end fingerprint terminal uses TCP/IP protocols to make 1:3,000 matches in one second, and features a color LCD screen and proximity card reader option. The new and improved fingerprint reading sensor can read a wet or dry finger. As the operating partner for Suprema in the USA, Canada, UK, Ireland and Puerto Rico, the Suprema BioStation 2 can be purchased through Entertech.\nFull Suite of Suprema devices supported in the integration:\n Suprema FaceStation Suprema BioStation Suprema BioStation 2 (new!)
