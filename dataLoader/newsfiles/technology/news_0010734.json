Textura-PQM has streamlined our process overall and helped mitigate risk for Robins & Morton and our clients,\" Cassady said. \"The prequalification process can be challenging for general contractors of all sizes, and large organizations face even greater complexity due to their scale and reach,\" said Michael Goldstein , Vice President of Client Services for Textura. \"We're thrilled that Robins & Morton has successfully centralized and streamlined its processes with Textura-PQM, with the benefits extending to its subcontractors and clients.
