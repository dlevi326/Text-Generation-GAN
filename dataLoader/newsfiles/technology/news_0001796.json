It is ISO direct mount, F-03/05 pattern, 50% duty cycle, with CE certified 24 or 110VAC motors.\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (PRWEB) September 29, 2015\nThe new Valbia® VB008 “Mini” quarter-turn direct-mount electric actuator measures just 4-3/4” long X 2-3/4” wide. Used with 1/4” to 1-1/4” full-port direct mount ball valves, it provides the most compact and reliable automatic flow control for a wide range of HVAC, light industrial, and OEM applications.\nVB008 mini actuators feature an F-03/05 pattern ISO-5211 direct mount flange and square shaft slot for easy direct mount installation. The standard 110 VAC motor with Class II insulation meets CE standards and delivers 71 in/lbs. of torque in horizontal or vertical installations.\nA manual override, heater/thermostat, and LED indicator light are standard. The waterproof IP 65 housing of the VB008 is constructed of flame-resistant plastic with O-ring seals at critical points.\nOptions include 24VAC operation and three-point or modulating control. The new actuators are available as separate components or on single-number automated valve packages with Bonomi ball valves.\nSpace-saving VB008 electric actuators can be used in water treatment, irrigation, fire protection, leak detection and prevention systems, food and beverage processing, smart home systems and other commercial or light industrial applications. They offer a cost-saving alternative to solenoid valves in some situations.\nAbout Bonomi\nBonomi North America has served the U.S. and Canada since 2003 and is part of the Bonomi Group of Brescia, Italy.
