Other big box stores, some large grocery conglomerates and a few other merchants have EMV capable terminals, but have yet to turn on the EMV feature. \nHowever, many other small and medium-size merchants have yet to upgrade to EMV-capable terminals. Fraudsters will shift their efforts to these merchants and to card not present transactions as of the Oct. 1 date, said Ritchie, pointing to the experience of European merchants once the continent adopted EMV more than a decade ago. \n“It’s important to make sure that payments are secure,” Ritchie said, pointing to the example of hackers compromising a POS system that was popular among restaurants and other small businesses. As a result of the security flaw, 1,800 small restaurants were breached, and the resulting costs resulted in many going out of business. \nIf the industry doesn’t sufficiently protect payments from fraud, the government will step in with regulations, Ritchie cautioned. \nFor ecommerce merchants and others involved in card not present transactions, Ritchie recommended that companies look at encryption, tokenization, secure vaulting and PCI 3.0. \nHe cautioned that many vaulting solutions aren’t secure. PCI 3.0 is important because it removes sensitive customer information from the merchant’s systems.
