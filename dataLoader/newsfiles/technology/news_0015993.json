The move follows various missteps in key markets, including smartphones, that have seen an incredible $44 billion wiped off the company's valuation. The headcount, as of June 30, sat at 98,999. That would imply Samsung is letting go of nearly 10,000 people. The company is reportedly targetting workers in areas such as human resources, finance and public relations. Beyond this, the company is looking to cut expenses next year as the pressure mounts. Samsung recently \"adjusted\" the prices of the new Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge phones after demand was not as strong as previously anticipated. According to Bloomberg, Samsung's global smartphone share fell by three percent in the second quarter.
