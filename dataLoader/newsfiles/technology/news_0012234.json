The WTS122 is the first solution of its kind to enable VoLTE device-to-device mobile testing in one unit. This benchtop network emulator utilizes modular, programmable, and scalable Layer 2 stack from Sooktha’s LTE Advanced Smart Base Station (SBS) solution. \nThe WTS122 is at the heart of the Spirent Elevate Test Framework and tests VoLTE functionality, IMS/RCS conformance, device-to-device interoperability, as well as VoLTE E911 and Voice over Wi-Fi capability. While IMS, VoLTE, and RCS testing focus on application layer functions, these critical areas require support for Layer 2. VoLTE user experience depends on quality of service (QoS) based dedicated bearer management, semi-persistent scheduling (SPS), and robust header compression (RoHC). These LTE radio access network (RAN) features are available on the WTS122 and supported by Sooktha’s Layer 2 stack. \n“The advent of IMS, RCS, and VoLTE is bringing about a new wave of services that require implementation of new test methodologies,” said Clarke Ryan, director of engineering at Spirent Communications. “We developed the Spirent Elevate framework to provide a flexible and open platform which allows us to quickly and efficiently diversify our test capabilities to suit our customers’ needs. With this partnership, we were able to utilize Sooktha’s customization, ASP support, rich software diagnostics, and stable LTE protocol stacks for the timely launch of Spirent Elevate Test Framework.” \n“The Spirent WTS122 solution powered by Sooktha SBS software demonstrates the industry leading feature set and the simplicity, scalability, and extensibility of the Sooktha software,” said Balaji Rangaswamy, CEO at Sooktha. “It also demonstrates our commitment to accelerating the deployment of next generation wireless technologies by developing solutions for both test and measurement and infrastructure segments.” \nMore Information \nSooktha SBS: http://www.sooktha.com/sbs.html \nAbout Sooktha \nSooktha Consulting Private Limited, an advanced wireless access solutions company, offers solutions and services to enable network operators to deploy innovative wireless access services with LTE Advanced and Wi-Fi technologies, and to enable test and measurement equipment manufacturers to offer solutions for adequate testing of these new services.
