Telescope protesters agree to take down tent on Mauna Kea 1 / 1 Back to Gallery HONOLULU (AP) â€” Protesters against building a giant telescope atop a Hawaiian mountain say they will no longer keep around-the-clock vigil on Mauna Kea.\nProtest leaders say they have reached an agreement with the state to take down a large tent where people have been sleeping. The state announced the agreement Thursday.\nOne of the leaders, Lanakila Mangauil, says they will trust the state to warn protesters when the nonprofit company building the Thirty Meter Telescope plans to resume construction.\nProtesters have been camping on the mountain in an attempt to block construction. Construction has stalled since April, and the company hasn't indicated when it will resume.\nMangauil says it doesn't mean protesters are giving up. He says they'll continue to have a presence on the mountain during the day.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/75/03/8638671/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/75/03/8638671/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-18T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T04:43:28.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
