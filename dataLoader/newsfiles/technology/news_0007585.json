Textura plans to showcase TexturaLink at the Viewpoint User Conference next week in Portland, Ore. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20110602/CG12932LOGO \n­­TexturaLink enables the seamless flow of information between CPM(®) and construction companies' other financial applications. Replacing the flat-file integration approach, TexturaLink leverages RESTful Web services to fully automate data exchange. This improves user experience by eliminating the manual import/export of information between an ERP and Textura's CPM solution, including subcontracts, change orders, compliance status, invoices, payments and document images. TexturaLink allows users to configure the timing and frequency of automated data transfers, and a searchable audit screen provides ready ­­­access to historical information. \nA web-based, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering, CPM electronically integrates all construction payment management processes -- including billing, lien waiver collection, progress claims, statutory declarations, sub-tier waivers, compliance management and electronic payments -- into a seamless online workflow that facilitates collaboration across project participants. \nTexturaLink will soon be available to users of Viewpoint's Construction Software's ERP solution, enhancing the current integration benefits. Textura will showcase the tool during an educational session at Collaborate 2015, the Viewpoint user conference, next week in Portland's Oregon Convention Center. The session will be held Thursday, Sept. 17, at 1:30 p.m. \nTexturaLink is already available to CPM clients using accounting/ERP software from SAP and COINS, and adapters for additional leading ERP solutions will be rolled out in the near term. \n\"Textura clients have long benefitted from the ability to integrate CPM with various leading ERP solutions. Our TexturaLink tool offers new levels of integration flexibility and automation, unlocking even greater efficiencies in construction companies' financial processes,\" said Mark Mariano, Integration Product Manager for Textura. \nAbout Textura \nTextura is a leading provider of collaboration and productivity tools for the construction industry.
