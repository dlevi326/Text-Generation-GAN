Created by a software developer with a Masters degree and 25 years of deep learning and mathematical experience, Cornucopia will empower all the people who are not computer savvy in being able to create their own software as if they had decades of computer science knowledge at hand. It is now time to let computers serve their users not through a sort of high priesthood of computer \"experts\" but directly, each one providing in minutes anything one's mind desires and orders of magnitude faster.\nCornucopia will leverage creativity and ideas that could never arise in any other way, as anyone will be able to express them on the web and share them too with the world if they want. It can be a natural extension of the Open Source movement, except one doesn't need to be a programmer anymore. And of course some help is needed. A K ickstarter campaign was launched and the goal of this project is to raise $100,000 by November 7, 2015.\nTo help bring this game-changing project to life, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered by May 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special revolution! Help Cornucopia reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nMaurycy Sokolowski\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
