Those funds will go towards researching flexible hybrid electronics that could pave the way for new technological advances with respect to wearables, Mr. Carter said. \n“This is an emerging technology that takes advanced flexible materials for circuits, communications, sensors and power and combines them with thinned silicon chips to ultimately produce the next generation of electronic products,” he said. “Our troops will be able to lighten their loads with sensors and electronic gear embedded in their clothing, and wounded warriors will benefit from smart prosthetics that have the full flexibility of human skin.” \nAccording to the White House, the alliance will work to develop “an end-to-end stretchable electronics ‘ecosystem’ in the U.S.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T23:48:37.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
