(Konica Minolta), a leader in the Graphic Communications industry, announced the measured results of data directly comparing leading manufacturers in image quality and color, ranking them above all of their competitors. Image Test Labs (ITL), the leading think tank in imaging science, measured the quality over the last twelve months from a vast population of digital presses globally, concluding that Konica Minolta attributes surpassed the quality of high priced devices. \nSolidifying its premiere position within the industry, test runs from the cost-effective Konica Minolta digital presses consistently scored at or near the top. This clearly debunks the myth that commercial printers need expensive solutions to produce high quality printing. ITL conducted independent evaluations at commercial printing plants, collecting empirical data from press runs in production environments, not from a manufacturer's R &D facility or lab. \nOf the entire sheet fed toner digital presses that ITL graded, including both liquid and dry toner products from six different leading manufacturers, 75% of the Konica Minolta graded presses are in the top 10%. The Konica Minolta bizhub® PRESS line holds the dominant position for printed color image performance. This performance was measured against a large international database of ITL press grades from presses run in real printing production environments. \n\"Konica Minolta is thrilled with the results and will continue to work with Henry (Freedman) and ITL to exceed our customer's expectations.\" says Kevin Kern, senior vice president, Konica Minolta U.S.A., Inc. \"The fact that this study goes well beyond a typical laboratory validation demonstrates our commitment to delivering the highest quality at an affordable cost and keeps us ahead of our competitors.\" \n\"Image Test Labs pioneered a new printed image evaluation process that is independent, evenhanded and authoritative,\" says Henry Freedman, Principal Developer, Image Test Labs. \"Image Test Lab's patent pending process is used by the majority of manufacturers producing all types of printing presses in the graphic arts. Our greatest contribution is a new way to measure and report printed imagery that is both comprehensive and extremely easy to understand using typical proven school A, B and C-etc. methods understood by all.\" \nImage Test Labs grade individual machines and deliver a report card with those grades including where they rank against presses in the same classification, e.g. sheet fed digital, wide format, inkjet web, etc. The non-published reports are only shared with the customer. \nKonica Minolta will openly share the head-to-head comparisons at Booth #1913 during Graph Expo, including testing details. The results show Konica Minolta digital presses clearly exceed color and image quality compared to other digital presses in similar class. In specific head-to-head comparisons of a Konica \nMinolta bizhub® PRESS C1100 vs. leading competitors, Konica Minolta wins. \nThe white paper is found here: http://kmbs.konicaminolta.us/wps/wcm/connect/3339c395-62e2-4655-adcc-a978c4c56c45/FINAL_Graph+Expo+White+Paper.pdf?MOD=AJPERES \nImage Test Labs website: www.imagetestlabs.com \nAbout Konica Minolta \nKonica Minolta Business Solutions U.S.A., Inc. is a leader in information management focused on enterprise content, technology optimization and cloud services.
