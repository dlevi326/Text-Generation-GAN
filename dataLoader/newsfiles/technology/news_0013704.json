About 11 million of the company's diesel vehicles worldwide have the software that can fool emissions tests. The company is taking a related charge of $7.3 billion. Over two days, VW shares fell 35 percent, wiping out more than $30 billion (27 billion euros) of the company's market value.\n12:20 p.m.\nLucia Caudet, industry spokeswoman for the European Commission, told reporters at a daily briefing that while it is \"premature to draw any conclusions,\" the commission needs to \"shed light\" on VW's actions. The German company has not yet explained why so-called \"defeat devices\" were installed on some diesel models sold between 2008 and this year. \"We owe it to our consumers and for the environment. We have to be absolutely certain that industry is respecting emission limits for cars,\" Caudet said.\n11:30 a.m.\nVolkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn apologized again for the scandal, and pledged a fast and thorough investigation. \"Millions of people across the world trust our brands, our cars and our technologies,\" he said in a video message. \"I am endlessly sorry that we have disappointed this trust.\" Earlier, Volkswagen disclosed that some 11 million of its diesel vehicles worldwide were fitted with software programmed to switch engines to a cleaner mode during official emissions testing. The software then switches off again, enabling cars to drive more powerfully on the road while emitting as much as 40 times the legal pollution limit. VW said it was setting aside around 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) to cover the cost of fixing the cars.\nGerman Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said he was setting up a commission to determine whether the VW diesel vehicles were built and examined in a way that complied with German and European rules. The governments of France and South Korea also said they would investigate the Volkswagen vehicles.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T22:43:14.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
