(NASDAQ:ITRI), a world-leading technology and services company dedicated to the resourceful use of energy and water, announced today the expansion of the partner ecosystem for Itron’s OpenWay Riva solution – the first-of-its-kind, smart-grid-by-design technology featuring adaptive communications technology and distributed computing power that supports new smart grid applications. The ecosystem brings together multiple electricity meter solution vendors to support the OpenWay Riva solution in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). \nWith these additions to the OpenWay Riva ecosystem, Itron is addressing industry requirements to have multiple options for technology suppliers for smart grid projects in EMEA. The expanded ecosystem, which will initially focus on the Austrian market, includes Kapsch BusinessCom and Kapsch Smart Energy, Itron’s integration partner in Austria, and technology and solution suppliers Schrack Technik Energie in cooperation with EMH Metering, Kamstrup and Wasion Group Ltd. The objective of the consortium is to supply OpenWay Riva-powered devices that are compliant with global metering and Internet of Things telecommunication standards, including those promoted by HomePlug Netricity™. \nThe collaboration will enable utilities in EMEA to take advantage of Itron’s OpenWay Riva solution and deploy a single network that incorporates two communications technologies – radio frequency (RF) and power line carrier (PLC) – working in concert in the same device in real time. The solution also provides a unified device-level software platform for new smart grid applications that leverage high-performance communications and distributed computing power. This enables new approaches that significantly improve the accuracy and timeliness of smart grid applications such as outage detection and analysis, transformer load management and energy diversion detection. \n“With this expansion of our partner ecosystem, Itron is bringing leading-edge technology in a multi-vendor, standards-compliant solution to utilities in EMEA. Our OpenWay Riva solution is the most advanced technology available today, helping utilities transform their smart grid communications and deploy new and highly innovative approaches to key grid operations and business challenges,” said Jeff Carkhuff, vice president of global solutions marketing for electricity at Itron. “We are pleased to expand choices for our utility customers and to demonstrate the flexibility of the solution by bringing together multiple vendors to meet industry requirements and utility’s needs.” \n“Kapsch BusinessCom is pleased to be working with Itron in Austria to bring the best technology available to utilities in order to help them meet their smart grid needs,” said Peter Mitterhofer, Vice President Sales, Kapsch BusinessCom AG at Kapsch BusinessCom. “Bringing together multiple technology suppliers, including Schrack Technik Energie, EMH Metering, Kamstrup and Wasion, helps us address a fundamental industry requirement, while offering utilities in Austria greater choice and flexibility.” \nAbout Itron \nItron is a world-leading technology and services company dedicated to the resourceful use of energy and water.
