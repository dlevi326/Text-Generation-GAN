The online grocery venture has inked a deal with Shah Rukh Khan and the advertisements are set to go live soon in a two month long campaign as the company plans to expand its operations to almost 50 cities, from seven now. RELATED BENGALURU: Flush with venture capital funds and competition intensifying, startups in the consumer internet space are increasingly signing up celebrities to build trust and confidence. BigBasket is the latest. The online grocery venture has inked a deal with Shah Rukh Khan and the advertisements are set to go live soon in a two month long campaign as the company plans to expand its operations to almost 50 cities, from seven now. Classifieds portal Quikr recently signed-up Ranveer Singh and Suriya, along with a change in brand identity. E-commerce venture Yepme had Shah Rukh Khan as its brand ambassador, travel portal Yatra partnered with Salman Khan. Amitabh Bachchan endorses local classifieds JustDial and baby products e-commerce firm FirstCry. Some players enter into partnerships for events or a certain product on the platform. For instance, Myntra partnered with Ranveer Singh for its Roadster line of clothes, and with Hrithik Roshan for the HRX collection. BigBasket will spend Rs 30-40 crore for their marketing blitzkrieg with Khan. Hari Menon, co-founder and CEO of BigBasket, told TOI, \"Our customer profile has changed and gone mainstream. This campaign will reduce our overall customer acquisition cost by 30% and triple our customer base.\" The company had raised $50 million (Rs 315 crore) earlier this year and has mandated Citigroup to raise another $150 million (Rs 950 crore.) \"We want to do things faster and to exit the current fiscal at a revenue run rate of $400 million, from the current $100 million,\" Menon said. Basabdutta Chowdhuri, CEO of Platinum Media, a media buying firm which buys advertisement slots for clients in media, said that celebrities help the online companies to convert recall value into trust. \"There are still some trust issues with online platforms dealing with users' information and cash. These companies are new in the business and the awareness has to be converted into trust. The megabucks spent on the stars work harder for the companies,\" she said, adding that most sectors are overcrowded and celebrities help to differentiate the brand. When Quikr used celebrities, it was to launch multiple verticals and with a different brand identity. It launched verticals in cars, real estate, jobs, services and others, since the volumes in all those verticals had attained significant scale. Pranay Chulet, founder and CEO of Quikr, said, \"We had to communicate the launch of these verticals with a bang because it does unleash a very different kind of force in the industry. Like me, most of India is crazy about movies so we roped in film actors to help us communicate this change across the country.\" While such campaigns cost companies crores of rupees, the startups feel that to attain the next stage of accelerated growth, such TV and print campaigns are inevitable. \"If we had gone with the ad campaign earlier, it would have been a waste of some part of the resources,\" said Menon. Chulet said the measurement in terms of brand equity and user engagement suggested that the campaigns have done very well for Quikr. \"It is all about investing smartly for the future. The timing of such investments is really a function of the maturity of your business and your vision for it going forward,\" Chulet said. BigBasket expects a surge in demand during the campaign and has increased capacity and recruited more than 100 people to meet this surge. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Shah Rukh Khan,Ranveer Singh,Quikr,Myntra,e-commerce Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T11:19:10.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
