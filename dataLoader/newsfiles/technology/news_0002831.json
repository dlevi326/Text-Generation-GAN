With Trueplay, millions of listeners can easily tune their existing Sonos speakers to optimize the sound no matter where the speaker is placed. The new SONOS PLAY:5, elegantly designed from the inside out, delivers the purest, deepest, most vibrant sound yet from Sonos. Both Trueplay and the new SONOS PLAY:5 will be available later this year. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150926/271050 \nTrueplay - Purer sound through smarter speakers Trueplay stems from the insight that few homes are acoustically perfect. The placement of the speaker and the room it's in impacts the way it sounds. In the past, customizing speakers has required complex and expensive professional calibration. Now with Trueplay, anyone can tune speakers with the press of a button. The result? Music is liberated so that it sounds great in every room, in every home. \n\"Trueplay is a revolutionary system that gives music lovers confidence that they're hearing what their favorite artists labored to produce, independent of the room's acoustics and speaker location,\" said CEO John MacFarlane. \"Finally there's a simple, reliable process that delivers studio-quality listening experiences in each room of the home.\" \nUsing the Sonos app, the microphone on an iPhone or iPad, and a special tone emitted by the Sonos speaker, the system analyzes how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, glass and other surfaces in any given room. Sonos then smartly tunes that speaker so the music sounds its very best. \n\"Our remit at Sonos has evolved from constantly working to improve the general sound of all of our speakers to customizing them: first by room, and in the future, by person, activity and content,\" said record producer, composer, and Sonos Sound Experience Leader Giles Martin. \"We are obsessed with improving the home music experience, which must take into account acoustically unfriendly rooms. Tuning a room is the first of many software enhancements that make the experience richer and more personal for listeners whilst giving artists a whole new creative arena.\" \nInitially, Trueplay will be available on all SONOS PLAY:1 (®) , SONOS PLAY:3 (®) , SONOS PLAY:5 (®) products and iOS controllers, and will continue to be added to the Sonos lineup over time. \nNew SONOS PLAY:5 - the flagship smart speaker with more of everything you love about Sonos The new SONOS PLAY:5 delivers a listening experience that is closer than ever to how every track was mastered in the studio. Built with six synchronized, custom-designed drivers, the speaker's three mid-woofers create smooth mids and deep, powerful lows, and three tweeters deliver crystal clear highs at any volume. The array produces a soundstage that is much wider than expected in a single speaker, creating room-filling sound with precise separation of vocals and instruments. \nFor the first time, SONOS PLAY:5 has three orientations. This flexibility, combined with Trueplay tuning, enables best-in-class sound for any placement, in any room. In addition to horizontal orientation as a standalone speaker, two SONOS PLAY:5s paired together vertically deliver top-of-the-line stereo sound with a focused and intense sweet spot. Paired horizontally, they create a larger stereo image for an immersive, room-filling listening experience. \nThe new SONOS PLAY:5 incorporates an innovative design that allows for the most effective wireless performance, without compromises, to ensure the music remains in perfect sync without dropouts. \nDesigned to fit the home now and for years to come, the aesthetic of the new SONOS PLAY:5 carves away complexity to focus on the simple essence of a speaker. Functionally, every detail matters, down to the placement of the nearly 60,000 individually drilled holes in the grill and the carefully selected material for each and every part. The new touch controls offer an intuitive, easy way to play, pause, adjust volume and change the track. Smart sensors make these touch controls responsive to all orientations, so the volume-up is always facing up. \nJust like its predecessor, the new SONOS PLAY:5 works seamlessly with all Sonos smart speakers and adds even greater modularity with the ability to act as rear speakers in home theater setups with SONOS PLAYBAR (®) and SONOS SUB (tm) . Control every room in your home with one easy-to-use app that brings together your favorite music services such as Pandora, Spotify, TIDAL, Google Play Music, and Groove. \nAvailable in a custom matte black and matte white finish, the all-new SONOS PLAY:5 will retail for $499 USD, $549 CAD, $749 AUS, EUR579 and £429. \nFor more details on Trueplay and the new SONOS PLAY:5, please visit Sonos.com . \nBlog | Video \nAbout Sonos Founded in 2002, Sonos(®) creates the leading smart speaker system.
