Preference would be to distribute benefits in kind to refugees rather than in cash.\nThose with a good chance of winning asylum should also be given integration classes, according to the new measures which will be debated in parliament from Thursday before, pending approval, entering into force on November 1.\nBut aid organisations have challenged some of the steps, arguing that they constitute human rights violations.\nAmnesty International's secretary general in Germany, Selmin Caliskan, warned that asylum seekers from safe origin countries may not be given a fair assessment of their claims.\nGermany expects up to one million asylum seekers this year, five times the number seen in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T15:13:27.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
