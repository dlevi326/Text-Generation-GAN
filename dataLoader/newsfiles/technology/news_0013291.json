The intelligence behind the movement of the dress and sportswear are powered by the Intel CurieTM Module, a tiny hardware product that provides designers and makers the ability to add functions and capabilities to a wide range of wearable products such as rings, handbags, clothing and fitness trackers.\nWith the Intel Curie Module, the garments can change shape and adapt to the wearer’s environment. By using sensors and an innovative shape memory alloy, the responsive garments reflect a concept known as biomimicry, where nature is used to solve complex human problems.\nThe Chromat Adrenaline Dress powered by Intel is composed of 3-D printed panels and an interlinked, expandable carbon fiber framework. When the wearer senses adrenaline, the dress’s framework expands a carbon fiber framework into a stylized hourglass shape.\nChromat also showcased futuristic sportswear built with Intel technology: the Chromat Aeros Sports Bra powered by Intel, inspired by wind, air and flight. The Chromat Aeros Sports Bra leverages shape memory alloy to open vents when it senses heat and sweat in order to cool down the body. With integration of the Intel Curie module, the sports bra can respond to changes in perspiration, respiration and body temperature to open or close vents in order to cool (or warm) the wearer.\nThe expanding dress is made of 3D printed TPU, neoprene, and carbon fiber actuated by shape memory alloy. The sports bra is made of Lycra, mesh, neoprene, 3D printed frames with vents actuated by shape memory alloy.\nThe two garments powered by Intel technology illustrate the potential of future integrations of fashion and technology by bringing innovative concepts and aspirations to life. As we continue our exploration with wearable tech and incorporating technology into clothing, we at Intel look forward to empowering and inspiring the fashion industry by elevating the utility of clothing and accessories with intelligent capabilities.\n Tags: technology latest gadgets Science and Trends wearables Also Read Volatility part and parcel of capital markets: Jayant Sinha London police to wear body cameras in year-long trial YouTube to launch paid music service Sony threatens Twitter with legal action over hack", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Intel%20powered%20wearables%20%284%29.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150919/technology-latest/article/intel-powered-sports-bra-opens-automatically-when-things-get-hot", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Intel%20powered%20wearables%20%282%29.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Intel%20powered%20wearables%20%284%29.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://chromat.co/collections/all-1/products/elite-sports-bra", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Intel%20powered%20wearables%20%283%29.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Intel%20powered%20wearables%20%281%29.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-20T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T01:23:33.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
