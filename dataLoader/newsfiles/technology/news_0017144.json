The court had convicted the dance teacher under Sections 354 A (molestation), 384 (extortion), 506 (criminal intimidation) and Section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. While pronouncing the order, the court stated that the convict had outraged the modesty of the minor girl by making physical contact with her, by advancing unwelcome and explicit overtures to her and sexually assaulting her. Besides, he had criminally intimidated her and extorting money from her. The sentencing came a day before Teacher’s Day and the court held that the convict did not deserve to be a teacher, who stooped so low to fulfil his desire of trapping an innocent girl in the net of his shameful vile acts. “This court cannot under any circumstance permit the accused to sacrilege and defile the sacred bond of the “guru-shishya” relationship. Not only has he cast a slur on the pious teacher-pupil relationship, but has also put the whole teaching community to shame,” said the court. “Such types of crimes against women are increasing in society at an alarming speed. The court cannot take such crimes lightly. To curb and discourage the commission of such offences, the court should deal with the perpetrators of such offences with a stern and heavy hand. The act committed by the accused is highly condemnable,” said the court. Akash, a dance teacher, was arrested earlier this year for molesting, blackmailing and extorting money from his student, who studied in a prominent convent school in the city. The victim used to learn dance at Akash’s academy in Sector 44. According to the prosecution case, the victim was molested by Akash, a resident of Panchkula, in 2013. At that time, she was a minor. The complainant’s counsel, Terminder Singh, said justice had prevailed and the sentencing would send a message to society.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T02:09:21.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
