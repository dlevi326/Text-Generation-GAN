There are many people who read the articles yet take more delight from seeing what the general public has to say on the matter, without necessarily leaving a comment themselves.\nThe one thing which bears examination is the fact that print media doesn’t offer the option of immediate comments, yet people continue to write to the editor to express their views. Not all letters are accepted, of course, but those which make it into print are published for their relevance and clarity of expression, surely, and in order to make a contribution to a subject or debate.\nThe internet and social media combined have had the effect of turning huge numbers of consumers into ‘immediate gratification’ junkies. That is exactly the word which describes the addiction to provoking ire, making inane comments and raising contentious issues by expressing direct and vicious attacks for no reason other than that they can. For that reason, the removal of the comments feature seems like a sensible idea.\nStating that the removal of comments is a direct attack on freedom of speech can only be said to be applicable when the publication or website in question becomes simply a mouthpiece for the government or ruling party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:04:43.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
