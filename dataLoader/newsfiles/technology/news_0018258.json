Jurbala, M.D., commented \"We are extremely pleased with the results to date, and patient satisfaction has exceeded our expectations. Patients appreciate the minimally invasive nature of the procedure, and surgeons appreciate the convenience of an office-based environment.\" The Trigger Tome procedure is more accurate, less expensive and allows the patient to return to normal activity much faster than current open surgery protocol. Instruments are available to surgeon customers sterile and disposable.\nThe Company will be attending the American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) in Seattle from September 10-12, 2015 ( http://www.assh.org ).
