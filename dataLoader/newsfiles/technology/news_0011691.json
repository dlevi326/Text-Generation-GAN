His colleague Baher Mohammed has also left the prison accompanied by his family,\" Fahmy's wife, Marwa Omara, told dpa.\nThe pardons, marking the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha, are the first to include prominent figures caught up in Egypt's crackdown on dissent since al-Sissi, then head of the armed forces, ousted Islamist president Mohammed Morsi two years ago.\nThey were issued ahead of al-Sissi's visit to New York to attend the UN General Assembly meetings.\nFahmy, Mohammed and Australian journalist Peter Greste were arrested in late 2013 and charged with publishing false news and collaborating with Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which has been banned as a terrorist organization.\nThey were sentenced to seven years imprisonment on those charges in an initial trial last year. Observers at the trial said that no concrete evidence in support of the allegations had been heard in court sessions open to the press.\nThe convictions were overturned on appeal and the journalists were jailed for three years after a retrial that concluded last month.\nGreste was released and deported on al-Sissi's orders in February before the retrial started.\nEmbarrassed Egyptian authorities\nFahmy gave up his Egyptian citizenship in order to qualify for deportation like Greste, saying a senior security official had urged him to do so to save the country embarrassment, but was not released.\nHuman rights organizations and press freedom groups had called for the release of the journalists.\nThe case clearly embarrassed Egyptian authorities, with al-Sissi publicly saying that it would have been better if the journalists had been deported instead of being put on trial.\nInterior Ministry spokesman Abu Bakr Abdul Kareem said the other prisoners, including 16 women, will be released \"within hours.\"\nThe presidency said the pardons came \"in the framework of the president's initiative to release groups of young people, which he launched in December last year.\"\nThousands of people, mainly suspected Islamists but also including young democracy activists, have been jailed since Morsi's toppling in the wake of mass protests against his increasingly unpopular rule.\nMost have been accused of illegal demonstrations, membership of illegal organizations, or participation in riots and deadly attacks on security forces.\nAccording to data compiled by activists from the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, some 41,000 people were detained or prosecuted between the fall of Morsi and May 2014.\nAmong those to be freed are two prominent young female activists, Sanaa Seif and Yara Salam, who were jailed last year under a law that effectively bans protests without prior police approval.\nThe pardons also come less than a month before the start of Egypt's parliamentary elections, which the government says mark the final stage in a process of restoring democracy after alleged abuses under Morsi's one-year rule.\nApril 6 Youth Movement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T00:14:57.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
