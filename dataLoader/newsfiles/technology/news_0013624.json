That, and the “ three-day rule ” – the length of time it was deemed necessary to wait before contacting someone after the first date.\nTinder , however, has distanced itself from received courting wisdom with the latest addition to its dating app – the “super like” feature, which allows users to declare an interest more eager than a mere swipe right.\nIt’s true that both the three-day rule and the idea that acting disrespectfully to a potential mate is outdated practice – and by “outdated” I mean awful and socially inept – but Tinder’s super-like feature isn’t something that sets the heart a-fluttering either.\nFresh from the moral panic that an article in Vanity Fair created , in which Tinder was portrayed as a tool for oversexed college frat boys, the app has released a promo for its new feature, poking fun at its reputation for users being, well, oversexed college frat boys.\nTinder’s new advert for the super-like feature. Super like (swipe up) will be a third option presented to a user when browsing other users of the app – along with the pre-existing options to swipe left (reject) or swipe right (approve). At present, if two users swipe right on each other, they will be “matched” and are able to converse privately. A user does not know if another user has swiped right on his or her profile until he or she has done likewise.\nWith the super like option, however, users will be able to see when browsing if a user has already “super liked” them. Tinder hopes this will “influence” the actions of users (ie encourage more matches). Because ego.\nIntroducing varying levels of liking, however, could prove to be a disaster. If one is super liked, it may raise concerns that a suitor is, like, really eager. See also: blurting out potential kids’ names on a first date (Reuben and Rafferty for twin boys, by the way).\nThe flip side is if one receives a swipe right, but not a super like . This just sends a signal that someone thinks you’re OK, but in the parlance of many a rom-com, just isn’t that into you . It sets the relationship up for banal dates in the park and mediocre sex before one partner calls time on “what was a good thing while it lasted”.\nEach user is allowed just one “super like” a day. Tinder’s chief executive, Sean Rad, has said that this limitation “sends a more powerful signal, conveying an especially high level of interest”. Which is great, but see above. How does one know a super-liker isn’t going to turn out to be the type of person who adds you on Facebook on the night bus home from date two?\nIt’s possible that Tinder felt the need, after the recent negative publicity off the back of the Vanity Fair piece – exacerbated by a public relations Twitter meltdown – to announce a new feature to shift its current image. But the super-like feature is the kind of idea that should have stayed on the A3 flip-board and been disregarded way before the boardroom broke for lunch.\nThe feature is now available in Australia, and will be rolled out to other countries later in the year. It remains to be seen whether users will take to the new swiping option, but as far as I’m concerned … well, I don’t super like it.\n• Star-crossed lovers?
