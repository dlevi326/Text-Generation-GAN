It previously was granted breakthrough therapy designation, which speeds up the development and review of drugs for serious illnesses.\nThe acceptance is supported by promising data from a late-stage, randomized style that showed the drug was more efficient in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone than lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone.\nBristol-Myers is co-developing elotuzumab with AbbVie Inc. but is solely responsible for commercial activities.\nBristol-Myers has gained attention as a leader in developing drugs that enlist the power of the immune system against cancer. In another recent study, a combination of the company's immunotherapy drug Opdivo and skin-cancer drug Yervoy delayed the progression of melanoma longer than either drug alone, which could support wider use of both drugs.\nShares, inactive premarket, have fallen 11% in the past three months through Monday's close.\nWrite to Angela Chen at angela.chen@wsj.com\nSeptember 01, 2015 08:35 ET (12:35 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:52:27.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
