The technique known as the wavelet transform was first reported in 1910, but it was during the early 1990s that its applications in medicine and biomedical research first emerged and it is now reaching maturity as a technique to supplement or even displace conventional analytical methods. \nThe conventional approach to processing imaging data from medical scanners is to apply a computer algorithm, a Fourier transform, which converts the raw signals into a format that can be displayed as an image on the computer screen to reveal brain damage, detect tumors and look for defects in the heart and for countless other diagnostic reasons. The Fourier transform is a powerful tool but Satya Singh and Shabana Urooj of the Gautam Buddha University, in Uttar Pradesh, India, suggest that an alternative signal processing system based on an analysis of \"wavelets\" could improve medical imaging significantly. They point out that a wavelet transform applied to the raw imaging data would boost the signal to noise ratio for the data by ignoring many of the artifacts generated by interfering electrical signals and waves present in the body and picked by the scanner. \nThe team reports that the same wavelet transform approach could have applications not only in MRI but in simplifying electrocardiography, de-noising biomedical images and in facilitating and functional neuroimaging, including positron emission tomography and functional MRI (fMRI). The latter requiring data processing in real-time so that live images can be recorded and studied. In addition, the wavelet transform produces a much smaller digital file than conventional processing, which means faster data transfer and lower storage requirements per scan. NIST PET phantoms bring new accuracy to medical scans July 29, 2015 \nTeaming with a medical equipment company, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have demonstrated the first calibration system for positron emission tomography (PET) scanners directly tied ... Leaner Fourier transforms: Algorithm separates signals into their individual frequencies using minimal number of samples December 11, 2013 \nThe fast Fourier transform, one of the most important algorithms of the 20th century, revolutionized signal processing.
