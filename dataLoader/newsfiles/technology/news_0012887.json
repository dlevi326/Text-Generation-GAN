InfoSnap’s award winning integration with PowerSchool, the district’s student information system, generates real-time, on-demand data transfer between the two systems. “We were looking for an intuitive solution that is both cost and time effective to simplify student registration for our families and school staff. InfoSnap provides us with a responsive solution that is helping to increase efficiency throughout the entire school community,” notes Jim Froemming, Director of Business Services at Port Washington-Saukville School District.\nThe electronic format allows families who have more than one child in the district to ‘snap’ data from one student to another. SmartForm™ technology, an intuitive tool built into the solution, collects relevant data based on previously entered information or choices (grade, activities, medical history, etc.). The data submitted by families is reviewed, polished, and formatted to meet the district’s policies and then delivered into PowerSchool, resulting in up-to-date records on the first day of school.\nThe opportunity for parents to enter a core set of data that can then be applied to other children who attend the district is a valuable time saving feature. The solution also provides both families and staff with the opportunity to spend more time on the things they want to do rather than the things they have to do.\nSince launching the InfoSnap solution, more than 85% of the district’s families have completed registration online. “InfoSnap worked well with our staff to deliver our solution in a timely manner. We are receiving great feedback from families and administrators which lets us know that we selected the highest of quality providers for online student registration,” said Froemming.\nAbout InfoSnap\nInfoSnap®, Inc. is the leading provider of cloud-based registration management solutions, including online Application, Admissions, School Choice/Lottery, New Student Enrollment, Annual Student Registration, and Staff Registration, designed specifically for Pre K-12 independent, charter, and public schools.
