It provides capacities of 1.6, 3.2, or 4 Tbytes in a single PCIe 3.0 x8 low profile add-in card. \nThe card enables 5 Gbye/s sequential reads and 3 Gbyte/s sequential writes. 20 nm High-Endurance Technology MLC NAND flash yields endurance of up to three DWPD over 5 years. Idle power is 11.5 W and maximum power is 40 W. The card has two controllers and NAND pools and presents itself logically to the host as two separate volumes. $3,509 for the 1.6 Tbyte model.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T07:55:25.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
