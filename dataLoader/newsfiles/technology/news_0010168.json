Bard in 2002, during which time the company was seeking FDA clearance for the blood clot filter. She alleges that she had concerns about the product after a small human clinical trial showed warning signs and Bard did not give her some important safety performance test results.\nShe tried to continue the investigation, but, she told NBC, received in return an indication that if she kept looking into the device she would be removed from the team.\nThe application for the product was submitted to the FDA with what appears to be Fuller’s signature on it, but, she said, she did not sign off on it and the signature did not match her handwriting.\nShe resigned from Bard and reported her concerns about the blood clot filter to the FDA.\nThe Recovery is housed inside the vena cava, and prevents blood clots from traveling into the heart or lungs. About 34,000 of the filters have been sold to patients. One patient died when the filter punctured her heart, and another was nearly killed when a piece of the filter broke off during a severe car accident.\nBard executives denied that they had submitted forged documents to the FDA, but otherwise refused to comment on Fuller’s case.\nThe company has been involved in legal actions before: in July 2015 the FDA notified Bard of violations at two of its facilities, including marketing a device without FDA approval. Three executives were imprisoned in 1994 after a court determined that the company made false statements in its communication with regulators and illegally altered and marketed catheters.\n(Via NBC .)", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/did-forged-signature-clear-way-dangerous-medical-device-n417246"], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T00:44:35.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
