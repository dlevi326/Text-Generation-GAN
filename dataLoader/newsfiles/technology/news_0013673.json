He will have two years of eligibility remaining.\nHarden, a redshirt senior, suffered a broken bone in his foot during a non-contact drill before the season. He was the team’s leading receiver last year with 60 catches for 885 yards and seven touchdowns.\nGeorgia State Panthers wide receiver Avery Sweeting (80) could return as early as next week.
