ESA/Rosetta/Navcam - CC BY-SA IGO 3.0\nEven by comet standards, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is a bit goofy-looking. It's most often compared to a rubber duck when people try to describe its shape.\nThe comet is the focus of the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission and scientists have been puzzling over its distinctive look since it first came into the spacecraft's view in July 2014.\nTwo main theories have competed with each other: either one big comet eroded in an odd way to form 67P's \"neck,\" or two comets merged in the long-distant past. The mystery has now been solved.\nRosetta captures comet's craggy beauty (pictures)", "external_links": ["http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/28/786cb1a5-4d3a-4fad-839c-a7fb5fb351a9/resize/570xauto/f13ebf73ae4f0304a5f89a18bf3bc09c/rosettacomet.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-28T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T19:21:58.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
