His mind was stumbling more than his feet. Last night I felt the same. All thoughts consumed in a hurricane of exasperating emotion. Everything was just white noise; the laughter coming from the neutral fans, the chiming of the church bells in Antwerp, the hoards of tourists comparing photos of the quaint architecture. And there I was, misty eyes condensing, avoiding all eye contact. I dared not look at the man who sold me my bottle of Absolut, and my Lucky Strikes. Last night wasn't that complicated; Moan, groan, drink, smoke, repeat.\nAt the depths of my devastation, a few hard rugby truths began to surface. And I shy away from none of them.\nQuite possibly the biggest game in the history of Springbok rugby will be against Samoa next week. That’s first off. The dinosaurs of South Africa were outplayed by the significantly smaller, more determined pack of Japan, and although Samoa pose a different threat, it’s of juggernaut proportions, physically and mentally. The colossal men from the Pacific Isles can taste blood, let alone smell it, and considering how the Boks have been wounded from the losses against Ireland, Wales, and Argentina, (it’s barely worth mentioning the Wallabies and All Blacks), Samoa will try “Fee fi fo fum” their way to another historic victory in this year's Rugby World Cup. One only has to remember how close they came in 2011. But the Springboks can still win it. Not just next week, I’m talking about the whole tournament.\nI’ve witnessed classics, from France vs New Zealand in 1999, to the iconic Wales vs Fiji match in 2007. But when Tonga beat France in 2011, the outcome I feel was appreciated differently. It sits in history, but the players chose to rewrite it with follow-up performances. The clear difference between the first two examples and the latter one is that France still carried on in the tournament, despite two losses in the pool stages. They made it by a fraction of a hair to the quarters. They then smashed the English, withstood the Welsh, and nearly caused the greatest sporting upset in history, inches short by blasphemously beating Richie McCaw and the All Blacks off their throne, in their kingdom, in the final. It was just one wayward converted penalty kick that nearly saw Tonga being the unofficial champions of the rugby world.\nWe can’t speak such truths without lamenting the warrior that took them there, Thierry Dusautoir. His performances against New Zealand are some of the best ever displayed, and had it not been for him, and a small group that followed his example, France would have been the epitome of a team to showcase how severely a coach could destroy the support and love for a rugby team.\nIn South Africa’s case, coach Heyneke Meyer has done extremely well under the turbulent, and ‘necessary’ conditions smothered on him by political interferences. I dare not consider someone a rugby lover in the republic if they think he is to blame for all this. His players are tested, and maybe too tired. Their careers have been long, but they have consistently been some of the best players in world. Up until a year ago, South Africa camped at no.2 for years, and he has only done his best to take us to the summit. Meyer, and captain Jean de Villiers spoke as if their mission had failed. Their words complemented their nature. The grief was tangible.\nNone more so than Jean. Many are saying form over experience is the only way to approach the tournament. And it’s difficult to argue with that. Jean has had absolute minimum game time this year, and truth be said, he’s not our best centre anymore. Damien de Allende and Jessie Kriel are our best centre pairing, and there is no doubt about that. But this cannot happen.\nWe need to play with our heads now, and although ‘the most experienced Springbok side ever fielded’ ultimately conceded the greatest upset in rugby history (also no doubt about this), Heyneke Meyer, must, and should, stick to his guns. The Springbok emblem will be a sinking ship if Meyer is to opt for the ‘everyman for himself‘ approach. I couldn’t help but feel that, from now on, it's all or nothing, every game, our best form side. However, like many would say about a Rugby World Cup, “it’s a marathon, not a sprint”. And we need Jean to steer us. He has been there for us season in, season out. He has delivered, and although his form is under severe scrutiny, he is pure class, and class is permanent. He is our captain, and he must go down with the ship if it sinks. The same applies for the rest of our stalwarts.\nAnd if we do win the tournament, and get chastised for not being the world’s best, and we are referred to the Japan loss, then so be it. Think back to the 1 point difference that separated New Zealand and France in the final in 2011. You don’t have to be the best in the world to win the tournament, you just need to be better than your opponents on the day, as exhibited by the beautiful cherry blossoms.\nI called my extremely rugby void girlfriend last night to tell me that “rugby is just a game”, that “it just doesn’t matter”. Well, she didn’t get through to me, but she said something that pierced me as hard as yesterday’s result.\n“Japan must have gone through hell.”\nHow selfish of me as a rugby supporter to not know this, and understand this immediately. (To my defence, I was rather inebriated). I have always loved and cherished an underdog win. The saddest days of my rugby life was when Ireland only narrowly beat Georgia 14-10 in the 2007 tournament, and when the Irish lost to New Zealand in 2013 after leading 19-0. Heartbroken. Spirit smashed. I could only imagine the global rugby sorrow had South Africa held on for the win. In retrospect, I too would have been teary-eyed today because Japan’s rugby history has been tormented by horrifying losses against tier-1 nations. Every side like Japan need a momentous win to propel the future of their game forward. The amount of hours and sacrifice Eddie Jones and his players have committed in their lives for such an outstanding victory is worth a second standing ovation from the world over. Funny enough, Japan are a testament to Winston Churchill’s words that “if you’re in hell, keep going”.\nAnd this is what Heyneke Meyer, Jean de Villiers and the Springboks must do, just keep f*cking going, and don’t look back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:11:14.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
