The biotechnology company, located in the Science + Technology Park at Johns Hopkins, has outlined one of the best potential therapies yet for people with Down syndrome and other chromosome disorders in a paper entitled, \" Correction of Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome aneuploidies in human cell cultures, \" published in the journal DNA Research . Elixirgen plans to develop this technology into a treatment for the many complications that affect people with Down syndrome and other chromosome disorders at all age levels. \nThe paper demonstrates the use of the gene ZSCAN4 as a means to cure chromosome abnormalities. First, the company's researchers developed footprint-free ways to deliver ZSCAN4 into cells; the gene is expressed in a transient manner. Next, they found that such \"hit-and-run\" application of the gene significantly increased the proportion of cells with a normal number of chromosomes - also known as euploidy - in a population of mouse embryonic stem cells with mostly abnormal numbers of chromosomes - also known as aneuploidy. Finally, the researchers used the human version of the same gene on cells from people with Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome and found a significant increase in the number of euploid cells. Because Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome are caused by having three copies of a chromosome (21 and 18 respectively), the euploid cells no longer have the characteristics of either of those syndromes. Interestingly, ZSCAN4 is found ordinarily in the 2-cell stage of mammalian embryos and occasionally in stem cells, making the gene a natural chromosome therapy. \nPeople with Down syndrome often experience a range of complications such as '/>\"/> Page: 1 2 Related biology technology :   NEW YORK, April 18, 2011 KellBenx, a biotechnology ...
