Schreiner MediPharm's Flexi-Cap makes this impossible as the security concept is based on an innovative combination of label and cap. \nThe film cap is first put over the closed container, then the label is applied without covering the peel-open tab on the opening strip. \nOnce the strip is opened, the bottom part of the cap, together with the label, remains attached to the container. Attempting to remove the reset of the cap destroys the label and eliminates the possibility of illegal, unnoticed reuse. \nDue to the novel coloured film caps, Flexi-Cap can also be used to prevent medication errors. Colour marking allows physicians and nurses to instantly verify they are handling the right product and dosage. \nThe cap's transparent film material is printed using various easily differentiated colours. Pharmaceutical manufacturers can design caps to meet specific requirements. \nSince the solution leaves ample space for customer-specific designs, they can also include branding components. \nFlexi-Cap allows flexible use with different container types, forms and sizes. Unlike shrink-wrap solutions, the label construction can be applied without using heat, making it suitable for temperature-sensitive medicines. \nThe top of Flexi-Cap allows space for bar code printing or NFC chip integration for electronic tracking. In addition, important user information can be communicated and patient compliance documented.
