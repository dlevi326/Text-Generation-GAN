Instead, I am sadly here to break the bad news to you: Apple has decided to continue to offer its dreaded “Storage Almost Full” messages with a 16GB iPhone 6S.\nInstead of bumping up the entry-level $650 iPhone 6S to a more usable 32GB of storage like Samsung and other competitors have done with their lower-tier models, Apple will continue to offer 16GB, 64GB and 128GB options.\nThe structure continues to be one of Apple’s best money traps: For just $100 more you can go up to the 64GB model and get quadruple the storage. You know what the pricing is great for? Apple’s margins.\nOf course, Apple and many others will argue that 16GB is good enough for many people, especially when iCloud is integrated for backing up photos, videos, notes and more to the cloud. Except when you snap photos or shoot 4K video with the new 6S, it will all be saved locally before it is uploaded to the cloud.\nThe good news is that iOS 9, which will ship on the 6S, won’t require as much free space when there are updates to the operating system. Still, as phones turn into our primary cameras and have hefty, more powerful apps, 16GB is no longer good enough.\nIt’s time for the 16GB iPhone to die, even if Apple won’t admit it yet.\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T01:18:16.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
