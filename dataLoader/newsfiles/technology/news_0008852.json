The study revealed that 20 percent of patients examined by the study had at least three major nutrient deficiencies before having their procedure, pointing to the fact that nutrient deficiency might have more to do with being obese than it does with losing weight. According to Los Angeles bariatric surgeon Dr. Michael Feiz, this finding may come as a surprise to many people, and is an important reminder of the difference between caloric intake and nutrition.\nDr. Feiz notes that many people assume that obesity means that a person is eating a large amount of food, so they are therefore receiving a large amount of nutrients. Yet, he explains, a person can eat a great deal of unhealthy food and still lack the nutrients that go along with eating a healthy diet. If a patient is eating very unhealthy food, or simply a large amount of the same type of food, their nutrients may be unbalanced like many of the patients examined in this study.\nRegardless of whether or not a patient has nutrient deficiencies before their surgery, Dr. Feiz notes that it is vital that they take nutrient supplements during their weight loss journey. Part of the reason why people naturally assumed that nutrient deficiencies among bariatric patients were a result of their weight loss, Dr. Feiz explains, is that a reduction in food intake does logically lead to a reduction in nutrients. While this study points out that at least some of the bariatric patients suffering from nutrient deficiencies had those issues before they began losing weight, it should not be taken to mean that supplements during each individualâ€™s weight loss journey are any less important.\nFor countless patients, weight loss surgery with Dr. Feiz and Associates gave them the tools that they need to successfully lose weight and keep the weight off. For many of them, equally important to their success was the carefully considered nutrient regimen that Dr. Feiz and his staff provide for each patient in order to ensure the healthiest possible weight loss.
