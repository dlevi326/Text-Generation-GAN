Many are struggling with too much debt to spend heartily. But there may be a turnaround as the 75 million millennials pivot their tastes from mass-market retailers like Aeropostale to upscale haute couture, at least among older millennials.\nAccording to Forrester Data, a division of Forrester Research Inc, older millennials (ages 27-35) started to splurge in 2015, suddenly spending twice as much as younger millennials (ages 18-26). The two groups spent evenly on purchases in 2014.\nThe median amount spent on the most recent luxury good item purchased by older millennials was $180 in early 2015. Younger ones spent $91 on their most recent purchase.\nThat tops Gen Xers, also beleaguered by financial woes, who spent a median $150, but hardly competes with the richer, more settled baby boomers (50-59) who spent a strong $250.\nWu finds that the trend driving new spending among his millennial customers is that they are now interested in long-lasting quality items, not just what is cheap and expedient. \"We are not so disposable anymore, and I think that mirrors how I design clothes,\" Wu says.\nFOCUS THOSE MINDS\nDesigners are increasing their social media footprint to grab the attention of millennials bombarded by their peers with pictures, video, news, music and messages.\nFor instance, at New York Fashion Week, which runs Sept. 10-17, veteran designer Ralph Lauren was one of many using the new livestream mobile app Periscope to broadcast runway shows. Periscope has 10 million users.\n\"Periscope is changing the way fashion fans consume and experience fashion, essentially democratizing it for everyone,\" says Rachel Dodes, head of fashion partnerships at Twitter Inc . \"The two-way nature of Periscope allows people to engage in a way that wasn't possible before, and as we've seen this fashion week, the community is embracing it.\"\nThrough the last day of the fashion event, there were 97 Periscope livestreams coming from designers, according to Socialbakers, a social media marketing consultant.\nThe goal for attracting buyers? \"Making them feel like they're at the show, just like I'm at the show,\" says Jaclyn Jones, an editor at fashion trend forecasting firm WGSN.\nDesigners make it easy for millennials to tap into social media for instant feedback. Almost 70 percent of millennials check in with peers on social media before making a purchase, according to strategic retail advisory firm HRC Advisory.\nSocial media sites like Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest all play a role in getting the thumbs up. To make sure customers can connect at the point of sale, retailers are installing Wi-Fi and charging stations in their stores, says HRC Advisory's president Farla Efros.\nThat will keep millennials browsing - and buying - in style.
