Unlike traditional multimode fiber, which supports transmission at the single wavelength of 850 nanometers (nm), LaserWave FLEX WideBand fiber will support traffic over a range of wavelengths from 850nm to 950nm. This will enable multiple lanes of traffic over the same strand of fiber and significantly improve the bandwidth capacity of multimode fiber while maintaining its cost advantages for short distance applications, up to 300 meters (m) or more. The fiber will support four wavelength 100 Gb/s applications, while providing bandwidth for tomorrow's 400Gb/s and higher speeds. \n\"We have been working to offer datacenter end-users a solution for 400 Gb/s transmission and SWDM provides the possibility of duplex 100 Gb/s links while allowing a graceful 400G solution using only eight fibers,\" said Andrew Oliviero, Senior Director, Product Line Management |Research and Development for OFS. \"WDM technology is well known for its use in single mode transmission, but has only recently been adapted for use with vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), used in short wave multimode applications. The use of SWDM in these applications enables multimode fiber to maintain the cost advantage of multimode fiber systems over single-mode fiber in short links and greatly increases the total link capacity.\" \nAbout OFS \nOFS is a world-leading designer, manufacturer and provider of optical fiber, optical fiber cable, connectivity, FTTX and specialty photonics solutions.
