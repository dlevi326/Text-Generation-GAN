The first was the release of The Notebook in 2004, which sparked the beginning of the Nicholas Sparks Industrial Complex, sucking up all available emotional sincerity into a giant vortex of tears and walks on the beach and American towns preserved in time. The second was the ascendancy of Judd Apatow, whose brilliance prompted filmmakers everywhere to adopt the now-well-worn formula of kidults trying to find love. No longer would circumstance get in the way of two people getting together; instead, it was the people themselves whose assholery or manbabyness or sadomasochistic impulses were the issue that had to be overcome.\nRelated Story Why Are Romantic Comedies So Bad?\nLeslye Headland’s Sleeping With Other People is a film very much in the contemporary rom-com mold, in that there’s very little standing between its two protagonists other than their own worst tendencies, and thus not a whole lot to enjoy other than a series of increasingly exhausting attempts to be subversive. Lainey (Alison Brie) and Jake (Jason Sudeikis) meet in 2002, when he sees her drunkenly attempting to break down the door of a TA in his dorm and intervenes before she’s thrown off campus. Striking up an instant rapport, the pair lose their virginity to each other and then never talk again until a second run-in at a sex-addiction meeting 12 years later.\nNeither is actually a sex addict—Lainey is obsessed with the TA from the first scene, now a dull gynecologist (Adam Scott) who’s been cheating on his fiancée with her, and Jake is the kind of guy who sleeps with his girlfriend’s best friend and then blames her getting upset about it on the “societal insecurity” that pits women against each other.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T23:11:09.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
