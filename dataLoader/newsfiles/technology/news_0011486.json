TDS Carrier OnBoarding gathers, validates and maintains accurate motor carrier qualification information using the complete TDS database as well as surveys and the private-branded onboarding websites that TDS provides to brokers as part of the service. The product can be quickly configured to match the existing workflows of brokers to accelerate the onboarding process, specific to their needs.\n“In response to tight capacity, freight brokers are looking to expand their network of carriers while improving the quality to grow their businesses,” said Lyn Simon, president of TDS. “TDS Carrier OnBoarding provides accurate, up-to-date information on carriers to confidently move freight, faster and more efficiently than before.”\nThe product instantly verifies insurance coverage, CSA scores, operating authority, roadside inspection violations and more based on custom business requirements. TDS continues to validate and monitor carrier qualification data, sending instant notifications if any changes occur.\nThe Carrier OnBoarding package comes with the full TDS database, a dedicated account manager and training. An instant search feature in the TDS database, Lane Search Plus, compliments the onboarding process by identifying carriers that operate in specified lanes by equipment type.\n“Brokers that use Carrier OnBoarding with Lane Search Plus can build and maintain a database of qualified carriers to eliminate time-consuming searches,” added Simon. “This all-inclusive package costs less than what other companies are charging just for carrier monitoring services alone.”\nThe TDS database comes with a web-based user interface. Through optional integration capabilities, the Lane Search Plus, Carrier OnBoarding and other features can be embedded in transportation management software (TMS) systems to further streamline workflows.\nAbout TDS\nTransportation Data Source (TDS) provides unique, detailed information about carriers in easily accessible formats tailored to benefit a wide range of users, particularly third party logistics providers that specialize in brokerage.
