Is it even an issue in New Zealand? \nTragically, yes it is. \nStory met a private investigator with the ability to enter your child's virtual reality. \nCyber bullies might regard Mike Chappell as their worst nightmare. To some parents he's a godsend. \nAnxious parents bring their child's phone or device to him, and within minutes, he can access content – images, text messages – even those that have been deleted. \nWhat he's seen, what he's read, is shocking – \"Why don't you go and jump off the bridge?

They think they can do whatever they want, say whatever they want.\" \nBut under the new cyber bully legislation, if the recipient can prove the message caused serious emotional distress, the sender can face jail time and up to three years imprisonment for inciting someone to take their own life. \nWatch the video for the full Story report.
