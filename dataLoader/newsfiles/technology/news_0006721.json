Customers can now use Zomato to order online from a huge number of restaurants, and enjoy the convenience of making completely cashless payments using the Paytm wallet,” said Tanmay Saksena, global business head, Zomato Order, which is run by Zomato Media Pvt Ltd. \nIn May, Zomato launched a new app called Order, allowing users to order food through its platform. The service is currently operational in Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Kochi, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Coimbatore and Indore. \nJust like countless other food ordering apps, Zomato Order too enables users to view menus and ratings, and order for free from a range of restaurants. Customers can search by restaurant name or location, and see places that deliver to their location; give their current location or select a new location for delivery; add frequently used locations to their address book for quick orders; track order status with real-time notifications; and see all previous orders and reorder from the list. Zomato recently invested in hyperlocal delivery startups Pickingo and Grab while partnering with e-commerce logistics firm Delhivery . \nThe Paytm wallet option is in addition to the existing payment options such as credit/debit cards, net banking and cash on delivery at Zomato. “We are delighted to integrate Paytm Wallet on Zomato. It’s the leading food discovery and ordering platform in India, and has the largest consumer base in this space. Food ordering is a prime use case for Paytm wallet users, and the association with Zomato will be great for our users. This is in sync with our mission of moving towards a cashless environment in India,” Amit Lakhotia, vice president, Paytm. \nPaytm recently crossed the 100 million users threshold for its mobile wallet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T16:10:20.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
