(John Green/San Jose Mercury News/TNS) \n\"Oh these? No, these don't have x-ray vision — yet,\" said a Google Glass user . \nYeah, safe to say \"much-needed\" is an understatement. \nBut Project Aura will be about more than just saving Google Glass from its unpleasant past; the company reportedly hopes the project can help it compete in the virtual reality/augmented reality market. \nIt's a market that's growing quickly, and it's chock-full of major players to boot. Microsoft's HoloLens is poised to be an augmented reality hit and the Facebook-owned Oculus Rift is already a darling among developers and gamers alike. \nAnd Google isn't playing around — the company has reportedly poached engineers and developers from Amazon's special hardware team, Lab126. (Video via Amazon ) \nThat means we could see Google taking on Samsung and Apple with a whole host of new wearable devices. According to Re/code , members of Google's new team say they're working on \"Google Glass and Beyond,\" and \"building cool wearables.\" (Video via Apple ) \nAs long as you don't have to strap those \"cool wearables\" to your face, I'm sure whatever Google's working on will be better than good ol' Google Glass. \nThis video includes images from lawrencegs / CC BY 2.0 and Ted Eytan / CC BY SA 2.0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T16:31:13.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
