Not only does it track software configurations – it also provides the opportunity to store the software in a repository on-ground for upload to the aircraft through portable data loaders and physical media, including even floppy disks. The solution increases operator safety, and provides coherent management of the aircraft’s optimal “as operated” state. \nThe eEnabled Software Management solution is developed by Flatirons for Lufthansa Technik, and is jointly being marketed by the two companies to the airlines industry. The eESM tool is in production at Lufthansa Technik, and supports several of their 3 rd party airline customers. \nMiika Haatio, Head Of A350 Fleet Engineering with Finnair, noted that “ Finnair is proud to be one of the first airlines to take the advanced Airbus A350 into service. We needed a tool to manage all the software upgrades on-board the aircraft. The eEnabled Software Management tool from Flatirons and Lufthansa will help us fully control all software updates on each aircraft individually. Through its integration with the currently deployed Maintenance Management System from AMOS, the eESM solution will help us to ensure best possible aircraft configuration management .” \nDaniel Wilk, Product Manager at Lufthansa Technik and a leader in defining the solution’s innovative approach to eEnabled software configuration management, also noted that “ Lufthansa Technik and Flatirons have worked hard to realize our vision of eESM for the real-world MRO enterprise. We are now seeing increasing demand for the eESM tool, as more and more eEnabled aircraft are taken into service. ” \nFlatirons’ President of EMEA, Toralf Johannessen, stated that “ We have had an amazing partnership with Lufthansa Technik spanning more than two decades of service. In addition to a large team who are developing and supporting several of Lufthansa Technik’s MRO systems on-site, we have recently been appointed a Lufthansa Innovation Partner. As new partnerships like the Finnair agreement demonstrates, our work has been productive for the industry.” \nOperators or MROs seeking additional information on the Flatirons eEnabled Software Management solution, including a personalized briefing, are invited to visit the CORENA Suite website at http://www.corena.com/products/eenabled-software-management-eesm/ . \nAbout Finnair \nFinnair ( www.finnair.com ) flies between Asia, Europe and North America with an emphasis on fast connections via Helsinki, carrying more than nine million passengers annually and connecting 15 cities in Asia with more than 60 destinations in Europe.
