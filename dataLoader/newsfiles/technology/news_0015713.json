Greek is next in line so that activists there can let refugees heading north what to expect,\" Kov said. \nOne of the two coders behind the app—28-year-old Afghan-Hungarian Enys Mones, who Kov calls the \"brains\" of the operation—told AFP there are already 700 daily active users, and around 100 new ones every day. \n\"One user can then spread the word, so more and more people are getting real-time info,\" Kov says. \nA half-Hungarian born in Paris, 34-year-old Kov says her ethnic-German grandfather was forced to leave his home in Romania in 1946, while her Russian father swapped \"anti-Russian\" Hungary for France in the late-1970s. \n\"Everyone in Europe has refugee blood, if you look deep enough inside,\" she says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T07:05:59.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
