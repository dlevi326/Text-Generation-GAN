The conference will showcase growing influence of Hindi in the IT sector with industry giants like Microsoft, Google, Apple and Cdac all set to take visitors by surprise with their latest software innovations to promote Hindi. Beginning with Google, the company has provided a series of software from search engines to Hindi fonts and from Hindi typing to voice-search and dictation. \"The input tool in Hindi developed by Google is becoming popular with an addition of Hindi keyboard, which could help novices write irrespective of their knowledge of Hindi typing,\" said Pravin Das of Google Inc. Das said the handwriting software can write on device screens and the latest Google voice recognition has surprising results which can detect commands in Hindi, English or Hinglish. He also admitted 10 per cent errors in application. Also, a wordland application would help translation from Hindi to English or vice-a versa through lens or camera. Tech giant Microsoft is also supporting Hindi since 2000 after company promoter Bill Gates pushed the company in India to promote local languages. \"MS office Unicode has more capabilities to provide Hindi content. Through this, all version of Windows will support Hindi language, including power point and excel,\" said director (marketing) Microsoft India, Alok Lal. He said MS office is compatible in all versions, including Windows, Android and even on I-pads. A recent addition is 'Digital India Curriculum' to educate novices on use of computers and simple software, he said. Experts say for Hindi learners, cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is a subfield of information retrieval dealing with retrieving information written in a language different from language of the user's query. Aim of this conference is to promote Hindi language in the field of science and technology. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Windows,Microsoft,Google Voice,Google Inc.,Google Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T12:57:55.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
