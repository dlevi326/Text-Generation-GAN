Picture: GALLO IMAGES/DUIF DU TOIT Related articles India bypass speedsters for Proteas Twenty20 duel Proteas selectors plump for spin Test selectors could make easy choices In this article Companies and organisations: Proteas THE Proteas’ media minder, Lerato Malekutu, received a call moments before the start of a news conference at the departure of the national Twenty20 squad from Johannesburg on Saturday.\n\"Plus-91, oh, my word,\" she said. Twenty20 captain Faf du Plessis, who was at her elbow ready to field questions from the reporters, offered empathy: \"Plus-91.… You know what’s coming.\"\nIndeed, she did. Plus-91 is the international dialling code for India, where SA will be until December 7 for three Twenty20s, five one-dayers and four Tests.\nAnd that in cricket’s biggest media goldfish bowl, which is fed by about 87,000 newspapers in one of the few countries in which circulation figures are rising.\nThere are also around 1,400 television channels in India. Radio? Who knows, but there are 17 stations in Delhi alone, 16 in Calcutta and another 17 in Mumbai. And those are only the FM stations.\nSimilarly, it is difficult to put a number on how many Indian websites are devoted to cricket. But some of them are among the most widely read on the internet.\nESPNcricinfo had a daily average of 5.8-million unique visitors during the World Cup. The site’s daily record was set on March 26, when 13-million people logged on to follow the semifinal between Australia and India.\nOn Saturday, one member of that huge army of reporters covering cricket in India was calling Malekutu. And the tour had yet to start …\nBut there was news: David Wiese was out of the Twenty20 squad with a broken hand and replaced by Albie Morkel; Khaya Zondo had been included in the one-day international squad because of Rilee Rossouw’s stress fracture of the foot.\nSelection convener Linda Zondi handed the reins to coach Russell Domingo to coax the players out of their off-season. His approach? The silent treatment. \"I’ve tried not to talk too much to the players in the past few weeks because they are going to be tired of me talking to them in the next few weeks.\n\"I’d hate to be talking spin to them for three weeks before we get there, and we get there and the guys are already mentally blown before we’ve seen a ball bowled.\"\nThe first ball will be bowled in a warm-up match against a Board President’s XI in Delhi on Tuesday and the first Twenty20 is in Dharamsala on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:30:52.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
