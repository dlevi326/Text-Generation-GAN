It sees biotechnology as a revenue growth engine for the future. File picture: Choi Bu-Seok \nSeoul - Samsung unveiled its latest smartwatch on Tuesday as the South Korean tech giant seeks to challenge Apple's global domination in the fast-growing wearable-device market. \nThe round-faced Gear S2 is fitted with a 30mm circular screen and allows for mobile payment and remote control over home appliances as well as common phone calls and text messaging features, according to a company statement. \nSamsung is hoping the new watch will compete with similar Apple products, after the US company became the top provider of wearable devices worldwide only months after the Apple Watch was unveiled in April. \nThe new smartwatch - the latest model by Samsung since last November - will be officially released later this month during the IFA trade fair in Berlin. \nSamsung has released a series of smartwatches since 2013. However, most of the models have been met with lukewarm responses from consumers. \nApple has dominated the wearable device sector, shipping about four million smartwatches globally in the second quarter - about 75 percent of the overall market - market researcher Strategy Analytics estimated in July. \nSamsung came in second by a wide margin, after shipping 400 000 units during the same quarter. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:51:21.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
