And the 14-inch display? It benefits from LED backlighting and an HD+ resolution of 900p. \nWith an all-day battery, a 1.17-inch thick chassis, and an ultra durable design, this affordable little machine has a lot to offer for heavy travelers. At 4.75 pounds, it’s on the heavy side, but the available horsepower here is definitely worth the tradeoff. \nWhile Windows 7 Professional (64-bit) comes installed by default, it also comes with a license for Windows 8 Pro (64-bit). And since the Windows 10 upgrade is free until July of 2016, you’re eligible to upgrade to the latest and greatest OS out of Redmond. \nTypically, this model sells for $1553.20, but Lenovo currently running a massive sale on its online store. When you buy directly, you’ll only be paying $819 (plus any applicable taxes) for the ThinkPad T440p. On top of that, Lenovo also offers free standard shipping via UPS, so the total value here is even better. \nOur commerce group sources the best deals and products for the Geek Deals posts.
