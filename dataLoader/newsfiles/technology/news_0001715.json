You're seeing the first biofluorescent reptile discovered by scientists. While filming small sharks and coral reefs in the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, marine biologists had a stunning encounter with a \"glowing\" sea turtle. Scientists captured footage of a hawkbill sea turtle emitting neon green and red light. The discovery was made in late July by David Gruber of the City University of New York and his team. The footage was released for the first time on Monday. Gruber, an emerging explorer for National Geographic, described the turtle as an alien spaceship when he initially saw it swimming in the water. \"It was absolutely gorgeous,\" Gruber said in an interview with CNN. The turtle swam into the team's lights while they were filming coral underwater. The turtle's appearance was unexpected and took everyone by surprise, he said. In just a few years, scientists have started to pay more attention to biofluorescence in marine species. \"It's a bit like a mystery novel,\" Gruber said. \"It started with jellyfish and coral, and the fluorescent molecules jellyfish and coral create has lead to monumental breakthroughs in biomedical science.\" Fluorescence has helped provide a marker for scientists to see the inner workings of cells and that has partially lead to an explosion in research in the biofluorescence field, Gruber explained. Finding a reptile that exhibits biofluorescence opens up a new set of questions: Why is a turtle emitting light? What is the chemical composition? Unlike bioluminescence , which is when an organism produces its own light through chemical reactions, such as what fireflies do, biofluorescence is when an animal absorbs light, transforms it and radiates it, sometimes in different colors. 8 photos: Bioluminescent fauna and flora Each year, Watasenia scintillans, or firefly squid, rise up from the deep waters off the coast of Japan to mate. In doing so, they emit a light called bioluminescence. It's a chemical reaction that produces light. It occurs mostly in marine animals, but it can also be found in different types of fungi and fireflies. Click through the gallery to see other bioluminescent organisms.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 8 photos: Bioluminescent fauna and flora Noctiluca scintillans or sea sparkle is a large, bioluminescent and nontoxic phytoplankton that causes the sea to glow. It is relatively common in Hong Kong, but it is uncommon to capture its iridescent glow on camera. It only appears when the water is disturbed or the ecosystem is out of balance. Hide Caption 3 of 8 8 photos: Bioluminescent fauna and flora Sea creatures aren't the only thing that glow. Some fungi do, too. Omphalotus nidiformis or ghost fungus is primarily found in Australia. It uses a bioluminescence technique certain organisms have developed to create energy, in the form of light, through a chemical reaction.

Documentary filmmaker Martin Dohrn developed a special camera to catch bioluminescence because he says it was \"...designed to function at the very limits of animal vision, which is far beyond the limits of most cameras.\" Hide Caption 5 of 8 8 photos: Bioluminescent fauna and flora Does the fluorescent lizardfish glow to communicate with other fish? There is a light show in the ocean that you may not be able to see, but many fish can. The discovery of what is hidden from human eyes -- biofluorescence in 180 species of fish -- brings up this and many questions for researchers. Hide Caption 6 of 8 8 photos: Bioluminescent fauna and flora Comb jellyfish, which evolved more than 500 million years ago, can emit and reflect light, according to the National Human Genome Research Institute . Hide Caption 7 of 8 8 photos: Bioluminescent fauna and flora Instead of only producing blue light like most other bioluminescent marine animals, the dragon fish emits a red light as well. Although red light doesn't travel as far, it lets the dragon fish see its prey undetected. Hide Caption 8 of 8 Scientists have discovered the presence of biofluorescence in corals; arthropods such as crabs and insects; and more than 200 species of sharks and fishes. In certain cases, scientists have an idea as to how organisms use biofluorescence. In coral living in sun-drenched parts of the ocean, for example, biofluorescence functions as a form of sunscreen. It also can work as a lure as well. Early studies suggest some fish use biofluorescence as a way to signal to one another. \"For fish and sharks and now turtles, it's much more mysterious,\" Gruber said. Typically biofluorescence is used to attract prey and is used as a form of defense. The neon lights may help with camouflaging the turtle. But Gruber explained that it may be too early to understand why the turtle radiates these lights. \"The ocean is the perfect place to evolve these kinds of fluorescent molecules because it is almost completely blue,\" he said. \"The ocean absorbs almost every other color except for blue -- so these animals have been creating ways to take in that blue light and transform into other colors,\" he said. Scientists are just starting to understand the process. \"This is just another example showing how many mysteries the ocean has in store for us,\" he said. However, the hawksbill turtle is critically endangered and the species is threatened because of climate change. In some areas, there are only several thousand breeding females left. \"Their numbers have really dwindled, and yet we still don't understand them. For me, there's a sense of urgency to protect and understand these species while they are still here,\" he said.
