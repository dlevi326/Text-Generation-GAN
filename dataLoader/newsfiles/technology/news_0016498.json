Theranos’ clinical laboratory offers comprehensive laboratory tests from smaller samples at unprecedented low prices. Founded in 2003 by Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos’ mission is to make actionable health information accessible to people everywhere in the world at the time it matters, enabling early detection and intervention of disease, and empowering individuals with information to live the lives they want to live. \nThe company is also leading transparency in lab testing by committing to FDA review all of its laboratory developed tests and publishing its prices, lab proficiency testing scores, customer satisfaction scores, guest visit times, and more. \n“When one of our Arizona bioscience companies achieves great success, it is cause for celebration across the entire life sciences community,” said AZBio President and CEO Joan Koerber-Walker. “The Arizona Bioscience Company of the Year award recognizes the bioscience company whose Arizona-based operations did the most to transform the world during the last 12 months.” \n“Theranos’ mission is to make actionable health information accessible to everyone at the time it matters. The company’s testing system uses cutting edge technology to make lab testing more efficient, affordable, convenient, and accessible to patients,” said Koerber-Walker. “Theranos has shown great leadership in Arizona, actively advocating for patient access to lab tests and the importance of the information those tests provide to empower patients in our community to engage in their own health, which has the potential to be life-saving.” \nThe company began operations in Arizona in late 2013 and has 42 Theranos Wellness Centers in the greater Phoenix area. Theranos also has business operations and a lab in the newest SkySong building in Scottsdale, employing hundreds of Arizonans, with plans to expand throughout the state. \n“By empowering individuals with the information they need to make more informed health care decisions and better engage with their doctors, we’re helping shift the health care paradigm in this country to one focused on prevention and the early detection of disease, to empower individuals to live their best possible lives,” said Elizabeth Holmes, founder and CEO of Theranos. “The passage of Arizona’s groundbreaking Direct Access testing law introduced the potential for a new era of preventive care across the country, giving Arizonans the opportunity to take control of their own health information, and work with their doctors, so that they can seek care and make lifestyle changes before the onset of disease by taking control of their own health.” \nTheranos will be honored during the Tenth Annual AZBio Awards at the Phoenix Convention Center on October 1, 2015, in front of an audience of local, national, and international leaders. \nPrevious recipients of the Arizona Bioscience Company of the Year Award include: Insys Therapeutics, Inc.
