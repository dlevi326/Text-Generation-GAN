Twitter \nStreaming Apps are coming to Virtual Reality and the first to do so is Netflix, so now you can binge watch your favourite series in your own personal IMAX Theatre. \nComing to Gear VR, a Netflix VR app is available right now so you can watch Orange is the New Black and Daredevil like a futuristic pro. Other apps will also be arriving soon from the likes of Hulu, Vimeo, and of course, Twitch. \nThe news was announced yesterday at the Oculus developer event where the company announced that it’ll be getting a ton of streaming apps with some pretty big content partners, including 20th Century Fox, Lionsgate, and those mentioned above. \n— Oculus (@oculus) September 24, 2015 \nIt seems this experience will not only allow you to watch movies and TV shows in a cinema-like way, it’ll also be able to transport you to different locations, for example, Hulu said that: Viewers can also choose to view Hulu’s library of premium content including movies and current season TV in a classic movie theater setting. Seinfeld fans can choose to be transported on to the blue couch in Jerry’s iconic apartment to watch favorite episodes of the series. \nThat’s a pretty impressive claim, although it sounds fairly gimmicky. \nAre you keen to watch movies and TV in Virtual Reality? Would you like to feel like you’re somewhere else while watching The Hunger Games? I fear if this became a mainstream experience, it’d make watching TV and movies a pretty lonesome experience…", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T02:07:20.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
