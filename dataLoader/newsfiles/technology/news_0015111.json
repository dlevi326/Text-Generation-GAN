One measure of success, he said, will be “more children wanting to study engineering and the sciences.”\nAlbert Helberg, North-West University’s programme coordinator and solar team manager, points to both rising student interest in engineering and the increasing number of small industries engaging in electric vehicle projects as the strongest evidence of the impact of the solar cars.\nSmall and medium-sized companies have approached North-West University to make agreements to collaborate on innovative products in renewable energy, he said.\nThe public in South Africa is becoming more aware of solar energy, he said, in part because of continuing shortages of traditional power from the country’s main electricity grid supply.\nAccording to Tobias Bischof-Niemz of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, about 25 solar plants today contribute 1,000 megawatts of power to the national grid.\nSOUTHERN AFRICA DRIVE\nThe University of Johannesburg also has been taking the green technology message on the road. Parked outside its solar laboratory is the Ilanga II.\nEngineering and industrial design students built the solar car, which is named after the sun in the isiZulu language, in 2013 to compete in the 2014 Sasol Solar Challenge.\nFollowing improvements to the car from a new generation of students this year, the Ilanga II left Johannesburg last June for a 4,160 km (2,600-mile) educational road trip dubbed the 2015 African Solar Drive.\nThe trip saw 20 students from the engineering and humanities faculties taking turns at the wheel. The route passed through Namibia before ending in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana.\nAlong the way, the team made stops in communities and at higher education institutions, meeting students, academics and the public.\n\"The vehicle is used as a platform to promote renewable energy, demonstrating what can be done and inspiring communities to imagine a clean future and to build it themselves,” said Nickey Janse van Rensburg, a programme manager for the university clean energy project.\nJanse van Rensburg said the team was pleasantly surprised to see that some of the communities they visited had already adopted green energy solutions, including rooftop solar lighting and solar water heating.\nDuring the road trip, she added, students collected and analysed data to optimise the performance of the vehicle in preparation for an attempt to set the solar land-speed record in 2016.\nLEARNING PLATFORM\n\"For us, Ilanga is a technology platform to develop students and technology and promote energy innovation, similar to what F1 racing does for the motor industry,” said Janse van Rensburg, who also lectures in mechanical engineering science at the university.\nShe said the university is in discussions with the Polytechnic of Namibia in Windhoek to develop a solar-powered utility vehicle and photovoltaic charging stations.\nShe envisions off-grid solar-powered factories in rural communities across the country, where locals can manufacture items for sale.\n\"The solar car has become a peg project upon which many other programmes are tied to, a platform where industry and business partners can support community upliftment,” she said.\n(Reporting by Munyaradzi Makoni; editing by James Baer and Laurie Goering :; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, women's rights, trafficking and corruption.
