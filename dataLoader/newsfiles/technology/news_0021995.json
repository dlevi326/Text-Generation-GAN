Today we can say that Kyrgyzstan gained energy independence.\" \nIn the Soviet era, the electrical grids of Central Asia republics were unified, meaning that as much as one third of Kyrgyzstan's domestically-produced energy transited through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan before returning to the country. \nThe $390 million deal to build the power line was struck with the Chinese Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Company (TBEA) in 2010. \nChina's economic influence in Central Asia has grown tremendously in the last decade, surpassing its traditional partner Russia in regional trade and encompassing deals worth tens of billions of dollars with energy-rich Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. \nChina, to which Kyrgyzstan owes more than $1 billion in external debt, is also financing a number of other key projects in the resource-poor country. \nIn June, Beijing allocated $300 million in credit to help Kyrgyzstan build a North-South road across its territory. \nSince the mid-1990s China has pledged to build a railway up to 300 kilometres-long linking its restive western Xinjiang region to Uzbekistan via Kyrgyzstan. \nThe railway -- which would cost over $2 billion -- is opposed by many in Kyrgyzstan, who argue it could lead to overwhelming migration from the country's 1.3 billion-strong neighbour and add to growing dependence on Beijing. \nThese projects complement Beijing's Silk Road Economic Belt, a vision of massive investments in infrastructure and trade links across Eurasia to increase its heft in the vast region. \ntol-cr/gtf/bc", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:02:39.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
