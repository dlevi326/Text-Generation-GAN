The material developed by assistant professor Zhibin Yu , however, requires only one application. \nThe result, as reported in the journal Advanced Materials , sharply reduces the cost of LED production while maintaining its efficiency. \nREAD MORE: Energy savings with the latest in warehouse lighting \n“In the future, to do manufacturing, it’s a big challenge if you have to deal with multiple layers,” Yu said. \nWidespread adoption of LED technology, despite its dramatic energy savings, remained slow because of cost and quality issues. Yu said the new material could finally clear those hurdles. \n“In general, the cost of LED lighting has been a big concern thus far,\" Yu said. \"Energy savings have not balanced out high costs. This could change that.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:29:48.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
