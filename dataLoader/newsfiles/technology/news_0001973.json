That is why my office is investigating troubling reports that millions of Volkswagen cars carried software designed to cheat emissions tests that protect our environment,\" Schneiderman said \n\"We look forward to collaborating with attorneys general across the nation on this matter.\" \nThe German automaker is already under investigation by the US Environmental Protection Agency, and could face up to $18 billion in fines related to that inquiry. \nThe California Air Resources Board is also investigating Volkswagen's violations of emissions standards. \nVolkswagen, the world's largest automaker by sales in the first half of this year, has said it is cooperating with the various US investigations. \nOn Tuesday, Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its diesel cars worldwide are equipped with devices that can cheat pollution tests. \nA hearing over the emissions scandal will be held soon in Congress, two Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives announced Monday. \nVolkswagen faces a criminal probe, myriad customer lawsuits and a grilling before hostile legislators in the United States over its emissions cheating scandal, dampening its prospects in a key auto market. \nAt the top of the worries is a Department of Justice criminal probe into Volkswagen, confirmed to AFP on Tuesday by a person familiar with the matter. \nThat is in addition to a probe led by the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board into Volkswagen's equipment intentionally developed to allow its diesel cars to meet pollution limits during official testing. \nBut the software, known as a \"defeat device\", turns off while the car is being driven, allowing the car to spew out health-damaging pollutants, including up to 40 times the legal amount of nitrogen oxide emissions. \n\"It's too early to predict what will be the results of the investigation,\" said Jacob Frenkel, a former US federal criminal prosecutor now at Shulman Rogers law firm. \nFrom the prosecutor's standpoint, key questions concern Volkswagen's response, including how it punishes employees directly responsible for the wrongdoing, Frenkel said. \nFrenkel predicted a higher criminal penalty for Volkswagen than those paid by Toyota ($1.2 billion) over accelerator problems and General Motors ($900 million) for defective ignition switches linked to at least 124 deaths. \nHe said those companies were fined for delaying needed vehicle recalls, whereas Volkswagen has already admitted it deliberately cheated on US clean-air standards, including the remarkable statement from Volkswagen America chief executive Michael Horn that the company \"totally screwed up.\" \n- Congressional grilling ahead? - \nVolkswagen is also likely to receive a tough once-over in the US House of Representatives energy and commerce committee, which announced plans for a hearing in the coming weeks. \n\"Auto consumers may have been deceived -- that what they were purchasing did not come as advertised,\" said Republicans representatives Fred Upton of Michigan and Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania. \n\"The American people deserve answers and assurances that this will not happen again. We intend to get those answers.\" \nThe lawmakers have not announced witnesses yet for the session, but there is a long tradition on Capitol Hill of inviting embattled executives to appear for tough questioning. \nLaw firms are also lining up to take on the German company, the world's largest automaker by sales in the first half of 2015. \nThe Seattle law firm Hagens Berman has filed a class-action suit against Volkswagen with clients in more than 20 states alleging fraudulent concealment, false advertising and violations of federal and state laws. \n\"I paid premium for a Golf TDI because I was promised that it was 'Clean Diesel,'\" said a claimant cited by Hagens Berman. \n\"I was told that the emissions were better than a standard gas automobile. In addition, I was also promised high fuel economy. I now feel I have been defrauded by these claims.\" \nThese cases will also undoubtedly weigh on new sales for Volkswagen as it battles for market share with GM, Ford, Toyota and other giants. \n\"I think there is a basic violation of trust here and a violation of trust for Volkswagen buyers who are basically very loyal here in the USA,\" said Jack Nerad, analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \n\"It is in Volkswagen's best interest to publicly address steps to fix this mess as soon as possible before it loses its customer base for good,\" said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at the auto website Edmunds.com. \nThe emissions debacle will also likely hinder Volkswagen's ambitions to make diesel cars a bigger share of the US auto fleet. \nThe cheating device is on nearly 500,000 diesel cars in the US market, and Volkswagen admitted Tuesday it was on 11 million cars worldwide. \nVolkswagen's slate of diesel offerings includes Passat and Jetta sedans and compacts like the Golf cars. \nThose are among the nearly 50 diesel models currently available on the US market, according to Diesel Technology Forum, a lobbying group. \nBut diesel currently accounts for just three percent of US vehicle sales, according to JD Power. \nDiesel \"will stay a niche market,\" Kelley's Nerad predicted. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T17:46:36.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
