Some of these are generic and usually crop up after rollout. OnePlus forum members have come up with fixes for them. Following is a consolidated list of issues and their fixes: \nVertical layout launcher \nIf you don't want the vertical layout of the launcher, just long press on the home screen and then press two dot menus (appearing like this ^) to expand Settings. Now click on Layout, which can be found under Drawer Settings>> Profile. The value will be changed from Vertical to Paged. \nRemove bloats: \nThe Cyanogen OS 12.1 brings a host of features â€“ the Cyanogen browser, TrueCaller, Boxer Email and Calendar. But if you want your device to be bloatware- free you may always choose to uninstall the app, without any need of rooting. \nBing on homepage: \nIf you don't like the Bing browser on the homepage, you have the option to change it from Settings>> homepage. Note that Bing will be set on the homepage, even though you have installed Chrome. You need to remove this every time. \nDisable Cyanogen recovery: \nEvery time you boot, you get Cyanogen recovery, as the stock update brings it. If your device is having a custom recovery this would be a little annoying. But you may disable it by going to Developer Options and uncheck Update Cyanogen Recovery. \nCM recording via Xposed module: \nThe stock 12.1 update wipes out the call recording feature through Xposed. But if you are really fond of this, try out some apps from the Play Store. \nFix low battery life:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T13:00:32.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
