I've been reading the comments made on stories for a long time and I understand both sides of the argument raging around this decision. Were some of the comments racist? Absolutely. Misinformed? Absolutely. Did they add value? Absolutely.\nThe divisiveness often shown in the comments section was perhaps a truer reflection of the current state of South Africa than what our politicians would like us to believe. There is a lot of anger and frustration boiling up from different sides that we seldom have a chance to express. I'm not saying that we should feel free to anonymously express all the thoughts that pop into our minds, but I also think that not being able to voice opinions on current, contentious issues is more damaging. Perhaps we are just a community of slacktivists, but should all these thoughts remain bottled up?\nWe see protests in the streets, in Universities, sometimes even in Parliament... South Africans want to be heard! It may not be the ideal place for our expression, but for those of us sitting in an office for 8+ hours a day, what other options are available?\nI often asked myself 2 questions when reading an article: do other people feel the same way I do? If they don't, why not? It was the answer to the second question that usually caused the most controversy in the comments section, and also added the most value.\nAs much as we speak of a Rainbow Nation, the truth is that we have a very limited understanding of the \"other side of the fence\". Our opinions are often so vastly different, that debates descend into senseless arguments that, but some of us were able to look past that. For a long time I was guilty of being swept up in the anger caused by some people not sharing my view on an issue and I voiced that anger in some of my comments. However, as time went by I learnt to bite my tongue (or keep my fingers off the keyboard) until I had had time to properly reflect on why someone else saw things with as much conviction as I did, but with the opposite view.\nI heard the point raised that we can continue to have these \"discussions\" on other social media platforms. Can we? Do I want to be the guy on Facebook continually posting how disgusted I am by policemen being shot? Do I want to risk alienating my friends by sharing strong opinions that differ from theirs? Most importantly, would any of my comments be read by people who think in a completely different way from how I do?\nLike so many other News24 readers, I will also be moving on once they close the comments section. I believe that freedom of speech is vital in South Africa. Knowing what the average South African is thinking and feeling remains very important to me and I will be looking for a site that allows us to express that.\nRegards,\nChris", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:57:00.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
