An affective computing system is equipped with technology such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and automated reasoning, and emotion analytics that are capable of processing the complex data sets and human emotions. The continuous advancement in the field of gesture recognition, facial expression recognition, and speech analytics can take the affective computing systems market to new heights. Affective computing can immensely contribute in the area of consumer behavior and assist industry verticals like e-commerce & retail and telecom & IT to understand the customer satisfaction level. The major restraint of this market is the exuberant cost involved in making the affective computing systems while power consumption of wearable computing devices is the biggest challenge this market is facing.
