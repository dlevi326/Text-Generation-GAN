The U.S. market accounted for more than 70% of Amgen's $1.16 billion in global sales last year of Neupogen, a drug prescribed to chemotherapy patients.\nZarxio was the first biosimilar--a copy of a biotechnology drug--approved by the FDA under new, abbreviated criteria enabled by a provision of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. But the product's introduction has been held up by a legal dispute between Amgen and Novartis.\nThe drug industry and its lawyers are closely watching the Neupogen biosimilar case because the outcome could shape the path to market for a coming wave of biosimilar drugs that are expected to cost less than the original brands.\nA Novartis spokesman said the company welcomed Wednesday's decision, but didn't provide plans for selling Zarxio. An Amgen spokeswoman said the company will \"compete effectively\" but declined to comment directly on the court decision.\nWrite to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com\nSeptember 02, 2015 16:01 ET (20:01 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:28:35.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
