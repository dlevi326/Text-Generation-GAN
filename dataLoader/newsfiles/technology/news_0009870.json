It met with mixed reviews, but its industrial design – the look and feel, manufacturing and finish – was a cut above the competition.\nNow the rest of the market is catching up, as Motorola, Huawei and Samsung all launch smartwatches with design and style front and centre.\nMotorola Moto 360 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Motorola’s new Moto 360 with standard watch strap fittings. Photograph: Motorola\nMotorola has launched not one, but three new Moto 360 smartwatches. They have round screens, come in two sizes and a Sport variant ditches metal for silicone.\nIan Fogg, director of mobile analysis at IHS Technology said : “The new Moto 360 smartwatch offers female and sport-focused models to increase appeal, plus user changeable watch straps and extensive ‘mass customisation’ options similar to the company’s Moto X smartphones.”\nThe round screen still has the flat tyre shape with a piece at the bottom housing the watch’s sensors, which was criticised in last year’s model. But having two different sizes will appeal to more users, while the all-metal and screen design is certainly attractive.\nHuawei Watch Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Huawei Watch ranges from €300 and up, and is the Chinese smartphone manufacturer’s premium wearable. Photograph: Gregor Fischer/EPA\nHuawei’s Watch also has a premium look and feel to it that is more reminiscent of a man’s metal watch, and a €300 and up price tag to match. It, like all the new Android Wear watches, can connect to both Android smartphones and Apple’s iPhone.\nIt’s large circular display is more pixel dense than its rivals, so will appear sharper, while its fit and finish is approaching traditional watchmaker standards.\nSamsung Gear S2 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Samsung Gear S2 smartwatch, a significant upgrade in design over last year’s Gear S. Photograph: Martyn Landi/PA\nApple’s chief rival Samsung has also improved its smartwatch considerably. Gone is the chunky curved oblong that resembled a prisoner ankle bracelet and instead Samsung has produced its first round smartwatch, with a premium design and innovation in the form of a rotating bezel.\nBen Wood, head of research at CCS Insight said: “The Gear S2 is a breath of fresh air compared to Samsung’s previous smartwatches. It follows the trend set by the Moto 360 for a circular display, and at a glance it looks much more like a traditional watch than the geek-ware that has characterised most other smartwatches to date.”\n— Ben Wood (@benwood) September 3, 2015 Rotating bezel on Samsung Gear S2. Scrolling through apps and widgets. pic.twitter.com/V5O7h5LxoX\nAfter having tried out the watch at its launch at the IFA trade show in Berlin, Wood described the rotating bezel as “really addictive” and found it “reminiscent of how consumers used to idly fiddle with flip and slider phones back in the day”.\nSamsung has also ditched its requirement of connecting the Gear S2 to a Samsung-branded smartphone. Despite running Samsung’s Tizen operating system, it will work with any Android smartphone.\nNow Android Wear works with the iPhone , the Apple Watch has some direct competition.\nWhile the case for using a smartwatch has yet to be proven, for most consumers, at least now the design of the devices is approaching something closer to that of watches worn as jewellery.\n• Pebble boss: ‘one day, people will not be able to live without their smartwatch’\n• Swatch CEO: Apple Watch is ‘interesting toy’ that can’t last more than 24 hour", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9192c070e32ce3dede2ad583878f35e593086d3b/817_639_2991_1795/master/2991.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=3eedf1e88e0c8a58fc0075e0333fd446", "https://twitter.com/benwood/status/639489380550352896", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac508c83c6572b28b76f72ce72639291a6bacfc/0_0_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=81cea13d7a634d178cb002e38e32ea29", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64bb12a7360c28c8d5837fef6cc02360c7d6eb19/340_480_3038_1823/master/3038.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=441124ac04eedba3ebfc079f4bcd765f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9192c070e32ce3dede2ad583878f35e593086d3b/817_639_2991_1795/master/2991.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=c89906526fcd1abdbb6a8c0f04673cb5", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9192c070e32ce3dede2ad583878f35e593086d3b/817_639_2991_1795/master/2991.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=35699835c8ff49ae8c6d0d96858a09a8", "https://twitter.com/ianfogg42/status/639150189622640640", "https://twitter.com/benwood/statuses/639489380550352896", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c57y%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac508c83c6572b28b76f72ce72639291a6bacfc/0_0_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=2059c313aafb2230d0e43a37957f9612", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64bb12a7360c28c8d5837fef6cc02360c7d6eb19/340_480_3038_1823/master/3038.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=7347ffbb1b905dadbc5d187931b7a103", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64bb12a7360c28c8d5837fef6cc02360c7d6eb19/340_480_3038_1823/master/3038.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=34f6f07362e55214f4e276b856df735f", "http://t.co/V5O7h5LxoX", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac508c83c6572b28b76f72ce72639291a6bacfc/0_0_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=c32335f4526ec5c3b8bbdccbd40ff2a8", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9192c070e32ce3dede2ad583878f35e593086d3b/817_639_2991_1795/master/2991.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=179933e1e86ee64dc3801c818b3d0ae8", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c57y%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Have+smartwatches+finally+had+the+injection+of+style+they+need%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2Fsep%2F04%2Fsmartwatches-style-collection-ifa-designs&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F9ac508c83c6572b28b76f72ce72639291a6bacfc%2F0_0_2100_1260%2F2100.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64bb12a7360c28c8d5837fef6cc02360c7d6eb19/340_480_3038_1823/master/3038.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=eff6906415da7a7b374dbb22d0a7dfb6", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c57y%2Fsfb%23img-4&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Have+smartwatches+finally+had+the+injection+of+style+they+need%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2Fsep%2F04%2Fsmartwatches-style-collection-ifa-designs&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F9192c070e32ce3dede2ad583878f35e593086d3b%2F817_639_2991_1795%2F2991.jpg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Have+smartwatches+finally+had+the+injection+of+style+they+need%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2Fsep%2F04%2Fsmartwatches-style-collection-ifa-designs&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F64bb12a7360c28c8d5837fef6cc02360c7d6eb19%2F340_480_3038_1823%2F3038.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac508c83c6572b28b76f72ce72639291a6bacfc/0_0_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=dce0f4231fd1156b66294e188cca4dec", "http://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/639489186844774400/pu/img/t6VayEScOGvfuUoz.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Have+smartwatches+finally+had+the+injection+of+style+they+need%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c57y%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Have+smartwatches+finally+had+the+injection+of+style+they+need%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c57y%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Have+smartwatches+finally+had+the+injection+of+style+they+need%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c57y%2Fstw%23img-4"], "published": "2015-09-04T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T17:52:11.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
