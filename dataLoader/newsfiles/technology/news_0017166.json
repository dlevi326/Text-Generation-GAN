The vehicle which was showcased at DSEI 2013 had its full autonomy capability validated in a demonstration to the UK MOD which took place in September 2014. \n“Our Halcyon class of multi-role Autonomous Surface Vehicles has been developed over the course of our long standing relationship with Thales to offer the ideal solution to the MMCM programme. Developed from the Halcyon design, the more complex and capable mark II offers greater efficiency, stability and an increased payload capacity” said ASV Managing Director Dan Hook. \nMaritime autonomy is recognised as a key area of technological development reflected by the investment being made by the UK and French MOD into the development of an MCM solution centred on autonomous and unmanned systems. This MMCM programme seeks to demonstrate the maturity of the industry provided autonomous solutions. \nBroken down into various stages, the programme output will be two identical systems for evaluation against several predefined operational scenarios. Following an initial de-risking study, detail design has now begun. This first official stage comprising a design study prior to system build is scheduled to run until the end of 2016. This will also involve working with the end user to define the requirement and place consideration on other external factors. Stages 2 and 3 will include the system manufacture and demonstrations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T00:17:08.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
