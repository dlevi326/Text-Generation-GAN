The test was conducted in the Amazon AWS EC2 commercial cloud using a combination of 501 Red Hat Linux 6 and Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 instances. The test involved remediating the server infrastructure to the new July 2015 DISA STIG (Defense Information Systems Agency - Security Technical Implementation Guide). SteelCloud has published a video demonstration of the performance test on its website, www.steelcloud.com . \n\"We accomplished in 15 minutes what it would typically take an organization weeks to complete manually,\" said Brian Hajost, SteelCloud President and CEO. \"Being able to remediate 2,000 servers per hour, ConfigOS will, for the first time, allow any organization the possibility of remediating every endpoint, every day. ConfigOS has again demonstrated its ability to remediate intricate policy, and this high volume performance test has validated that our symmetrical remediation technology can handle enterprise loads with a constant level of performance as volumes increase.\" \nConfigOS tool is \"client-less,\" and was only loaded on a single server for the AWS performance test. The advanced XLR interface allows the customer to group and select endpoints and initiate the remediation of hundreds or even thousands of servers with a few mouse clicks. ConfigOS maintains constant performance across a large endpoint population with SteelCloud's unique symmetrical remediation technology. Further, its machine-automated interface allows ConfigOS to be integrated with, and \"driven\" by, any security framework or systems automation technology. \nAccording to Henry J. Sienkiewicz, the former Chief Information Officer and Designated Approval Authority for DISA, \"ConfigOS fundamentally changes the game. The machine-automated interface allows service providers to rapidly ensure compliance across highly complex environments, and permits the support team to focus in on the right things.\" \nConfigOS is a revolutionary tool for automating ongoing STIG policy remediation for Microsoft Windows and Linux environments. ConfigOS utilizes new patented technology to automate the remediation of production servers using simple, but secure XML policy signatures. SteelCloud's ConfigOS \"Builder\" technology automates the hardening of a system around any application in under an hour. ConfigOS has been designed to be used with physical, virtualized, and cloud infrastructures. \nConfigOS is available on GSA and other BPAs.
