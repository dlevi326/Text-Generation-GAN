They will however be audited by the notified body against aspects such as:\nDevice vigilance, Management review and objectives Technical file control Device history control Ongoing risk assessment (ISO 14971) Do I Need to Hire a Quality Manager?\nInitially you should take guidance from a reputable regulatory consultant who will manage the required aspects of your quality management system. You will probably find that the established framework of ISO 13485 is recommended.\nAt this stage the quality consultant will normally visit the contract manufacturer to either audit or verify their QMS accreditation, and ensure that both you and your contract manufacturer agree a quality interface.\nAs the legal manufacturer and the contract manufacturer must work closely together, a manufacturing quality agreement in line with ISO 13485 and the Medical Device Directive is beneficial so that the responsibilities of each party can be clearly defined.\nAs the product or project develops and as your business allows, you should hire a quality manager tasked with running the QMS in-house. This will include the management of the contract manufacturer as a supplier.\nTo conclude, a QMS is required by the legal manufacturer in order to market medical devices under their own name. When outsourcing manufacturing or other elements of the development and/or sales process, the relevant QMS responsibilities pass to the contract manufacturer.\nThe work involved in setting up and maintaining a QMS will of course vary depending on the quantity, complexity and classification of your medical device.", "external_links": ["http://medicaldeviceacademy.com/supplier-risk-management/"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:16:08.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
