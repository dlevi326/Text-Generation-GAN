In July, the agency announced the discovery of Earth-life planet Kepler-452b, located outside of the Solar System, according to Express . \nMonday’s event will feature Jim Green, director of planetary science at NASA; Michael Meyer, lead scientist for the Mars Exploration Program; Mary Beth Wilhelm of Georgia IT and NASA’s Ames Research Center; and Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona in Tucson. \nScientist Lujendra Ojha, of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, will also attend, perhaps hinting that the likelihood of NASA discovering water on Mars. Ojha theorized that the planet has liquid salt water flowing through it during warm months. If water has been discovered, the chance of life on Mars increases. \nPreviously, Mars was thought to be too cold for water, but in April, it was discovered by NASA’s Curiosity rover that the soil was damp with liquid brine, which lowers the freezing point. The rover also found rocks one meter under the service that contain almost four times as much water as scientists previously believed. Moreover, satellite images of what could have once been a riverbed complete with round pebbles caused further belief that flowing water did exist on the planet at some point. \nAll of the current evidence has led to speculation that Mars once was similar to Earth. \n“This new evidence comes in support of speculations by many scientists that Mars was once an Earth-like planet, with continents divided by oceans, both teeming with microbial life, at least,” science writer Kevin Kopas said. “The large bundle of images that Curiosity has taken on Mars, which have been made available through NASA’s website, have already prompted researchers to speculate the existence of microbial fossils, and of strange alien objects.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:43:38.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
