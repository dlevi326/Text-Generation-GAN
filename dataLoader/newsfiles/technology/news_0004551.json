The firm’s expertise ranges from corporate and commercial property disputes through to conveyancing and medical negligence. WHN prides itself on its commitment to delivering outstanding service and results to businesses, individuals and families. \nThe deal means the firm will be implementing the Proclaim Matter Management Software solution, with a ready-to-go Conveyancing Case Management system enabling the residential property team to experience immediate process enhancements. WHN will also utilise Proclaim as its integrated practice accounting and reporting toolset, providing a ‘one view’ approach to the firm’s finances and financial management data. \nAs part of the drive to further enhance efficiencies in property transactions, WHN will take advantage of the integration between Proclaim and the Land Registry’s Business Gateway (LRBG). Providing two-way integration for both data and documentation, solicitors will have instant access via the Proclaim desktop application, delivering the ultimate in operational effectiveness. \nMike Gillibrand, Finance Director at Woodcocks Haworth and Nuttall, said: \n“The decision is client led. In a modern, flexible world the right IT can make a huge difference in how law firms deliver legal services.” \n“More of our solicitors are working offsite, on the move with clients, so the new legal software will give them the tools to bring greater efficiencies into the way they advise clients, accessing important documents as and when they need them.” \n“Whether it’s working with businesses or individuals, due to the nature of our business, we must have a rigorous and robust document storage management system. The process in how we store and recover documents will now be quicker and more secure, bringing greater operational efficiencies.” \nShare:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:45:34.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
