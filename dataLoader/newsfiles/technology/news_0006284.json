Virtually every industry projection concurs that mobile use will undoubtedly forge ahead as the medium of choice in the trip planning and travel booking process. All the big players in the online travel space have mobile apps offering the ability to book flights, hotel rooms, car rental and more on the go, whenever and wherever you may be on your travels. Customers download these apps in the knowledge that the same security features are present that are often taken for granted when making bookings on their websites. According to mobile security firm Bluebox Security, this blind acceptance could turn into a very expensive mistake. Bluebox analyzed the top ten most popular travel apps (each with millions of downloads) for both Android and iOS and found some glaring security vulnerabilities. \"We did a little bit of research in the app ecosystem where we wanted to see what kind of security protection is in place in apps, or rather what protections are not in place. We selected the category of travel apps, which are used by both consumers and enterprises every day for multiple things like airline booking, payments for hotels, restaurants and ride sharing,\" said Andrew Blaich, Bluebox's head security analyst. \"We noticed that overall security is a second-class factor when apps are being developed,\" Blaich said. \"We looked at a variety of different factors including third-party coders, data exposure and are they exposing or not protecting data they're saving on the device like log in or credit card information.\" The Bluebox study found that only one out 10 Android apps analyzed and none from the Apple App Store used any data encryption for stored information such as usernames, passwords, email addresses and even credit card numbers. The report described it as a 'potentially catastrophic' situation, but also identified other flaws. About 70% of the code in the apps, Bluebox said, originated from external third-party sources and not created or indeed authenticated in-house. These range from social media APIs, location based content, and other travel related third party information. These come from numerous different Internet resources 'significantly increasing the attack surface,' it said. In addition, none of the apps had any anti-tamper or anti-debug protection, again leaving them exposed to possible attack. \"Some of the flaws we discovered would allow an attacker to create a malicious version of the app and have it look the same as the original app,\" Blaich added. In conclusion, Bluebox stressed app security should be an essential part of the development process from the outset, with robust encryption, 'self-defending'capabilities and the removal of any unnecessary third-party code.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T02:05:45.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
