The Oregonian just did! Today NAVIS , the leader in resort, hotel, and vacation rental integrated sales and marketing solutions, announced that the company was named one of 2015 “Top Workplaces” by The Oregonian/Oregonlive . This is the fourth consecutive year that NAVIS, under the corporate name Buehner-Fry Inc., has received this award, proving the exceptional and innovative workplace it offers.\nThe “Top Workplaces” awards are given annually, and companies are evaluated by an independent research firm based on feedback from employees on leadership, culture, how their companies create opportunities for development, as well as how employers demonstrate to workers that they are valued. As the prestigious publication notes, “Top Workplaces are recognized not only as better places to work but are also more likely to be successful than peer organizations.”\nComments about NAVIS from its employees included, “Everyone at NAVIS is friendly and helpful. This company truly treats its employees well! I am treated with respect, kindness, appreciation, value.” Another employee states, “Positive environment. Owners and partners that care. Employee driven. Excellent benefits.”\nKyle Buehner, president and CEO of NAVIS, says, “Receiving the award again this year is such great timing. We are hiring in just about every department. We place our company culture at the center of everything we do, and I’m incredibly grateful to our employees for making NAVIS such a special place to work. To us, it’s about being passionate and excited to come into work every day and discover new ways to innovate and help our clients succeed. We couldn’t be more proud of this achievement.”\nCombining the excitement of a fast-growing company with the stability of a 27-year old, privately held business, NAVIS has established itself as THE place to work. Founded in 1987, NAVIS has 314 employees and over 32,991 SQ feet of office space. There are plans to add 76 more employees by the end of 2015. In addition, the company focuses on having a positive impact on the local communities it serves, while creating a fun, enjoyable and rewarding environment that makes it the workplace of choice in the Oregon area.\nInterested in working for an award-winning employer?
