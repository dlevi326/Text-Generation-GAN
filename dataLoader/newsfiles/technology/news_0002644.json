In almost all locations that you look, you don't find stars, galaxies, or other points of light. Instead, all you find is the black emptiness you associate with space itself: the absence of all sources of light. Even if you take the most powerful telescope humanity's ever devised -- the Hubble Space Telescope -- and point it at an obscure patch of sky for incredible durations of time, most of what you see is still blackness.[caption id=\"attachment_329\" align=\"\" width=\"800\"] Image credit: NASA, ESA, R. Bouwens and G. Illingworth (UC, Santa Cruz).[/caption]Sure, there are plenty of stars and galaxies that jump out at you, but there aren't an infinite number. The brighter, larger ones are closer to us, as you might suspect. But the fainter ones don't just appear smaller, as you'd expect for more distant ones; they also appear redder in color.This seems like awfully peculiar behavior, doesn't it? After all, galaxies are made up of stars, and as far as we can tell, there's nothing that should make distant stars inherently redder in color than the ones closer to us. If anything, the stars should be bluer , since -- thanks to the finite speed-of-light -- when we see a galaxy that's more distant, we're seeing it when the Universe was younger. And since red-colored stars live longer than blue-colored stars, we expect the distant Universe should have its galaxies be intrinsically bluer in color, not redder![caption id=\"attachment_330\" align=\"\" width=\"885\"] Image credit: NASA, ESA, P. van Dokkum (Yale University), S. Patel (Leiden University), and the 3D-HST Team.[/caption]Yet these more distant galaxies really do appear redder, fainter, and sparser as the distance to them increases. In fact, beyond a certain point, even the Hubble Space Telescope sees no galaxies at all. This isn't , as you might think, because there weren't any galaxies to be seen. Sure, that's true at some point, as the Universe has only been around for some 13.8 billion years since the Big Bang, but the very first stars in the Universe form when it's only 50-100 million years old, and we ought to have formed galaxies by 200-400 million years.But we can't see those first galaxies, even with Hubble. Why not? The culprit in this crime is the very thing that allowed our Universe to emerge from the Big Bang at all: the expansion of the Universe.[youtubevid id=\"3OiSoptcEDs\"]When the fabric of space itself expands, it doesn't just cause the matter and radiation in the Universe to drop in density and dilute, it also causes the light that exists to redshift , by stretching its wavelength. In physics, the energy of a photon is defined by its wavelength, so if you stretch its wavelength, it drop to a lower energy and hence becomes redder in color. For a galaxy whose light was emitted more than 13 billion years ago, that redshift is so severe that the ultraviolet light emitted by its atoms gets shifted all the way past the visible light portion and into the infrared. Shift that light too much, and even the Hubble Space Telescope won't be able to detect it.[caption id=\"attachment_332\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"] Image credit: X. Fan et al, Astron.J.132:117-136, (2006), retrieved via Ned Wright.[/caption]But Hubble can see the dimmest and faintest objects out there of any telescope we've ever built, and can do so to wavelengths entering the near infrared. In theory, it could pick up traces of once-ultraviolet light from objects from when the Universe was just 400 million years old.What Hubble can't do for us, however, is verify precisely just how distant these objects are. To make that happen, we need to measure the precise wavelengths that the emission and absorption features from a galaxy are: we need ground-based spectroscopy. And that means we need to turn to the largest telescopes we've ever built, such as the 10-meter Keck telescopes on Hawaii, which house the newly-installed MOSFIRE spectrometer , perfected for infrared observations.[caption id=\"attachment_333\" align=\"\" width=\"900\"] Images credit: I. Labb√© (Leiden University), NASA/ESA/JPL-Caltech (L); Adi Zitrin / Caltech (R).[/caption]The newest find? The galaxy EGS8p7, observed and measured by Hubble, was confirmed to have the highest redshift of any galaxy ever : 8.63, meaning that its emission lines are a factor of 863% longer in wavelength today than when they were emitted. The light from this object comes from when the Universe was just 588 million years old, or just 4% of its current age.And best of all? This record won't stand for long! This isn't the farthest galaxy, ever , as you might hear elsewhere. This is just the next step in what we can measure, and we know that plenty more is out there. When the James Webb Space Telescope comes online in just three years, it should not only dwarf the light-gathering power of Hubble, it is designed to probe farther infrared wavelengths than Hubble has ever dreamed of.[caption id=\"attachment_334\" align=\"\" width=\"1182\"] Images credit: Image credit: NASA / JWST team, via http://jwst.nasa.gov/comparison.html (main); NASA / JWST science team (inset).[/caption]Unlike Hubble, which can reach wavelengths of about 1.5 microns, James Webb can go all the way out past ten microns, meaning it can see all the way back to the first galaxies and potentially beyond, all the way back to the first stars.So enjoy the new record-holder for most distant galaxy in the Universe, but be aware: this isn't the ultimate record-breaker. Instead, delight in the fact that even more remote frontiers will be pushed back before the decade is out![gallery2012]", "external_links": ["http://www.caltech.edu/content/powerful-new-astronomy-instrument-gets-ready-hawaii", "http://www.caltech.edu/news/farthest-galaxy-detected-47761", "http://jwst.nasa.gov/comparison.html"], "published": "2015-09-09T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T20:44:57.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
