Shopify Plus is the company’s premium product aimed at larger merchants.\nThe move comes as Google gets set to move into a new 185,000-square-foot space in Kitchener this fall. The office, some three times the size of its current space, will allow Google to vastly expand its 300-person work force in the region.\nA spokeswoman for Google said the company has not outlined any specific growth targets and the new space is being developed in a phased manner.\nSmaller startups based in the Kitchener-Waterloo region such as Kik Interactive, whose chat platform is popular with U.S. teens; and Vidyard, which creates video marketing and analytics tools, have also outlined plans to roughly double their work forces.\nBLACKBERRY CUTS\nThe moves come as BlackBerry further pares back some of its non-core teams in the region. Sources familiar with the matter said that BlackBerry last week laid off roughly 200 staff on its hardware and design teams.\n“Our intention is to reallocate resources in ways that will best enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities while driving toward sustainable profitability across all facets of our business,” said a spokeswoman for BlackBerry in an e-mail.\nThe sources added the moves come after BlackBerry has completed all major hardware and design work on its widely anticipated new handset, code-named Venice. The device is widely expected to arrive in November and run on Google’s Android platform, but come layered with BlackBerry security and productivity features.\nBlackBerry, which is pivoting to focus more on software as it outsources more of the work around its hardware, declined to comment on the device.\n More Related to this Story Shopify’s stock soars on news of Amazon partnership\nLightspeed aims for more global growth with $61-million in new funding\nFrom hardware to software: Ottawa’s push for a tech revival\nTopics: Technology Ottawa, Ontario Toronto, Ontario Google Inc.
