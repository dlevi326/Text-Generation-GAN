Though the overall plot of Sam Esmail’s Mr. Robot is presented as a hacker-oriented homage to Fight Club , the show is as much “about” hacking as Breaking Bad is “about” meth. In fact, Mr. Robot’s closest comp right now is indeed Breaking Bad . The show’s most thrilling plot points and intriguing character development, its genius cinematography and haunting audio design, and — most notably — its sense of tension and dread, are like nothing on television except Vince Gilligan’s take on a chemistry teacher’s slow descent into villainy. \nThe most brilliant aspect of Mr. Robot , though, is its visual language. It’s so good that you have to use the phrase “visual language” to describe it. The tone of each episode is conveyed right from the start, through the use of gorgeous title cards — something even Breaking Bad cut to a more traditional title sequence to show. Stills of the title cards don’t even come close to doing justice for the title sequence when it’s in motion, complimented by the stellar audio design, and full of plot context, but they’re gorgeous in their own right. So, we collected them all for you to peruse — either because you’ve been hearing people flip out about this silly-named show and are curious, or because you’re already a fan, know exactly how great the title sequences are, and need a steady drip of Mr. Robot hype to sustain your life force until next season. \nYou can check out the stills in the gallery above, but remember, if you haven’t seen the show, the stills do not do the in-motion title sequence justice even though they’re gorgeous on their own. The footage, audio, and context elevate the sequences to the best television title sequences of, perhaps, all time. Basically: watch Mr. Robot . \nAlso, minor spoilers, but we tried to keep them to a minimum. eps1.0_hellofriend.mov", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T05:13:01.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
