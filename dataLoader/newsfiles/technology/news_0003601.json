It is up to the data privacy regulators of each country to implement the EU-wide decisions.\nGoogle says it has received 318,269 requests for removal, and delisted about 40 percent of the URLs that it evaluated as part of the requests.\nFacebook links accounted for the most of any single website, Google said.\nIf a French citizen files a request under the \"right to be forgotten,\" CNIL said Google must comply with the order worldwide — not just on European extensions of its search engine, such as .fr, .es, or .de for example — or face possible sanctions.\nGoogle had no immediate response but has argued that agreeing to the request would leave it — and the free flow of information — vulnerable to similar orders from any government, democratic or totalitarian.\n\"The Internet would only be as free as the world's least free place,\" the company wrote in July on its Europe policy blog.\n0 Shares Email Star Comments French Data Privacy Regulator Rejects Google Appeal   \n  \" \n2015 Emmy Awards: Complete Winners List \" \nApple   \" \nTracy Morgan Back on Stage at Emmys for First Time Since Accident     \" \nNew  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T17:53:12.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
