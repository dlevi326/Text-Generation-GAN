He claimed that the car was so safe that when they crashed it into a pole, it didn’t crumple like a standard car does, but instead actually broke the pole. Looks good too. Source: AP \nNot only does it absorb energy from collisions better than any other SUV, but it has sensors in it that will help steer it away from an accident to help you avoid an accident before one is able to happen. \nThe Model X is powered by twin electric motors, with the standard car able to accelerate from 0-100km/h in 4.8 seconds, while one equipped with the ‘Ludicrous’ package can do it in a ridiculous 3.3 seconds, or roughly the same time as an Audi R8 supercar. Remember this is a seven-seater SUV around the same size as a Mazda CX-9 or Audi Q7. The Falcon doors make it easy to get into the third row. Source: AP \nDesign wise, the highlight feature is the doors. The rear doors are known as ‘Falcon doors’ which are able to open vertically. \nOn the surface they may just seem like an attention grabbers, but they actually serve a purpose. Multiple hinges on the door allow it to adjust how it opens based on sensors, meaning you can open the doors in tight spots. Ultrasonic sensors help the door detects obstacles and the multiple hinge positions allow the door to adjust itself to suit the situation. — Kimberly Daggerhart (@kmdaggerhart) September 30, 2015 \nThe front doors are pretty special, too. They may open outwards like a standard car, but there are sensors inside which detect the passenger and driver’s movement. The doors are then able to automatically open in time with the driver’s approach and close once they’re in. Elon Musk called this the “invisible chauffer”. \nIncluded in the Model X is also the largest piece of glass ever put into a production car. It’s called the Panoramic Windshield and wraps over the front passenger’s head and onto the roof. \nTo be able to make you feel like you’re inside a helicopter, Tesla engineers did much more than design a big piece of glass. Hurdles such as keeping front passengers from getting destroyed by the sun were solved by designing a gradual gradient tint and special sun visors that are clipped to the side pillars when not in use were needed. Much the same as the Model S. Source: AP \nThe rest of the interior is mostly the same as the Model S, with that giant 17-inch touchscreen panel that controls everything in the centre console and a completely digital dashboard. \nThough there are little things on the inside that Tesla has thought of to differentiate it. One simple, but clever feature is a blind holster for your phone that allows you to place it down and the charger will adjust and connect without you needing to fiddle around. No need to worry about the impending apocalypse. Source: \nThe other is a typical Elon Musk invention. A bioweapon defence mode button that exemplifies the car’s air filtration system that avoid toxic fumes that comes into cars while you’re driving. Musk said that “If there’s ever an apocalyptic scenario of some kind” the mode, which is a real button in the air-conditioning settings, should come in handy. \n“We’re trying to be a leader in apocalyptic defence scenarios,” Musk half-seriously joked. \nThe first cars were delivered to American customers today, with the first Australian models expected to land in March 2016. We're also chasing Australian pricing, but expect it to be around the $200k mark. The SUV of the future?
