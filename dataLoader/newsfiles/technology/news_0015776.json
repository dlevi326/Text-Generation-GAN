Poor or non-existent metadata is a fundamental issue, impacting many business processes and applications. Few organizations proactively manage metadata to improve business outcomes.\n“Our client webinars are a testament to our products. They represent a snapshot of real-life issues that audiences may also be facing, and examine how the challenges were met. The webinars are led by Concept Searching clients, providing a first-hand explanations of how they were able to leverage metadata to achieve their business goals,” said Martin Garland, President of Concept Searching. “These clients all faced very different challenges, all due to poor metadata. That is the biggest strength of our products, as they are part of an infrastructure component that can be used to solve a multitude of metadata challenges,” he concluded.\nCollaboration, Search, and Information Governance\nA premier US program management firm’s goal was to update its SharePoint 2010 intranet, to refresh an out-of-the-box design and to mine an immense amount of data, to enhance findability of its content and provide staff with easily accessible data. The existing intranet lacked a clear governance structure, effective information architecture, and mobile accessibility.\nThis webinar discusses how conceptClassifier for SharePoint was used to quickly identify duplicate documents within the current SharePoint environment and file shares. The technology solution easily migrated content, automatically applied content types, and aligned governance policies, enabling the intranet portal to be significantly improved.\nEliminating End User Tagging\nThe leading iUS nformation provider for the mortgage industry wanted to improve findability and search for its mortgage lending content library. This webinar explores the benefits of metadata management, standardization, and auto-classification of content to taxonomies.\nThis was a business-critical project, with hundreds of thousands of documents that had to be tagged and classified for clients to access on demand. The conceptClassifier platform was used as the key tool for the team of publishers, to keep up with demand and ultimately increase accuracy in search for site visitors.\nExternal Self-serve Portal\nThis US nonprofit organization, with a mission to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer, provides details on how its online patient portal was developed and deployed using conceptClassifier.\nThe challenge met was how to provide individual patients with information most relevant to their specific health situations, while ensuring the information was accurate, medically sound, and secure. The solution delivered the ability to search across multiple pools of information inside and outside the company, and was easy to use for patients of all ages and demographics.\neDiscovery\nThe UK’s 9th largest council shares why it purchased the Concept Searching Technology platform and what it is being used for today. Originally acquired to track information assets for the delivery of over 300 discrete services, the Concept Searching solution is now being used to support eDiscovery efforts for legal compliance.\nThe flexibility of the technologies enhances search outcomes by significantly improving the retrieval of highly precise and relevant information. This is particularly useful when information is scattered throughout the enterprise in diverse repositories. The solution delivers compliance with regulatory requirements and adherence to applicable laws, which are of paramount importance to a public sector organization.\nAll the client webinars can be accessed on the Concept Searching website here .\nAbout Concept Searching\nConcept Searching is the industry leader specializing in semantic metadata generation, auto-classification, and taxonomy management.
