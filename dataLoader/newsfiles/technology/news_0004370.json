Sachin Dave | 11 September 2015, 2:04 PM IST Share MUMBAI: Games like Temple Run and Mortal Kombat are set to see competition from an unexpected quarter -PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).PwC India has developed a gaming app, Cyber Warrior, where gamers would be able to hack emails and network systems in the virtual world. PwC has developed the game specifically for its clients, especially top and middle-level managers who could be at a risk from cyberattacks.\"This is our first step towards gamification of our services,\" said Sivarama Krishnan, leader, cyber security, at PwC India. \"While currently this game would be for free, going ahead, we are looking to monitise it,\" he said. PwC hopes that the game will help managers assess cyberattack risks better.With inadequate safeguards, Indian companies are prone to cyber attacks, and the `Big 4' services firms -PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and EY -are dealing with an increasing num ber of such cases.Recently , an Indian bank was attacked by hackers, which may have compromised some data, say people with knowledge of the matter.Indian companies are exposed to cyber risks, but they do almost nothing to prevent it, say experts. They usually take remedial steps only once they have been attacked. Through the online game, PwC is seeking to make the companies aware of the risk well in advance. \"Our tech team could assist the users initially when they play the game,\" said Krishnan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T17:41:10.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
