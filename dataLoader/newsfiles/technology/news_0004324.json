Officials eventually called off the 2018 World Cup and 2019 Asian Cup qualifier.\nThe fans were apparently venting their anger over the Malaysian team’s humiliating 10-0 defeat to the United Arab Emirates last week. Players looked on as smoke billowed up from the flares.\nThe Hong Kong referee ended the game three minutes before the final whistle and ordered the players to return to their dressing rooms. Witnesses said that the stadium, 25 km from Kuala Lumpur, looked like a “war zone.” There were scenes of fans throwing plastic chairs at security officers. According to reports, the head of Shah Alam police refused to comment on the arrests. He said that the police were trying to determine how the bombs were smuggled into the stadium.\nHe said that the police were not notified that any of the Saudi team’s fans were hurt, but said an ambassador whom he did not name, informed him of this situation.\n According to reports in the Malaysian press, fans from the host nation attacked Saudi fans inside and outside the stadium. In addition, a 23-year-old Yemeni student studying in Malaysia said that he suffered leg injuries as he tried to escape his attackers.\nAnother fan, Mohammed Abu Obeidah, said that guards told him the situation was under control but he found stick-wielding Malaysian fans waiting to assault him and others outside the stadium.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:06:34.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
