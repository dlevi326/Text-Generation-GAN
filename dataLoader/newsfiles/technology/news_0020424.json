As much as 40 per cent of all comments on Instagram posts mention other accounts, Instagram said, suggesting that many users like to flag content to users they know and start conversations about it. \nThe move comes a week after Instagram upgraded its service to allow new layout options in addition to its signature square for pictures and videos, which was viewed as a move to compete better with Snapchat. \nSnapchat, which is popular partly because messages on its platform disappear after a few seconds, already offered a variety of picture and video formats. Earlier this year, Snapchat upgraded its service so users could exchange text messages in response to photos and videos. \nMany social sites and apps have added specialised messaging features recently in a bid to keep users. \nFacebook , which owns Instagram, launched its Messenger service as a standalone app earlier this year, and added a virtual assistant called 'M' last week that can complete tasks for users such as shopping. \nOn Tuesday, LinkedIn Corp said it would revamp its inbox with new apps and designs that mimic chat services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T09:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:32:34.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
