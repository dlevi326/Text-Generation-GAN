The unique assessment quantifies user results into an easily understood \"Health Age\"— a number that suggests an individual's biological age based on personal health habits, characteristics and biometric values as measured by the kiosk.\nComprised of age, gender, and risk dependent questions as well as kiosk measurements of weight, BMI, blood pressure and pulse, the Health Age assessment takes the average user only 4-5 minutes to complete on the kiosk's touchscreen interface. Questions cover every aspect of overall wellness in order to provide a holistic health profile of the individual, along with simple, personalized health advice. The assessment was developed to comply with National Committee of Quality Assurance (NCQA) Standards and Guidelines, with topics addressing physical activity, nutrition, sleep, mental health, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, preventive care screenings and biometric measurements.\nThe assessment can be taken in both English and Spanish on the Pursuant Health kiosk, an FDA-cleared Class II Medical Device that collects non-invasive biometric data. This first-of-its-kind assessment is a one-stop task that ensures accuracy and efficiency because it is completed on a platform where the user's biometric data is automatically incorporated into one all-inclusive result. While other health risk assessments require users to manually enter weight and blood pressure information that may be incorrectly estimated or outdated, this streamlines the process for employer wellness programs by eliminating the pain points common to population health assessments and reducing data collection costs. An online version will also be made available.\nIn addition to a Health Age, the results screen provides a user with immediate feedback on their health status by illustrating their top three health risks. Health risks are listed in an order to depict the areas that have the most negative impact on a user's health along with personalized recommendations to reduce the individual's Health Age. Following the assessment, users may obtain a full detailed report outlining their individual health strengths and weaknesses as well as educational information to improve well-being. Results can also be shared with an individual's physician.\n The Health Age assessment also connects users with Cleveland Clinic's evidence-based coaching programs. Led by a team of health experts including Dr. Michael Roizen, Cleveland Clinic Wellness offers a vast amount of online and eCoaching programs for improved sleep, weight loss, nutrition, exercise, tobacco cessation, healthy pregnancy and more. Throughout the Health Age assessment, a user will receive information for enrolling in Cleveland Clinic Wellness programs that target their specific health issues. Interested users can learn more and enroll in programs by emailing the information to their personal inbox directly from the kiosk.\nThe Health Age assessment is a free, bilingual resource with the ability to engage and educate individuals of all ethnicities, geographic areas and socioeconomic levels. With Pursuant Health kiosks conveniently located within 10 miles of 79% of the US population and visited by over 3 million users every month, the majority of the public can easily access a kiosk and discover their Health Age. This high level of accessibility is especially significant for disparate and uninsured populations in need of a clinically valid health resource.\nThe Health Age assessment is now available on Pursuant Health's nationwide network of over 3,600 kiosks located in retail pharmacies, hospitals and worksites. The assessment is available for inclusion with both Employer and Payer-based health programs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:02:21.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
