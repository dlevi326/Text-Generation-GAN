Shilpa Elizabeth | 25 September 2015, 9:36 AM IST Share CHENNAI: The self-drive car rental market in India is eyeing the fast lane and leading players seem to be shifting to top gear experimenting and innovating on the technological front. With the industry expected to reach a size of $3-5 billion (approximately Rs 18,000 crore to Rs 30,000 crore) by 2020, car rental companies are going smart.Companies have started integrating technologies like Driver Behaviour Monitoring (DBM,) and On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) in their cars, not just in high end sedans, but also in the smaller ones starting from hatchbacks, hoping that technology will fuel growth.Bengaluru-based ZoomCar which claims to have around 75% of the market share started in 2013 with the usual GPS tracking system, but soon realised the potential to evolve technologically. \"There are tonnes of enhancements you could bring on to the platform,\" said its Cofounder & CEO Greg Moran. A speeding alert system enabled via an in-car \"black box\" helps the company monitor the speed of its vehicles in real time and penalise over-speeding customers.The OBD device, which Moran notes \"is the most recent technology incorporated\", monitors the performance of the car and gives realtime feedback to the driver. \"It helps improve fuel efficiency which is very important for our economy and makes dramatic impact on cost reduction and car maintenance,\" he said.Meanwhile, Revv, a comparatively young entrant which is just six months old, \"has been incorporating DBM and OBD technologies right from the day of inception\", noted Anupam Agarwal, who cofounded the company with Karan Jain. \"India-specific localisation tweaks are required to make the model work here,\" said Agarwal, the CEO, whose company claims to be the only self-drive car rental company in India to provide door delivery service.Moving one s tep further Revv is also planning to use the DBM tech to switch to dynamic pricing system. \"Based on the driving behaviour of a person we generate a customer score and very soon we will start making that score an input into the price an individual customer is charged,\" said Agarwal, adding that in four months the pricing system would be revamped based on the overall demand and supply and the driving history of the customers.A bit of technology has gone into the unique door-step delivery model too, according to him. \"We are using electrical technology here foldable electric scooters which the company employee could use for coming back after the delivery.They fit into the boot of every single car on our portfolio and costs just Rs 1 per km, runs 25-30 km on electric charge at 30kmph speed. This is what is currently driving our low cost structure,\" he said, revealing further plans to later make it an independent profitable scheme by giving the scooters to the customers along with the cars for their vacations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T08:20:01.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
