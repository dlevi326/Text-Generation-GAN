CareerBook announced today that it will be launching a seed round funding campaign using the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter effective September 18th, 2015. The link to the Kickstarter campaign is https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/669837918/1021453299?token=dc0dc7b9 . The company is targeting to raise up to US$250,000 to launch its new mobile and web platform on Apple iPhone, iPad, and Android within the next 6-9 months. Through innovative technology, this game-changing mobile and web app will allow veterans and employers to form a strong and strategic alliance which will enable employers to hire the best talent in a cost effective and efficient manner.\nCareerBook is expected to rapidly grow investor confidence, as it will set itself apart from other job search apps. Not only will it enable top talent to quickly connect with great employers, the platform will actually prepare job seekers to re-enter the workforce. Quite simply, CareerBook extends beyond searching through posted job ads. The platform will provide candidates with a variety of innovative resources such as mentorships and 24/7 interview coaching capability via video conference. CareerBook is really about giving veterans the opportunity to get back into the driver-seat of their careers versus rolling the dice on resume parsing software to get in front of employers.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua2lja3N0YXJ0ZXIuY29tL3Byb2plY3RzLzY2OTgzNzkxOC8xMDIxNDUzMjk5P3Rva2VuPWRjMGRjN2I5", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/669837918/1021453299?token=dc0dc7b9"], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:22:08.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
