But it does have Bluetooth connectivity, which means it can be used to play any internet streaming service you like. My mind is boggling with the thought of what is happening out there in the world right now. The aliens might have landed and commenced their radio broadcast, and I won't know about it for ages. I think I'm up to date with the latest news, but all my news was so 41 seconds ago.\nThe other, far more practical disadvantage of streaming radio is that it no longer works whenever the internet stops working, which, due to the vagaries of routers and modems, is every couple of months in my household – far more often than the old-fashioned radio carks it.\nIt's especially a problem when the radio doubles as your alarm clock. Every couple of months, I'm not just 41 seconds late. I can be hours late.\nI discovered this gap in my life while testing the latest version of Ruark Audio's R1 tabletop radio, an old-fashioned broadcast-radio radio (albeit a DAB+ digital one), which has been a very refreshing alternative to our Sonos.\n It's not nearly as functional as a Sonos – it doesn't have a Wi-Fi connection, so can't tune directly into Pandora radio or into Spotify or Google Play Music. But after a week of using it, I'm starting to see that as a strength as much as a weakness.\nNo fiddling around There's a lot to be said for a gadget with a big knob on the top that just works. Plug it in, pull up the antenna (or not, depending on your reception), tune into a station, and that's it. No need to fiddle around with Wi-Fi identification numbers and passphrases. Just turn it on and it goes.\nYou won't get nearly as many radio stations as you can get with an internet radio such as the Sonos, but how many do you really need? Between ABC Radio National and Double J (the station for people who used to listen to Triple J but now can't stand all the doof doof), Adelgunde and I have been as happy as clams.\nOf course, the R1 isn't a complete throwback. It does have a big LCD display on the front that will show you what track you're listening to on the radio, if your station transmits that information. It does have a line-in, so you could use it as a speaker for your home computer.\nAnd it does have Bluetooth connectivity, which means it can be used to play any internet service you like. There was a period last week when our Sonos system was down (it had to do with our house renovations, rather than a problem with the Sonos itself), and we just used the Ruark as a Bluetooth speaker for our phones, listening to Pandora and Google Play Music with almost as little effort as listening to DAB radio.\nIndeed, there's a case to be made that simple Bluetooth-based speakers like the R1 are in some ways better than sophisticated multi-room audio systems such as the Sonos. With the Ruark, you get to use the native, presumably best-of-breed apps on your phone for all your streaming services, rather than the Sonos versions of those apps which I quite like but which do attract a fair bit of criticism.\nAs for the sound, it's what you might expect from a single-driver, slightly pricey tabletop radio: big enough to fill your bedroom (where you'll probably end up locating it), but not much more than that. It emits a surprisingly warm sound, considering it has no bass driver, and it's not so tinny or bright that you're going to suffer from listening fatigue after a few hours.\nBut what would I know about sound? Not a lot. Everything reaching my ears is so 41 seconds ago.\nLikes: Dead simple to use with big, easy controls. Good sound for the size.\nDislikes: Battery broken on our test unit.\nPrice: R1 Mk3 deluxe tabletop radio, $449; leather CarryPack, $99; BackPack battery, $119", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:22:32.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
