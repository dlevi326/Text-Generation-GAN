With estimated resources of 1.7 to three billion barrels, it will rank as one of Norway's most important industrial projects over the next half-century.\nThe field is due to come on stream in December 2019, and to continue producing for 50 years.\nGassco will serve as the operator and technical manager of the 156-kilometre pipeline from the riser platform on Johan Sverdrup to the Statpipe rich-gas leg once the field comes on stream. Statoil is the development operator.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T20:07:20.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
