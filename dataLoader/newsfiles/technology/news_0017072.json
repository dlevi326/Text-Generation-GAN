Or maybe you just don't want to splash out on a new one right now. \nWell fear not, because this video has the answer to your problems. \nSimple: All you need is a balloon \nAnd amazingly, all you need is a balloon. \nFirst step is simple enough - inflate the balloon. (It might be easier if you have a friend to help by holding the end). \nNext step: Slowly deflate the balloon... \nThen, place your phone on top of the balloon and let it slowly deflate. \nThe balloon then shrinks around your device, providing the perfect makeshift case. \nEt voila!
