Known as eLimu, the Swahili word for education, the program is aimed at overwhelmed state schools in the East African country. \nIn Nigeria, Lagos' gridlocked traffic leads to a loss of 3 billion working hours each year, according to the developers of a carpooling app. Developed in May with 10,000 registered users already, Jekalo — the Yoruba phrase for 'let's go' — matches commuters on the same route with willing drivers to form a lift club. \nThe digital age also allows young Africans to define their own culture in an interconnected world, as a skateboarder and break-dancer in Zambia's capital Lusaka learned. The two founded Street Culture, a digital platform that connects Zambian youths interested in extreme sports, dance and other urban culture to an online community. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T20:24:26.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
