The property sector accounts for 15 percent of China's gross domestic product, so even modest signs of improvement in the sector would relieve some pressure on the economy, which is expected to expand at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century this year.\nOther fees to be cut include trademark registration fees and software copyright registration fees, the state planner said.\n($1 = 6.3818 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by Judy Hua and Nick Heath; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T15:44:07.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
