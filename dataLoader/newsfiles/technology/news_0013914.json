The NIFTY cup is designed to facilitate feeding and prevent starvation in infants in developing countries who are unable to breastfeed.\n“It’s incredibly gratifying to be nominated for this award that will help fund the crucial next step in our five-year journey to bring this lifesaving tool to the infants who need it,” said Dr. Christy McKinney , a clinical assistant professor at the University of Washington who spearheaded the project and was instrumental in designing the NIFTY cup. “It’s astounding that this simple feeding tool has the potential to have such a profound global impact.”\nEach year, approximately nine million babies born in Africa and South Asia have difficulties breastfeeding because they are either premature, have craniofacial anomalies like cleft lip and palate, or are born to mothers who die of birth-related causes, putting these infants at risk of dying from starvation. The World Health Organization recommends the use of a small cup to feed these newborns in low-resource settings, but there is no standard feeding tool in existence.\nPATH’s multidisciplinary team of product development, public health and commercialization experts collaborated with epidemiological, dental and medical experts at Seattle Children’s and the UW School of Dentistry, Department of Oral Health Sciences, to create the NIFTY cup, a low-cost, safe and easy-to-use feeding cup that aims to solve this problem with a design that mimics breastfeeding. Dr. Patricia Coffey, leader of the Health Technologies for Women and Children group at PATH, will co-lead the effort with McKinney.\n“Our collaborative team has worked tirelessly with modest funding for the last five years to realize this vision, so it is wonderful to have the NIFTY cup recognized in this way,” said Coffey. “We are confident that we have a great team in place to move the product through validation as quickly as possible and into the hands of those who need it.”\nKey features of the NIFTY cup include:\nExtended reservoir off the lip of the cup that holds a small bowl of milk, ensuring efficient delivery of milk that mimics traditional breastfeeding where the infant is able to pace feeding. Mothers can directly express breastmilk into the 60-ml cup, reducing possible cross-contamination from other containers. Made of a durable, soft silicone material that protects the infant’s mouth from injury. Embossed measurements help track volume and intake of milk. Ergonomically designed for frequent use and to enhance finger and wrist control over milk flow. Quick-drying, UV-resistant, affordable silicone that can be boiled for sterilization. Dr. Michael Cunningham , medical director of Seattle Children’s Craniofacial Center and an investigator with Seattle Children’s Research Institute’s Center for Developmental and Regenerative Medicine, helped spark the collaboration with McKinney after seeing the need for a solution first-hand in Africa during a trip with Partners in African Cleft Training (PACT) , which he co-founded.\n“We were devastated to learn that newborns with clefts were starving to death because they were unable to properly feed,” said Cunningham. “We just knew that there had to be a simple intervention that could be life-changing for this population which led to our quest to develop the perfect feeding tool.”\nAfter McKinney, Cunningham and the team at PATH developed the first prototype of the NIFTY cup, McKinney evaluated its design in South India with infants that had clefts or were born premature. She said the feedback was resoundingly positive. The feedback the team received also helped refine the cup’s design, which will be completed at the PATH product development shop.\n“It was quite dramatic to see how much easier it was for infants to feed when the NIFTY cup was introduced,” said McKinney. “There was a lot of interest as to when this cup could become widely disseminated.”\nThe Saving Lives at Birth partnership funding will support the team’s work to generate a base of evidence by validating the NIFTY cup through a study conducted at a hospital in Ethiopia, shape the sub-Saharan Africa market by identifying a commercialization partner, and develop a market strategy and global advocacy plan.", "external_links": ["http://pulse.seattlechildrens.org/seattle-childrens-takes-cleft-training-program-to-africa/", "http://depts.washington.edu/nacrohd/about_us/personnel/mckinney", "http://www.seattlechildrens.org/medical-staff/michael-l-cunningham/", "http://www.seattlechildrens.org/clinics-programs/craniofacial/", "https://savinglivesatbirth.net/"], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:04:47.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
