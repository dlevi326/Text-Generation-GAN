An Uber spokesperson said the final rules were approved just last week and that its permit was issued on Monday. \nThe company is used to roadblocks. It's been heavily targeted by cab services and local governments that see it as a loosely regulated liability as well as a threat to taxis' business. Protests in France broke out in July, and Hong Kong police recently raided an Uber office. \nUber has also gotten blowback from its drivers in California who claim they should be considered employees and not contractors. \nBut none of that has stopped Uber from growing at a breakneck pace.
