Justin McManus Share on twitter by David Ramli At the end of August Telstra revealed it was in talks with beer and food giant San Miguel to help launch a mobile carrier in the Philippines , a move that would see it burn through hundreds of millions of dollars in the distant archipelago.\nIt's the type of play chief executive Andy Penn must make to continue growing profits as Australian rivals eat away at Telstra's market share and profits. In the past six months its share price has fallen by over 10 per cent as the reality of rising competition dawns on investors.\nBut Globe Telecom chief executive Ernest Cu, who runs the biggest mobile provider in the Philippines, told Fairfax Media that a new national mobile network would cost $US2.5 billion ($3.5 billion) to build. That's the sort of money that would spark a riot amongst Telstra investors.\nCan Penn help Telstra break the curse of Australian companies failing abroad by turning his company into a global powerhouse? Or will he squander billions of dollars amongst the pitfalls of Asia and bring the telco to its knees?\nPenn was hired with extensive experience abroad and he's already flagged investing in Asian mobile networks.\nBut why the Philippines, a developing nation with two strong mobile carriers and 100 million people, 25.2 per cent of whom the World Bank says lived below the poverty line in 2012?\nThere are three key reasons: the strength of its would-be partner, San Miguel; the venture's massive spectrum holdings ready for 4G expansion; and the healthy profits enjoyed by incumbent telcos supplying mobile-hungry Filipinos.\nNomura Securities regional head of telecoms research Sachin Gupta adds that Telstra lacks options elsewhere.\n \"In retail, there are not many opportunities left – most Asian telcos already have a foreign partner,\" he says.\nThe two incumbent in the Philippines' mobile market, Globe Telecom and PLDT, have long reaped major profits. In financial year 2014, Globe made 13.1 billion Philippine Pesos ($391.5 million) in comprehensive income while PLDT made 34.1 billion ($1.02 billion).\nBoth have EBITDA margins of over 40 per cent, amongst the highest in the region and similar to that of Telstra.\nBut Telstra risks a trench war in a market it doesn't understand and which has seen several foreign intrusions fail. San Miguel's last Qatari partner sold out this year after a dismal run.\nGlobe is the biggest player in the Philippines mobile market with 46 million mobile customers, and its chief executive, Ernest Cu, admits he was surprised and slightly worried by Telstra's announcement. But he's ready to fight the Australians off.\nHe believes Telstra is out of its depth, doesn't understand the local market and will be hurt by the relatively low amounts of money generated by each customer.\n\"Rolling out any network in this country requires you to build practically everything … and we have lot of problems today negotiating with landlords to build towers today [and] the easiest part is actually building the cell site,\" he says.\n\"The average cost per tower without the backhaul would be around $US200,000 to $US300,000 and to get to effective good coverage would be 8000 sites and so that's $US2.5 billion … not including the IT infrastructure, distribution infrastructure or the operating costs.\"\nAnd he's not keen to help Telstra out, noting that Globe never got a helping hand from any of its rivals, and warning there's a high chance San Miguel will be asked to surrender some of its valuable spectrum.\nNomura's Gupta disagrees on costs and thinks Telstra could help build a 4G network that focused on the cities for far less than Cu claims.\n\"Assuming a starting point of 3000 to 4000 base stations, total initial investment could be sub-$US500 million depending on how much backhaul they have and how much spectrum they can use and keep,\" he says.\nMost Filipinos use their phones for calls and text messages, suited to 2G and 3G networks. Telstra aims to take advantage of the rise in data downloads by bringing its 4G network experience to Asia.\nBut Globe's Cu says the rise in 4G directly correlates with smartphone usage and says most of his fellow citizens can't afford the expensive devices like the Apple iPhone Australians take for granted. Instead, old \"dumb\" phones like classic Nokias get handed down and only 30-40 per cent of users own smartphones.\n\"In Australia Xiao Mi or Huawei are cheap phones but in the Philippines it's expensive,\" he says. \"For a phone to be viable here it has to be $US100 or below before … the masses can actually afford it.\"\nOn this, Gupta is in some agreement. The main way 4G networks handle voice calls is Voice over LTE (VoLTE) technology that can only be handled by high-end devices, meaning Telstra would need to install 3G equipment to target the masses.\nTelstra is not intimidated and has vowed to press ahead. Smartphone use is rapidly rising and it wants to get a piece of the action.\n\"We've indicated to the market that we are in negotiations with SMC who understands business in the Philippines better than anyone,\" a Telstra spokeswoman says. \"We respect there are two incumbents and it's no surprise they would seek to make the market look as difficult as possible.\"\nShareholders themselves are reserving judgment, with many telling Fairfax Media that Telstra deserves permission to invest in Asia.\nBut the bottom line is that much depends on the success or failure of projects like this.\nWhere Telstra's former chief executive, David Thodey, will be remembered for cementing its future in Australia, Penn could be renowned as the man who took the company global – to place its name amongst the sector's stars like AT&T or Britain's Vodafone Group.\nBut if the Asian strategy fails his legacy will be as the man who broke an iconic company by squandering its wealth throughout the region's murky markets.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/telstra-in-talks-to-invest-hundreds-of-millions-in-philippines-mobile-carrier-20150828-gj9peo.html"], "published": "2015-09-18T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:19:13.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
