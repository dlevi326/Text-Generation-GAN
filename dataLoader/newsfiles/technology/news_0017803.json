The changes announced Friday are designed to detect software and other methods automakers might use to rig a test. \n“We’re actually making sure that this is a one-off,” EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said Friday. \nThe agency is going to “look at all of the other models aggressively and do the testing we need to make sure there aren’t any hidden software devices or other ways they could defeat the emission system,” McCarthy said. \nThe revelations about VW led to unwanted scrutiny for the EPA. Its testing procedures have been criticized for being predictable and outdated, making it relatively easy for VW to cheat.
