Rob Homer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup You might have the world's best business idea, money, power and wisdom, but if you don't have three particular personality traits you won't be transformative, according to Malcolm Gladwell, a best-selling author of books that include The Tipping Point .\nSpeaking at the Telstra Vantage event in Melbourne on Wednesday, The New Yorker writer, author and thinker, Mr Gladwell told the audience that the most transformative business leaders all had three traits in common: creative, conscientious and disagreeable.\n\"We spend a lot of time discussing the nuts and bolts of [transformation], but i'm not sure we spend enough time talking about the attitudes behind organisations,\" he said.\n\"The attitude part is as important as the research, technology and skills part... When it comes to transformation, attitudes are what matter over everything else.\"\nMr Gladwell, who popularised the 10,000 hours or practice concept in his book Outliers, framed the discussion around the tale of Malcolm McLean, the man who revolutionised shipping in the late 1950s by creating shipping containers.\n1. Creative To solve a major problem you have to be creative. Shipping in the 1950s was slow, tedious and costly, the \"choke point of the economy\", according to Mr Gladwell.\nBut Mr McLean had an idea to package goods in containers that could be easily loaded and unloaded off ships. It sounds simple, but it required a complete change of thinking in the industry.\n \"People would look at him and just laugh. He was routinely ridiculed and denounced but he persists, \" Mr Gladwell said.\n\"People who transform the world...do not place much stock in what people say about them.\"\n2. Conscientious Creativity in itself doesn't make a disrupter. Many people before Mr McLean had experimented with the idea of containerised shipping, but failed.\nAccording to Mr Gladwell, it was Mr McLean's conscientious attitude which led to his success.\n\"He reframed the problem. He created a seamless supply chain from the point he picked up the cargo to when it was delivered. That meant tending to 100 points along the way,\" he said.\n\"He had to bring in entirely new people, college educated people, and train them properly to handle this new business. It sounds like a small thing, but before he came along everyone engaged in the world of shipping had a very narrow definition of what they were doing.\"\n3. Disagreeable Above all, disrupters are disagreeable. Mr Gladwell told the audience the story of American businessman and radio pioneer David Sarnoff.\nIn the 1920s Mr Sarnoff was one of the few people who realised the potential of radio to do more than just communicate the news.\nHe went to his bosses at RCA Wireless with a plan to live broadcast the 1921 boxing match between Jack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier. This event went on to kick start the popularity of radio in the US.\n\"The board of directors say it's the stupidest thing they've ever heard. He comes back the next day and the next and they say he can do it, but he has to do it on his own,\" Mr Gladwell said.\n\"A rebellious activity is something that leads every single beautiful woman to not want to sleep with you... That kind of courage lies at the heart of what it means to be disruptive.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-09-24T08:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:19:43.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
