Market projections are given through 2019. Use this report to: - Learn more about self-tracking usability by target groups such as seniors.- Analyze mobile digital technologies that generate health-related data primarily for the user's personal consumption.- Receive information about relevant patents through analysis.- Gather knowledge about major companies taking part in self-monitoring healthcare. Highlights - The global market for selected health self-monitoring technologies reached $1.1 billion and nearly $3.2 billion in 2013 and 2014, respectively. This market is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.9% to reach $18.8 billion in 2019.- Peripherals as a segment is projected to grow from $3.0 billion in 2014 to $18.4 billion in 2019 at a CAGR of 43.4% for the period 2014-2019.- Software applications as a segment is expected to grow from $120 million in 2014 to $385 million by 2019, increasing at a CAGR of 26.3% for the period 2014-2019. Introduction & Scope INTRODUCTION STUDY BACKGROUND Self-monitoring is a new trend in personal health where individuals use electronic devices and software technologies to collect, process and display a wide range ofpersonal data to help them monitor and manage their personal health. The current, early generation of self-monitoring tools enables the user to monitor and record detailsof his or her everyday activity, from counting steps or miles walked, and floors climbed, to monitoring calorie consumption, as well daily patterns and hours of sleep. Futuredevelopments will expand the range of physiological variables that can be self-monitored and enhance the usefulness of the data thus collected.The growing use of self-tracking, facilitated by recent advances in technology, heralds \"the biggest shake-up in the history of medicine,\" according to Eric Topol , a prominentphysician who has studied the uses of wireless technology to treat chronic disease. The market environment for healthcare information systems has shifted dramatically inrecent years. After years of incremental steps toward a national healthcare information technology (IT) infrastructure, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA),the economic stimulus bill approved by Congress and signed into law in February 2009 , provides more than $19 billion for healthcare IT spending, including more than $17billion to promote the wider adoption of electronic health records (EHRs). The Obama administration has made it clear that this $17 billion is only a down payment on thetotal cost of a national EHR system, which is generally estimated at $100 billion or more.Modernization of the nation's healthcare IT infrastructure is a cornerstone of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), the legislation that established anational healthcare system that was enacted into law in 2010. The PPACAdoes not include any specific measures to encourage the adoption of EHRs beyond those already contained in the ARRA, but EHRs are one of several clinical healthcare IT technologies that have the potential to increase the availability and quality ofhealthcare while contributing to lower costs.In addition to the potential benefits in terms of the quality and cost of U.S. healthcare, this is obviously a significant opportunity for suppliers of healthcare IT and relatedtechnologies. U.S. healthcare providers presently spend approximately $40 billion per year on all types of IT technologies. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES The goal of the report is to examine market opportunities for health self-monitoring products and technologies that are now on the market or that are likely to enter themarket over the rest of the decade. Specific objectives of the report include analyzing the following:- Identify and describe existing health self-monitoring technologies, as well as technologies that are under development.- Estimate the 2014 market for these technologies.- Analyze the major drivers and constraints that will influence the future development of the self-monitoring market.- Project the market for major health self-monitoring technology platforms, devices and software.- Describe and evaluate different vendors' business models.- Assess the potential impact of self-monitoring on the way medicine is practiced. INTENDED AUDIENCE The report has been written explicitly for those with an interest in health self-monitoring, including the following:- Manufacturers and distributors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T11:09:41.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
