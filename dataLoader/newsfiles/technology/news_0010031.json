Arasan addresses these challenges by offering its Arasan ONFI 4.0 Compliant NAND Flash Controller IP solution that provides a performance boost by increasing data transfer rates to 800 MT/s - or 800MB/s for an 8 bit interface - and reduces power consumption by more than 50%.\nFocusing on high performance and high reliability, Arasan’s ONFI 4.0 NAND Flash Controller IP solution comprises a high performance digital controller IP core and a hardened Analog PHY which includes ONFI 4.0 compatible I/O pads supporting 1.2v, 1.8v and 3.3v operation. Compliant to the ONFI 4.0 electrical interface, Arasan’s IP core solution, delivered in RTL supports NV-DDR3 up to the specifications full 800 MB/s. The ONFI 4.0 compatible I/O pads support NV-DDR3 operation at 1.2v. These pads differ from typical high speed DDR I/O pads in that they also support 1.8v and 3.3v I/O operation to enable backward compatibility with ONFI 2/3 . The combined Controller IP, analog PHY and the I/O pads shortens time-to-market by reducing SoC designers’ development time otherwise spent on ensuring high speed signal integrity.\nArasan’s ONFI 4.0 NAND controller IP supports SLC, MLC, and TLC NAND Flash up to 1024Gb, synchronous and asynchronous NAND interfaces, page size up to 16KB, BCH ECC engine correcting 32-bit or more errors, and eight chip-selects. Arasan’s ONFI 4.0 NAND Flash Controller IP interfaces to the system’s AXI, AHB or OCP bus. Arasan also provides ONFI 4.0 software stack and drivers. The Silicon Proven ONFI 4.0 NAND PHY IP is available in nodes from 40nm to 16nm for most major foundries.\nArasan will continue to make available its ONFI 2.3 and 3.1 Compliant NAND Flash Controllers along with a Soft NAND PHY with I/O Pads for speeds supporting up to the 3.1 specification.\nAvailability\nArasan’s ONFI 4.0 NAND Controller Total IP Solution, including Controller IP core in RTL, ONFI 4.0 I/O pads delivered in GDSII, and the optional ONFI 4.0 PHY delivered in GDSII is available now for shipment.\nAbout Arasan\nArasan Chip Systems is a leading provider of Total IP Solutions for mobile and the next generation of Smart applications from home to automobile. Arasan’s high-quality, silicon-proven, Total IP Solutions include digital IP cores, analog PHY interfaces, verification IP, hardware verification kits, protocol analyzers, software stacks and drivers, and optional customization services for Ethernet, MIPI, PCIe, USB, UFS, SD, SDIO, eMMC, and UFS. Arasan’s Total IP products serve system architects and chip design teams in applications that require silicon-proven, validated IP, delivered with the ability to integrate and verify both digital, analog and software components in the shortest possible time with the lowest risk.\nAbout ONFI\nThe Open NAND Flash Interface (ONFI) is an industry Workgroup made up of more than 100 companies that build, design-in, or enable NAND Flash memory. We’re dedicated to simplifying NAND Flash integration into consumer electronic products, computing platforms, and any other application that requires solid state mass storage. We define standardized component-level interface specifications as well as connector and module form factor specifications for NAND Flash.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12941090.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12941090.htm"], "published": "2015-09-03T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T09:38:49.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
