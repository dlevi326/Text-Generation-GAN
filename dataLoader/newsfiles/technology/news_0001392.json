The version is enhanced with new features to assist with document review and production in smaller cases – light eDiscovery tasks – which benefits litigation teams with greater efficiency and time and cost savings. “With a well-established penetration among large law litigators, the new version of CaseMap enables our customers to manage additional components of the litigation workflow for the smaller cases they handle,” said Steve Ashbacher, vice president of litigation solutions with LexisNexis software and technology business. “The new capabilities built into the software allow litigation teams to conduct light document review, coding and production. They can do more within a single tool and therefore save hours of valuable time.”\nThe CaseMap software helps litigation teams bring together the relevant facts , documents, cast of characters and issues of each case – as well as legal and investigative research – into a centralized repository for improved case assessment. This allows users to maximize case knowledge, see connections they might otherwise miss and better collaborate with colleagues on a matter.\nIn addition to performance improvements with those powerful case organization tools, the new version 12 includes three important new capabilities:\n1. Redaction. Users can redact text or areas on a page while reviewing a document for privilege. This essentially creates a review platform for small cases and eliminates the dependency on third-party tools (e.g., Adobe® Acrobat® software) for use in performing redactions. The new “light review” tool is ideal for cases up to 50,000 documents; for larger cases, the LexisNexis Concordance ® or Concordance® Evolution software provides more robust eDiscovery review capabilities.\n2. Document Coding. The software now enables users to code file metadata easily and efficiently from within the DocManager coding sidebar tool. They can also add or modify the coded data while viewing a linked file, create custom views or define coding fields. This streamlined document coding is more efficient and provides a greater degree of flexibility for reviewers to focus on specific metadata when viewing documents.\n3. Production. A new document production wizard guides users through the process of selecting documents, applying Bates numbers and choosing the unique options they prefer for standardizing the format used during document production. The wizard-based workflow is easy to use and eliminates the need to manually prepare a document production set, saving valuable time in low-volume eDiscovery. This new capability makes the CaseMap presentation tool a more complete, one-stop litigation solution for smaller cases.\n“The user experience and usability are primary objectives across all of the technology products we’re developing in the Technology Center of Excellence in Raleigh,” added Ashbacher. “This is the third major new software enhancement we’ve delivered for the CaseMap software focused on ease-of-use including integration with research products.”\nThe CaseMap software suite has won more than 50 legal industry awards for its innovative use of technology that helps litigators better manage their cases.
