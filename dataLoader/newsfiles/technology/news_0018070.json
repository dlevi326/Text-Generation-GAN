The drivers — Thomas Colopy, Matthew Manahan and Elie Gurfinkel — are suing Uber on the grounds that they should be labeled employees and not independent contractors, an issue that goes to the heart of how Uber does business as a win by the drivers could increase costs for the $51 billion company.\nThe judge in the case, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, put limits on the class in his ruling Tuesday. For example, Judge Chen said the drivers can only sue on behalf of UberBlack, UberX, and UberSUV drivers who have driven for Uber in the state of California at any time since Aug. 16, 2009. To join the class, drivers also must have signed up to drive directly with Uber or an Uber subsidiary, among other restrictions.\nUber said its \"early estimates\" suggest that fewer than 15,000 drivers will therefore be eligible to join the class-action lawsuit. Uber also said that one of the three plaintiffs, Colopy, will be disqualified because he drove for Uber as an employee of limo companies.\nUSA TODAY\nUber's California drivers granted class-action status - upping financial stakes\nThe San Francisco start-up keeps expenses down by positioning itself as a technology company that merely matches drivers with riders, rather a taxi or car service company with vehicles to maintain. That means Uber's drivers are saddled with expenses such as maintenance, insurance, gas and the vehicles themselves.\nIf Uber is forced to treat drivers as employees, it could be forced to bear some of those costs as well as Social Security, workers compensation and other benefits.\nUber will appeal the ruling, it said.\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kaja Whitehouse on Twitter: @kajawhitehouse.\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Ez5rgO TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/709159b0999c20b88b62e753e8e4e98cea30f556/c=0-248-4928-3032&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/09/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767234253078768-Uber-app-2-.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767919425413780-AP-Hilton-Uber-Bedfellows.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Ez5rgO&text=Uber%20says%20less%20than%2010%25%20of%20Calif.%20drivers%20can%20join%20employment%20class-action&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Ez5rgO&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1Ez5rgO", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0dde4714bd16df68e388eb22d0982f857bc8b941/c=264-0-2976-2039&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767919425413780-AP-Hilton-Uber-Bedfellows.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-02T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:56:56.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
