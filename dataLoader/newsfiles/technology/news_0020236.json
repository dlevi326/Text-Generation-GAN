The Bramor rTK currently carries one of two payloads: a traditional digital RGB camera for mapping; and a modified digital camera intended to perform agricultural assessments. The data collected by both payloads can be used to create geo-referenced ortho-mosaic maps, point clouds, digital surface models (DEMs), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products, and custom data analytics. \nPaul Linnell, Director of MTSI’s National Security Division, Civil and Commercial Small UAS (SUAS) team, said, “MTSI is investing in expanding commercial opportunities that will provide new customers smart analytical solutions. We are working on turning the Terabytes of Bramor data into cloud accessible imagery products. Alongside imagery products and maps, novel algorithms are also actively under development to extract features from the thousands of acres that this aircraft covers during each flight.” \nMore information about MTSI’s UAS work, including fully-insured drone flight operations, is available at http://www.mtsi-va.com/solutions/unmanned-system-solutions/ or by contacting Paul Linnell on 703-564-3825. \nAbout Modern Technology Solutions, Inc.
