So far this year, IPOs backed by private equity have shrunk to $1.47 billion, a far cry from full-year 2014's record $6 billion.\n\"Institutions are becoming more selective, largely as a result of poor performance over the last three months, last six months,\" Macquarie Group's head of private equity, Jeremy Tasker, told a conference in Melbourne earlier this month. \"There is a bit of a negative view towards IPOs.\"\nAmong private equity-backed listings that did go ahead are the two biggest Australian IPOs of 2015, software firm MYOB Ltd and fruit and vegetable supplier Costa Group. With both trading well below issue prices, a host of anticipated listings have been cancelled or delayed pending fairer market conditions which are yet to materialise.\n(Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T10:08:17.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
