Proper surface preparation and paint removal are two of several key components of an effective system. In our experience, we have found waterblasting to be a versatile method to accomplish these tasks, and the Stripe Hog consistently demonstrates its versatility and capability at each Symposium.\" Follow Us:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T03:25:55.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
