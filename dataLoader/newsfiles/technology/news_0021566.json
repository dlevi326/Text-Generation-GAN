It gave regulators clearer responsibilities and greater authority,\" Amano said. \n\"There can be no grounds for complacency about nuclear safety in any country. Some of the factors that contributed to the Fukushima Daiichi accident were not unique to Japan.\" \nAnti-nuclear sentiment still runs high in Japan, which last month began restarting its atomic power programme after a shutdown triggered by Fukushima. \nUtility Kyushu Electric Power turned on a reactor at Sendai, about 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) southwest of Tokyo. \nCommercial operations for the 31-year-old reactor -- operating under tougher post-Fukushima safety rules -- will begin early this month, as the government pushes to return to a cheaper energy source than fossil fuels. \nThe resource-poor nation, which once relied on nuclear power for a quarter of its electricity, restarted two reactors temporarily to feed its needs after Fukushima. But they both went offline by September 2013, making Japan completely nuclear-free for about two years. \nThe government wants nuclear power to generate up to 22 percent of Japan's electricity needs by 2030, a lower percentage than before Fukushima. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:23:11.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
