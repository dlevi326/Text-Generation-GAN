The measures include looking at arming the navy with equipment to help them with their patrols and working with law enforcement to increase its presence in the area to protect pipelines, he said.\nKachikwu said that between June 2014 and June 2015, the corporation recorded between 3 500 to 4 000 theft attempts at the various products pipelines across the country.\n\"The best security for these pipelines lies with the communities. We are trying to create enough incentives for them to see these pipelines as their own,\" Kachikwu said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T16:02:31.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
