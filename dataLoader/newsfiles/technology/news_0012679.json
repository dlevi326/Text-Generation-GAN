The latest version is 22 per cent lighter than its predecessor at 310g. \nUnveiling the new Gear VR at the Oculus Connect developer conference in Hollywood on Thursday, Peter Koo, senior vice-president at Samsung Mobile, said the device would help make virtual reality “mainstream”. \n“This is virtual reality for everyone,” he said. \nOculus is preparing to launch its PC-based Rift headset in the first quarter of next year. While it has not yet set a price for the device, a set-up including a PC powerful enough to support VR software will cost in excess of $1,000. \nMinecraft , the virtual-world game owned by Microsoft , will be among the first titles available for the Rift when it goes on sale next year, Oculus said. \nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook ’s founder and chief executive, who paid $2bn to acquire Oculus last year, said VR was the “next great technology platform that’s going to define the way we all connect in the future”. \nBut onstage at Oculus Connect, he warned that the market would grow “slowly”, as PCs and smartphones did in their early days. \n“The first units shipped did not sell tens of millions in the first year,” he said of those forebears. “But they proved an idea and made it real . . . Facebook is committed to this for the long term.” \nSo far, the developers assembled at Oculus Connect have focused on making games for Oculus’ two headsets. But as it tries to appeal to a broader audience, the Gear VR will allow users to watch movies on Netflix as well as 360-degree videos , which Facebook said it would bring to its apps on Wednesday. \nOther online video services, including Vimeo and Hulu, will arrive on the Gear VR in the coming months.
