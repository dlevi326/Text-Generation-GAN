I have a 4mb uncapped package from Telkom. First time it died, it was down for about 3 weeks. Second time it was down for 2 weeks, and yesterday it just died again.\nThe first time it went down I called on a daily basis, and was told that the issue was being addressed. That there was a shortage of transport, that the transport had no ladders, (you don’t need a ladder to fix my internet) or that there were 3 technicians in the area who had to attend to 300 calls. I told the person that I lived in Boksburg and if they looked in Atlas Road they would see about a hundred Telkom vans parked in an area there and they were pretty much just sitting there, so they could always take one of those. My attempt at humour was brushed off. I finally managed to speak to a wonderful lady there, who I shall not name, who managed to get my issue sorted out within about 24 hours after talking to her. She actually cared. You know who you are JMB.\nThe second time it went down, I did not want to bug this wonderful lady, but after about 11 days I decided to email her, and yes she fixed my issue within a few days.\nThe Telkom Facebook page is a joke. I think the people working there are robots, you get the same basic responses no matter what you say. We have escalated your issue, we are working on it. They will be there Friday. (Which Friday, and which year exactly?) Every time I see a technician working on the Telkom boxes down the road from me I cringe, because it is about that time my internet goes down. Oddly enough, yesterday I saw them working down there and when I got home my internet was down. I rushed back and they had left.\nWhen I called them yesterday to report the fault, I was asked by the woman I got through to “what do I want her to do about this”? Wow, I was a little shocked.\nHere is the fun part. When my internet was down for 3 weeks, I noticed that while my internet was down, there had been almost 80 gig of data used. It was not me, I had no access. I check my usage on a daily basis now and see that huge amounts of data is used when I am not even online. I was told by the Telkom Facebook page that it would be investigated. It has not been investigated. My data is still being used by someone and I have changed passwords and done whatever I can. I really want to know who used/uses my data when my internet was not available to me, or I am offline.\nI look at all the complaints online regarding people who have had no service for months, and I wonder what has happened to make Telkom so bad. What has happened that they just simply do not care about the customer? I see them sitting at these boxes for hours, chatting to people walking by, sitting in their vans, not a care in the world. I know I am not the only person in the world that issues with Telkom, but having your internet die 3 times in 5 months is just sad.\n48 hours to address an issue? It’s laughable because some wait weeks and months to get an issue sorted out. Yet they have let so many people leave Telkom which makes the customer’s wait even longer. I had to call 3 times yesterday before the phone was even answered. I waited for 10 minutes the first time.\nI am seriously tired of being held hostage by Telkom, I am tired of being told the issue is being escalated. I am tired of being told that they are sorry for the inconvenience. I am tired of lame excuses, lies and bitchy attitudes. I have never raised my voice at the person on the other end of the line. It’s not their fault. Screaming at them won’t help. But don’t ask me what I expect them to do. It’s simple…. What they get paid to do…. Their Job. I don’t need to die to know if hell exists, I have an internet line from Telkom so I know Hell exists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:09:35.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
