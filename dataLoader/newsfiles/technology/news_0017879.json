Phil Hearne Share on twitter by David Ramli Telstra has chosen not to tender for the $56 billion national broadband network's biggest construction contracts, which will connect millions of homes and businesses using the Coalition's preferred fibre-to-the-node technology.\nFibre-to-the-node and fibre-to-the-basement reuse the existing copper network and will become the main phone and internet line for 4.5 million homes and businesses by 2020, which represents 38 per cent of the total NBN footprint. Labor's plan was to connect 93 per cent of premises directly with faster and more expensive fibre-optic cabling.\nTelstra and NBN had originally hoped Australia's biggest phone and internet provider could help install the new technology, which relies on the copper phone network that has long been owned and managed by Telstra. Australia's first fibre-to-the-node services were built by Telstra and launched last week in Belmont, NSW .\nBut Telstra walked away from the first round of construction contracts in June after its alternative non-conforming proposal was rejected and a spokesman for NBN said it chose not to compete in the second round, which covers all major contracts for the remaining States and Territories.\nNBN on Monday will announce the winners of the last major contracts to connect premises across Australia using fibre-based technologies apart from hybrid fibre-coaxial networks.\nAn NBN spokesman declined to state how much the latest round of contracts were worth but added they were similar in size and value to those awarded in June. Market sources at the time indicated those were worth between $1.2 billion and $2 billion.\nTelstra remains involved, however, through its contracts to help design and plan large swathes of the rollout.\nA Telstra spokeswoman said the company chose not to participate based on its commercial assessment of the work but continued to have positive discussions on a range of other NBN rollout areas.\n Some of the construction partners that were badly burnt by the construction contracts awarded under Labor have returned in the latest round of wins.\nSyntheo was a 50-50 partnership between Lend Lease and Service Stream that dissolved after facing huge difficulties completing the work that was assigned to it in South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia â€“ losing tens of millions of dollars along the way.\nBut both parties have separately returned to work on NBN contracts, albeit in smaller roles. Service Stream will work to connect some premises in Victoria while Lend Lease is now one of five contractors connecting premises to the NBN in NSW.\nSA Power Networks has won the contracts to build the NBN in South Australia and the Northern Territory while QC Comms will do the job in the ACT and parts of NSW.\nDecon has also been added to the list as one of four contractors in Victoria.\nThe last major construction contracts on the NBN project yet to be awarded involve the upgrade and expansion of hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) networks that are used to deliver pay TV services and cable broadband.\nNBN has tendered for a construction trial with expectations that work will commence in early 2016.\nNBN is also due to launch the first of its two dedicated satellites on Thursday, October 1 .", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/telstra-walks-away-from-nbn-rollout-billions-20150610-ghkite.html", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/malcolm-turnbulls-nbn-gets-newcastle-hooked-20150908-gjhk6c.html"], "published": "2015-09-27T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T02:21:10.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
