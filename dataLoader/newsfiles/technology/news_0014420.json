Net sales increased 11.3% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, compared to net sales of $18.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. \nGross profit was $5.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, compared to $7.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Gross profit margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net sales, was 27.5% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, compared to 34.9% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. \nSales, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses decreased 9.9% to $6.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, compared to $6.8 million for the same period last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 29.3% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, compared to 32.2% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, consistent with some of the Company's cost cutting initiatives implemented near the end of fiscal year 2014. \nOCC recorded a net loss attributable to the Company of $573,000, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, compared to net income attributable to the Company of $292,000, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. \nFiscal Year-to-Date 2015 Financial Results \nConsolidated net sales for the first nine months of fiscal year 2015 decreased 1.6% to $56.8 million, compared to net sales of $57.7 million for the same period in fiscal year 2014. The Company achieved a year-over-year increase in net sales during the first nine months of fiscal year 2015 in its commercial markets; however, this increase was offset by decreases in net sales in its specialty markets. \nGross profit was $16.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2015, compared to $19.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2014. Gross profit margin was 29.5% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2015, compared to 33.6% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2014. \nSG&A expenses decreased 6.9% to $18.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2015 from $19.6 million for the same period last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 32.2% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2015 compared to 34.0% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2014, consistent with some of the Company's cost cutting initiatives implemented near the end of fiscal year 2014. \nOCC recorded a net loss attributable to the Company of $1.3 million, or $0.21 per basic and diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2015, compared to a net loss of $263,000, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share, for the same period last year. \nManagement's Comments \nNeil Wilkin, President and Chief Executive Officer of OCC, said, \"We are pleased with our momentum in commercial markets, including the 11.3% sequential quarterly sales growth we achieved this quarter, and with our ability to cut SG&A expenses 6.9% fiscal year to date.\" \nMr. Wilkin added, \"Like others, we have experienced weakness in some of our larger specialty markets, including the mining, oil & gas and military markets. We have also experienced pricing pressure in certain markets, particularly the wireless carrier market. As a result, our net sales and gross profit margins were negatively impacted.\" \n\"OCC is fortunate to operate in diverse markets--both by end-user market and by geography. This creates opportunities as we continue to market innovative new products and solutions, particularly connectivity products and solutions in our commercial markets,\" Mr. Wilkin added. \n\"We remain focused on operational excellence and controlling costs, and we will continue to drive growth and value creation by investing in product innovation as well as manufacturing enhancements to extend our broad suite of top-tier integrated connectivity and cabling solutions. We believe these actions will result in improved gross profits and bottom line results. We are confident in the underlying strength of our business, our market position and our future prospects--strengths that are not diminished by current macroeconomic factors in some of our markets,\" Mr. Wilkin said. \nMr. Wilkin added, \"During the quarter, we announced a new share repurchase plan and another quarterly cash dividend, reflecting our confidence in our strategy, the long-term success of OCC and our commitment to delivering value for shareholders. We look forward to executing on our strategic plans in the fiscal fourth quarter to drive enhanced shareholder value.\" \nConference Call Information \nAs previously announced, OCC will host a conference call today, September 11, 2015, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
