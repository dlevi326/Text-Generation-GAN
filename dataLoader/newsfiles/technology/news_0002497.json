That may seem like a thick smartphone, but that's the thickest part. It has a curved back and the thinnest point comes in at 6.1mm.\nDesign wise, the name of the game is customisation. The Moto Maker website is back, allowing you to choose different materials for the back, accent colours for the camera and the phone's overall colour.\nThere are 18 different backs to choose from and colour wise you've got seven options for accents. You really can make it your own design.\nChoices of material are silicone plastic, leather or wood. I had a bit of time trying them all out and it's a similar affair as before. The leather feels really good on the palm of the hand and gives fantastic grip. Wood looks great from afar, but doesn't offer great grip and looks like it could easily be damaged.\nThe plastic also feels quite nice on the back of the phone, but it doesn't look particularly nice when laying face down.\nThe left hand side of the phone is free from buttons while the right-hand side has the lock button within easy thumb reach alongside the volume rocker.\nGoing from using an LG G4, I did keep finding myself trying to unlock the phone with the indented Motorola logo on the rear – you'd get used to that after a bit of use though.\nThe headphone jack sits in the middle at the top once again – an annoying position I find - while the same position at the bottom is home to the microUSB port.\nOn the front is a 5.7-inch Quad HD display with a resolution of 1440 x 2560 equalling 520ppi. That's the largest Quad HD display we've seen so far on a big phone and it looks beautiful when you hold it in your hand.\nI got to watch a little video from the phone's storage and it looks supremely sharp and clear. The new Moto X Style has a great screen to body ratio at 76%, meaning the bezels are particularly slim and that not a lot of space is wasted.\nUnder the hood is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor clocked at 1.8GHz paired with 3GB of RAM. Storage options are either 32GB or 64GB and then there's 128GB microSD support on top of that.\nI didn't have time to play around with the camera that muchm but the images I saw taken with it look fantastic. It has a 21MP sensor that can film in both 4K and full HD as well as all the features you'd usually expect, like burst mode, auto HD and panorama.\nThe front facing camera has a 5MP sensor with a dedicated flash and a wide-angle selfie mode so you can fit even more people into your shots.\nIn terms of software, it'll be launching on the latest and greatest Android 5.1.1 Lollipop and it has all the connectivity options you'd expect to be packed in, including 4G LTE, NFC and Bluetooth 4.1.\nThe battery is a 3,000mAh cell that Motorola claims will last the day. The most exciting part is Turbo Charging that can charge your phone for 10 hours of use from just a 15-minute charge.\nIn the US, the Moto X Style will be known as the Moto X Pure Edition, and will start at $399 unlocked on Amazon, BestBuy.com and Motorola's own online store. However, Moto's been mum on a specific release date, saying merely \"September\".\nThat the Moto X Pure will be completely unlocked in the states – as in, zero plans for carrier subsidies – is an important distinction. Selling phones purely online or in stores without contracts has been a growing trend in the US for some time now, and Motorola is undoubtedly the biggest player to give the strategy a shot. It helps that the phone's universal LTE banding feature will allow to operate on virtually any carrier.\nAs for the UK, Motorola has outright said the Style is set to cost £359 and will be available from September. Motorola didn't announce pricing for Australia, but did confirm the phone would launch there in September, too.\nLet's talk a little about the Moto X Style's sibling - the Moto X Play . The Play is already out there in the wild and we've managed to give the phone a full review.\nIt comes in a bit cheaper than the Moto X Style, but the Style doesn't exactly cost much for a flagship handset. It's a little more durable than this phone and has some impressive battery life - we recommend checking out our review before you decide on what phone to buy.\nEarly verdict All in all, the Moto X Style is a very impressive phone. You've got high-end specs such as the stunning display, an impressive processor set-up and a great looking camera to top it off.\nThrow the fully customisable design in the pot with wood and leather seasoning, and you're onto a real winner.\nIt's all there for not quite much money either and that's always a bonus. It's quite far behind the main competition making the Moto X Style an affordable yet high-end option for your next smartphone.\nTo make the decision harder though, Motorola has thrown the slightly cheaper Moto X Play your way as well. It'll cost a bit less at £299 (around $466, AU$638) and still offers a strong display and stock Android.\nRead our hands-on review of the Moto X Play What is a hands on review? 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.
