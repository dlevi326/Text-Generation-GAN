A proprietary AISYS optical system will deliver 5,000 lumens of brightness without the need for large lamps and cooling systems â€” resulting in a compact and lightweight body, according to the company. The projector will also feature a \";newly developed 4K wide-zoom lens capable of projecting large images from a short distance, as well as an optical focusing function that enables the projection of images on curved-surface screens.\" \nThe device will be Canon's first entry into the 4K projector market.
