Miraikikai (Kurashiki City, Okayama Prefecture) is developing a robot for cleaning solar panels, etc. \nMiraikikai is a venture firm established mainly by researchers at Kagawa University. It is developing a robot that autonomously runs and cleans solar panels without using water, etc ( See related article ). \nCurrently, the number of construction projects of mega (large-scale) solar power plants is increasing in Middle Eastern countries. However, in desert areas, dust attached to solar panels lowers power generation efficiency. \nWhen panels are cleaned, there is also an issue of securing water. Miraikikai's robot cleaner, which does not use water, is expected to solve such problems. The company has already conducted test operations in the Middle East. Currently, the robot is under development for volume production. \nThe VCF will purchase new shares to be allocated to a third party and provide a development fund for commercialization of the robot that cleans solar panels. Also, it will support marketing and sales in Middle Eastern countries in cooperation with companies that invested in the VCF. \nEuglena SMBC Nikko Leave a Nest Capital was established by Euglena Investment Co Ltd (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Euglena Co Ltd), SMBC Nikko Securities Inc and Leave a Nest Co Ltd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:02:53.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
