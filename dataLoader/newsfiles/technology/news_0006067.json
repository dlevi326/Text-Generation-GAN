Also, it showed a plan to improve the speed of supply and demand adjustment and left opportunities for businesses that locally produce energy for local consumption by setting power transmission/distribution companies as purchasers. \nCurrently, certification takes place before grid connection application, but METI is planning to make it happen after concluding a grid connection contract. While the current certification system is targeted at \"facilities,\" the target of the new system is \"power generation business,\" METI said. Therefore, it intends to secure the feasibility of projects by making it necessary to conclude a grid connection contract in advance. \nThose changes will be applied not only to projects that have already started operations but also to power producers who have already obtained certification for their facilities under the current system. As for those who have obtained certification under the current system, if they cannot conclude a grid connection contract after a certain period of time, the certification will be canceled. With this change, METI aims to eliminate a considerable number of stagnant projects that do not start operations after obtaining certification. \nAs of now, the total capacity of certified solar power generation facilities has reached about 83GW, but only about 40GW of those projects have concluded a grid connection contract. With the new certification system, among the rest of the projects, those that cannot conclude a contract after a certain period of time will lose the certification. If they concluded a grid connection contract after the period, the certification will be canceled, changing the purchasing price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:53:04.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
