Once the collections are sold, they are put into production. This unique business model allows designers to directly sell their pieces to individual shoppers, who will receive a custom-made garment, produced in a limited quantity and made in the USA, leaving no excess inventory. \n“What Nineteenth Amendment provides to independent designers is a risk-free way to come to market,” said Terry Lundgren, Macy’s, Inc. chairman and chief executive officer. “This innovative concept gives customers a made-to-order product and a great shopping experience, while in turn helping new fashion talent find and build an audience, piece by piece. We’re excited to give macys.com customers the opportunity to connect with the design stars of tomorrow while they shop for unique limited-edition apparel.” \n“Our mission at Nineteenth Amendment is to launch the next massive designer by giving independent talent around the world an inventory-less business model built for the digital age, while helping to grow U.S. manufacturing and giving shoppers a voice in the future of fashion,” said Nineteenth Amendment co-founders Amanda Curtis and Gemma Sole. “This collaboration is a testament to Macy’s commitment to pushing fashion forward while giving macys.com customers the opportunity to discover and support independent designers from around the world.” \nThis exclusive relationship with nineteenthamendment.com to support their designer pre-sales via promotional integration will give millions of shoppers who visit macys.com every day the opportunity to browse hard-to-find independent designer collections. Looking to the future, macys.com will have the ability to provide its customers with exclusive first look access to purchase pieces from specially curated designers and collections. \nMacy’s and Nineteenth Amendment began working together as part of the NY Fashion Tech Lab, a business of fashion accelerator that is a result of a collaboration between the Partnership Fund for New York City, Springboard Enterprises and major fashion retailers, including Macy’s. The focus of the Lab is to target early stage companies that have developed innovations at the intersection of fashion, retail and technology. Macy’s and Nineteenth Amendment were both participants in the first class of the Lab during the summer of 2014. Macy’s executives chose to mentor the Nineteenth Amendment team for three months and this collaboration resulted in a relationship that will broaden the reach of Macy’s online store into the emerging designer landscape.
