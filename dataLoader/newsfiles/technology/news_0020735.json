The company hasn’t decided whether to proceed, the person said.\nWith original programming, Apple would make the leap from being one of the top retailers of entertainment to its wealthiest producer, and obtain premium content for a live TV service it’s said to be planning. Next week, the Cupertino, California-based maker of iPhones and Mac computers is expected to unveil a new version of its Apple TV set-top box, along with the latest iteration of the popular mobile phone.\nThe move would pose another threat to the pay-TV industry, which has suffered subscriber losses as young consumers watch video using online services like Netflix Inc. and Google Inc.’s YouTube and older viewers pare their spending.\nTom Neumayr, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment. Variety reported on Apple’s plans on Monday.\nIt would also represent a challenge to established online streaming companies like Netflix, Amazon.com Inc. and Hulu. Those three services are bedrock offerings in the current Apple TV set-top box.\nApple would want to fund a number of high-profile series, the person said, rather than start with one or two. The company attempted to work with the stars of hit BBC series “Top Gear” after they left the show, according to Variety.\nAnalysts and executives have long speculated Apple might fund programming or buy a movie studio. Up to now, the company has stuck with producing phones, tablets and computers -- businesses with higher profit margins than content production.\nThe company has been taking steps into video production. Apple’s new music app, for example, includes some exclusive, behind-the-scenes clips. Artists often welcome videographers and photographers into the studio with them, and Apple has hired executives to help shoot and produce video from recording sessions with willing musicians.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T10:17:41.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
