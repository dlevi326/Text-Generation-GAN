This new solution leverages Cloud Logistics’ award-winning TMS to enable customers to start their transportation implementation and begin shipping with their TMS all on the same day. Container Centralen (CC) has already proven the value of Same Day TMS with their rapid deployment.\n“When we first created Cloud Logistics, our goal was to compress the average project cycle time from months to weeks to days,” said Mark Nix, Chief Executive Officer of Cloud Logistics. “This new offering shows that we surpassed that goal and can now help customers start saving on the first day. Plus, partnering with the innovative distributor CC was a great way to prove we could achieve such an audacious goal.”\nFor more information on Same Day TMS, go to http://www.samedaytms.com .\nJohn Paulsen, CC’s VP of Operations commented, “Our customers expect top notch service. We need to balance this service with reasonable freight spend. After researching many solutions available in the marketplace, we determined that Cloud Logistics best allows us to satisfy all of our customers while efficiently managing our transportation network. On top of that, no one else came close to being able to deploy in a single day.\"\nSame Day TMS offers the same features that any shipper would expect from a transportation solution. These include freight rating, carrier selection, load tendering and visibility as well as match pay. The solution provides communication with the nearly 1,000 carriers already on the Cloud Logistics network via the Carrier Portal. Additional capabilities, such as mobile, a vendor portal and 3PL billing are also available to the shipper and can be deployed shortly after go-live.\nAdrian Gonzalez, President of Adelante SCM and founder of Talking Logistics, offered, \"Several years ago, I proposed a concept called 'Software-as-a-Self-Service', in which a shipper could be up and running with a TMS within an hour or two. Such a solution would empower all of those companies currently managing their transportation operations manually. Cloud Logistics’ Same-Day TMS helps brings the industry much closer to this vision of rapid on-boarding and time-to-value.\"\nCloud Logistics will be demonstrating their solution at the annual Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP) September 27-30, 2015 in San Diego, California.\nAbout Cloud Logistics\nCloud Logistics provides the newest generation of transportation logistics solutions for the global supply chain market.
