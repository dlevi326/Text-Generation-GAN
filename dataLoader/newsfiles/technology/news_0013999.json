The next step is to search for available booking slots within the given time zones, with users having 15 minutes to select their desired zones for each container. Once all the details have been reviewed and finalised, users can then proceed to confirm their appointment. \nBooked slots further facilitate service levels and are planned to all but eliminate truck queues because the container terminal controls the flow of trucks to and from the terminal. This aims to eliminate the current peaks created by road congestion, truck bans, and other external factors while giving importers and exporters a transparent view of when their trucks are meant to process transactions. \nThree days prior to the launch, ICTSI conducted a two-day training to introduce port users to the functionalities and features of TABS. \nTABS was made possible through the collaborative efforts of the Philippine supply chain stakeholders and Australia’s 1-Stop Connections. \nFact File: In 1988, ICTSI won the 25 + 25 years concession to operate MICT in an international tender. Since ICTSI’s takeover, MICT has increased its annual capacity by five times, expanded its container handling fleet to make it the largest and most modern container terminal in the Philippines, and switched from a manual control system to an integrated real-time IT terminal control system. MICT is ICTSI’s flagship operation. \nFact File: ICTSI’s portfolio of terminals and projects spans developed and emerging market economies in the Asia Pacific, the Americas, Europe and the Middle East, and Africa. ICTSI has received global acclaim for its public-private partnerships with governments divesting of their port assets to the private sector.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T16:30:06.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
