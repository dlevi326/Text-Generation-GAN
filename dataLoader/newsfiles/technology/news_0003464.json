The AFL recently announced it had switched its GPS provider. \nSABEL Labs project manager and research fellow Dr Jono Neville developed a model which presents accelerometers as a viable alternative to GPS in the quest for improved athlete assessment techniques. \nHis research, titled 'A model for comparing over-ground running speed and accelerometer derived step rate in elite level athletes', is detailed in Sensors Journal, which is currently published online and will be in print next month. \nDr Neville said while Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are an important tool for workload management, the devices have limitations when it comes to changes in speed and direction and when they are used indoors, due to their reliance on external satellites. \nHe said he compared inertial sensor data with GPS data, collected simultaneously from Brisbane Lions AFL players during 2009, to create a model which was highly accurate for running speeds. \n\"There is a driving need for emerging technology like this in the sports performance industry,\" the microelectronic engineer said. \n\"When it comes to frequent and rapid changes in speed and distance, GPS just doesn't cut it, although it's still the most widely used technology. \n\"We have found a data processing technique which allows us to extract data from an athlete and create an individualised model. \" \nDr Neville said his technology will be key in monitoring training and game workloads. \n\"This will assist in preventing things such as over-training, which is a major concern for elite athletes, to reduce risk of injury.\" \nDr Neville said individualised models are created automatically using SABEL Sense technology which can then be used to track speeds and distances. \n  Griffith University .
