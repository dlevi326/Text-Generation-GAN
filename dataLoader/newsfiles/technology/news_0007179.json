Its shares were pummelled a further 20 per cent amid news of a profit downgrade and a decision to set aside over $10 billion to cover potential fines and legal fees.\nEuropean peers BMW , Daimler , Fiat Chrysler , Peugeot and Renault all plunged between 6 and 9 per cent as investor confidence in the industry was compromised.\nThe developments helped drive Germany’s DAX 30 down 3.8 per cent, while France’s CAC 40 tumbled 3.4 per cent, Italy’s Milan Stock Exchange dived 3.3 per cent and the UK’s FTSE 100 slid 2.8 per cent.\nBHP Billiton and Rio Tinto tanked 5.1 per cent and 3.5 per cent in London trade, respectively. The session was so dire, however, that these numbers were above par compared to their main rivals, with troubled Glencore setting the low mark thanks to a drop of more than 10 per cent.\nThe Athens Stock Exchange extended its lacklustre response to the latest Greek election, slipping 2.3 per cent.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average weakened 1.1 per cent, the S&P 500 slid 1.2 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite Index backtracked 1.5 per cent. Key indexes were pointing down more than 1.5 per cent for much of the session before staging a minor rally near the close.\nThe Richmond Fed index weakened into negative territory, hitting a mark of -5 in September and falling short of expectations of a -2 reading. The number is the latest sign of softness in the US manufacturing sector, but does little to temper a positive view on the broader US economy.\nIn other market action:\n-- The Australian dollar slumped as commodities hit the skids. At 6am (AEST), the local unit is trading at US70.85c, down from US71.52c on Tuesday. It fell as low as US70.56c during the session.\n-- US Nymex crude yielded 1.8 per cent to $US45.83 as investors again turned cautious on demand prospects. Global benchmark Brent crude bucked the trend in inching up 0.3 per cent to $US49.08.\n-- Gold dipped 0.7 per cent to $US1,124.80 an ounce as the US dollar gained ground.\n-- Iron ore held steady at $US57.10 a tonne for a second straight day.\n-- ASX futures are pointing down 62 points, or 1.2 per cent, as of 6.15am (AEST).\nAhead: Manufacturing data will drive markets, with monthly readings on tap in China, Europe and the US over the next 24 hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T02:00:28.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
