IEEE NetSoft 2016 will be held 6-10 June 2016, at The-K Hotel in Seoul, Korea. \nSoftwarization is a systemic trend that is opening a new value-chain for telecommunications, ICT, and several other industries. IEEE NetSoft 2016 will shed light on the fundamental technology components and systems for software-defined infrastructures, clouds, and services in order to fully exploit its potential for the efficient handling of various physical resources across wire and wireless networks and datacenter domains and for easy and fast deployment of new services. \nThe IEEE NetSoft 2016 conference theme: Softwarization of Networks, Clouds, and Internet of Things (IoT), presents an opportunity for academia and industry to present their work and contribute to an in-depth exchange on the latest elements in the software-defined ecosystem. Through 15 November 2015, authors are invited to submit papers on relevant topics such as: APIs, protocols and languages for programmable networks and Software-Defined Infrastructures Efficient network and service monitoring for SDN/NFV Softwarized platforms for IoT Debugging and introspection of software-defined virtualized systems New service models and paradigms enabled by softwarization \nFor details on the complete list of NetSoft 2016 topics and submission information, please visit http://bit.ly/NetSoft16CFP . \nIEEE NetSoft 2016 is a world conference sponsored by IEEE Communications Society, IEEE Computer Society, IEEE Consumer Electronics Society, IEEE Signal Processing Society, and IEEE Future Directions Committee. \nIEEE SDN is building a large technical community with nearly 2500 experts worldwide.
