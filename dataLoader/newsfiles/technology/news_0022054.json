A new Samsung divide called SleepSense has just entered the market, and it’s a step up from the usual gadgets by the tech giant. Picture: Samsung Source: Supplied \nSAMSUNG is making a play for your bedroom, revealing a small device in Berlin today that lies beneath your mattress to not only monitor your sleep, but control your air conditioner, television and audio system to ensure better sleep, less jet lag, and a faster metabolism. \nIt can even turn off your TV when it senses you’ve fallen asleep in front of it. \nSamsung revealed its SleepSense monitor at the IFA technology show, showing off a slender device that lies inside a bed and, without touching the user, tracks their vital signs. Unleashed ... The SleepSense was unveiled at the IFA technology show in Berlin, Germany. Picture: Samsung Source: Supplied \nSamsung digital appliances vice-president Yoon C Lee said the SleepSense device used sensors to track the user’s sleep quality and upload it to the internet, showing it off in an app. \n“We now offer the power to track, manage and improve the quality of your sleep,” he said. \n“When you’re in bed, It measures your heart rate and your breathing all in real time, and without touching your body it delivers data accuracy of up to 97 per cent.” \nThe device will also track how long it took you to fall asleep, sleep efficiency, the number of times you woke, and if you got out of bed. \nMr Lee said the Samsung SleepSense device was different to existing sleep-tracking technology, as it not only measured the user’s behaviour but attempted to improve it by connecting to “your devices at home such as the TV, air conditioning and lights”. \nOn a hot summer’s night, for example, the SleepSense could send a message to a connected air conditioning unit to lower the temperature for optimal rest. \nIt could also turn your TV off when it sense you’ve fallen asleep, or turn on your coffee machine when it senses you’ve woken up in the morning. All encompassing ... The new Samsung SleepSense promises to connect to other home devices such as the TV, air conditioning and lights. Picture: Samsung Source: Supplied \nSamsung paired with metabolism expert Dr Christos Mantzoros from the Harvard Medical School to develop the system and deliver sleep improvement tips in its accompanying app. \n“With more than 25 years of experience and expertise in human metabolism … I can state with confidence there are three important factors that regulate our metabolism: ow much we eat and drink, how much we exercise, and how much and how well we sleep,” Dr Mantzoros said. \n“Many among us take these factors for granted. Most people don’t really realise how and whether they can improve their sleep.” \nA Samsung Australia spokeswoman confirmed the SleepSense device would “launch in Australia” but said “we look forward to providing more details around pricing availability … very soon”. \nJennifer Dudley-Nicholson travelled to Berlin as a guest of Samsung.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T16:53:11.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
