The new Application Performance specialization recognizes and rewards partners’ expertise and proven success, and enhances their ability to sell and support Ixia solutions for network visibility, network assessment, and virtualization. \n“Earning an Ixia specialization rating is a true point of differentiation for us because Ixia’s comprehensive portfolio and training address a broad range of challenges that our customers face,” said Bob Kerr, vice president of SwishData , provider of enterprise architecture solutions. “The specialization certification recognizes our ability to add value to our customers at every stage of the sale — from helping them evaluate their technology investments to maintaining visibility into performance and security as their networks evolve.” \nIxia’s Channel Xcelerate Specializations Program enables eligible partners to qualify for additional discounts on products covered within each focus area. Partners also benefit by leveraging third-party certification by Ixia to differentiate their brands and offerings from the competition. To qualify to be certified a specialist, partners must demonstrate that a significant percentage of their annual revenues is derived from the specialization area, and must have a minimum of two individuals complete Ixia’s certification programs and testing. \nAbout the New Specialization Ratings \nThe Application Performance specialization encompasses: Ixia’s IxChariot™ Network Assessment suite, which evaluates networks’ readiness to support challenging applications such as voice-over-IP (VoIP), unified communications services (UC) such as Microsoft Lync, Wi-Fi deployments and cloud computing Network visibility solutions, which include taps, virtualized visibility tools and network packet brokers Ixia’s Application & Threat Intelligence (ATI) Processor™, which delivers actionable insight into application traffic used to optimize resource use, ROI and network security \nThe new specialization follows the formal launch of Ixia’s Channel Xcelerate Specializations Program in May 2015 , which included the launch of the Security specialization.
