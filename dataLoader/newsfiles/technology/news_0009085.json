According to Palo Alto , the XcodeGhost can prompt fake user alerts to phish for passwords, and read and write clipboard data. \n“We believe XcodeGhost is a very harmful and dangerous malware that has bypassed Apple’s code review and made unprecedented attacks on the iOS ecosystem,” said Palo Alto security researcher Claud Xiao. \nObservers noted that the developers may have been tempted to use XcodeGhost because it was being hosted in China, and therefore quicker and easier to download than the legitimate version. This raises concerns over the security of the app-development process, said Palo Alto. \nPiers Wilson, head of product management at Huntsman Security, commented: “The success of the attack is another reminder that not all attacks are new hacking techniques or ultra-sophisticated malware, but often just exploit human nature. \n“Developers who in all likelihood had no malicious intent were tricked into building malware into the otherwise legitimate apps they were creating.”  Handbook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T17:00:22.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
