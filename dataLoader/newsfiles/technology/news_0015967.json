But since the integration, enterprises can manage and report on all of their corporate-liable and BYOD devices, users, expenses and security from a single web interface while gaining valuable new insights and functionality from combined data.\nAmong the benefits enterprises experience from the integrated solution are simplified management, streamlined processes, better EMM utilization through automated enrollment, and the ability to monitor roaming and adjust rate plans to minimize charges. Organizations also gain valuable management insights through a variety of contextual reports that intelligently combine data from carriers and corporate feeds with AirWatch information for a holistic view of the enterprise wireless environment.\nThose interested in learning about Comview’s telecom management solutions and how they work with AirWatch are invited to visit booth 403 of the Mobility Expo from September 21-23 or on the web at http://www.comviewcorp.com .\nAbout Comview Corporation\nComview provides fully integrated Telecom Expense Management (TEM), Wireless Mobility Management (WMM) and Call Accounting solutions backed by industry-leading customer service.
