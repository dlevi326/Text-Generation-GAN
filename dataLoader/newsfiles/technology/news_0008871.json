The recent entrants in this space are coalition loyalty programme Payback (a subsidiary of American Express) and State Bank of India, which recently launched app-based customer reward programmes, joining existing players like QwikCilver and OneRewardz. \n\n\"We have observed that only one-third of loyalty point redemption happens online, while majority of the transactions happen offline. We have re-launched our digital channels to cater to the rising number of online transactions and have driven close to 32,000 transactions since mid-August on Payback Bingo, the price-comparison engine,\" said Rahul Rana, CEO & MD of Payback (Loyalty Solutions and Research Private Limited). \n\nPayback re-launched its mobile app along with a price comparison engine for e-commerce players, and announced a tie-up with Oxigen to convert points into digital currency. \n\nStored value card provider QwikCilver Solutions launched its appbased solution 'Woohoo' in July this year to manage loyalty points and enable gifting and buying using the platform. \"Customer stickiness is higher on mobile and the ease of using the loyalty points as well as multiple (digital) currencies to transact and make purchases is higher. App is another channel of engagement which goes beyond mere transaction for the brands,\" said Pratap TP, co-founder and chief marketing officer at QwikCilver. \n\nLast year the firm raised $10 million from online retailer Amazon. Helion Venture Partners and Accel. The app has tie-ups with over 150 brands and recently announced a partnership with Citrus Pay to allow customers to transact using the digital currency at the partner stores for QwikCilver. \n\nExperts say that offline brands and establishments have realized the need to provide relevant offers to high-value customers using the loyalty app as a marketing channel. \n\n\"Being on app helps brands send out location based push-ads to customers with offers, track the interest and intent of the user. Since no one downloads a loyalty app just ahead of shopping, we have cross-linked it to our SMS notifications to increase adoption,\" said Ashwin Meshram, cofounder and CEO of ONE Rewardz.
