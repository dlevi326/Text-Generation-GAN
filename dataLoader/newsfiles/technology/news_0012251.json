Faced with an expanding universe of front-end devices, high volume machine-to-machine communications, data sharing across 3rd-party platforms, and integrations into legacy systems, developers are required to adopt new approaches that fundamentally change how their applications are designed and built.\nThe paradigm shift to Web 3.0 has led to a dramatic emphasis on the creation and management of APIs, which can often overshadow the applications themselves. APIs give application data the power of portability and integration, but can be difficult and time-consuming to implement. Front-end developers have the expertise to create the applications, but API’s have long been the sole domain of the back-end developer, until now.\nCreated as an Open Source tool for front-end developers, Form.io is a breakthrough resource that eliminates the burdens of traditional API creation and management. The first-to-market combined FORM and API platform is based on the natural connection between the two. Front-end developers now have an unprecedented level of autonomy in creating the apps of the future, because with Form.io the FORMs are the APIs.\nForm.io also purports tremendous flexibility and ease of use - including an innovative drag and drop workflow - to satisfy everyone from the individual hobbyist to the corporate enterprise. Features not found on any other platform include:\n“Dynamically Updateable FORMs” which can be changed on the fly without having to recompile and reissue the application software itself.\nTrademarked formio HTML tags that seamlessly inject and render dynamic forms directly into applications; allowing limitless theme and design choices.\nMultiple Hosting options to address data security control, firewall and other considerations.\nAccording to Form.io CTO and Co-founder Travis Tidwell, “Our technology is not just a proxy of other 3rd party API's, but a comprehensive, multi-faceted workflow solution that abstracts APIs away from the developer. As such, it achieves the greatest goal for all software platforms, to simplify programming for developers.”\nCBDO and Co-founder, Denise Kay is excited to reveal that Form.io has also caught the eye of Microsoft. “The Microsoft team was impressed with the speed & ease with which Form.io allows developers to create applications that quickly integrate their forms with Office 365 services. This powerful technology will be featured in upcoming Microsoft podcasts and on the Microsoft Channel 9 Dev. show.\"\nGary Wetzel, CEO and Co-founder adds, “We see market applications across a wide range of end-user business verticals including healthcare, LMS, education, government agencies, industrial manufacturing, real estate, software development and more. Form.io is to Web 3.0 as the CMS was to Web 2.0, and will impact the way modern organizations approach software application development.”\nForm.io will launch at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco on September 21, 2015. TechCrunch Disrupt is the world’s leading authority in debuting revolutionary startups, introducing game-changing technologies, and discussing what’s top of mind for the tech industry’s key innovators.\nAbout Form.io:\nForm.io was founded in 2015 on the principle of Open Source software development and is committed to serving the Open Source community. Their mission is to provide developers’ innovative tools and strategies to address the emerging requirements of Web 3.0 application design - and become the new industry standard for combined FORM and API platforms.\nTo learn more about the numerous benefits of the Form.io platform visit the form.io website.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12971651.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12971651.htm"], "published": "2015-09-19T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T11:54:01.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
