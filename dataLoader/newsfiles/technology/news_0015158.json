New this year is the addition of a third day of programming, which features intermediate-level courses on topics such as standards, materials, packings and fugitive emissions , critical service applications, valve repair, and more. \nThe Basics Seminar, now in its sixth year, brings together employees and supervisors of the plants that use valves , controls and actuators with distributors and sales reps who want to better understand the products they sell. Personnel from valve manufacturers are in the classroom with those who specify, purchase and repair valves and related equipment. They learn together with young engineers, as well as senior-level mechanical engineering students.   \nThe 101 portion of the course (Oct. 21-22) consists of lessons that guide attendees through the world of valves and the systems they help control, starting with the simplest types of valves and moving into the more complicated automated products, including actuators and controls. A day of 201-level training (Oct. 23) has been added so attendees can learn even more about some of the important topics mentioned briefly in the 101 portion of the class. \nThe popular \"Valve Petting Zoo\" is a unique experience that enables participants to \"touch and feel\" examples of the many products discussed during the course. Attendees in small groups cycle around to nine tables, each featuring a different category of valves, actuators and controls. At each station, an industry expert answers questions about the products and further explains how they work. Likewise, tabletop exhibits provide attendees with time between education sessions to learn what is offered by valve, actuator and control manufacturers and distributors, suppliers to the valve industry, and valve repair firms. \nAbout VMA \nFounded in 1938, the Washington, D.C.-based Valve Manufacturers Association of America represents nearly 100 U.S. and Canadian manufacturers of valves, actuators and controls. Members' products are used in industries such as power, water/wastewater, oil & gas, chemical processing and refining, pharmaceuticals, industrial and commercial construction, pulp & paper, mining and more.
