Specifically, the Registration Statement failed to disclose that MaxPoint was wholly dependent upon its top 50 customers alone for two-thirds of its sales, leaving the company more exposed to the budgetary constraints and spending priorities of just 50 customers, resulting in lower trailing twelve-month average spending per customer growth. Further, MaxPoint's new customers during the first half of 2015 started with smaller budgets and were smaller companies than many of the enterprise customers who had been signed prior to the IPO. Although MaxPoint was required to disclose that it was more exposed to customers' budgetary proclivities due to high customer concentration and that it had been signing smaller customers in the months leading up to the IPO, its Registration Statement contained no such disclosures. During its IPO, MaxPoint sold 6.5 million shares of common stock to the public at $11.50 per share, raising $74.75 million in gross proceeds. However, it closed at $4.51 per share on September 1, 2015 , an approximately 60% decline from the IPO price.
