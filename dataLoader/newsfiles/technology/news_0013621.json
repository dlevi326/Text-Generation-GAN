The project is still a part of Google X lab, though the company did not rule out the possibility of it being a part of its parent Alphabet in the near future.Google X lab also works on other projects like Loon, which aims to provide wireless Internet to the most-remote areas in the world via smart balloons and is currently being tested in the Southern hemisphere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T02:46:13.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
