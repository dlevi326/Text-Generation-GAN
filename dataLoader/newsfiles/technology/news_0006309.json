Worldwide, it sold 10.2 million vehicles in 2014. The company says it will set aside $7.3 billion (6.5 billion euros) to cover the cost of repairing the cars.\nPreviously, American regulators had said about 482,000 cars in the U.S. were affected. The new announcement indicates that the fallout from the scandal will be felt around the world.\n[ EPA: Volkswagen used ‘defeat device’ to illegally skirt air-pollution controls ]\nThe announcement sent Volkswagen stock plunging once again Tuesday, with shares falling about 20 percent in Frankfurt by midday to 107 euros, or $119.50 a share. The company has shed nearly two-fifths of its public stock value since news of the emissions problem broke.\n“Volkswagen is working intensely to eliminate these deviations through technical measures,” VW said in a statement.\nPressure on the company began mounting Friday, when the Environmental Protection Agency announced VW had admitted to installing software that let its diesel cars detect when they were being checked for emissions and cheat on the test.\nWhile the cars, from model years 2009 to 2015, passed emissions tests, they spewed nitrogen oxide at up to 40 times federal standards on the road.\nThe latest news adds to the growing list of woes for VW this week. Already, the company faces a fine in the U.S. of up to $18 billion, class action lawsuits have been filed and the Department of Justice has launched a criminal inquiry.\nMeantime, company officials have sought to regain the trust of their customers, by apologizing in blunt terms.\n“Let’s be clear about this: Our company was dishonest with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board and with all of you,” VW’s U.S. chief, Michael Horn, said at an event in Brooklyn Monday night. “In my German words, we have totally screwed up.”\nMoore is a freelance writer.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thadmoore"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:26:36.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
