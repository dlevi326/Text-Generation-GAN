However, there are numerous technical challenges to solve before terahertz wireless can become a reality. This new multiplexing system potentially solves one of those challenges. \nMultiplexing is the process of separating streams of data that are traveling through a single medium, such as a single TV cable carrying multiple channels. \"Any terahertz communications application is going to need some form of multiplexing and demultiplexing,\" said Daniel Mittleman, professor of engineering at Brown and senior author of a research paper on the subject, in a prepared statement. \"This is, to our knowledge, the first time anyone has demonstrated a viable strategy for multiplexing in the terahertz range.\" \nThe terahertz multiplexing system developed by the researchers uses a \"leaky wave antenna,\" which has \"two metal plates placed in parallel to form a waveguide,\" according to information from the university. \"One of the plates has a small slit in it. As terahertz waves travel down the waveguide, some of the radiation leaks out of the slit. It turns out that terahertz waves leak out a different angles depending on their frequency.\" Each frequency can carry a separate data stream, and the data receiver at the other end could pick up an individual stream by accepting radiation at a specific angle. \nThe researchers published a paper, \" Frequency-Division Multiplexing in the Terahertz Range Using a Leaky-Wave Antenna ,\" in Nature Photonics on September 14. The lead author of the paper was Nicholas Karl, a graduate student at Brown.
