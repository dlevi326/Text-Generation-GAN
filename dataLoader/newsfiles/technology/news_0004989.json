The firm’s website says it is currently in beta stage of development and will pursue new ways of commissioning and rethinking the reading experience, book distribution and payments. \nThe venture was floated by Chiki Sarkar, former publisher of Penguin India and editor-in-chief of Random House India, along with Durga Raghunath, CEO and co-founder, who launched Firstpost and was previously CEO, Web18. \nRaghunath began her career in book publishing, going on to head digital operations for Mint and The Wall Street Journal in India, then founding Firstpost, and leading Network 18’s digital businesses. She was most recently senior vice president, growth, at restaurant listing and online food ordering firm Zomato. \n“There are more Indians accessing the Internet, reading, writing and paying online than five years ago. I cannot imagine something more exciting than rethinking the underdeveloped book market and getting Indians to read,” said Raghunath. \nAlong with Sarkar and Raghunath, Juggernaut’s founding team includes Gavin Morris (art director), Jaishree Ram Mohan (managing editor), executive editors Nandini Mehta and R Sivapriya. \nThe digital and business teams include Saurav Roy (chief product officer), who has founded two companies, Myriads and Burrn, the former while he was still in IIT Madras; and Neel Karinje (CFO). \nThe firm counts group editor of ABP Group Aveek Sarkar, Vijay Shekhar Sharma (founder and CEO of Paytm) and D Sundaram, former CFO of Hindustan Unilever and currently a director with PE firm TVS Capital, among its advisers. \nJuggernaut said it will publish 50 titles each year, starting from April 2016. It will be distributed and warehoused by Hachette India. \nWilliam Bissell was advised by Angela De Giacomo and Dipankar Vig of MPC Legal; Nandan Nilekani was advised by Entrust Family Office; and Juggernaut was advised by Satyajit Sarna and Associates, for the funding transaction. \nCo-founder Raghunath had previously worked at The Wall Street Journal, a publication owned by News Corp. News Corp is the owner of this news website and has a publishing business under HarperCollins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:59:43.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
