First, users can now have customers fill out data when they create a profile within their app. The data could be anything from generic information like birthdays, to data that’s more relevant to the user’s store, like what flavor ice cream is the customer’s favorite. Secondly, while customers can use apps as a “guest” to collect coupons and reward points, users can now set it so that they need to create a profile in order to redeem either of these.\nThe second update, which would be of particular interest to businesses with multiple locations, lets users display in their app the contact information, a photo album, and any custom data for each of their branches in 2 display modes: “map view” and “list view”.\nThe ability to display each location’s unique contact information, address, and photo album lets users give their customers a personal touch, and a much easier path to finding the information they need. And with the custom information feature, users can display location-specific items such as deals, events, and menu items.\nThe two display modes offer customers the versatility to search for nearby locations in the manner they prefer. “Map view” shows the app user’s location on a map, as well as the location of all nearby branches. The customer can even get directions to a location of their choosing through the app. “List view” on the other hand displays all locations in a list, ranking them by how close they are to the app user.\n“These new updates streamline the search process for customers, letting them quickly find what they are looking for,” said Trumpia’s CEO Ken Rhie. “This lets users cut down on customer frustration, which inevitably leads to more sales.”\nAbout Trumpia\nTrumpia is the leading mobile messaging & cross-channel marketing automation software platform and is committed to helping businesses grow and stay well-connected with their audience.
