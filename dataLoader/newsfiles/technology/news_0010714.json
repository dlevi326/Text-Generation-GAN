Night Shyamalan says ominously. “I literally will pound them. They’ll tell you .”\nThe writer/director of The Sixth Sense, Signs and Lady in the Water is referring to Aussie actors Olivia DeJonge, 17, and Ed Oxenbould, 14. The youngsters star as sister and brother in The Visit — a comedic horror thriller that is being hailed as Shyamalan’s return to form.\nThat he cast two Australians, says Shyamalan, was a “total fluke”. The pair hadn’t met previously, says Perth girl DeJonge, but “clicked as soon as we met each other”. Which was helpful, given Shyamalan’s exacting standards.\nTyler (Oxenbould) and his big sister spend a weird, scary week with the grandparents they never knew (Peter McRobbie and Deanna Dunagan) in movie The Visit.
