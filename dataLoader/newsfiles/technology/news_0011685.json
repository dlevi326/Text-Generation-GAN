Ben Fox Rubin/CNET\nNEW YORK -- Edward Snowden wants to lead the charge to take back the public's privacy.\nThe former government contractor on Thursday helped kick off a new campaign to pass the Snowden Treaty, a proposed international agreement to outlaw mass surveillance and protect whistleblowers like himself.\n\"This is a global problem that affects all of us,\" Snowden said via video from Russia to a room filled with reporters and activists. \"We have to come forward with proposals to assert what our rights are, traditionally and digitally.\"\nThe Snowden Treaty has the potential to vastly change the way governments gather intelligence on their citizens and other countries. However, the chances of such a sweeping regulation on information-gather ever gaining majority support from the UN seems unlikely.\nThe treaty was conceived by civil rights activist David Miranda, whose partner, journalist Glenn Greenwald, helped published many of the Snowden revelations. Miranda told the crowd Thursday that he came up with the idea for the treaty after British authorities two years ago interrogated him for about nine hours, using UK terror laws to detain him.\n\"That balanced me to fight against the system that is so corrupted,\" he said Thursday.\nThe proposal, formally called the International Treaty on the Right to Privacy, Protection Against Improper Surveillance and Protection of Whistleblowers, would need to be ratified by the United Nations. Supporters expect the work of finding backers from the public and member nations will take years. Miranda said there are dialogues with governments on the proposal already, though declined to disclose which countries.\n\"I expect it will be extremely difficult,\" said Betsy Page Sigman, a distinguished teaching professor at Georgetown University who's studied and taught political science for years. She added that the topic of mass surveillance and Snowden himself are \"very controversial,\" and member countries will disagree on what levels of privacy are appropriate.\nDavid Miranda, center, calls on the public get involved and pressure governments to curtail mass surveillance. Ben Fox Rubin/CNET\nGreenwald said Thursday that the treaty would be a vital way of protecting the rights of whistleblowers. He noted how Snowden, after he leaked millions of National Security Agency documents in 2013, found himself facing the potential of a long prison sentence if he didn't quickly find protection in another country. He ended up in Russia, where he's lived ever since.\n\"I think the critical part of this treaty is to say that whistleblowers are entitled to protection on an international level,\" Greenwald said. \"They shouldn't have to rely on some sort of ad hoc, desperate attempt at the last-minute to avoid being put into prison for 40 years.\"\nThe campaign is part of an international effort led by advocacy groups, including Avaaz and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, focused on human rights in the digital age.\nDespite the challenges of pushing the treaty, speakers at Thursday's event said they were heartened that the conversation on privacy has changed since the Snowden revelations and more major tech companies are now working to encrypt their data to prevent further government snooping.\nWhile governments aren't likely to agree to such a treaty, Miranda said they could if people got involved and insisted on such changes.\n\"They don't want to restrain their powers of surveillance,\" he said. \"It's up to us to stand up and make that change ... This is not for them, it's for us.\"", "external_links": ["http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/24/5eaa44bf-5ce9-4825-94fc-1cdb2e432cc5/crop/2833x1927+163+163/resize/570xauto/6f07eb0eec65177c151398591c5e7107/img8710.jpg", "http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/24/a00cfcf4-bfb5-46e6-afce-a4f3180cfb83/crop/3066x2448+142+0/resize/570xauto/ad9a4db2d3590d920d29b42110097c71/img8702.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-24T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T23:51:58.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
