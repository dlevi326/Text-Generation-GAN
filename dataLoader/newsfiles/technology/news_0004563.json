Today, Kentucky ranks No. 46 out of 50 states in broadband availability, and nearly a quarter of rural areas in Kentucky have no broadband at all. Thanks to KentuckyWired, the state will now have the opportunity to catch up.\nThe next step will be turning broadband into jobs – specifically, jobs for the modern knowledge economy. KentuckyWired emerged from the SOAR (Shaping Our Appalachian Region) initiative, which is grappling with Kentucky’s transition from a coal-based economy to a more modern, diverse economy. Using broadband to create jobs will be the subject of the Fiber for the New Economy conference in Lexington, Ky., September 15–18.\nBroadband Communities and the Fiber to the Home Council, along with Next Century Cities and the Coalition for Local Internet Choice, have recruited top-notch speakers from federal, state and local agencies, broadband operators, and research institutions.\nCommunities inside and outside Kentucky will discuss how they built next-generation, fiber optic-based broadband. The people behind KentuckyWired, including Lt. Gov. Crit Luallen, will answer questions about that project. Mayor Jim Gray will discuss Lexington’s gigabit city initiative. Top officials from the FCC, USDA and other agencies will talk about what they’re doing to encourage broadband.\nIn four days of workshops, keynotes and panel discussions, attendees will learn how communities are leveraging next-generation networks to transform their economies and build a better quality of life.\nThe full agenda is available at http://www.bbcmag.com/lexington/agenda-at-a-glance.html\nLocal elected officials, city managers, economic development professionals, city planners, network operators, educators and broadband activists are all expected at the conference. “Meeting folks who have set policy, made financial investments, built networks, and pulled communities together to build their own networks will be a wonderful opportunity – all in beautiful Lexington, Ky.,” said conference chair Hilda Legg, vice chairman of Broadband Communities. “More folks should be aware of the vast array of opportunities awaiting communities that expand their high-speed broadband.”\n“This conference in Kentucky is an opportunity to celebrate our successes and move the market forward,” said Heather Burnett Gold, president and CEO of FTTH Council Americas. “We’re excited for the opportunity to introduce communities to the possibilities presented by faster, more robust and scalable broadband networks supported by all-fiber technology.”\nLearn more and register at http://www.bbcmag.com/lexington . Walk-in registration available.\nAbout Broadband Communities\nBroadband Communities is the leading source of information on digital and broadband technologies for buildings and communities. Our magazine, other publications and conferences aim to accelerate the deployment of fiber to the home and business while keeping readers and attendees up to date on the available solutions capable of serving their practical needs. http://www.bbcmag.com\nAbout Fiber to the Home Council Americas\nFTTH Council Americas is a non-profit association of companies and organizations that deliver video, Internet and/or voice services over high-bandwidth, next-generation, direct fiber optic connections – as well as companies that manufacture FTTH products and others involved in planning and building FTTH networks. The Council shares and builds industry consensus on key issues surrounding fiber to the home. Its mission is to accelerate deployment of all-fiber access networks by demonstrating how fiber-enabled applications and solutions create value for service providers and their customers, promote economic development and enhance quality of life.
