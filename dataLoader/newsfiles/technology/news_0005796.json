The LevelGuard is built to last, and we believe LevelGuard will surpass 2 million cycles early next year.\" \nLevelGuard, which utilizes Field-Effect sensor technology, was designed to surpass 1.5 million cycles and provide a better solution than the current float switch technology for pump OEMs' and homeowners. Mechanical float switches are the number one cause of failure in sump pump systems, and the 1,500,000 cycle milestone is further evidence that LevelGuard can dramatically improve the reliability of the system by employing a solid-state design.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T09:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:42:52.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
