Ltd (GDCATV), one of the largest cable TV stations in China, to deploy an integrated budget management planning and support system by leveraging the Enterprise Private Cloud solution under the Huawei-Accenture strategic alliance agreement. \nAs a result, GDCATV will standardize its budget processes across Guangdong province, where it serves more than 700,000 subscribers, operates 27 channels of cable TV programming, and provides IP and data services to customers. \n“Ensuring that business processes such as budget planning and administration are consistent across our operation is critical to our expansion plans for an integrated cable network, and to provide increasingly sophisticated digital services to our clients,” said Zhong Mingge, director of Enterprise Information Technology, GDCATV. “Accenture’s proven financial performance management assets and knowledge of the communications service provider (CSP) industry, combined with Huawei’s enhanced infrastructure solutions will enable us to realize operational efficiencies and deliver an excellent customer experience.” \nUnder the agreement with GDCATV, Accenture is providing its Total Budgeting Management System, a comprehensive management system which utilizes modern networking, data analysis and information technology to integrate enterprises’ operations, capital, salary, and financial budgeting. This will allow enterprises to more efficiently allocate resources, increase operation quality, improve business efficiency and strengthen risk management and control across their entire operation. \nHuawei is providing GDCATV with its Hyper-Converged Infrastructure FusionCube and cloud OS FusionSphere, an enterprise product family that encompasses both hardware such as servers, storage, security, and networking, and software including virtual computing, cloud computing, and cloud management. Compared to conventional architecture, FusionCube helps reduce the system deployment time to hours from weeks and improve performance by more than 10 times, cutting overall costs by up to 30 percent. \n“We will work with Accenture to co-support GDCATV in effective business extension across Guangdong province, as well as in operational efficiency and cost effectiveness, helping it better serve individual clients. This exciting cooperation will be a milestone for Huawei-Accenture strategic alliance regarding the HASA EPC-Enterprise Private Cloud,” said William Xu, Chief Strategy Marketing Officer of Huawei. \n“We are delighted to enable GDCATV to integrate and standardize its current tools to more effectively manage the budgeting process. The new system represents the foundation for them to deliver many new digital services, and the same could be said for any CSP,” said Gianfranco Casati, Group Chief Executive – Growth Markets of Accenture. \nThe agreement was formed under the strategic alliance announced by Huawei and Accenture in October 2014 to develop and market innovative solutions to address customer requirements in both the CSP and enterprise ICT markets. The companies agreed to serve their global clients by leveraging Huawei’s wide portfolio of leading hardware and software products and solutions, and Accenture’s capabilities in consulting, systems integration and outsourcing.
