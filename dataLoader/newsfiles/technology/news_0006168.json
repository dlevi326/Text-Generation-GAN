The Road Transport Ministry has decided to write to the Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) asking it to modify the existing specification of tyres produced in India to make it on par with global standard,” Road Transport Secretary Vijay Chhibber told Deccan Herald.\nThe Road Ministry had earlier also expressed concern over quality of tyre produced in India. However, since 2014, the Ministry has decided to compile separate column in its annual report mentioning accidents due to tyre bursts.\nIn 2014, total 9,748 accidents reported due to tyre busts while 3,371 persons killed and 9,081 persons have been injured.\n“As the BIS, standard specification body under the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, certify tyres and tubes, we will write to them about our concerns by mentioning accidents due to tyre bursts in 2014,” he said, adding that the matter would also be taken to Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion as well as Heavy Industries which deals with tyre manufacturers, he said.\nTyre specs revision\nWith the Union Road Ministry working on constructing national highways with cement concrete, the BIS have to revise its specification on tyre accordingly, he said.\nHe also pointed out that several accidents on Yamuna Express that connects Delhi with Agra were mainly due to tyre bursts.\nWith the increasing road fatalities in the country, the government is working to reduce accidents.\nIn 2014, 1.39 lakh people were killed in road accidents against 1.37 lakh in 2013. “If any accident occurred due to tyre bursts, then tyre makers should be held responsible,” said S P Singh, senior fellow of a transport research body, the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training (IFTRT).\nHe said IFTRT had recently written to the Consumer Affairs Ministry, seeking inclusion of a tyre recall mechanism in the new road safety bill proposed by the Union Ministry of Transport.\n“To protect consumers, the limits for rolling resistance of tyres in India for mandatory tyre recall mechanism should be brought in the country,” he said.\nThe US, Europe, Japan, South Korea and China have mandatory tyre recall mechanisms if any fault is found in tyres, whereas India does not have any such rule yet, he added.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T06:32:56.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
