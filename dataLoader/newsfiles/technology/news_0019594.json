The new hardware line up comes with the latest v8.0 software that simplifies load-balancing management, coupled with PCI compliance and enabling a smooth migration to cloud-based services such as AWS or Azure.\n“Customers wanted more performance and upgrading our entry level product that is capable of 3,671 SSL TPS satisfies that need. In fact, the vast majority of businesses will probably need nothing more,” says Malcolm Turnbull, CEO, Loadbalancer.org Inc. “Having the ability to address 5 VIPs with each serving a cluster of 4 servers with unrestricted performance means only the largest of enterprises would require an upgraded license.”\nFor customers, with an outward facing web-based business, then the Enterprise R20 is the fastest way to scale their web site by simply placing the load balancer between their firewall and web servers. All web requests are handled by the load balancer and dispatched to individual web servers based on the scheduling algorithm selected. If any web server fails a ‘health check’ it is immediately taken out of the cluster so that the company’s customers are not affected.\n“Whatever way you look at it, Loadbalancer.org, Inc. offers far better value than other leading names in the load balancing market. Our new base model provides more throughput per dollar than competitors higher end models,” states Malcolm Turnbull. “Where most of our competitors will limit the throughput and in some cases even the feature set of their low-end models, our philosophy has always been to offer fully featured solutions with maximum performance.”\nThe Enterprise R20 is a fully featured load balancer with outstanding performance at a remarkable price point.\nHardware platform:\n 4 x 10/100/1000Mbps auto negotiation Ethernet ports Full duplex support at 10, 100 and 1,000Mbps 100% SSD storage 8GB DDR RAM Quad core Intel Xeon\nPrice: $2995-00\nThe new entry-level appliance is priced in line with the recently announced major re-pricing of its hardware range – reductions of up to 43%, making the choice easier for enterprise customers.\n The ENTERPRISE MAX has been reduced by 38% (to $4,995 from $7,995)* The ENTERPRISE 10G has been reduced by 43% (to $6,995 from $11,995)* The ENTERPRISE R320 has been reduced by 20% (to $12,495 from $15,995)*\n*Global pricing reflect similar savings\nThe new R20 completes the company’s initial steps in ‘responding to the market’ over the last 3 months which has seen price restructuring, major v8.0 software release and a brand new customer facing website.\nABOUT THE ENTERPRISE R20\nThe full R20 data sheet can be viewed or downloaded here:\nhttp://pdfs.loadbalancer.org/datasheets/enterprise-r20-datasheet.pdf\nABOUT LOADBALANCER.ORG\nLoadbalancer.org Inc. leads the industry in delivering high-performance load balancing solutions directly to customers around the world backed by unequalled customer support.
