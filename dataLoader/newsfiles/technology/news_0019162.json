Serious Games founder Simon Egenfeldt-Nielsen took to Twitter to defend ”Slave Trade” against the controversy before deleting his account Tuesday. He could not be immediately reached for comment.\n”Slave Trade,” which is intended to teach children ages 11 to 14 about slavery in the 18th century, casts players for most of the game as a young slave steward named Putij, who serves on a ship crossing the Atlantic Ocean.\nWhile the ”Tetris”-like slave-stacking level has been excised from the game, a talking mouse character who guides players still says at one point: ”Slave traders didn’t look upon slaves as people but as a product. They therefore stacked the slaves on top of each other to get as many as possible shipped.”\nOther titles in the Serious Games’ ”Playing History” series include ”Playing History: Vikings” and ”Playing History: The Plague.”\n 03, 2015 9:00 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T04:45:30.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
