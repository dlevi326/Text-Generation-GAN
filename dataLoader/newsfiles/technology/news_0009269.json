The next level of people analytics solutions are most likely to come from HR software vendors, which increasingly are able to provide predictive solutions out of the box.” \nTo enable HR teams to act on the predictive power of the employee data they already gather, the latest enhancements to UltiPro’s set of predictive analytics — which include the UltiPro Retention Predictor™, the UltiPro High Performer Predictor™, and the UltiPro High Performer Indicator™— include a new visual dashboard that can help leaders quickly spot their future top performers and recognize if they are at risk of losing top talent. \n“Our UltiPro Summer 2015 release focuses on empowering our customers through data and analytics,” said Adam Rogers, chief technology officer for Ultimate. “With UltiPro’s Predictive Analytics Dashboard, customers have an at-a-glance view of their employees’ performance and retention risk. From there, leaders and managers can make data-driven decisions regarding their talent strategies, which can result in lower turnover and even higher performance.” \nUltiPro’s Predictive Analytics Dashboard includes visual indicators such as: High-, medium-, and low-retention-risk groups, based on the UltiPro Retention Predictor analytics High performers by retention risk Termination rates of the workforce as a whole, in comparison with the termination rates of high performers, and more \n“Building a better environment to attract and retain talent starts with having visibility into your workforce as it stands today and what’s likely to happen in the future. Our Predictive Analytics Dashboard empowers customers with easy-to-understand visual gauges of the top talent in the organization and future flight risks,” said Rogers. “Ultimate is continuously evolving the scope of UltiPro’s analytics to help our customers build the people-centric environments they need to grow and succeed.” \nMany Ultimate customers are already using UltiPro’s predictive analytics to forecast employee performance and flight risk, and assist managers in taking action to grow and retain high-potential talent. \n“We are excited about Ultimate’s predictive tools and their promising role in workforce planning and the talent assessment processes at INTRUST Bank,” said Jill Beckman, division director of people services at INTRUST Bank. “We are currently partnering with Ultimate to better understand the analytics and how to best integrate them in our processes, as well as understand and utilize the new Predictive Analytics Dashboard.” \nExpanded Configurability \nThe Summer 2015 release also adds enhanced configurability that focuses on allowing customers to more easily tailor the UltiPro solution to their business requirements through an engaging and intuitive end-user experience. New features include: Expanded workflow configurability and simplified configuration capabilities for common changes such as field-label changes New “Value Rules Engine” that gives customers the ability to auto-populate data in one field based on the value in another field in the system — for example, automatically populating the department an employee works in based on his or her office location Faster tools for mass data updates Enhanced ability to more easily create and manage integrations to other business systems with the new intuitive graphical design of UltiPro’s Integration Studio \n“More than 1,000 Ultimate customers are leveraging UltiPro’s configurability options and have created more than 60,000 configurations to address business-specific data, field labels, workflows, page layouts, and more,” said Rogers. “Because Ultimate believes in simplifying work to renew and increase engagement, we enable our customers to achieve a highly tailored solution through configuration. We are strengthening UltiPro’s configurability with every release so that UltiPro can fit our customers—not the other way around.” \nPartner News \nUltimate continues to grow its partner ecosystem to give customers options to leverage complimentary products and services.
