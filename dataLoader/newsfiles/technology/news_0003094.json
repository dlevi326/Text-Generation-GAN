Pic: File Share by email A prosthetic hand wired directly to the brain has allowed a paralysed man to \"feel\". \nIt is the first time a person has been able to feel physical sensations through a prosthetic device. \nThe technology is so advanced the 28-year-old man could even identify which mechanical finger was being gently touched. \nThe system was designed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is part of the US Department of Defense. \nProgramme manager Justin Sanchez said: \"We've completed the circuit.
