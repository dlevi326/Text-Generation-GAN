The vessel suffered severe fire damage after a fire incident while berthed in a shipbuilding area for routine maintenance and repair. \nThe vehicle deck of HIGHSPEED 5 will be upgraded by installing rapid access composite (RAC) while the engine rooms will be structurally fire protected with rapid access stainless (RAS). CBG's panelised RAC and RAS system will deliver the most advanced and integral passive fire safety while saving up to 70% weight when compared with the previously installed SFP. \nThe upgrade will take place at Fincantieri's shipyard in Trieste, Italy. \nImage: The HIGHSPEED 5 vessel receiving fire protection from CBG Systems.
