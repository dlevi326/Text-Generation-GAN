It will benefit nearly 29 lakh consumers in suburbs. \"Complaints will be tracked real-time on the app. The moment you log in a complaint for a power-cut or any electricity related grievance, you will be instantly given a complaint number and also the expected time of restoration/resolving the issue,\" said Reliance Energy CEO R R Mehta. \"Consumer convenience is our focus. And, these days, many users own a smartphone. So they will be able to connect us through this app. Any application - from changing your name on the bill or address to complaints on faulty billing -can be routed through the citizen-friendly app. It will save you the trouble of walking to our office and interacting with our staff. \"Also, our customer care people have been instructed to go through all the complaints/queries/suggestions sent by users on the app and provide solutions on a priority,\" he stated. You can also pay bills through the quick pay gateway. \"An unique feature of the app is the consumption pattern report for past one year with meter readings, the billing details/bill amount for past six months at the flick of a key and bill comparison graphs - which give you a fair idea of your domestic power consumption,\" Mehta said. The app is also linked to social media plug-ins and live twitter feed. It can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Reliance Energy CEO,Reliance Energy,Reliance app Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T14:17:30.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
