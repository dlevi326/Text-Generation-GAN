MONROE, La. -- \nTECH BY 20 will hold its next technology event Tuesday, September 29 from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm at the CenturyLink Technology Center of Excellence, 100 CenturyLink Drive, Monroe, LA. \nThe meeting, entitled \"Cyber Security - a 360 Degree View,\" will feature top IT security leaders. \nThe event is free and open to the public. \nSpeakers include John Knies, CenturyLink chief information security officer; Joshua Tannehill, CenturyLink senior information security engineer and founder of the NELA InfoSec group; and Todd Trimble, IBM security architect. \nThe increased need for talent with various technology skills has been driven by growth in our technology sector from companies moving into or expanding in North Louisiana. \nStrong business recruitment efforts by state, regional and local economic development organizations and attractive incentives have brought new technology companies to the region. \nIn response to this growing need for knowledge workers, K-12 and higher education partners are developing new technology curricula. \nOne such academic program is Louisiana Tech Universityâ€™s first-in-the-nation Bachelor of Science degree in Cyber Engineering. \nUniversity of Louisiana at Monroe offers Accounting, Computer Information Systems, Computer Science, and Finance programs geared toward equipping students with technology skills in order to support regional employers. \n\n\nCopyright 2015 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
