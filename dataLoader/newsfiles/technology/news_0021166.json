The most important is a larger, sharper screen that lets the device be read from across the room — no more getting up to check what the current or desired temperature is. It'll even turn on when you walk in the room and show what it's set at — or, if you prefer, a clock face. The device itself is a bit thinner, too.\nNest There's also a new furnace-monitoring feature: Nest watches how the furnace shuts down and starts up, and alerts you if there appears to be a problem. No one wants to get stuck with a busted furnace just as winter descends. This feature, while making its debut on this new third-generation Nest, will also come to the earlier versions soon with a software update.\nRelated: Butterfleye Smart Security Cam Recognizes Pets and Faces\nadvertisement The new version will, like its predecessor, cost $249. That predecessor, however, will cost $199 until supplies run out, so if you can live without the latest model you can save a bit of cash.", "external_links": ["https://nest.com/blog/2015/09/01/meet-the-3rd-generation-nest-learning-thermostat/", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1202072/nest_v3_b553fa11f5eb1955dfb6f3c5456def0c.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://nbcnews.to/1O66YuR", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1202072/nest_v3_b553fa11f5eb1955dfb6f3c5456def0c.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "http://www.newsvine.com/_api/discuss?u=http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/gadgets/new-nest-thermostat-bumps-display-size-adds-furnace-check-n419662&h=New", "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1202087/heads_up_896d20ca81b8f4f4a1574cb602062224.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://nbcnews.to/1O66YuR", "http://nbcnews.to/1O66YuR&via=nbcnews", "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1202087/heads_up_896d20ca81b8f4f4a1574cb602062224.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "https://twitter.com/share?text=New", "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1202087/heads_up_896d20ca81b8f4f4a1574cb602062224.nbcnews-ux-320-320.jpg", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1202072/nest_v3_b553fa11f5eb1955dfb6f3c5456def0c.nbcnews-ux-600-480.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-01T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T21:38:56.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
