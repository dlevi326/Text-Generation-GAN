PSC also made three acquisitions, most recently of the TechAmerica Foundation. \nSoloway is a two-time winner of FCW's Federal 100 Award, and in 2013 was the recipient of GCN's IT Executive of the Year award . He has been active participant in the discussions surrounding acquisition reform , government mandates for contractors and efforts to build more IT development capacity within agencies themselves . \nPSC Executive Committee member and IBM General Manager Anne Altman will lead the search for Soloway's successor, according to Ellen Glover, executive vice president of ICF International and chair of the PSC board of directors. \nIn an email message to PSC membership, Soloway said he has been working with Glover and Vice Chair John Goodman for several months to plan for an effective, smooth transition. \"While I am not yet certain what my next step will be, I do plan to remain fully engaged in this exciting and important industry,\" he wrote.
