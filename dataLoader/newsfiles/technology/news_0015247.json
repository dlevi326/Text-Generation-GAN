Available in over 100 countries, TRACE Sport Stars is the first channel exclusively dedicated to sports celebrities. It claims to offer 'unique' behind-the-scenes access to athletes, offering 'an intimate and in-depth understanding' of their lives. \nTRACE had previously commissioned Inverleigh to produce original programming over the past three years, spawning the successful National Icons and Football Stars formats, broadcast on the TRACE Sport Stars channels in more than 100 countries. \nIn addition to this production partnership, TRACE has appointed DSI by Inverleigh as its exclusive worldwide distribution partner to represent TRACE Sport Stars' programming catalogue for broadcast acquisition over the next four years. \n\"Broadcasters have recognised the appeal of sport entertainment making it an increasingly important component of schedules over the past 12-24 months,\" noted Inverleigh director, Matt Whytcross. \"TRACE and Inverleigh have, in parallel, been pioneers in this genre which makes this alliance a natural progression in a long-term association.\" \nAdded TRACE Sport Stars CEO Laurent Dumeau: \"We are delighted to renew our production partnership with Inverleigh, following a successful three-year collaboration ... having an extensive knowledge of our channel and its catalogue, and numerous years' experience in production and content commercialisation, I'm confident that Inverleigh is the relevant partner to succeed.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T19:18:39.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
