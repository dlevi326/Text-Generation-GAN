She praised Pope Francis, who has called on all Catholic parishes and religious communities to welcome in the migrants.\n\"The whole world has to take some responsibility,\" Clinton said.\nIn her interview with AP, Clinton said - as she has often in recent weeks - that it would have been a \"better choice\" for her to use separate email accounts for her personal and public business during her tenure as President Barack Obama's first secretary of state. \"I've also tried to not only take responsibility, because it was my decision, but to be as transparent as possible,\" Clinton said.\nClinton also said the issue has not damaged her campaign, but is a \"distraction, certainly.\"\n\"But it hasn't in any way affected the plan for our campaign, the efforts we're making to organize here in Iowa and elsewhere in the country,\" Clinton said. \"And I still feel very confident about the organization and the message that my campaign is putting out.\"\nOn Friday, she did not apologize for using a private email system when asked directly by NBC, \"Are you sorry?\" Asked Monday by the AP why she won't directly apologize, Clinton said: \"What I did was allowed. It was allowed by the State Department. The State Department has confirmed that.\n\"I did not send or receive any information marked classified,\" Clinton said. \"I take the responsibilities of handling classified materials very seriously and did so.\"\nLast year, Clinton turned over roughly 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department that she sent and received using a home-brew email server set up at her home in suburban New York while serving as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.\nClinton has said she set up her own system instead of using a State Department account for the convenience of using a single hand-held email device.\nThe State Department is reviewing and publicly releasing those emails, some showing that Clinton received messages that were later determined to contain classified information. Some of those regarded the production and dissemination of U.S. intelligence.\n\"There is always a debate among different agencies about what something should be retroactively (marked classified),\" Clinton told the AP on Monday. \"But at the time, there were none. So I'm going to keep answering the questions and providing the facts so that people can understand better what happened.\"\n___\nFollow Catherine Lucey on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/catherine_lucey\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
