Matthew Stock   \nPeugeot showcases their new concept car at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The Peugeot Fractal is an electric urban coup√© that puts sound at the forefront of the driving experience... something Peugeot believes has been missing from electric cars. (SOUNDBITE) (English) MATTHIAS HOSSANN, HEAD OF PEUGEOT CONCEPT CARS, SAYING: \"It's an exploration of what could be an electric car in the future for Peugeot. And based on that there is work on which kind of emotion can provide an electric car, because basically electric cars do not provide any sound and sound previously was a big part of the car experience.\" The cabin interior is 80 percent 3D printed and lined with hundreds of these protruding shapes that absorb road noise and direct sound around the cabin. (SOUNDBITE) (English) GILLES VIDAL, DIRECTOR OF PEUGEOT DESIGN, SAYING: \"The way we produced those shapes was partly designed by designers but produced by an equation that is parametric design basically, or parametric modelling. You tell the computer that's where the sound comes from and we want to cancel it... And those shapes are super complicated; you can't actually mould them in plastic and then un-mould them, they are so intricate somehow.\" New safety requirements mean electric and hybrid cars will soon have to make some sort of sound to warn pedestrians and cyclists. As well as a unique interior sound design, the Peugeot Fractal has an exterior sound which varies depending on the speed the vehicle is moving at. The Peugeot Fractal as it is now won't be released commercially - but could inspire the carmakers' future models. (SOUNDBITE) (English) GILLES VIDAL, DIRECTOR OF PEUGEOT DESIGN, SAYING: \"Many, many subjects that we want to push forward in the future for our production cars which we study through a concept car like this. But the global proportions, the shape is a bit too caricature for production - even though as a designer I would love to drive it every day.\" It's powered by a lithium-ion battery with a range of about 280 miles, and goes from 0 to 62 miles per hour in 6.8 seconds.  //reut.rs/1KWb0IY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T01:16:26.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
