It clearly demonstrates that the aesthetics of solar are improving and I'm confident that our customers will be amazed by this new system.\" \nIntecto solar tiles have been developed to enable architects, housebuilders and roofing contractors to provide an effective rooftop PV solution with a conventional appearance without any compromise in solar power production. \nThey are also appropriate for use in heritage and green-belt areas, where the requirement is for rooftop solar PV systems that maintain the integrity of individual buildings and their local environment. \nAvailable in black, grey, and terracotta colours, the new range is fully IEC and MCS certified and complies with other international and European building industry regulations and roofing performance standards. \nRomag is a leading UK bespoke glass and solar manufacturing company has been a pioneer in the development of building integrated photovoltaic solutions. The company's braid range of BIPV products includes skylights, facades, windows, curtain walling, brise soleil, parking canopies, covered walkways and roof lights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:42:34.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
