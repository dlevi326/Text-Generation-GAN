Users can zoom into the map to a specific location or enter a place name or postcode, to receive data on the coverage for each mobile network.\nThe map uses data provided by EE, O2, Three and Vodafone. All other mobile operators in the country provide their services over one of these networks, as these are the four main network operators in the UK. A True Telecom SIM provides mobile data over the Vodafone network; this means that customers are able to check their coverage on the map with ease.\nRecently True Telecom launched a range of 4G SIM only plans, ideal for customers who might want to keep their existing phone but add a bundle of 4G data, minutes and texts. Unlike many competitor deals available on the high street, each True Telecom tariff comes with 4G as standard, ensuring that customers receive the best network service available to them anytime, anywhere.\nStuart Griffiths, CEO of True Telecom commented. “True Telecom offers to customer’s fantastic value 4G data deals, so we find Ofcom’s Mobile Coverage Checker a fantastic way of promoting competition between mobile operators.”\nOfcom is inviting users to check their coverage experience and leave feedback, which will help refine and improve the tool.\nFind out the mobile coverage in your area: www.ofcom.org.uk/mobile-coverage?utm_source=updates&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mobile-coverage-checker-launch\nFind out more about True Telecom SIM only tariffs: www.true-telecom.com/mobile-and-tablets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T01:24:10.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
