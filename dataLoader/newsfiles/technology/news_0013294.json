So when an application that makes me stand up and take note comes along it must be shared! \nA video posted by Graphics Systems Corporation , a Stratasys reseller, outlines an application for 3D printing I had not come across; the 3D printing of mistake proof fixtures in order to get the visually impaired into work. \nWe’ve seen a number of applications dedicated to accessibility, items like Robohand, or self-created assistive design pieces from Hereward College but this particular case is a mixture of the MyMiniFactory story of 3D printing illustrations from children’s books and the Todd Grimm column on 3D printing of the mundane . \nUsing Poka-Yoke - the Japanese term for mistake proofing - the engineers at the Milwaukee-based social enterprise, Beyond Vision , are modelling and 3D printing blind-friendly fixtures for assemblies that mean the operator can only place the component in the correct way. This allows a visually impaired person to perform jobs previously not available to them. \n“We’ve taken the poka-yoke theory to a different level.” – Jim Kerlin, President & CEO, Beyond Vision. \nBy 3D printing the poka-yoke fixtures using Stratasys FDM technologies Beyond Vision has increased productivity at Beyond Vision by 20%. They are not stopping there with the 3D printing of mistake proof fixtures either, the company also produce the fire exit routes on a printer to show their employees the correct escape routes. \n“We’re all about creating job opportunities for people who are blind and I’d love to see a day when we’re doing enough 3D printing for ourselves and for other companies to create a blind job, or two, or three, and turn this into another way that we can extend our mission.” – Jim Kerlin, President & CEO, Beyond Vision.
