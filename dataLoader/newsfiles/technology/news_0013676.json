For the first time ever, a transparent image sensor b ased on optical TFT technology combine s the fingerprint capture area with the user display for instructions and real-time feedback . L IVETOUCH conquers the limitations of previous systems and re defines user friendliness for capturing fingerprint s .  \n\"LIVETOUCH quattro\" is fully two thirds smaller than conventional devices and is the first device fully certified to the FBI standard for Mobile ID FAP 60. The graphical display beneath the sensor is used for both illuminating the capture area as well as for displaying the user instructions. That way, prisms, lenses and mirrors used in traditional fingerprint scanners become obsolete.\n\"The LIVETOUCH ® technology opens up new possibilities for capturing biometric features. Finally we are able to combine the highest image quality requirements with incredibly simple operation. Our customers not only save time and money, but they also increase the public acceptance of using fingerprint systems\", says Roberto Wolfer , one of the founders and CEOs of JENETRIC GmbH.\nThe very close proximity of the finger and the image sensor improves the image contrast significantly. The \"LIVETOUCH quattro\" achieves an excellent image quality going clearly beyond the strict FBI requirements. Being able to show graphical elements, animations or movies on the integrated display avoids errors due to incorrect positioning of fingers and makes the product an ideal solution for self-service terminals.\nJENETRIC is pleased to announce the introduction of the \"LIVETOUCH quattro\" at the Global Identity Summit in Tampa, Florida where it will be on display and available for live demonstration. \"LIVETOUCH quattro\" is the first of a family of products that will be based on the LIVETOUCH Technology, a new way for the collection of biometric identifiers.\n\nYou can find the JENETRIC GmbH in Tampa Convention Center at booth no. 501\nJENETRIC GmbH was founded in 2014 in Jena , Germany - a location famous for cutting-edge optical technology - by engineers with significant experience in fingerprint technology and special focus on the development of biometric systems . The multidisciplinary team includes hardware and software specialists as well as production and sales professionals . The company is financed by internal ownership , a business angel and by the \" Thuringian Gründerfond \" as well as by the \" High-Tech Gründerfonds \" . The company follows a holistic approach in its product development with a clear and strong focus on customer requirements and with the ambitious goal of enhancing living and working conditions by using biometric systems .  \nContact:\n\nRoberto Wolfer , Geschäftsführer/CEO\nJENETRIC GmbH\nT: +49-3641-3219955\nM: +49-172-3652272\nE-mail: r.wolfer@jenetric.de \n\n\nSOURCE Jenetric GmbH", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:09:26.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
