[...] Toyota envisions cars becoming gradually smarter and more independent of humans as its own engineers and the research centers at Stanford and MIT discover breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and robotics. If the goals are realized, Toyota might be able to build a car \"incapable of getting into a collision,\" said Daniela Rus, the MIT professor who will lead the university's research partnership with the automaker. Besides working on recognition technology, the Stanford research center will try to create artificial intelligence programs that can predict behavior patterns so cars can quickly adjust to potentially dangerous situations.
