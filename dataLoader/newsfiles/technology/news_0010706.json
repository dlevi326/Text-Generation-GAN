The statement said this was done “to ensure that the organisation becomes stable” and was “without a doubt, in the best interests of the organisation”.\nMkhize was suspended in December 2014 pending an investigation into his role in the implementation of a new organisational structure that has subsequently been reversed. The wildlife body was expected to begin with hearings into Mkhize’s conduct in August.", "external_links": ["http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=505403", "http://whoswho.co.za/mike-mabuyakhulu-505403"], "published": "2015-09-18T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T12:05:37.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
