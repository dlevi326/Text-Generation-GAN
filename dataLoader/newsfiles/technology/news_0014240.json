It “talks” to traffic lights and other vehicles. \nThe teardrop-shaped spaceship on wheels is what German maker Mercedes-Benz believes autonomous cars will look like in 2030 and beyond. \nUnveiled overnight ahead of this year’s Frankfurt motor show, Europe’s biggest automotive expo, the concept car has reignited debate about how much control should be taken away from drivers. The future ... Mercedes-Benz has unveils the car that “talks” to traffic lights and other vehicles. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nAcross town, the global boss of General Motors, Mary Barra , one of the car industry’s most vocal advocates for autonomous vehicles, told international media: “There are a lot of aspects that need to be solved (with autonomous cars) but I think the journey is worth going on because we know it fundamentally creates safer vehicles and reduces congestion which therefore improves the environment.” German maker ... Mercedes-Benz believes autonomous cars will look like this in 2030 and beyond. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nThe Mercedes show car has petrol-electric hybrid power and can drive 66km on electricity alone. \nBut the experimental vehicle was primarily designed to showcase advances in car-to-car and car-to-infrastructure technology. \nMost of the world’s car makers — and tech companies Google and Apple — are developing autonomous vehicle technology. \nEarlier this year Audi demonstrated its driver assistance systems being tested in busy and unpredictable traffic in China. Touch-based operating philosophy ... adjustable panels at the front and rear of the Mercedes move into position at 80km/h to reduce resistance through the air. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nLate last year, Mercedes-Benz allowed media to ride in the back seat of an autonomous car in Silicon Valley — where it narrowly avoided a collision. \nTwo years ago Volvo showed a car that parks itself — without anyone behind the wheel — with the tap of an icon on a smartphone. \nThe other technical feat of the latest Mercedes show car is how easily it slips through the air at cruising speeds. \nDespite being as long and wide as a Holden Caprice limousine, the Mercedes concept has the same aerodynamic rating (for the tech heads: 0.19Cd) as the bubble-shaped General Motors EV1 electric car from the late 1990s. Aerodynamic ... this Mercedes is a long way from becoming a showroom reality. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nAdjustable panels at the front and rear of the Mercedes move into position at 80km/h to reduce resistance through the air, and therefore reduce fuel consumption. \nFor all its hi-tech gadgetry, however, this Mercedes is a long way from becoming a showroom reality. \nThere isn’t even anywhere to fit a registration plate. \nThis reporter is on Twitter: @JoshuaDowling", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T23:24:30.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
