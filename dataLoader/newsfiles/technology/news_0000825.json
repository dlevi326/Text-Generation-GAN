Mr. Nadella later said he was \"inarticulate\" in his comments, and that the tech industry needed to close the pay gap for women so they aren't forced to press for raises.\nIn general, the role of women in technology has become a flash point for controversy. Workforce composition disclosures by major tech companies, including Microsoft, have shown relatively low percentages of women, particularly in technical roles.\nThe gender discrimination lawsuit filed by Ellen Pao against venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers also pushed into the headlines allegations of sexism in Silicon Valley. However, Ms. Pao's loss in the court system shows how hard these cases can be to prove.\nAccording to the Microsoft lawsuit, Ms. Moussouris was employed at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., from April 2007 to May 2014 as a security program manager in the trustworthy computing group. The lawsuit alleged that Ms. Moussouris routinely received lower performance ratings than male peers despite performing better.\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, also accused a male supervisor of retaliating against Ms. Moussouris by assigning her a low bonus after she accused him of sexually harassing women in her department. According to the lawsuit, Microsoft concluded that he had been sexually harassing female employees after investigating the accusation.\nThe lawsuit seeks back pay and monetary damages among other penalties on behalf of Ms. Moussouris and a class defined as all female technical employees employed by Microsoft in the U.S. from Sept 16, 2009, to the present.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com\n 16, 2015 17:04 ET (21:04 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T03:17:37.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
