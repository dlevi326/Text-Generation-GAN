Picture: Jim Young \nNew York - Hewlett-Packard said on Tuesday its upcoming corporate split will lead to job losses of 25 000 to 30 000. \nThe losses are seen as the US tech giant splits into two separate units, one with a focus on personal computers and printers, and the other on software and enterprise services. \nThe new enterprise unit is seeking $2 billion in annual cost reductions, according to the outlook provided to analysts, plus $700 million in savings related to the spinoff. \n“These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split. \n“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business,” said Whitman. \n“As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.” \nThe new company will focus on cloud computing, servers, storage, networking and other technology services, with the other unit keeping the personal computer and printer operations. \nHewlett Packard Enterprise will have more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering unrivaled integrated technology solutions” to companies, according to a company statement. \nThe split, set to be completed by the end of the fiscal year in late October, will take place as a tax-free distribution of shares to HP's stockholders. \nIt breaks up a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electric equipment, and whose Palo Alto garage has been dubbed “the birthplace of Silicon Valley.” \nHP has been undergoing a massive re-organisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices. \nThe move by Hewlett-Packard, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms, is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tightly focused firms perform better. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:21:20.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
