The federal program now offers a second grant — known as Category 2 — every five years that assists public schools and libraries pay for things like firewalls, routers and wireless access points. \nE-rate also offers, and has offered for years, a Category 1 grant that helps schools and libraries pay for its basic bandwidth. \nDel-Com has hired a company to help the district with the grant application. \nTechnology Dynamics will evaluate the district’s current technology infrastructure and put together a project plan, Mann said Tuesday. The company will also write a request for proposal, which the district needs to apply for the grant. \nThe district is paying $9,980 from the Capital Project Fund to hire the technology consulting company to do the audit, money that won’t be returned to the fund even if Del-Com receives the grant. Mann said the grant money has to be put toward technology specifically. \nThe board approved the payment Tuesday night. \nAccording to its website, the majority of Technology Dynamics projects have been for schools and universities, including Purdue University, Indiana State University, Indianapolis Public Schools and Anderson Community Schools. \nMann had applied for the E-rate Category 2 grant while superintendent at Monroe Central Schools last year. \nBrent Headland, the technology director at Monroe Central, said he put together the request for proposal and project plan himself instead of using a company like Technology Dynamics. \nThe district was approved for the grant a few months ago and new equipment — including new switches, fiber optic lines and wireless access points — is on its way, Headland said. Headland’s proposal for $150,000 was approved and the grant is reimbursing the school 80 percent of its spending. \nMonroe Central already has a technology infrastructure that supports its 1:1 technology-to-student ratio. Headland said it was included in a 2008 building project, but hasn’t been updated since. Ideally, it should be updated every five years, he said. \nContact families & education reporter Emma Kate Fittes at 765-213-5845 and follow @EmmaKate_TSP 5 CONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tspne.ws/1KkHysE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:32:19.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
