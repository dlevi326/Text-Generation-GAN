Climate Interactive, a non-profit Washington based research organization, says its projections are based on the United Nations Convention on Climate Change. It said the figures would \"put the world on track for a global temperature increase of 3.5°C,\" lower than the 4.5°C projected increase if countries continue on their current track.\nClimate Interactive analyst Andrew Jones said with the current INDCs (intended nationally determined contributions) progress has been made, but the analysis showed with further action global warming could be held below a 2°C rise.\nOn Sunday, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said world leaders \"have expressed their resolve to finalize a durable, meaningful agreement\" at the upcoming United Nations climate change conference in Paris.\nEvery major country, except India, has submitted a plan for combating climate change ahead of the finalization of a global climate pact.\nU.S. President Barack Obama who spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly Monday thanked him for commitment to clean energy.\n\"We agree that this is a critical issue for the world, and all of us have responsibilities,\" said Obama. \"We are encouraged by the aggressive nature of President (sic) Modi's commitment to clean energy.\"\nModi said he and Obama \"share an uncompromising commitment on climate change.\" He added that the partnership with the United States is important to the world and the two could apply innovation and technology to combating the sustainable development goals, \"including combating climate change and conserving nature.\"\nThe United Nations wants countries to agree to stop temperatures from rising beyond 2°C from pre-industrial levels. Scientists have warned that the world could face catastrophic storms, floods, droughts and rising sea levels if temperatures rise much more than that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:13:30.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
