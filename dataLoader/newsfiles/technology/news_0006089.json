That announcement was made today at the opening of the September Radiology Business Management Association (RBMA) 2015 Fall Educational Conference . Demonstrations of the new product are available during the conference at FORE Support Services booth No. 500. \nIntroduced to the market just over 14 weeks ago at the RBMA 2015 Radiology Summit Conference , installations have grown rapidly. FORE Support Services President and CEO Mohammed M. Ahmed said that’s because AuthPal is the only solution proven to save time and money for imaging centers by automating the eligibility and prior authorization processes. \n“The formal June launch of AuthPal, a first-of-its-kind suite of automation tools, has been an overwhelming success. It represents a validation of the power of our breakthrough technology to address the costs and headaches associated with advanced imaging prior authorizations,” said Ahmed. “The response to AuthPal has been phenomenal, and we are receiving invaluable client feedback as our customer base continues to grow. Our team will add capabilities and enhancements on an ongoing basis to the standard product platform to meet the growing needs of the markets we serve.” \nAuthPal is the first in a suite of cloud-based automation services and tools being developed by FORE Support Services. The AuthPal software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution automates the prior authorization process. This drastically reduces the time it takes to process a procedure prior authorization request from days to just hours or minutes, eliminates costly denials and greatly reduces the amount of time staff spends on the phone or entering data on payer websites. \nFORE representatives are available September 27, 28 and 29 during regular exhibit hours to provide product demonstrations and answer questions at booth 500 in the Austin Grand Ballroom of the Hilton conference center.
