It was funded mostly by the federal government, which decided to de-fund the organisation in 2013.\nIn the lead-up to the election, the Coalition had proposed discontinuing, after June 30, 2015, direct commonwealth funding to NICTA to the tune of $42 million.\nThe 2014 budget also saw CSIRO’s funding cut by $115 million over four years.\nNICTA’s purpose was to “build capacity and strengthen investment in strategic information and communications technology research, and improve Australia’s ability to fully capture the productivity and transformational benefits that ICT capability can deliver”.\nThe federal government has been contacted for further comment.\nThis article was first published in The Australian Business Review.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/nicta-mergers-with-csiro-to-create-new-entity-data61/story-e6frgakx-1227502362282"], "published": "2015-08-28T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:19:51.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
