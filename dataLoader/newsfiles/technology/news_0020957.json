They used to use Bamboo and later metal tubes to project flames and shrapnel at their targets. It was only after it was adopted by the Europeans that guns as there are today became part of life.\nAccording to police minister Nathi Nhleko, over 2 356 guns were lost since 2012 to date. These are guns lost and never recovered. The reality is that all firearms started out as legal before they ended up in the hands of criminals. This number is totally unacceptable and is believed to be due to Fraud, corruption and poor implementation of the Firearms Control Act so that means people who are not fit to carry a gun, e.g. Due to mental instability or disqualifying violent history to name a few, are issued with firearm certificates, licences and permits. No wonder why there are six murders per day which is five times higher than the global average.\nIf now in 2015 we still have not solved this problem it means that what we have been doing all along is not working. If, for an example, a corrupt cop sells him gun to a criminal and then report it as lost. There are no repercussions for that so there is no deterrent against that so there is no reason why Mr Corrupt cop should not do the same thing again. If on the other hand the cop mentioned above loses it honestly there is no motivation for him to look for it.\nGiven the above, I think I have a possible solution.\nWe need to have guns which are for the police only. The bullets for these guys are not available anywhere. A tender is given to a manufacture to only make special guns that are for the police. Some piece of technology can be horned in to make it useless after it has been stolen. Alternatively, the gun can have a lock similar to the one in a briefcase that uses numbers. This locks functions like a safety pin and prevents the bullet from elevating to the chamber. If this is achieved, even if a former policeman, who is familiar with how the gun works, get hold of one he will only use the bullets found with the gun but once those run out he will not be able to get supplies. This will render the gun useless and nothing more than a toy but because it is a stolen item and also by virtue of being a police gun it still carries a crime to whoever is found with it.\nAll the bullets will be marked in codes. These will reveal a lot of information about the gun which fired it. The bullets themselves will be unique in such a way that just by looking at it you will know immediately that it is a police gun bullet.\nThis I hope will lead to a reduction in the illegal guns in circulation. I admit that it will not eradicate the problem completely but at least some crimes will be solved much quicker that they normally do.\n sources;\nhttp://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/cops-lost-2-356-guns-in-3-years-1.1857689#.VedBd2ccRLM\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_gunpowder", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_gunpowder", "http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/cops-lost-2-356-guns-in-3-years-1.1857689#.VedBd2ccRLM"], "published": "2015-09-03T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T10:51:45.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
