( mzl.la/1N7L9fC )\nMozilla said on Friday the hackers may have used information from Bugzilla to exploit a vulnerability that allowed them to search for sensitive files and upload them to a server.\nA version of Firefox, the world's second-largest browser by users, released on Aug. 27 fixed all the vulnerabilities the hacker learned about and could have used to harm its web browser users, the company said.\nBugzilla is an open-source tool used for tracking \"bugs\" or flaws in software that result in incorrect or unexpected results.\nWhile Bugzilla is mostly public, access to security sensitive information is restricted to certain trusted users.\nMozilla said it had conducted an investigation on the breach and notified relevant law enforcement authorities.\nRising cybersecurity threats and a jump in the number of reported incidents have led companies and governments to beef up their security platforms and software.\nSeveral high profile cyber attacks including those at Anthem Inc, one of the largest U.S. health insurers and retailer Target Corp have brought the issue of data security to the fore in recent years.
