Samsung Electronics Co. and Panasonic Corp. both showcased devices at the IFA, Europe's largest consumer electronics show, geared to helping people sleep better and wake up more refreshed.\nSamsung's Sleep Sense can be placed underneath the mattress at night, where it can monitor heartbeat, breathing and movements. Data are transmitted to a tablet, where they will be ready for analysis over breakfast, the head of Samsung's digital products, Yoon C. Lee, said.\nSleep Sense could also be connected to air conditioning, electronic window blinds or lights, allowing for room temperature and lights to be adapted depending on the user's physical condition.\nPanasonic showed similar prototypes that can measure sleep rhythm and time an alarm to gently ease the user awake during a period of light snoozing, rather than giving a sudden jolt from a deep slumber.\nThe device can be linked to air conditioning and, if it is connected to a coffee machine, the user can be greeted with the smell of fresh coffee in the morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T23:03:33.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
