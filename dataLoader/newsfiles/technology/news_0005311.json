Output per hour is still around 1 percent lower than its level in early 2008, before Britain tipped into recession.\nThe Bank of England is keeping a close eye on wage growth as it mulls the first rate hike in over seven years. The ongoing productivity puzzle could cast doubt over the central bank's ability to gauge the speed with which pay will rise.
