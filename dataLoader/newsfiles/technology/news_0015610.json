Perception Neuron returns to the Bay Area for the third time this year after their last appearances at GDC San Francisco in March and SVVR and Maker Faire in May, and where they were able to meet with fans of their revolutionary product that’s been creating a buzz around the virtual reality world since its debut. This time, the Perception Neuron team will be taking part in TechCrunch Disrupt , where they will be engaging with members of the media and the newest startups introducing their cutting-edge technology.\nThe conference welcomes a series of speakers from various tech companies throughout the event. Perception Neuron will be in the exhibition area, where they will be introducing their new virtual camera component.\n“The response to Perception Neuron since our Kickstarter launch last September has been nothing less than remarkable,” says Tristan Dai, CTO of Noitom and developer of Perception Neuron. “We couldn’t be happier with the response we have received from professionals throughout the industry who want to work with Perception Neuron. Coming to an event like TechCrunch Disrupt really solidifies our place in the emerging technology field. We have been in the process of developing new concepts for both our hardware and software and being here gives us the opportunity to share these new ideas with some of the industry’s leading experts.”\nOne of the new concepts Perception Neuron is excited to share with their users, industry partners and media is their Virtual Camera experience which allows users to see an actor wearing a full body Perception Neuron setup through a tablet in a virtual environment in real-time. The virtual camera is an early development concept for a product slated for release in Q3 of 2016.\nAlthough live demos will not be possible at the conference due to space constraints, the Perception Neuron team will be available to answer questions and to provide attendees with information about their full-body, wireless, motion capture system, which is one of the most affordable systems of its kind on the market.\n“This is a very exciting time for us,” says Roch Nakajima, Americas Marketing Director for Noitom Ltd. “Now that our product is out there and we get to see the different ways in which people are using the technology, it gives us more to share with the industry professionals who attend events like TechCrunch Disrupt. This is an excellent opportunity for us to introduce the product to a whole new set of influential media and industry leaders.”\nPerception Neuron is the world’s only adaptive and affordable full-body, wireless motion capture system. Designed to deliver professional results right out of the box, the system can be used for a variety of applications from VFX and gaming, to sports and medicine.\nPerception Neuron is currently available for pre-order on their online store.
