This incredible company is connecting surgeons to the patients they deserve and connecting patients to surgeons that are informed. Their goal is to create the Healthcare people deserve with a network of the Best Surgeons and Ambulatory Surgery Centers for the public to access from any computer. This service is subscription based for the providers, for those that qualify. Access to the website for consumers is at no cost. Most of the Providers will have a cash price for surgeries; some will have Insurance contracts while others are out-of-network.\nThe Exclusive Surgeries Network wants to encourage the doctor, patient relationship to develop. On the website, there will be a separate area for Surgeons to log-in and take advantage of a buyers group. The idea behind this buyers club is to make it possible for the small ASC's to have the same cost for supplies as the larger ASC's it's hard to have transparency in pricing when the fixed costs are not controlled. However, before this network can help people, Exclusive Surgeries Network needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $350,000 by October 31, 2015. The funds raised will go towards website development, hiring and training sales teams in Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Dallas.\nTo help bring this innovative network to life, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered by November 2015.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help Exclusive Surgeries Network reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: Suzanne Webb\nTitle: CEO\nPhone: 1-602-761-0250\nemail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
