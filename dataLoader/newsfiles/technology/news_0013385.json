This technology is implemented in civil and criminal court cases along with different other private organizations for internal investigations. Moreover, digital forensics has become a key asset in addressing employee theft, particularly in banking, defense, and IT industries. In addition, these devices are used for mobile data recovery and crimes related to cloud computing. With the continuous advancements in forensic technology, investigators are able to collect and analyze clear and accurate data across multiple devices. The global digital forensics market has been segmented on the basis of types and industry uses. A cross sectional study of the global digital forensics market across four major geographical segments has also been covered under the purview of the report.Growing cyber crimes coupled with rising safety concern have led to a rise in the implementation of digital forensic tools in various industries. Digital forensic technology plays an integral role in preventing internet related crimes and misuse of company data. Moreover, cyber crime is accelerating at an alarming rate and digital forensics acts as an essential element that has the power to encumber the progress of such criminals. Due to increasing security concerns across different verticals, such as law enforcement, defense, banking, health care, information technology, education, and logistics, among others, the market for digital forensics is witnessing substantial growth currently. In addition, due to rapid advancements in forensic technology, such as the ability to recover complex data from electronic devices, fingerprint recovery from metals, and DNA profiling, prices of forensic tools have reduced, which in turn has increased the affordability of forensic applications along with their market penetration. Considering all these factors, the global digital forensics market is expected to grow at a potential rate during the forecast period from 2015 to 2021. In the near future, with developments in digital forensic research, digital forensic tools would be further used in health care, education, transport, and other application areas. Moreover, forensic tools would find potential applications in mobile data recovery and crimes related to cloud computing. This would lead to more efficient and better coordinated detection, analysis, and presentation of data in courts of law. In order to cater to the needs of digital forensics, companies are coming up with new innovative products that can effectively collect, preserve, analyze, and present evidence obtained from digital sources. Furthermore, new players with advanced systems that come with better reliability and accuracy are likely to emerge in the market, in order to meet the challenging technical aspects along with judicial and legal issues.
