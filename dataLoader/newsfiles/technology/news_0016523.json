Today they have launched Speech Buddies Connect, an online marketplace for speech therapy that matches parents with some of the best speech therapists in Brooklyn.\nSan Francisco, CA (PRWEB) September 08, 2015\nSpeech Buddies announced today the launch of Speech Buddies Connect, the first online marketplace for parents to find and book appointments with local speech professionals. The service will initially be offered in Brooklyn, New York but the company projects it will be available in multiple cities in 2016.\nSpeech Buddies Connect helps parents find a speech therapist that fits their individual needs. Some families may seek a bi-lingual speech professional while others may want someone who focuses on special needs. Once they find a match, Speech Buddies Connect sends the speech professional to the family’s home to work with their child. All speech-language pathologists are fully licenced and handpicked during the company's rigorous interview and screening process. Parents can choose to schedule appointments at convenient times, including nights and weekends.\n10% of school-aged children will face a speech challenge, yet many parents are confused about how and when to seek treatment. “We created Speech Buddies Connect to change access to speech therapy for millions of children around the country. We continually hear that finding the right speech therapist is confusing and parents often spend months on waiting lists before being seen. Our goal is to provide better access to care and to get children into and out of therapy as quickly and effectively as possible,” said Adrienne Penake, Speech Buddies CEO.\nGordy Rogers, M.S., CCC-SLP, Speech Buddies co-founder and owner of Brooklyn Speech Solutions explains, “If kids don’t get treatment for speech impediments while they are young, they become more difficult to fix. Large or small, speech and language challenges hinder a child’s social and academic development. The biggest mistake I see parents making is waiting too long to start speech therapy. Most kids I work with are very aware that they sound different than other kids—if a child is in 2nd grade and can’t say the ‘r’ sound, that’s already impacting their development. Speech Buddies Connect will dramatically improve the way parents find speech therapy for their child.”\nWith the rise of similar on-demand markets like Zocdoc or AirBnB, consumers are becoming more and more comfortable finding and connecting with service providers online. Speech Buddies Connect is looking to bring these booking and payment efficiencies to the speech industry, while understanding that trust and professionalism are of primary importance to parents.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/08/prweb12906251.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/08/prweb12906251.htm"], "published": "2015-09-08T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:43:54.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
