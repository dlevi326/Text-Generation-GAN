The Eclipse project was created in collaboration with the European ITEA3 research projects AMALTHEA and its successor, AMALTHEA4public.\nSoftware development in the automotive industry is a key driver for meeting new regulatory and market demands. The result has been a rapid increase in the amount and complexity of automotive software that requires the computational power available from multi-core and many-core processors. At the same time, the software tools currently available for the industry are very diverse and not well integrated, which in turn makes it difficult to share artifacts among tools and companies. AMALTHEA and AMALTEHA4public are industry research projects designed to address some of these issues and improve the efficiency of software development in the automotive industry.\nAMALTHEA and AMALTHEA4public are establishing a de facto standard to integrate the tools for all the major design steps in multi-core and many-core development. The main focus of this project will be on the automotive industry, but it is expected that other industries, such as automation and telecommunications, will benefit from the standard. The project is led by Robert Bosch and includes 21 partners from Germany, Sweden, Spain, and Turkey. The Eclipse Foundation Europe GmbH is one of the partners.\nThe Eclipse APP4MC project will provide an open source implementation of the AMALTHEA standard, including the tool chain platform that will support integration of open source, commercial, and in-house tools. The APP4MC platform will be based on Eclipse and be extended to add models, editors, and specific tools for scheduling, partitioning, and optimizing multi-core and many-core systems. To encourage wide adoption and dissemination of the technology, the APP4MC project will be available under the Eclipse Public License (EPL).\n“The APP4MC project is another example of how the Eclipse community helps industry research projects create innovative new technology,” explains Mike Milinkovich, executive director of the Eclipse Foundation. “The Eclipse Foundation helps these industry projects by providing an open environment for collaborative development, and then promoting the worldwide use and adoption of the results. We look forward to being a valued partner in the AMALTHEA4public project, and other future industry research projects.”\nThe APP4MC project has been officially created at Eclipse. More information is available at https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.app4mc . The first contribution is expect in Q3/2015.
