That is good for the recovery in Europe, for manufacturers and consumers.” \nBut if one tempest is fitfully fading, another one is hoving into view. The disruptive force of technology threatens to uproot many of the industries on which Europe has built its prosperity and challenge the balance of power across the world. \nThis technological challenge, of course, is convulsing all governments, societies and economies. But some US tech entrepreneurs, who attended the Ambrosetti forum in Italy at the weekend, warned that Europe might be particularly exposed to the fast-changing “techno-geopolitics” of the world. \nCraig Mundie, Microsoft’s former chief research and strategy officer, says: “People still talk about the geopolitics of oil. But now we have to talk about the geopolitics of technology. Technology is creating a new type of interaction of a geopolitical scale and importance.” \nIt is significant, he notes, that cyber security, data protection and privacy concerns will top the list for discussion when China’s President Xi Jinping visits the US this month. \nMr Mundie suggests that Europe’s tendency to shelter incumbent businesses rather than encourage insurgent companies may leave its economies particularly vulnerable to this disruptive change. The EU’s slow-moving, consensual style of politics may also be ill-adapted to the times. \nThe danger is that Europe is trying to wield old tools to solve new problems, as in the privacy debate, he suggests. “Europe is using its antitrust activism and trying to become a global enforcer on some of these questions. But I do not think that Europe’s approach can work. In Europe it is all about controlling the data not the user. Controlling the data are a hopeless quest. There has to be a shift of focus.” \nVivek Wadhwa, a tech entrepreneur who now teaches at Stanford University, also highlights the regulatory challenges that are confronting all governments as they struggle to stay abreast of the phenomenal technological developments. Robots are transforming manufacturing. Tech companies are amassing a wealth of data about their users’ health and expanding into the healthcare business. The ever-increasing efficiency of solar panels will challenge the energy industry. The provision of global wifi will threaten existing telecommunications companies. \n“Regulators do not understand these things. Between Washington DC and Silicon Valley is 3,000 miles and several lights years in terms of knowledge of tech,” he says. The EU is even more removed from such debates. \nSome European policymakers may, perhaps rightly, discount much of this Silicon Valley talk as overenthusiastic hype. There is always a tendency to overestimate the short-term impact of any technological change. But, as the saying continues, there is also a tendency to underestimate its long-term effects. \nMr Mundie argues that government institutions around the world will need to be reconfigured to deal with techno-geopolitics. “We are trying to retrofit a governance structure which was derived from geographic borders. But we live in a borderless world,” he says. \nWhile European policymakers are still obsessed with designing the optimal institutional structure to manage their own currency and managing the migrant crisis, the world is changing very fast around them. Do they also have the institutional bandwidth to address the emerging technological challenges of our age?
