Made from the same quality components used in the RGS® Linear Rail Series, the WGS Linear Slide utilizes a screw-driven carriage that offers reliable, continuous linear speed, while maintaining accurate positioning. Length and speed of the WGS are not limited by critical screw speed, allowing high RPM, linear speed and long stroke lengths. The WGS slide has a unique, compact profile that provides improved torsional stiffness and stability versus Haydon Kerk’s existing RGS and RGW slide products. An integral mounting base can provide support over the entire length, which can extend up to 8 feet (2.4 meters). Longer lengths are available on a special order basis.\nStandard leads include .100-in, .200-in, .500-in and 1.00-in (2.54, 5.08, 12.7 and 25.4 mm) travel per revolution. Information on other available imperial and metric leads is available at http://www.haydonkerk.com . There are short leads for non-backdriving vertical applications, eliminating the need for brakes, as well as longer leads capable of speeds of more than 60 inches per second (1.5 meters per second), which rival belts and cables while offering superior positioning accuracy, repeatability, axial stiffness and lower maintenance costs.\nThe WGS utilizes sliding plane bearings on a low-profile aluminum guide rail that keeps the motion smooth throughout the travel distance. The lead-screw is precision made of high-quality stainless steel rolled on-site at a Haydon Kerk manufacturing facility.\nAll moving surfaces include Kerkite® high-performance polymers running on a Kerkote® TFE coating. The slides come with wear-compensating, anti-backlash driven carriages. Additional driven or passive carriages can be added, along with application specific customization. Linear guides without the drive screw also are available.\n Haydon Kerk products, contact: Haydon Kerk Motion Solutions, 1500 Meriden Road, Waterbury, CT 06705.
