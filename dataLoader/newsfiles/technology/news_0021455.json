The other hurdle is client face-to-face meetings but, with two airports nearby, it’s only a short cheap flight anywhere on the east coast and we can be home for dinner in Byron after a day of meetings in Sydney.”\nSince the move, the online marketing company has turned over $6 million in just four years. Kitchener says running the business from one of Australia’s most iconic destinations has been a “competitive advantage’’ especially when it comes to retaining staff.\nIn fact, all of Jack Media’s eight internal staff have been lured from Sydney.\nByron Bay quietly boasts a growing tech scene of its own and is home to several other successful tech start-ups such as ­TripADeal, 30acres and Aeeris in addition to numerous indie app developers.\nThe other reason for Jack Media’s success is the in-house built Signup Partners platform, which enables clients to build lead generation marketing campaigns in “a matter of minutes’’ via a drag and drop interface.\nKitchener says it normally requires a team of coders and designers to develop but, through the use of their platform, clients can build responsive landing pages for various campaigns and start collecting relevant lead generation data in a few clicks.\n“Signup Partners has been so successful because there is no comparable product on the market and there is a huge demand from in-house marketers for help with the digital customer acquisition,” Kitchener says. “The platform allows us to win and retain premium clients and then quickly scale and automate marketing campaigns and spend based on ­results.\n“We save our clients thousands in design and development time to become more agile and responsive.”\nHe says coupling the platform with a results-based model, where clients pay only for leads generated by their campaigns, has played a pivotal role in the company’s growth.\n“It allows new clients to trial our services with very little risk,” Kitchener says.\n“We also have access to an incredible amount of data so we can easily demonstrate the impact of our services on the client’s bottom line.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:56:26.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
