Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET\nThe late '80s and early '90s kids' TV show \"Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers\" gets a realistic makeover from the creative folks at the official Disney blog Oh My Disney.\nCheck out the opening credits of the \"Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers\" theme song reenacted by actual chipmunks munching on nuts , being chased by a stuffed crocodile and attempting to solve crimes.\nThe video is so endearing, we kind of wish Disney would actually release new episodes of the show with these real-life animals. I bet they'd work for mere peanuts. After all, it's not like chipmunk actors have a union, right?\nThis isn't the first time Oh My Disney has replaced beloved cartoon characters with real animals. Last year, the gang filmed the \"DuckTales\" opening sequence with real ducks .\nIf they're taking requests for next year, how about \"The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" recast with real bears and tigers? Or maybe \"PB&J Otter\" with real otters. What would you like to see remade with real animals?\nWatch the \"Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers\" with real chipmunks -- along with the original opening sequence for a side-by-side comparison.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJRXz1hXNn0", "http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/17/a36fa430-eb81-4fc5-addd-f230653a14ae/resize/570xauto/55cd72cc11601209e3fa8a29fd554104/chipmunks2.jpg", "http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/", "http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2015/09/17/chip-n-dale-rescue-rangers-real-chipmunks/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLMp6Ybw3Dk", "https://youtu.be/wLMp6Ybw3Dk"], "published": "2015-09-18T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T04:21:47.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
