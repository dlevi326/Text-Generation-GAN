It is also believed that he is travelling with bodyguards to evade arrest.\nAccording to the police, Bharti, who faces non-bailable charges in a case filed by his wife, is behaving like a ‘criminal’. “Somnath Bharti may have changed his appearance. He may be in disguise. We are considering all angles now,” said Joint Commissioner of Police (South Western Range) Dependra Pathak.\nBharti has been dodging the police since Tuesday, when the Delhi High Court rejected his petition for protection from arrest. He was last believed to be in Agra in Uttar Pradesh. Based on technical surveillance, police say he is now moving between Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh.\n“Bharti is also being sheltered by some people with criminal history and 4-5 men protecting Bharti are always accompanying him,” said another police officer. Some of the men with him are believed to be from the AAP.\nOn Wednesday evening, Bharti was suspected to be in north east Delhi’s Khajuri Khas. On Thursday morning, he left Delhi and moved towards Agra. Later, he switched off his mobile phone. On Friday morning, his mobile phone was found active in Haryana. Pathak said several police teams have been sent to potential hideouts of the former Delhi law minister. On Thursday, a raid was also conducted in Agra, but Bharti managed to flee.\nMeanwhile, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia expressed surprise at the police surveillance and said that Bharti is being treated like a terrorist. “The way police are searching for Bharti, as if he is a terrorist, and the way Bharti is evading arrest, both are surprising,” said Sisodia.\nBharti faces charges under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (causing hurt) and 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the Indian Penal Code.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T06:28:43.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
