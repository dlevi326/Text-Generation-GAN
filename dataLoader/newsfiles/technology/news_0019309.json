U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon said Wednesday he has no intention of allowing the Obama administration to use legal maneuvering to \"run out the clock\" on a lawsuit filed by a conservative activist challenging the USA Patriot Act. Leon ruled in 2013 that the mass collection of phone records is likely unconstitutional. Congress approved a measure in June that phases out the Patriot Act and replaces it with one in which phone companies retain the records and allow the government to search them with a warrant.
