Titan looks as though it’s got a subsurface ocean now, and Enceladus throws liquid into space, so you can fly through that and see if it’s got organics in it,” he said.\nCox also said it was plausible that humans could be the only complex life in our galaxy.\nThe biological “bottlenecks” on the way to multicellular organisms are so difficult to squeeze through that only a tiny fraction of the planets where life emerges will be home to anything more than the simplest biology, he said.\nCox added that science is telling us now that “complex life is probably rare.”\nFirst Published on August 31, 2015 9:31 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:56:20.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
