The cabbies were protesting over a range of issues, including the introduction of electric vehicles and increasing competition from Uber.\nBoris Johnson had to leave the chamber and suspend Mayor's Question Time due to the protest, tweeting later: \"Vital Londoners see democratic process in action but behaviour of some cabbies at MQTs today undermines that.\n\"Also shocked that 3 City Hall security staff hurt following suspension of Mayor's Question Time - no excuse for violence.\"\nFootage of the meeting showed Mr Johnson attempting to answer a question but being shouted down by protesters in the public gallery.\n1 / 9 Gallery: Uber Protests In France Turn Violent\nFrench taxi drivers have burned cars and blocked transport hubs as part of a nationwide strike against the mobile-based service Uber\nEventually, Greater London Assembly Conservative Tony Arbour, who had been chairing the meeting, announced it would be suspended, to cheers, clapping and shouting from the gallery.\nAfterwards, Mr Arbour said: \"Londoners are very welcome at City Hall’s public meetings, but we can’t tolerate people disrupting proceedings.\n\"Today, at Mayor’s Question Time, after constant heckles and interruptions, I had no choice but to stop the meeting and ask our guests to leave.\n\"Not only did they riot inside the building, they beat up several security guards, one was even knocked out and taken to hospital. I hope those responsible can be identified, and have their licenses removed.\n\"Debate is the essence of democracy; but this was not a debate.\"\nA statement on behalf of those protesting said taxi drivers were \"enduring the total collapse of the trade\".\nThey accused TfL of \"indiscriminate licensing\" and risking public safety, as \"taxis from all over the country descend on London to ply their wares\".\nIt added that drivers' earning potential could no longer meet the \"inflated running costs\" under Transport for London and that TfL's refusal to act had led taxi apps to enter the market \"at an unprecedented rate\".\nThe rise of apps such as Uber saw violent protests in Paris earlier this year, for example, as almost 3,000 drivers showed their anger at the increased competition. \nThe statement from protesters said they opposed the violent action seen in Paris but added: \"The trade is entitled to know where it stands, if answers aren't forthcoming, then what we are effectively dealing with is nothing short of totalitarianism, and direct action will resume on a weekly basis.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:18:20.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
