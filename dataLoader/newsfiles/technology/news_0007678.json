That includes most VW owners; about three-quarters of the cars the automaker sells are standard gasoline vehicles.\nIf you bought a diesel VW in the last few years, though, your car might be affected. That includes about 482,000 cars, starting with the model year 2009.\nHere’s the list of cars investigators are looking at: VW Beetle, Golf and Jetta and the Audi A3, from model years 2009 to 2015. They’re also looking at the VW Passat in model years 2014 and 2015.\nWhat can I do now?\nUnfortunately, not a whole lot.\nMore than likely, VW will end up recalling these cars, meaning you’ll probably have to take your car into the shop to bring it into compliance. So far, though, the company hasn’t announced how it will go about doing that.\nIn a statement after the news broke last week, VW said: “We are working to develop a remedy that meets emissions standards and satisfies our loyal and valued customers. Owners of these vehicles do not need to take any action at this time.”\nMeantime, VW and regulators have emphasized that these cars are still legal and safe to drive.\nHow bad is the problem?\nAside from the sheer number of cars affected, the level of emissions violations raised by regulators is fairly dramatic.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency says these cars were emitting nitrogen oxides, or NOx, at 10 to 40 times the level allowed by federal law.\nNitrogen oxides, by the way, contribute to ground-level ozone pollution and can aggravate respiratory diseases such as asthma.\nCan I still sell my car? Can I still register it?\nThe EPA says it’s still legal for you to sell your car second-hand, even though VW has decided to halt sales of new diesel cars.\nAnd in California, where more affected cars were sold than any other state and where state officials have launched their own investigation, it still shouldn’t be a problem to register one, said Dave Clegern, a spokesman for the state Air Resources Board.\nWhat should I keep an eye on as the situation progresses?\nThe big question looming over VW’s diesel cars now is how the company will lower emissions and whether their performance will suffer as a result.\nDiesel engines have grown a fan base around the gas mileage they offer and the power they produce, so if VW has to tone down either, that could anger the company’s fans. And that could end up affecting the cars’ resale value, said Matthew DeLorenzo, a managing editor at Kelley Blue Book.\nAlready, commenters on the VW diesel-focused forum TDIclub.com have begun wondering whether they can get away with ignoring a recall that would fix the problem. And in a sign of what’s to come, a handful of law firms have filed class-action lawsuits against VW.", "external_links": ["http://forums.tdiclub.com/showthread.php?t=448053", "http://www3.epa.gov/otaq/cert/documents/vw-nov-caa-09-18-15.pdf", "https://twitter.com/thadmoore"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T01:45:07.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
