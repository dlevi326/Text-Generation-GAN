In addition, ZMDI is committed to sponsoring various local and international causes. As the sponsor of the ZMDI Open, a chess tournament that occurs annually in Dresden, Germany, ZMDI congratulates Mr. Daniel Fridman, who won the 2015 UKA German Masters, and Grandmaster Michael Roiz, who has won the ZMDI Open of the Schachfestival (Chess Festival) for 2015. This year’s event included the awarding of several norms: Vladimir Zakhartsov received the GM-Norm; Roven Vogel and Franz Bräuer received the IM–Norm; and Dr. Dirk Jordan was handed the FIDE-arbitrator tournament norm. With over 236 participants at this year’s event and ages from eight to eighty-two, the ZMDI Schachfestival continues to impress a global audience.\nDr Jordan, the president of the ZMDI Schachfestival e.V., and Thilo von Selchow, President and CEO of ZMDI, have collaborated on this event for over a decade.

Our engagement in chess is intended to communicate our social commitment and to promote the international image of the city. This is particularly important at a time when a high number of refugees come to Europe in search of new hope and new life. Dresden, ZMDI and chess are cosmopolitan and peacefully bring together many nations and cultures. The ZMDI Open in Dresden sets a clear sign for a more friendly and tolerant togetherness,” commented Mr. von Selchow.\nThe tournament has expanded to become one of the best-known, internationally recognized and respected chess festivals in the world, bringing together many grandmasters including Garry Kasparov. The ZMDI Schachfestival e.V. continues to promote chess as a sport and the city of Dresden and its region as an area that is synonymous with the game.\nZMDI and Mr. von Selchow have long been supporters of the game of chess both in Europe and in the United States of America, where ZMDI is also a sponsor of the American Foundation of Chess with Mr. von Selchow sitting on the board of the organization.
