We have seen a flood of new collaboration technology in business over the last few years, but rarely do the elaborate meeting room tools make businesses more productive or collaborative. Instead, users want to work in ways that are natural and familiar to them. Products like SMART kapp and SMART kapp iQ have seen success because they are so simple to install and intuitive to use.” \nNeil Gaydon, President & CEO of SMART added, “The [B2B technology] industry cannot continue to justify the prices being charged for complicated collaboration solutions when people simply aren’t using the existing technology in meeting rooms today. The consumerization of business technology is driving change across the industry, and SMART’s solutions are designed to be simple, natural, walk-up-and use tools.\" \nTune in to see SMART Technologies on Fox Business Network as sponsored programming on September 13 at 5:30pm ET and on Bloomberg International as sponsored programming at 8:30am CET, 3:00pm HKT, and 10:30am CDT. \nAbout Worldwide Business with kathy ireland \nWorldwide Business with kathy ireland is a weekly business television program featuring real-world insights from corporate executives from all over the globe. \nWorldwide Business with Kathy Ireland airs Sunday evenings throughout North America on Fox Business Network as part of their sponsored programming lineup and to over 50 countries throughout the world on Bloomberg International as part of their sponsored programming lineup.
