Nucleus Research noted in the report that bpm’online has moved further up from its previously strong position in the facilitator quadrant. Focusing on sales, marketing and customer service, CRM Value Matrix leaders are determined based on products’ usability and functionality as well as innovations and productivity advancements to compete within the fast evolving CRM market. Bpm’online CRM is recognized for enhanced user interface, integrated CRM features for marketing, sales, and service that include pre-built options and flexible customizability.\n\"Bpm’online moves from facilitator to a leader because of continued investments in both usability and functionality, largely delivered in the 7.6 release,\" said Rebecca Wettemann, vice president, Nucleus Research. “Automated process capabilities are a focus of bpm’online’s releases and we expect that further investments in automation and in the integration of data sharing and collaboration will yield even more productivity for bpm’online users. Continued investments in vertical industry capabilities will likely improve bpm’online’s functionality position in future editions of the Matrix.”\nIn addition, Nucleus Research, in its recent research note (1) on the newly released version of bpm’online CRM, highlighted the enhancements in the system that helps businesses streamline their customer journey. “With bpm’online 7.6, the vendor released several new integrated CRM features for online marketing, field sales, and service that include pre-built options and flexible customizability,” the research note said. “Combined with bpm’online’s business process automation foundation, the new features could potentially increase sales and marketing productivity by four to eight percent while reducing administrative overhead.” Numerous industry experts have identified that companies are no longer limiting the use of CRM solely around operational efficiency - but rather to support their customers in their end-to-end journeys. For too long marketing, sales and customer service teams have worked in silos and were often isolated by barriers between departments. By connecting marketing, sales and service efforts into a unified, smooth-functioning machine, companies are helping to prevent sales pipeline leakage and develop higher quality relationships with existing and prospective clients. Easy process configuration in bpm’online provides companies with the flexibility they need to gain competitive advantage and essential growth in productivity.\n“At bpm'online, we understand the importance of providing users with the tools that allow to manage the complete customer journey in one environment - and we're continuing to roll out innovative ways to further streamline their unique sales processes,\" said Michael Rooney, svp and general manager of bpm'online. \"Being named a Leader by Nucleus Research further validates bpm’online’s strategy to develop the best of breed process-driven CRM that seamlessly integrates marketing, sales and service on one platform with continued emphasis on outstanding user experience.”\n(1) Nucleus Research p116 – Bpm’online releases new capabilities with version 7.6, July 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:08:31.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
