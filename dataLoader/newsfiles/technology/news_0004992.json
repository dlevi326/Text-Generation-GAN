We will continue to be invested.\" \n\nGlobal Founders Capital, a European investment firm founded by Rocket Internet CEO Oliver Samwer and his brothers and Fidelity Growth Partners Europe alum Daniel Jones, has already begun investing in India. Kochhar said GFC is a 100% subsidiary of Rocket Internet. \n\nIn April, the venture capital firm participated in an $18-million funding round in Craftsvilla, an online marketplace for ethnic products, and three months later invested in Bengaluru-based automotive services marketplace Cartisan. \n\nRocket Internet maintains a stronghold over its companies, operating these through founders who take key decisions based on directions from the incubator's headquarters in Berlin. Experts said while this model has worked for Rocket Internet in other markets, it hobbles companies operating in India's highly competitive startup industry. \n\nIn the past year, startups such as TinyOwl and Swiggy have emerged with business models rivaling Rocket Internet companies in India, and securing huge sums from investors. Established consumer internet companies including Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon are also rapidly adding segments such as fashion and furniture, competing with Jabong and FabFurnish. \n\n\"Rocket Internet just failed to anticipate the depth of competition in India. The internet business in India is a different beast altogether,\" said a former senior executive at a Rocket Internet company in India. \n\nIndia's online retail industry is estimated to grow at a 47% compounded annual growth rate to $47 billion (about Rs 3 lakh crore) in the next five years, according to a report by Goldman Sachs. \n\nFlipkart commands 44% of India's e-commerce market, Snapdeal 32%, and Amazon India 15%, according to a recent Morgan Stanley report, leaving Jabong battling it out with new entrants such as Tiger Global-backed Shopclues for the scraps. Amazon earlier this year called off a proposed deal to buy Jabong. \n\n\"(Rocket Internet's) model of owning 90% of a venture simply doesn't motivate the founders, who, for obvious reasons, are not going to have the same values as that of Narayana Murthy or a Nandan Nilekani. The risk is imminent,\" said a fund manager. \n\nFour of five founder-managing directors of Jabong so far have quit, and Foodpanda India, which now also competes with Zomato's new online ordering business, continues to see a steady revolving door involving its top management. At FabFurnish, which competes with larger rivals Urban Ladder and PepperFry, founders Mehul Aggrawal and Vikram Chopra have step down from managing day-to-day operations. \n\nRocket Internet has continued to pump money into its Indian ventures but not at the scale of some of its peers. \n\nIn February last year, Jabong raised about $100 million from a consortium of investors including Swedish investment giant AB Kinnevik and Rocket Internet. This pales in comparison with the $3.4 billion that Flipkart has raised in total, and Snapdeal's $1.6 billion equity financing overall. Amazon is readying a $5-billion war-chest for its Indian unit.
