The online giant is launching an Uber-like program, called Flex, which uses on-demand independent contractors to deliver Amazon packages. The service is now available only in Seattle (and only to members of Amazon’s Prime Now same-day delivery service), but the company expects to roll it out to other cities where Prime Now is offered, including Manhattan, Baltimore, Miami, Dallas, and Chicago. \n“There is a tremendous population of people who want to work in an on-demand fashion,” Dave Clark, Amazon senior VP of world-wide operations, told the Wall Street Journal. “This is another opportunity for people to work with the company.” \nTo qualify to deliver packages for Amazon, drivers must provide their own car, own an Android smartphone, and pass a background check. Amazon bills Flex as a way for workers to “be your boss” by setting the hours they want to work. \n“You can work as much or as little as you want,” according to the Amazon site. \nFor more on the program, go to https://flex.amazon.com .
