The FBI was called in and the company began working to notify customers.\nExcellus Blue Cross Blue Shield is part of a larger parent company called Lifetime Healthcare, based in Rochester, NY. It serves about 10 million clients, primarily in upstate New York but with clients across the United States, Kane said.\nMembers of other Blue Cross Blue Shield plans who sought treatment at one of Excellus' service area may also have been hit, he said.\nThe attackers may have gained access to Excellus clients' names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, member identification numbers, financial account information and claim information, the company said.\nThe company so far has found no evidence of data leaving its computers or being used inappropriately, Kane said. However it is offering two years of free identity theft protection services to affected individuals.\nExcellus BlueCross BlueShield is the third major healthcare data company to be breached in the past year.\nPremera, an Alaskan Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance company, had information about as many as 11 million of its clients breached in March.\nUSA TODAY\nPremera says data breach affects up to 11M people\nAnthem announced in February that as many as 80 million of its customers' records might have been breached by hackers.\nUSA TODAY\nMillions of Anthem customers alerted to hack\n\"It is becoming clear that 2015 is the year of the Health Care Hack,\" said Nikki Parker, with Covata, a security firm based in Australia.\nHealthcare breaches especially are often worse than they initially appear, said Arun Vishwanath, a professor at the University at Buffalo and an expert on cyber deception and information technology.\n\"In these kinds of cases, if you have access to the network, you won't stop, you will hit as much as you can. That means it won't just be BlueCross that is impacted, it will be their vendors, physician offices connecting to them, and accessible affiliates all over the country,\" he said.\n25 CONNECT 84 TWEET 73 LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1UJWlQq TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UJWlQq&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1d06890cdb2fe3cdf0d1475eb33d61b889eea0e3/c=808-0-3768-2960/local/-/media/2015/02/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635587150726957162-AP-Earns-Anthem.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d206d7dc2d214bf5a65d2d605cee210e2b9a9c4f/c=4-0-3260-2448&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635775008094384103-Weise-2015-02-11-0720.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635775008094384103-Weise-2015-02-11-0720.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2e450531629b4f4ce9877388c93c664a94f82f37/c=0-0-1954-1954/local/-/media/2015/03/17/NWGroup/KING/635622013206617350-3213102.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UJWlQq&text=Cyber%20breach%20hits%2010%20million%20Excellus%20healthcare%20customers&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1UJWlQq"], "published": "2015-09-11T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T01:49:56.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
