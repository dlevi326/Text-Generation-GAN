Regular Time Message where a customer chooses a date and time for a recipient to be able to watch the message.\n2. Augmented Message where a customer chooses a certain marker (image) for the message to be hidden in and then displayed via mobile app.\nEffectively everyone can have same marker – like a 20 dollar bill – but all different personal messages on it.\nThe Dollar Message Campaign is exceptionally fun and entertaining promo campaign for the public to enjoy Augmented reality messaging and see its functionality. The dollar markers are free to use in Minute of Life marker store. The images of the dollar bills in the Minute of Life store are not genuine US dollar images.
