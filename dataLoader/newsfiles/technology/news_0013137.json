The crater of interest was also formed by an impact; it is about 7 km (4.4 mi) across, which is about seven times bigger than the famous Meteor Crater in northern Arizona in North America.\nThe north wall of the small crater has many narrow gullies eroded into it.

This frost sublimates (changes from solid directly to gas) in the spring, boosting the pressure of Mars's thin atmosphere. In the fall, the carbon dioxide condenses, causing the polar caps to reach as far as ~55 degrees latitude by late winter. In the study of seasonal processes we observe the caps as they increase and decrease in size to investigate both large-scale effects on Mars as well as the local details of the sublimation and condensation processes. By learning about current processes on a local level we can learn more about how to interpret the geological record of climate changes on Mars.\nPhoto: NASA/JPL-Caltech/University Of Arizona Mars's seasonal polar caps are composed primarily of carbon-dioxide...

The waters then poured across the landscape as they headed for the northern lowlands, carving a giant channel named Kasei Valles. In the scene here, the floodwaters moved generally left to right, dividing and merging to erode a network of linked channels. Where the floods encountered hills and craters in their path, they often left a streamlined mesa behind the feature, pointing like a pennant downstream. False colors display the nature of the ground surface. Areas in cool tints have more fine-grain materials (such as sand and dust) at the surface, while redder tints indicate areas with harder sediments and outcrops of rock.\nPhoto: NASA/JPL-Caltech/University Of Arizona/HI-RISE Billions of years ago, floodwaters emerged from Echus Chasma on the...

Opportunity was targeted on Meridiani because remote sensing from orbit by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor showed that portions of Meridiani contain up to 20 percent gray crystalline hematite at the surface. Hematite is an iron-oxide mineral, and on Earth the gray crystalline variety forms mostly in association with liquid water.\nOn the ground, Opportunity discovered the hematite lies within BB-sized spherules, dubbed \"blueberries\" by scientists. Blueberries that litter the surface at the landing site are embedded within outcrops of soft, layered sandstone rocks.\nAs geologists reconstruct it, the blueberries formed when strongly acidic groundwater drenched the basaltic sandstone, which was rich in goethite, another iron-bearing mineral. The water altered the goethite into hematite, forming spherules within the rocks. Then, over unknown ages, as the acid-rotted sandstones weathered away, the tougher spherules came free and collected on the surface.\nPhoto: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Arizona State University When the Mars Exploration Rover, Opportunity, landed on Meridiani...\nImage 19 of 44\nA towering dust devil casts a serpentine shadow over the Martian surface in this image acquired by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.\nThe scene is a late-spring afternoon in the Amazonis Planitia region of northern Mars. The view covers an area about four-tenths of a mile (644 meters) across. North is toward the top. The length of the dusty whirlwind's shadow indicates that the dust plume reaches more than half a mile (800 meters) in height. The plume is about 30 yards or meters in diameter.\nA westerly breeze partway up the height of the dust devil produced a delicate arc in the plume. The image was taken during the time of Martian year when the planet is farthest from the sun. Just as on Earth, winds on Mars are powered by solar heating. Exposure to the sun's rays declines during this season, yet even now, dust devils act relentlessly to clean the surface of freshly deposited dust, a little at a time.\nPhoto: NASA/JPL-Caltech/University Of Arizona A towering dust devil casts a serpentine shadow over the Martian...\nImage 20 of 44 Shortly after midnight Sunday morning (5 April 1998 12:39 AM PST), the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) on the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft successfully acquired a high resolution image of the \"Face on Mars\" feature in the Cydonia region.\nPhoto: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Shortly after midnight Sunday morning (5 April 1998 12:39 AM PST),...

A dense patchwork of craters from countless impacts testifies to the landscape's ancient age, dating back billions of years.\nIn eastern Arabia lies an anonymous crater, 120 kilometers (75 miles) across. The floor of this crater contains a large exposure of rocky material, a field of dark sand dunes, and numerous patches of what is probably fine-grained sand. The shape of the dunes hints that prevailing winds have come from different directions over the years.\nFine-grained materials, such as dust and the smallest sand particles, heat up quickly by day and cool off equally quickly at night. However, coarser materials-bigger sand particles, gravel, hardened sediments, and rocks- respond more slowly to the same daily cycle.\nThis means that when THEMIS views these coarse materials late in the Martian night, they appear warmer than the pools and patches of finegrain sand. In the image here, areas that are cold at night appear in blue tints, while the warmer areas show in yellows, oranges, and reds.\nPhoto: NASA/JPL-Caltech/University Of Arizona/HI-RISE The battered region of Arabia Terra is among the oldest terrain on...\nImage 23 of 44\nWhat triggered a Martian landslide?\nLandslides are common features in canyons on both Earth and Mars, and they happen the same way. Erosion undermines a canyon wall until abruptly millions of tons of rock come crashing down. In the case seen here, the impact of a meteorite landing near the edge of the canyon may have done more than just blast a crater 6.5 kilometers (4 miles) wide. The impact may also have triggered the massive landslide, either at the time of impact or shortly after.\nPhoto: NASA/JPL-Caltech/University Of Arizona/HI-RISE What triggered a Martian landslide?\nLandslides are common...\nImage 24 of 44\nGale Crater forms a large natural repository for much of Martian geologic history.

Wrapping around the crater's central peak-visible at lower right in the image-the mound stands about 5.5 kilometers (3.4 miles) higher than the northern crater floor and about 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles) above the southern floor.

By the time the rover acquired this view, it had examined rock layers inside the rim.\nOpportunity was headed for a closer look at the base of a promontory called \"Cape Verde,\" the cliff at about the 2-o'clock position of this image, before leaving Victoria. The face of Cape Verde is about 6 meters (20 feet) tall. Just clockwise from Cape Verde is the main bowl of Victoria Crater, with sand dunes at the bottom.

In enhanced color, the sediments are very distinctive. The rocks show a sharp change in color partway down the slope, indicating a change in the properties of the rock, probably to a different composition.\nThe erosional features have alcoves with aprons downslope, and in some cases have hints of channels, potentially due to abrasion by falling debris. These morphologies bear some resemblance to gullies commonly found in the mid-latitudes, which are often thought to have formed due to erosion by liquid water from melting snow. Near the equator, however, snowmelt in Mars' recent climate is less likely.\nPhoto: NASA/JPL-Caltech/University Of Arizona This observation shows erosional features on light-toned rocks in...\nImage 29 of 44 This mosaic was acquired on Sol 36 (February 8, 2004) by the Spirit rover's panoramic camera (Pancam).

Image 31 of 44\nThis mosaic image of Valles Marineris - colored to resemble the martian surface - comes from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), a visible-light and infrared-sensing camera on NASA's Mars OdyssGeologists think Valles Marineris began to open along geological faults about 3.5 billion years ago. The faulting was caused by the tectonic activity that accompanied the growth of the giant volcanoes in Tharsis, lying just to the west. As molten rock (magma) pushed into Tharsis from below, the entire region rose, and the surrounding crustal rocks stretched and broke into faults and fractures.\nAs cracks opened, the ground sank, much as the keystone in an arch drops when the ends of the arch move apart. The faulting also opened paths for subsurface water to escape, undermining the ground and enlarging the fracture zone. In countless places, the valley's steep, newly exposed walls became unstable, causing landslides that widened the canyon further. It's not clear when the valley's growth stopped - and in places even today small landslides undoubtedly occur. But it appears the main activity came to a halt roughly 2 billion years ago.\nPhoto: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Arizona State University Ey Orbiter.

Geologists would classify these dunes as \"sand-starved\" because the ground between the dunes has almost no sand. This surface shows a pattern of cracks that is typical of the permafrost's seasonal expansion and contraction. It is also possible that this subsurface ice exists inside the dunes. If so, the dunes are not currently moving and are being \"stabilized\" by this ice.\nPhoto: NASA/JPL-Caltech/University Of Arizona This picture was taken during the Martian summer with only small...

The polygons in this \"patterned ground\" are easy to see because their edges are bound by troughs or ridges covered by bright frost relative to their darker, frost-free interiors. Patterned ground on Mars is thought to form as the result of cyclic thermal contraction cracking in the permanently frozen ground.\nScientists study polygonally-patterned ground on Mars because the occurrence and physical characteristics of the polygons helps us understand the recent and past distribution of ice (frozen water) in the shallow subsurface. These features also provide clues about climate conditions.\nPhoto: NASA/JPL-Caltech/University Of Arizona From a distance, the floor of this crater looks like a giant...\nImage 35 of 44 Fans and ribbons of dark sand dunes creep across the floor of Bunge Crater in response to winds blowing from the direction at the top of the picture.

Many dark and light-toned slope streaks are visible on the wall of the trough surrounded by dunes. Slope streak formation is among the few known processes currently active on Mars. While the mechanism of formation and triggering is debated, they are most commonly believed to form by downslope movement of extremely dry sand or very fine-grained dust in an almost fluidlike manner (analogous to a terrestrial snow avalanche) exposing darker underlying material.\nSome of the slope streaks show evidence that downslope movement is being diverted around obstacles, such as large boulders, and a few appear to originate at boulders or clumps of rocky material. These slope streaks, as well as others on the planet, do not have deposits of displaced material at their downslope ends. The darkest slope streaks are youngest and can be seen to cross cut and lie on top of the older and lighter-toned streaks. The lighter-toned streaks are believed to be dark streaks that are lightening with time as new dust is deposited on their surface.\nPhoto: NASA/JPL-Caltech/University Of Arizona This observation shows a portion of the wall (light-toned material)...\nImage 44 of 44 Life on Mars? NASA says planet appears to have flowing water 1 / 44 Back to Gallery CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Mars appears to be flowing with rivulets of salty water, at least in the summer, scientists reported Monday in a finding that boosts the odds of life on the red planet.\n\"It suggests that it would be possible for there to be life today on Mars,\" NASA's science mission chief, John Grunsfeld , said at a news conference.\nScientists in 2008 confirmed the existence of frozen water on Mars. Now instruments aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have yielded the strongest evidence yet that salt water in liquid form trickles down certain Martian slopes each summer, according to the researchers.\nRelated Stories Stargazers witness rare event in supermoon eclipse Latest Pluto photos show a cryptic, scaly planet NASA shares massive Martian panorama on anniversary of latest landing \"Mars is not the dry, arid planet that we thought of in the past,\" said Jim Green , director of planetary science for NASA. \"Under certain circumstances, liquid water has been found on Mars.\"\nThe rivulets — if that's what they are, since the evidence for their existence is indirect — are about 12 to 15 feet wide and 300 feet or more long, scientists said.\n\"What we're dealing with is wet soil, thin layers of wet soil, not standing water,\" said Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona at Tucson, the principal scientist for the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's high-resolution imaging experiment.\nBecause liquid water is essential to life, the findings could have major implications for the possibility of Martian life. The researchers said in the journal Nature Geoscience that further exploration is warranted to determine whether microscopic life exists on the planet.\nMcEwen said he, for one, believes the possibility of life on Mars to be \"very high,\" though it would be microbial and somewhere in the Martian crust.\nThe presence of liquid water could also make life easier for astronauts visiting or living on Mars. Water could be used for drinking and for creating oxygen and rocket fuel. NASA's goal is to send humans there in the 2030s.\nThe evidence of flowing water consists largely of dark, narrow streaks on the surface that tend to appear and grow during the warmest Martian months and fade the rest of the year.\nMars is extremely cold even in summer, and the streaks are in places where the temperature is as low as minus-10 degrees Fahrenheit. But salt can lower the freezing point of water and melt ice.\nThe source of the water is a mystery. Scientists noted it could be melting ice, an underground aquifer, water vapor from the thin Martian atmosphere, or some combination.\nMcEwen said that there appears to be a \"significant volume\" of water, speculating it could fill many Olympic swimming pools, but that it is spread thin.\nThe streaks were spotted by the orbiter's high-resolution, telescopic camera. Another on-board instrument detected the chemical signature of salt compounds combined with water.\nMichael Meyer , lead scientist for NASA's Mars exploration program, said the only definitive way for now to determine whether there's life on Mars is to collect rocks and soil for analysis on Earth — something a U.S. lander set to lift off in 2020 will do.\nNow that scientists know what they're looking for, a better, more methodical search can be carried out, Green said.\n\"Water is one of the most precious resources necessary for a human mission to the red planet,\" said Rep. Lamar Smith , R-Texas, chairman of the House science, space and technology committee. \"The more evidence we find of it, the more encouraged I am for future Mars missions.\"\nPresent-day Mars is nothing like ancient Mars. Three billion years ago and more, our most Earthlike neighbor had a huge ocean, but something radical happened, and exactly what remains a mystery.\nThe idea of water — and life — on Mars has been irresistible to earthlings for generations.\nIn 1877, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli spied what he called \"canali\" on Mars — Italian for \"channels\" — but the word was mistranslated to \"canals\" in English, causing imaginations to run wild. In the early 1900s, amateur astronomer Percival Lowell claimed to have spotted irrigation canals and theorized they were built by Martians.\nIn 2008, NASA's Phoenix spacecraft landed on Mars and confirmed the long-suspected presence of ice in the soil. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been circling the planet since 2006.\nThe lead author of the research paper, Lujendra Ojha, is a Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology .\nFor NASA, at least, the timing couldn't be better. This Friday, the NASA-approved movie \"The Martian\" has its premiere.\n___\nOnline:\nNASA: http://mars.nasa.gov", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/10/02/7635094/11/920x920.jpg",
