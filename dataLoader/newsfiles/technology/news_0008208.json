The automakers are Audi, BMW, Ford, General Motors, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Tesla, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo. \nThe technology is already available in some vehicles, but typically as an option in higher-priced models like Cadillac, Infiniti and Lexus. They are also often bundled with non-safety features like heated seats or faux leather interiors, making the overall package more expensive. \n\"If technologies such as automatic emergency braking are only available as options or on the most expensive models, too few Americans will see the benefits of this new era,\" Foxx said. \nAutomatic emergency braking includes a range of systems designed to address the large number of crashes, especially rear-end crashes, in which drivers do not apply the brakes or fail to apply sufficient braking power to avoid or mitigate a crash. The systems use on-vehicle sensors such as radar, cameras or lasers to detect an imminent crash, warn the driver and, if the driver does not take sufficient action, engage the brakes. \nThe systems could prevent or mitigate an estimated 80 percent of the rear-end collisions that cause about 1,700 deaths and a half million injuries annually, according to a recent report by the National Transportation Safety Board. There are about 1.7 million rear-end crashes each year in the U.S. \n___ \nFollow Joan Lowy on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
