It is probably only a matter of time though before suggestions appear on stable versions as well. \nA click on the suggested application opens its Windows Store page where you can download it or look up additional information about it. \nSince you only see its name in the start menu, it may sometimes be difficult to tell right away what kind of app or game it is let alone why it was suggested to you. \nIt is easy enough to disable these suggestions in the Start Menu, even without installing a third-party alternative such as Classic Shell which offers many advantages over the built-in Start Menu. \nHere is what you need to do: Tap on the Windows-key and select Settings from the Start Menu. If you don't find Settings listed there, type Settings and hit enter. This should open the Settings app of the Windows 10 operating system. Navigate to Personalization > Start. There you find the preference \"Occasionally show suggestions in Start\". Flip the switch to off. \nWhen you return to the start menu the suggested listing should have been removed from it. \nIf you run a stable version of Windows 10 and see suggested items in the start menu suddenly, you will find the option to turn it off in the Settings. Microsoft could decide not to push it to stable systems though, that is an option I guess.

This is worse than even a smartphone... Reply Pants September 25, 2015 at 7:17 pm # \nThe day my OS becomes an advertising platform is the day I switch OSes - although there are a myriad of other reasons to only have Win10 (and Win8.1 for that matter) as a test machine. I get it, they gave the OS away for free - and they are moving to a service based model - but FFS ... enough is enough Reply Andrew September 25, 2015 at 7:50 pm # \nWell they gave the upgrade away for free, but still charging for a new license... that doesn't mean they should start advertising in the OS... I guess as long as you can disable it. Still, they should make it easier by adding a button underneath the \"suggested app\" with a \"do not show me these again\" Reply George September 25, 2015 at 10:37 pm # \nSo... *this* was the touted return of the Start Menu? Oh dear... Classic Shell all the way and never look back. Reply Jupster September 25, 2015 at 10:47 pm # \n..and now will come the comments from people who don't read the article properly and jump to conclusions. It's just a 'suggested' feature, not in the stable build, and easy enough to turn off that even the Tinfoil Hat wearers could manage it. \nNo big deal, but lets get a teacup for that approaching storm. George September 25, 2015 at 10:53 pm # \nRight Jupster, only*one* more easy thing to turn off. Just add it to this list: http://www.ghacks.net/2015/07/30/windows-10-and-privacy Reply Jeff September 26, 2015 at 12:49 am # \nIt's not just about how easy it is to turn off, or that it's not yet in a stable build. It's about Microsoft's new behaviours and trends that are consistently creeping into the OS. It is an aggressive act that is using what should be a generic and non-invasive OS as a captive audience advertising and sales platform. \nIMO, no OS should have a damn 'store' built into it.
