EmDrive is taking the space propulsion world by a storm. Tall claims have been made about it being a historic technology that even defies the laws of Newton and that it can change the face of space propulsion entirely. It has also been claimed that reaching far off stars, planets and celestial bodies would become much faster once this technology is used in space propulsion. Now what exactly is EmDrive? A mystery in itself. An aerospace engineer, Roger Shawyer had first designed this in 2001.According to Shawyer, this technology is a propellant-less propulsion system, that is the engine doesn’t use fuel to cause a reaction. This hypothetical drive removes the need for fuel leading to substantially lighter and cheaper spacecrafts. Also this hypothetical drive is able to attain extremely high speeds. So where is the problem? The problem actually is its inconsistency with Newton’s law of conservation of momentum, according to which within a closed system, linear and angular momentum remain constant regardless of any changes that take place within said system that is, unless an outside force is applied, an object will not move. It is actually a reaction-less device that is; it is proposing propulsion without any reaction (that is burning of fuel). An action (in this case propulsion of spacecraft) taking place without a reaction (in this case ignition of fuel and expulsion of mass) should be entirely impossible. And for such a thing to take place; we need to find a scientific ground which hasn’t been found as yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T15:42:16.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
