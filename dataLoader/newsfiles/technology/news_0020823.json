They own and run eight nuclear power stations in the UK with a combined capacity of almost 10,000 megawatts. \nAn integral part of a nuclear power station is the gas circulator. The circulators need to be checked periodically and any maintenance work carried out. In order to keep the power station productive for as long as possible duplicate circulators are kept on site - one working and one in storage. In order to prevent corrosion and deterioration of these parts, they need to be stored in a controlled environment. \nIn order to provide a controlled environment they contacted humidity experts, Munters. A Munters desiccant dehumidification system was installed and the circulators are now stored within a tent-like structure at a constant temperature and relative humidity (RH). \nDehumidification by Munters removes the ambient moisture, eliminating corrosion and humidity-induced electrical and electronic faults. This ensures reliable operation with fewer failures and lower maintenance costs - a key benefit in today's competitive market - maximises plant availability and profitability. \nTo read more, please download the free whitepaper...
