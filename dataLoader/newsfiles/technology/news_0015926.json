Around 30 per cent of men and 72 per cent of women over 60 are fully dependent on others.\nThe Global AgeWatch Index represents 91 per cent of the world's population aged 60 and over, amounting to some 901 million people. It measures the lives of older people in four key areas: income; health; education and employment and the enabling environment.\nThe rank of some other countries included Sri Lanka at 46th position, China (52), Bangladesh (67), Nepal (70), Pakistan (92) and Afghanistan was at the bottom of the list.\nThe report found that poverty rates among older people vary dramatically. South Korea currently has the highest poverty rate among older people at 48.5 per cent, followed by Venezuela at 38 per cent, Australia at 33.4 per cent, Bolivia at 30.3 per cent and Honduras at 28.9 per cent, despite significant variations in Gross National Income per capita.\nAt the other end of the spectrum countries with low old age poverty rates are equally varied. The poverty rate among older people in South Africa is 12.17 per cent, Mauritius, 6.4 per cent, India, 5.1 per cent, Lao People's Democratic Republic, 4.5 per cent, Czech Republic, 1.7 per cent and the lowest, Iceland at 1.6 per cent.\nThe report also found that a combination of a lifetime of gender discrimination, combined with inequality in old age, can have a devastating effect on older women. Globally 46.8 per cent of women aged 55 to 64 are economically active, compared with 73.5 per cent of men.\nIn addition, women usually earn less than men, so opportunities to save for later life are limited, increasing their risk of poverty in old age, the report said.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:26:41.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
