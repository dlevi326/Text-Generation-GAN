I had taken an intro to computer science class previously and the gender ratio in my class was about one girl for every five guys. Not only was it encouraging to be in a room full of girls as passionate and interested in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as I was, but it was also a great learning environment,\" Zheng said. \n\"It was amazing to be with other girls who came from a variety of backgrounds but came together with one common interest - STEM,\" she said, adding that it was a bonding experience. \n\"In my school, there are some girls who are interested in STEM subjects but I think overall, in high schools all around, there is a sizeable gender gap in almost every STEM-related class,\" said the Upper Saddle River teen. \nDuring the Girls Who Code program, the Verizon Foundation encouraged its senior female leaders to participate as a way to help motivate girls to continue their education and consider STEM-related careers. \nRose Kirk, president of the Verizon Foundation, said, \"This change begets opportunity. Our society is becoming more diverse in its race, its thinking and its power - and technology is at the nexus of innovation.\" \nKirk said \"smart, determined, young women\" are \"the change our society needs\" and \"the change companies in America - like Verizon - need also.\" \nAccording to a report from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic and Statistics Administration, women \"are vastly underrepresented in STEM jobs and among STEM degree holders, despite making up nearly half of the U.S. workforce.\" \nWomen hold less than 25 percent of STEM jobs, despite holding half of all jobs in the economy, the report says. By 2020, there will be 1.4 million jobs available in computing and technical fields, but women in the U.S. are only on track to filling 3 percent of those positions. \nThe main mission of Girls Who Code, a national non-profit, is to close those gaps in industries related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. \nZheng said she's looking at colleges with a focus on computer science, as well as graphic design to possibly double major in the two and is forming a Girls Who Code Club at her school, along with two other classmates who attended the program this summer. \n\"I'm interested in all sorts of STEM related careers. UX (User Experience) as well as UI (User Interface) design have been two career options that have interested me as they are a way to combine my interest in the arts as well as my interest in computer science,\" she said. \"In the future I would also love to inspire other girls to program, like Girls Who Code and our speakers did for me.\" \nE-mail: redmondk@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T09:43:56.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
