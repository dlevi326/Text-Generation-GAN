Nintex acquired Drawloop, one of the Top 10 paid apps in the Salesforce AppExchange, in July 2015 and has coupled its document generation technology with its workflow platform. In one of the new use cases, users simply click a link on Salesforce1 to launch a powerful Nintex Form to capture data and create new records in aggregate across multiple Salesforce record types. This single form will automatically trigger workflows and create a new Salesforce contact, account, and opportunity, plus simultaneously deliver a sales quote from a mobile device, both online and offline. \n\"As a leader in musical instruments, audio equipment and electronic devices, Yamaha works with dealers around the world,\" said Yamaha's CRM Manager, Customer Experience Group Michael Machado . \"By leveraging Drawloop's document generation within Salesforce, we've streamlined our dealer contracting processes to reduce time and friction from weeks to days. We look forward to being one of the first customers to use LOOP Document Services with Nintex to realize even more efficiencies.\"\nThe Nintex Connector for Salesforce allows companies to build workflows that communicate with the CRM system as well as synch content and data online or offline. Customers may capture data including geolocation, videos, images, and barcodes, create new records, and trigger any workflow and document generation through the integration between Nintex, Drawloop, and Salesforce. \n\"Today's sellers live and breathe by their mobile devices,\" added Nintex's VP of Product Ryan Duguid . \"By bringing together LOOP Document Services with Nintex Forms, we are transforming a salesperson's ability to easily capture data real-time in Salesforce, immediately generate a document like a sales contract, and send it to a customer or prospect to review and execute. The ability to accelerate closing deals, coupled with significant time savings, in this real-world selling scenario is huge.\"\nNintex continues to leverage its investment in Drawloop and is developing more workflow and document generation scenarios for customers operating in Salesforce and Office 365 environments. In the coming months, Nintex plans to release new capabilities that will directly integrate Drawloop document generation with the workflow platform and will enable Drawloop to leverage Office 365 for managing documents and templates.\nMedia Contacts \n\nKristin Treat \nErica O'Connor \nNintex Public Relations \nWeber Shandwick for Nintex \nkristin.treat@nintex.com \nnintex@webershandwick.com \ncell: (215) 317-9091 \n\nAbout Nintex\nNintex, the global standard for workflow automation, enables enterprise IT to more quickly and easily create and manage simple to sophisticated business processes from the back to front-office.
