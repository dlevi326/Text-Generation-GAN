When the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine, the plant's high operational flexibility ensures we can contribute to the security of electricity supply.\" \nAlstom Germany president Alf Henryk Wulf said: \"Alstom's KA26 combined-cycle power plant is a highly environmentally friendly power solution that provides RheinEnergie with unrivalled flexibility. \n\"With short start-up times and fast load changing capabilities, the plant is perfectly equipped to balance out fluctuations in the electricity grid, which arise from the volatile feed-in of renewable energy.\" \nAlstom and RheinEnergie signed the agreement to develop the facility in December 2012. \nImage: The combined-cycle heat and power plant.
