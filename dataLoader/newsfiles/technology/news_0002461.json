When it comes to immigration physicals, they must be conducted at a designated medical facility and all the appropriate immigration medical forms must be completed and signed — Dr. Vikram Gupta CLIFTON, NEW JERSEY, UNITED STATES, August 24, 2015 / EINPresswire.com / -- According to Dr. Vikram Gupta, MD, of GMed Healthcare, PC ( www.gmedhealthcare.com ), a Northern New Jersey medical practice serving Bergen County, Passaic County, Clifton, Maywood, and Paterson, NJ, in a range of urgent care and internal medicine needs, any immigrant seeking legal status in the United States of America is required by the US government to pass a physical as part of the immigration process. “Medical examinations in the United States are typically required for adjustment of status cases related to immigration status,” according to Dr. Gupta. “A physical may also be required for requests for certain non-immigrant status. If you are required to undergo an immigration medical exam, it is important to find an approved doctor in your area.” According to Dr. Gupta, thousands of people each year begin the immigration process. This can be a difficult and frustrating process that requires individuals to complete many confusing forms and often wait long periods of time as they progress through the immigration system. One requirement that each applicant must complete is a medical evaluation by a doctor that has been approved by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). In addition to being certified by the USCIS, Dr. Gupta completed his residency training at the highly-ranked Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, where he is currently a Clinical Instructor of Medicine for Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. He is certified by the American Board of Family Medicine and a member of numerous professional organizations. He was recently elected to the Board of New Jersey Academy of Family Physicians , serves on the Clinical Resource Utilization and Ethics Committee at St. Joseph’s Hospital, and is board certified in hospice and palliative care. “When it comes to immigration physicals, they must be conducted at a designated medical facility and all the appropriate immigration medical forms must be completed and signed precisely as required by government officials,” says Dr. Gupta. “The medical evaluation is straightforward and includes a physical, a review of the applicant's medical history, an assessment of vaccine, and all government-required lab tests.” For anyone in the Northern New Jersey area that is starting their journey toward American citizenship, it starts with an immigration physical from an approved physician, according to Dr. Gupta. Dr. Gupta is a family medicine physician caring for adult and pediatric patients in Northern New Jersey at his Clifton office (246 Clifton Ave Suite 4, Clifton, NJ 07011) and his Maywood office (255 W Spring Valley Ave., Suite 102, Maywood, NJ 07607), St. Joseph’s Hospital in Paterson, and across various acute and sub-acute rehab centers in the area. He is certified by the American Board of Family Medicine and a member of numerous professional organizations. He was recently elected to the Board of New Jersey Academy of Family Physicians, and serves on the Ethics Committee and in the Palliative Care Program at St. Joseph’s Hospital.
