Email address 1: James Rundle 23 September 2015 Trading firms are preparing for a key vote that will determine whether or not a sweeping reform of Europe’s financial markets will be delivered in September, with some warning that there are still major flaws with the draft that need to be resolved. Steven Maijoor, chairman, Esma \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority’s Board of Supervisors, a panel of 28 senior regulators from across the EU, will meet on September 24 to vote on whether the draft regulatory technical standards for the review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive should be passed to the European Parliament for scrutiny. \nThe Mifid II standards were initially scheduled to be released in July 2015 but were delayed due to a legal review by the European Commission until a projected September release date. Despite concerns that the rules may be delayed in recent weeks, Esma’s chairman, Steven Maijoor, sought to calm nerves on September 22. \nSpeaking during a keynote speech at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association’s annual general meeting for Europe, he said that he was “determined” to deliver the rules in September, but cautioned that the decision is ultimately up to the board and the uncertainties of the voting system. \nHe said: “We have qualified majority voting, which means that in some cases, you can have blocking minorities. This is the way that decision taking is done in the EU, and so sometimes you don’t get a result because there is simply no majority. \n\"On a simple majority vote then you might not like the result, but you can get a result if you have an uneven number of voters. On a qualified majority vote you can have blocking minorities and you get stuck.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T13:40:08.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
