But that hasn’t been enough to keep them from hemorrhaging students. Confronted with falling birth rates and demographic shifts, rising tuition, the growth of charter schools, and other challenges, parochial schools are seeing their enrollments plummet.\nAnd it’s not just in New Orleans, where the archdiocese has also had to contend with the exodus that followed Hurricane Katrina, and where 20 Catholic schools have closed in the period beginning even before Katrina hit, including three last year. Catholic schools nationwide have fewer than half as many students as they did 50 years ago, and the decline has resumed in the last 10 years after leveling off briefly in the late 1990s, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Nearly 1,650 schools have closed or been consolidated in the last 10 years, 88 of them last year alone, the National Catholic Education Association says .\nCatholic schools nationwide have fewer than half as many students as they did 50 years ago. “We’ve struggled,” said Karen Henderson, principal at St. Rita, which serves kids in prekindergarten through seventh grade. “Parents know they have a lot of choice.”\nIt’s not only religious private education that has experienced this trend. Secular private—which call themselves independent—schools have seen their numbers drop since the recession, too, the Education Department reports, for many of the same reasons, along with growing interest in homeschooling among higher-income families. “Within the independent school community, there has been this trend of saying, ‘This decline in enrollment is just the Catholic schools,’” said Myra McGovern, vice president of the National Association of Independent Schools. “But it’s not.”", "external_links": ["https://www.ncea.org/data-information/catholic-school-data", "http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cgc.asp"], "published": "2015-09-02T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T15:52:39.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
