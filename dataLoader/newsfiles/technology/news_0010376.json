WGBH said Thursday that it would fold GlobalPost’s journalism into Public Radio International, an affiliated company that co-produces the global news program The World with WGBH. Financial terms weren’t disclosed. “This is another manifestation of WGBH’s commitment to broadening and deepening public media’s international reporting resources,’’ said Jon Abbott, the chief executive of WGBH, in a statement.   GlobalPost was founded in 2009. It is headquartered in Boston and has journalists around the world, and had partnered with several news organizations to publish its articles, including NPR. In 2014, James Foley, one of its journalists, was killed by Islamic State militants in Syria. The deal would take around a month to close, WGBH said.
