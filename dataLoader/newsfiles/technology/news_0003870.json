It leases or hire purchases the plane from the foreign companies, and provides the Iranian airlines with new planes, so that domestic companies are not involved with the purchase,\" he explained. \n\"Hire purchasing planes is common in all countries and renovating the fleet becomes much easier this way,\" he added. \nIn May, Akhoundi said that Iranian airlines had obtained 15 used aircraft since February as part of efforts to renovate its fleet. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T11:41:04.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
