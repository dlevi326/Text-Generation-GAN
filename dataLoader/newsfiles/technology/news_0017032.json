With Spiceworks' cloud-based Help Desk, IT professionals can now deploy a solution built for them that includes all the capabilities they need with unlimited admin and end-user seats, no hosting or storage costs, ongoing updates, free support, and access to a Community of millions of peers. Together with Spiceworks' on-premise and mobile solutions, the cloud-based Help Desk enables IT professionals to support their growing businesses in the way that best works for them. \n\"IT professionals have spoken loud and clear -- they want great tools designed for them that just work,\" said Nicole Tanzillo, director of help desk product marketing at Spiceworks. \"Tools must be easy to deploy and use and allow IT professionals to spend less time on mundane tasks and more time supporting their organizations.\" \nSpiceworks' cloud-based Help Desk was built for IT professionals who need a feature-rich help desk environment but prefer a solution that doesn't require the expense or labor associated with an on-premise solution. With the cloud edition, IT professionals can remove many of the management tasks associated with locally installed applications while providing end users with a great experience and efficient way to get the help they need. Features include: Custom dashboards give IT professionals an at-a-glance view of help desk operations so they can quickly understand what's happening within their environment. Available statistics include average response time, top end-user ticket creators, ticket categories and types, and average time to close. Ticket auto-assignment helps IT professionals automate their help desk system and spend more time addressing issues and less time managing tickets. Ticket rules can be used to auto-assign tickets to specific technicians as they come in, set due dates for certain tasks, establish priority levels for certain types of tickets, and many other potential scenarios. User portals allow end-users to submit help desk requests through a website instead of email. User portals can be customized to create a personalized experience for end-users and clients, and IT service providers can create multiple user portals for each of the clients they support. \n\"We have four IT professionals using Spiceworks' cloud-based Help Desk system to support 27 company locations across Arkansas and Missouri,\" said Galen Ransone, IT technician at Greenway Equipment . \"It's clear the product was designed to meet the specific demands of IT professionals and it's already proven effective in helping us support employees who need technology assistance. The fact it's free makes it even more enticing.\" \nAdditionally, Spiceworks today introduced a new beta version of its mobile application for on-the-go IT professionals interested in managing their cloud-based Help Desk through Google Android- and Apple iOS-based tablets and smartphones. The updated app builds on existing mobile support for Spiceworks' on-premise help desk solution and provides the same granular level of control in a convenient, easy-to-navigate interface.
