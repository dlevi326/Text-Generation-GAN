Does the forestry industry negatively impact the environment? tremendously New Age United Well-Known Member I read about a study a few years back about the actual affect of the trees on the oxygen output of trees and how they don't exchange co2 for oxygen at nearly the rate we thought they did(sorry I don't have the link), remember how you were told in elementary that the forest was supporting the whole environment. It just came up in an argument I was having with my buddy and I was wondering, and concluded that surely that theory must be false bc I can only imagine it would be devastating to the environment if all the trees were cut down all over the globe, surely the atmosphere would become toxic and render the earth uninhabitable, wouldn't it? Can anyone find any peer reviewed data concerning this? Any opinions welcome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T08:02:00.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
