I’ve been to a few poetry sessions and it always moves me seeing the emotion portrayed by poets as their words flow, sometimes like daggers to the heart, other times like the sweet scent of a rose through your nose. Poetry can evoke all kinds of emotion both from the poet and the audiences.\nLady Mary Chudleigh (1656 – 1710)\nTo the Ladies\nWife and servant are the same\nBut only differ in the name:\nFor when that fatal knot is tied,\nWhich nothing, nothing can divide,\nWhen she the word Obey has said,\nAnd man by law supreme has made,\nThen all that’s kind is laid aside,\nAnd nothing left but state and pride.\nFierce as an eastern prince he grows,\nAnd all his innate rigour shows:\nThen but to look, to laugh, or speak,\nWill nuptial contract break,\nLike mutes, she signs alone must make,\nAnd never any freedom take,\nBut still be governed by a nod,\nAnd fear her husband as her god:\nHim still must serve, him still obey,\nAnd nothing act, and nothing say,\nBut what her haughty lord thinks fit,\nWho, with power, has all the wit.\nThen shun, oh! shun that wretched state,\nAnd all the fawning flatterers hate.\nValue yourselves, and men despise:\nYou must be proud, if you’ll be wise.\nThe above poem was written in a time when woman were seen as the property of their husbands they had no real say in society, things have changed dramatically over the times. Woman have come into their own and realized their real worth. The poets today took to the theme with enthusiasm and vigor, reciting their thoughts of the woman in their lives or just woman in general, praising them and thanking them for the role they play in our society.\nShe walks the mile makes you smile\nall the while being true\nDon’t take for granted the passions\nthat she has for you\nYou will lose if you chose to refuse\nto put her first\nShe will and she can find a man who\nknows her worth – Alicia Keys, A woman's worth\nhttp://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aliciakeys/awomansworth.html\nMen respect your woman, treat her right she is a goddess given to us as mother,companion, soulmate to cherish and to hold – her worth is immeasurable.", "external_links": ["http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aliciakeys/awomansworth.html"], "published": "2015-09-03T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T20:02:51.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
