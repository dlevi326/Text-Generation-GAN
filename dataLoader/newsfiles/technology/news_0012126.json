Victims of this attack are sent huge amounts of responses from Portmapper servers, which in turn will overload their bandwidth and render their websites and web-based services completely unreachable. \nOnce the experienced team from Psychz Networks heard about the RPC portmapper attack, the company spokesperson said they got right to work on their DDoS protection services, modifying and improving them as needed to make sure their clients would not fall prey to this attack. \n\"At Psychz, we have already made necessary changes to make sure we will continue to protect our clients from any form of DDoS attacks including reflection DDoS attack via RPC portmapper,\" the spokesperson said. \nThe fact that Psychz Networks would work hard to be sure their clients were safe from a new DDoS attack will not surprise the many people who have worked with the company. Since the day it opened, Psychz Networks has earned a well-deserved reputation for their outstanding DDoS protection services that help businesses save money by avoiding costly attacks. \n\"Over the past decade, we've seen the emergence of a new threat to global networks and as such have deployed a large 150Gbps network as a way or handling large attacks,\" the spokesperson said, adding that once the attacks reach Psychz Networks' network, they apply Access Control List Rules ( ACLs) blocking traffic at the edge of their network. \n\"The second stage of mitigation involves inspecting and analyzing each packet ensuring no malicious, service disrupting traffic makes it through to our clients.\" \nAnybody who would like to learn more about Psychz Networks is welcome to visit their user-friendly website; there, they can read about the top quality services that they provide. \nAbout Psychz Networks: \nPsychz has been in the web hosting industry since 2001 and now operates its own infrastructures, networks, and in-house staff.
