Summit is now launching a small pilot program.\nFacebook's founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the partnership with Summit is \"an example of how educators and engineers can team up to unlock more potential than we could have otherwise.\"\nThis is just the latest move by a major technology company and a growing number of start-ups to focus on education as an area ripe for disruption.\nGoogle's Chromebooks and Apple devices are becoming commonplace in classrooms. Other companies have taken aim at education software. One start-up, AltSchool, raised $100 million earlier this year for a network of private schools using custom technology to help educate kids.\nEducation is a cause that Zuckerberg has championed. Four years ago he made a $100 million gift to turn the Newark's failing public schools into \"a symbol of educational excellence for the whole nation.\" The effort has floundered.\nIn June Zuckerberg gave $5 million to provide college scholarships for undocumented students.\nCox says feedback from the Summit pilot program will be used to improve the software so it can eventually be offered for free \"to any school in the U.S. that wants it.\"\nCox says the educational software does not require a Facebook account and is subject to \"strict privacy controls\" to protect student data.\n6 CONNECT 64 TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1ECP1ns TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1ECP1ns&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768903945335361-Zuckerberg.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1ECP1ns&text=Facebook%20is%20building%20free%20educational%20software&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dcc982e8ed28edbe24141c93759ed7448c9e2642/c=58-0-965-682&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768903945335361-Zuckerberg.JPG", "http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/09/introducing-facebook-and-summits-k-12-education-project/", "http://usat.ly/1ECP1ns"], "published": "2015-09-03T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:23:51.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
