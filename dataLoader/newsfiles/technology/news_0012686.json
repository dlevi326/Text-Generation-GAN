(OTCQB: IWSY); Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Finjan (NASDAQ: FNJN), Route1 (TSX VENTURE: ROI) \nMcAfee \nMr. Raj Samani, McAfee, EMEA CTO, told us, \"If I utter the words cyber, what is the term that springs to mind? In most cases they will be negative, such as crime, espionage, war, etc. However the reality is that this is only one side of the coin, and one term that is often forgotten is opportunity. Technology has transformed every industry, every person, every section of society. We have to recognize this and maximize the opportunities for the benefit of each of us, but do so in a way that reduces the risk to a level we are all comfortable with.\" \nFor our complete interview with Mr. Raj Samani, McAfee, EMEA CTO, please click here \nFor more information: www.McAfee.com / NasdaqGS INTC \n\nHP Enterprise Services \nMr. Carl Bradley, U.S. Navy (Ret.), Information Assurance & IT Security, Consulting & Intelligence Strategy, HP Enterprise Services, U.S. Public Sector , told us, \"There are three key challenges our clients face today. First, cyber threats are ever-changing and becoming more sophisticated by the day. Cyber terrorism and targeted cybercriminal activities are directly impacting both the public and private sectors. They are persistent and yet, based on our research into exploit trends in 2014, attackers continue to leverage well known techniques to compromise systems and networks. Many vulnerabilities exploited in 2014 took advantage of code written many years ago and adversaries continue to leverage classic avenues for attack against client-side and server-side applications. Anti-virus signatures only catch approximately 45 percent of cyber attacks -- a truly abysmal rate. In our review of the 2014 threat landscape, we find that enterprises most successful in securing their environment employ complementary protection technologies. These technologies work best when paired with a mindset that assumes a breach will occur instead of only working to prevent intrusions and compromise from the perimeter. So our clients' security posture must be agile and responsive to better defend against threats -- internal and external -- in addition to vulnerabilities, in order to mitigate their risk\". \nFor the complete interview with Carl Bradley at HP, please click here , or here: http://securitysolutionswatch.com/Interviews/in_Boardroom_HP_CarlBradley.html \nFor more information:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T09:24:59.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
