Other charges include racketeering and money laundering. \n\"This case is not just about me. This case is about how much control we allow US corporations and the US government to have over the Internet,\" Dotcom said on Twitter before the hearing began. This case is not just about me. This case is about how much control we allow US corporations and the US government to have over the Internet — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) September 20, 2015 The judges on this case can become the champions for billions of Internet users or a handful of US content billionaires. #Hope — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) September 20, 2015 \nDotcom entered the courtroom wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap, his Mercedes SUV with the number plate \"KIM.COM\" parked outside. \nDozens of black-clad police, working in cooperation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, rappelled into Dotcom's New Zealand mansion in 2012. Years of legal wrangling ensued. \nUS authorities say Dotcom and the three other Megaupload executives cost film studios and record companies more than $500 million (£322 million) and generated more than $175 million by encouraging paying users to store and share copyrighted material, such as movies and TV shows. \nKim Dotcom in court in New Zealand \nDotcom greeted supporters in the gallery but sat apart from the other accused men in a black leather arm chair brought to the court from his mansion. He told New Zealand radio last week he needed a special chair because of back problems. \nThe case is being watched closely by the media industry and developers in the file-sharing business for signs of how far Washington is willing to go to protect US copyright holders. \nThe hearing is scheduled to take two weeks. Monday's session was largely procedural and the case will resume on Thursday. \nKim Dotcom licence plate Photo: Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T16:59:35.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
