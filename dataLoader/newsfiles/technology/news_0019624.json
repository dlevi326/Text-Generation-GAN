Morgan to a newly created senior strategy post, a sign that AbbVie plans to remain active on the deal front.\nAbbVie, a J.P. Morgan client, is naming Henry Gosebruch as its chief strategy officer, reporting to Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez effective in December, both companies said Wednesday.\nMr. Gosebruch, 42 years old, is currently co-head of North America mergers and acquisitions for J.P. Morgan, and has been with the firm since 1994, J.P. Morgan said. At AbbVie, his responsibilities will include strategic planning, licensing and acquisitions, and managing alliances with other companies, an AbbVie spokesman said. These functions have previously been split between other senior AbbVie executives.\nAbbVie created the new post and tapped Mr. Gosebruch because \"we recognized the increasingly important role that corporate strategy and business development will continue to play in our future success, and this will enable us to enhance our focus on those areas,\" the AbbVie spokesman said.\nAbbVie has been in the hunt for large deals recently. In May, it paid $21 billion to purchase blood-cancer drug developer Pharmacyclics. Last year it agreed to buy Shire PLC for about $54 billion, but subsequently abandoned the deal.\nJ.P. Morgan said Anu Aiyengar will become sole head of North America M&A; she has served as co-head with Mr. Gosebruch.\nWrite to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com\n 16, 2015 16:45 ET (20:45 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T03:18:02.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
