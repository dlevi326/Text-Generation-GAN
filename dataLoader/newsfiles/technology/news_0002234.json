The Fed retained a view that rates will likely need to rise from record lows at some point this year.\nMr Stevens said the performance of the US continues to improve and that eventually, this will have to be reflected in less accommodative monetary policy stance by the Fed.\n\"Some fretting about the first increase in US interest rates for nine years is to be expected, no matter how well telegraphed it has been,\" he said in his opening address.\n\"The more important factor, though, will be the pace of subsequent increases.\"\nThe Federal Reserve has indicated the pace is expected to be very gradual, but Mr Stevens noted that this depended on the US economy.\n\"There is a degree of irreducible uncertainty here and hence the possibility of further financial market volatility at some point,\" he said.\n\"Overall though, it seems very likely that global interest rates will still be quite low for quite some time yet.\"\nAsked to comment directly on the Fed's decision by the committee, Mr Stevens said \"I think it will be a very long time before we see anything you can call 'normal' interest rates in the US.\"\nMr Stevens noted the consensus view that a rate hike was still likely this year, saying it is \"probably going to happen before Christmas.\"\nMr Stevens also said t he Australian economy has a good chance of overcoming the end of the mining boom and slowing growth in China.\n\"There is still a pretty good chance that we will come out of this episode fairly well, and much better than we came out of previous episodes of this type,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T03:27:10.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
