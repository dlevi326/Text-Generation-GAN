The new 60-watt ME Series is specifically designed to meet the unique power supply requirements of home healthcare equipment. Meeting IEC 60601-1-2 Fourth edition electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements, the new ME60 models are also approved to AAMI ES/CSA C22.2/EN/IEC60601-1, third edition with 2x Means of Patient Protection (MOPP). The design of these external power supplies goes a step further by adhering to the new U.S. Department of Energy's Level VI efficiency requirements. \nThese new models are specifically designed for next-generation home healthcare medical devices such as surgical, patient monitoring equipment and therapeutic electro-medical devices that require a high level of EMC, EMI, and AC input performance. \n\"With the rapid advances of telemedicine and home healthcare devices, we're pleased to offer medical power solutions that provide maximum performance as well as exceed stringent medical device requirements,\" said Cochise Mapa, Director of Global Product Management. \"Design engineers can trust that our solutions meet the highest of safety standards and performance reliability.\" \nThe feature-rich power supplies use high-quality electrolytic capacitors, assuring the ME60 Series of a seven-year plus product life. \nLow common mode noise, high levels of ESD (IEC61000-4-2, level 4 standard: 8kV/15kV) and surge protection (IEC61000-4-5, level 4 standard: 2kV/4kV) help to ensure the highest overall performance. \nDemonstrating a mean time between failures (MTBF) greater than 250,000 hours, the ME Series offers Class B EMI filtering with 3db margin. In addition, with many input connection types (IEC60320 C14, C8 or C18 grounded or ungrounded; ungrounded wall-plug) these models can be used anywhere around the world. \nHoused in an impact resistant polycarbonate enclosure that adheres to the IP22 requirement for dust and water ingress protection, the desktop and wall plug models offer regulated output power with low ripple, no-load power consumption > 0.5W, and short circuit and thermal protection. With an operating temperature range of 0 degrees C to 50 degrees C, the units comply with worldwide safety and performance standards from UL, cUL, CE and RoHS. Interchangeable blade option and modified or custom designs are available as well as custom labeling. \nThe new ME Series models complement SL Power's comprehensive external power supply product offering with incremental power levels from 10 watts to 220 watts and various DC output connector options, providing maximum flexibility in form factor. \nFeaturing an industry leading three-year warranty, pricing for the ME Series models starts at $22 for production quantities and are available now through SL Power's worldwide distribution sales channels. \nFor more information on SL Power's extensive power supplies for a wide variety of demanding applications, contact a local SL Power representative who can be found on the SL Power Web site at www.slpower.com . \nAbout SL Power Electronics SL Power Electronics is a global leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of differentiated internal and external AC/DC and DC/DC power conversion solutions for demanding Medical, Test & Measurement, LED Lighting, Audio/Visual, Information Technology Equipment, Data/Telecom, Industrial and other OEM applications.
