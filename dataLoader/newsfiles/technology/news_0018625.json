The S&P 500 climbed 1.8% to 1949 while the NASDAQ rallied 2.5% to 4780.\n\nU.S. economic data \n\nU.S. productivity rose at an annualised 3.3% versus an initial estimate of a 1.3% gain making it the best growth rate since the end of 2013.\n\nMeanwhile private sector payrolls rose by 190000 in August according to Automatic Data Processing. In the previous month there had been 177000 new jobs created in the private sector.\n\nAnalysts are expecting non-farm payrolls to show a rise of 213000 jobs last month close to the 215000 seen in July. \n\nA figure around that mark might prompt the Fed to raise interest rates at their meeting on September 17.\n\n\nWall Street round-up \n\nComputer chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTL) up 2.1% at 28.41 was wanted after it introduced the 6th Generation Intel Core processor family based on a design dubbed Skylake after the market closed yesterday.\n\nAlso in demand was tax returns specialist H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) after it said it would offer to buy back up to US1.5bn of its shares. The shares jumped 7.3% to US35.37.\n\nTelecoms giant AT&T (NYSE:T) meanwhile was dismissive of an offer to its shareholders by TRC Capital to buy up to 3mln shares at 31.30 a throw.\n\nThat offer is below the current price of US32.65 (up 33 cents) and the board of AT&T urged shareholders to reject what it described as a \"mini-tender\".\n\nHandbags seller Vera Bradley (NYSE:VRA) shot up US2.92 to US13.35 after better than expected results announced this morning but discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) was friendless down US2.43 at US67.22 after a disappointing trading update released after the bell yesterday.\n\nSurgical devices maker Synergetics (NASDAQ:SURG) soared 49% to US6.55 after an agreed US6.50 a share cash offer from Canadian peer Valeant.\n\nThe offer could rise another dollar depending on whether certain targets are met.\n \nProactive Investors Australia is the market leader in producing news articles and research reports on ASX emerging companies with distribution in Australia UK North America and Hong Kong / China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:11:37.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
