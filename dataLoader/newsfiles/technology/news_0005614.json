This can be increased to 600,000 square feet by adding the optional range extender.\nFurthermore, colleges and universities do not have to pay for regulatory licenses or administrative fees. Plus, the radios operate in the 900 MHz ISM, and use hopping technology to continually change frequencies, which makes it essentially impossible for unauthorized parties to listen in.\nOther key features include: private reply, direct call, call all available, instant mute, talk permit tones, home channel, compact and lightweight design, built-in antimicrobial protection, ease-of-use, and 14-hour battery life with easy recharging in individual charging units. Multi-unit chargers that charge up to 12 radios at a time are also available.\nMore information on the groundbreaking new DLR Digital two-way radios can be found on the 2Way Supply website: http://2waysupply.com\nAbout 2Way Supply\n2Way Supply is an authorized Motorola dealer specializing in Motorola 2Way radios, parts and accessories.
