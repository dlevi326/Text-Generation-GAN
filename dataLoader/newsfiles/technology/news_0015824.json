A second version with a 5.2-inch screen, also powered by Marshmallow, is made by LG. The Nexus devices, while attracting fewer sales, are released annually to showcase what Google sees as the best use of Android on handsets.\nGoogle is looking for new ways to create demand for devices with the Android operating system, which manufacturers can use at no cost, often leading to fragmented user experiences. The software claimed 83 percent of the sector in the second quarter, slightly down from 85 percent in the year-ago period, according to IDC. Apple devices climbed to 14 percent from 12 percent.\n\"Google needs something that stands for Android,\" said Carolina Milanesi, chief of research at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech U.S. Business. \"It’s going to put pressure on partners, on the other vendors, to roll out these features and show what it is.\"\nGoogle’s Competition The company also will introduce a new “aspirational” Android device, said Sundar Pichai, who will become Google chief executive officer. Google’s event comes just days after Apple began sales of its latest smartphones, the iPhone 6s. Apple said it sold a record 13 million smartphones during the debut weekend, boosted in part by China.\nGoogle’s newest version of Android will go head-to-head with the iPhone after the search giant announced many of the updates during its massive annual developers conference in May. The new Nexus phones will ship in October to customers in the U.S., U.K. and Japan, the company said.\nA crucial new option is Android Pay, its latest effort to make get more of its users making payments on mobile. The service -- a response to the increasingly popular Apple Pay on the iPhone -- turns devices into digital wallets that store credit and debit cards, which can then be used in physical and virtual stores.\nEasier Access Another feature is Google Now on Tap, which helps users find what they are looking for on their phones, often before they even know what to ask. With the service, Google will let customers access new information and tools on a topic without even leaving an app. For example, users can search for more information on a musical artist while a song is playing. Apple, meanwhile, has rolled out a new service called 3D Touch, which lets customers press harder on an app to get more information without extra taps.", "external_links": ["http://www.idc.com/prodserv/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp\\"], "published": "2015-09-30T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T20:03:59.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
