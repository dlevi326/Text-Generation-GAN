The fall assortment is fashioned with unique color palettes, prints and patterns and affordably priced from $36 to $175. \n“We are thrilled to partner with Thakoon during one of the biggest fashion seasons of the year,” said Nancy Feldman, Kohl’s Executive Vice President of women’s apparel. “He is an award-winning designer who will bring an elevated caliber of fashion to our customers that we know they will love.” \nPanichgul, born in Thailand and raised in Omaha, Neb., brings a unique perspective to his exclusive designs for Kohl’s. He founded his namesake label, Thakoon in 2004 after honing his skills in business, editorial and merchandising. He established the brand’s aesthetic early on with a skillful blend of distinctive influences, innovative construction and textiles, and feel for a new sense of tomboy-femininity in dressing. These elements became the foundation for a global business. \n“There is a strong sense of freedom and individuality in fashion now, and I love to see how women make things their own,” said Panichgul. “Thakoon for DesigNation is a repertoire of classic pieces, each with a twist for the everyday wardrobe of the Kohl’s customer.” \nThakoon is the seventh designer to partner with Kohl’s for an exclusive DesigNation collection, introduced in the fall of 2012 with Narciso Rodriguez, followed by Derek Lam, Catherine Malandrino, Peter Som, Elie Tahari, and most recently MILLY by Michelle Smith. \nAbout Kohl's \nKohl’s (NYSE: KSS) is a leading specialty department store with 1,164 stores in 49 states.
