(PRWEB) September 24, 2015\nOneNeck® IT Solutions announced today the addition of hosting SAP® applications to its hybrid IT solutions portfolio. As an SAP-certified provider of hosting services, OneNeck will now host, manage and maintain SAP applications for customers across the U.S. The certification confirms OneNeck’s ability to deliver qualified hosting services for customers running SAP solutions.\nWhile hosting of SAP solutions may be new to OneNeck’s portfolio, the company teamed up with parent company Telephone and Data Systems to develop and deliver a jointly supported service. Clint Harder, CTO and senior vice president of Managed Services at OneNeck, said, “With our parent company’s nearly 20 years of experience managing SAP solution environments, we’ve leveraged their expertise and employee base to successfully deploy this application for a couple of clients, who now have the opportunity to focus on their business rather than their IT infrastructure.”\nAcross the country, Harder commented, businesses are looking for a strong partner to host their SAP business applications. He says, “Adding services for SAP solutions to our portfolio was a natural evolution. For years, we’ve offered support of several other ERP applications. However, we’re often asked if we ‘do SAP’ – and now we can say yes. We’re delighted to have hosting services for SAP solutions as part of our ERP portfolio. And to have earned the SAP certification for our hosting services, it simply affirms we can successfully deliver this solution.”\nAs an SAP-certified provider of hosting services, OneNeck will provide a cost-effective delivery model for mission-critical SAP applications. To achieve this certification from SAP, OneNeck’s infrastructure, physical and logical security measures, processes, portal and technical staff went through extensive review by SAP. The review process validated the operational integration of OneNeck’s support of SAP applications to ensure compliance with SAP's requirements for quality, availability and security. OneNeck successfully demonstrated their ability to perform a range of IT services related to SAP applications, from initial proof-of-concepts to rapid deployments for customers of their SAP solutions.\nTo further ensure ongoing high standards for the management of SAP solutions, SAP-certified providers of hosting services undergo a rigorous assessment of their delivery and support capabilities every two years by SAP’s outsourcing partner certification group.\nOneNeck offers a full suite of hybrid IT solutions.
