Doctors, parents, midwives, scientific journals all seem to echo this same fact time and again. Breast milk: the all purpose solution to your baby’s problems. It doesn’t just stop here. Breast milk actually customizes itself to the baby’s needs over the months of its growth. Katie Hinde, an evolutionary biologist shed light on the amazing exchange between a mother’s nipple and her baby that in turn makes it understand exactly what the child needs. According to Hinde, when a baby suckles at its mother’s breast, a vacuum is created. Within that vacuum, the infant’s saliva is sucked back into the mother’s nipple. She calls it “baby spit backwash”. Receptors in the mammary gland of the mother read the saliva as signals. The spit backwash contains the information about the baby’s immunity status. So if the mammary gland receptors detect the presence of pathogens, they compel the mother’s body to produce antibodies to fight it. The antibodies thus produced, travel through breast milk back into the baby’s body, where they target the infection. This thing keeps working in a loop and based on the need of the baby, breast milk keeps making changes accordingly. This theory throws light on how the magic of breast milk works and how important it is for the baby.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T17:29:08.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
