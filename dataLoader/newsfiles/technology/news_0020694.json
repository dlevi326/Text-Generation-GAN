Bloomberg by Lex Netflix is coming to Spain. \"Bienvenidos!\" was the tweet from a rival digital television provider, Wuaki TV, although it spiked the greeting with an image of a belligerent looking man and the words: \"We're waiting for you.\"\nIf Netflix's history of foreign invasions is a guide, it is Wuaki, owned by Japanese internet group Rakuten, that has more to fear when its US challenger arrives in October. Even where there is an established incumbent, such as Lovefilm in the UK, Netflix has triumphed with keen prices and keenly-awaited content such as House of Cards . Arriving later means a tougher battle but also permits lessons from the missteps of predecessors.\nIn Japan, where Netflix is launching this week, it is promising cheaper prices and more Japanese content than the entry offering from Hulu, which struggled at launch. Netflix spans more than 50 countries and 65 million subscribers, of which 23 million are outside the US.\nBut that comes at a cost. Netflix makes big operating losses in its non-US business - last quarter $US92 million on revenues of $US455 million - and has warned that they should worsen before peaking next year when launches are scheduled to include China and India. With a never-ending battle for content, Netflix's free cash flow has been negative for the past four quarters, $US229.3 million for the three months to June.\nFounder and chief executive Reed Hastings has been proved right in fending off shareholder calls to sell the company and aggressively pursuing growth in digital streaming.\nHis overseas expansion has captured the imagination of subscribers and investors alike. Last quarter it predicted 2.5 million new subscribers, but ended up with 3.3 million. The company predicts that it will break even next year before recording \"material global profits\" in 2017.\nYet after surging this year, Netflix's market capitalisation is now $US50 billion, about 265 times 2016 earnings. It is hard to see where the moats are around the business that would allow Netflix to ever charge enough subscribers enough money to justify that valuation.\nNor is there any sign that content, whose suppliers are increasingly also competitors, is going to cost less. With unusual frankness, Mr Hastings seems to agree. He has previously described a 2013 stock market valuation as a \"hype fest\". Today, with the stock 148 per cent higher, he sees a \"mystery\". His words deserve more attention.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:39:06.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
