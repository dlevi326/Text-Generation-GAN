Credit: Andrew Engilis/UC Davis \nDuring the warmer months, the air surrounding California's rivers and streams is alive with the flapping of wings and chirping of birds. But once the buzz and breeding of spring and summer are over, these riparian areas grow quiet. Sometimes it seems as though there are hardly any birds there at all. \nNot so, according to a study from the UC Davis Department of Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology. \nResearchers examined bird diversity in the lower Cosumnes River and lower Putah Creek watersheds in the Central Valley between 2004 and 2012. They found that just as many bird species used the riparian habitats in the winter as in the summer, and genetic diversity was actually higher in the winter than during summer months. \nIt turns out that while many birds headed south for the winter to tropical habitats, birds that breed in the boreal forest of Canada flew in to take their place. These \"neotemperate migrants,\" as the researchers call them, include birds such as the yellow-rumped warbler, white-crowned sparrow, fox sparrow, cedar waxwing, and varied thrush. \n\"You might have to look harder, but there are just as many species there,\" said lead author Kristen Dybala, a UC Davis postdoctoral student at the time of the study and currently a research ecologist with Point Blue Conservation Science. \"We found strong evidence that Central Valley ecosystems are very important in supporting bird populations throughout the year.\" \nCold Comfort \nThis study highlights the need to protect and restore riparian habitats to support birds throughout their annual life cycle—not just during the breeding times of spring and summer. Often neglected in conservation planning, wintering habitat can be key to a songbird's survival, affecting its reproductive success, migration timing, and overall health. The fox sparrow is a common species seen during the summertime in the Central Valley.

Bay Area thrushes nest together, winter together, and face change together June 18, 2013 \nSwainson' s Thrushes, from a local population near Bolinas, CA spend their winters together in Mexico, according to a new tracking study released by Point Blue Conservation Science, (Point Blue, formerly PRBO). This result ... Arctic ducks combine nutrients from wintering and breeding grounds to grow healthy eggs May 20, 2015 \nIt takes a lot of nutrients to build an egg. One of the big questions among researchers who study the eggs of migratory birds is where those nutrients come from—does the mother make the egg directly out of what she eats ... California sage-grouse remain genetically diverse... for now September 16, 2015 \nGenetic diversity is essential for a species to be able to adapt to environmental change, and when habitat loss divides a population into small, isolated fragments, that can spell trouble. Northeastern California is at the ... Tiny endangered songbirds given second chance at survival September 22, 2015 \nSeven Florida grasshopper sparrows, among the world's most endangered birds, have been given a second chance at survival in the care of researchers working to save threatened species across the planet. Geolocators used to link breeding and wintering populations of Prothonotary Warblers September 22, 2015 \nProthonotary Warblers are stunningly beautiful and highly migratory birds closely tied to their preferred breeding habitat: swamps and other forested wetlands in the eastern United States. Scientists have noted that Prothonotary ...

A gene that makes male mosquitoes more fertile could also increase malaria transmission September 23, 2015 \nMalaria is a deadly disease transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. Curiously, only female mosquitoes bite – male mosquitoes only feed on sugar, not on blood. That is because male mosquitoes do not need an extra ... Physiologists uncover a new code at the heart of biology September 23, 2015 \nUT Southwestern physiologists trying to understand the genetic code have found a previously unknown code that helps explain which protein should be created to form a particular type of cell. Mantis shrimp found to spar safely with deadly weapons September 23, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—A pair of biology researchers at Duke University has found that the mantis shrimp engages in an unusual form of sparring during territorial disputes—hammering each other on their tailplates.
