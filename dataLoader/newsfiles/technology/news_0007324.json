The nose was removed and the tool used seems to be an angle grinder,\" spokesperson Merle Collins told the publication.\n\"We are cleaning up as much as we can, and are assessing the damage. We have also increased security.\"\nThis new act of vandalism targeting the image of British imperialist Rhodes comes shortly after Maxwele on Friday won a High Court ruling against his suspension by the University of Cape Town (UCT).\nChumani was suspended as a student at UCT on May 1, for allegedly racially abusing and threatening a lecturer, pending a disciplinary hearing into the allegations.\nHe was deemed a potential risk to staff and students, and prohibited from attending classes, but was allowed to do so, as well as use the library, after the terms of the suspension order against him were varied.\nSpeaking to the Citizen following the High Court ruling, Maxwele said it \"confirms that the suspension was politically motivated\".\nHe also stated that the RMF movement would now continue its efforts to purge the UCT campus of any and all vestiges of South Africa's colonial past.\nBut has the RMF movement perhaps extended its protests to colonial landmarks outside of the university campus?\nSince Rhodes is already gone from campus, and the transformation debate is raging on, is the removal of the British imperialistâ€™s olfactory extremity a sign that RMF has simply run out of ideas?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:20:48.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
