A State by State Look SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Qualcomm is slashing more than 1,300 full-time jobs in San Diego and has cut hundreds more in other states. The San Diego Union-Tribune ( http://bit.ly/1NAjW5H ) says the smartphone chip maker sent out 60-day notices Thursday telling San Diego employees that their final work day is Nov. 20. A statement by Qualcomm President Derek Aberle says the company is providing outplacement help and severance packages. Qualcomm announced in July that it plans a 15-percent cut in its global workforce of around 31,300 employees over the next year. Around half of its workers are in San Diego, where the company's based. Qualcomm also confirmed that it cut 130 jobs in the San Francisco Bay Area, 158 jobs in Boulder, Colorado and 65 in Andover, Massachusetts. --- Information from: The San Diego Union-Tribune, http://www.utsandiego.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T09:26:04.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
