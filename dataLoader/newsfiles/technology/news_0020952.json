Answer: Surprisingly, at The Buzz Oates Group of Companies these days, the answer is: Almost none. That’s because the Sacramento-based commercial property management company has retrofitted almost all of its 25 million square feet of property it manages with long-life, energy-saving LED lighting. With LEDs’ operational life spans of 100,000 hours, compared with 5,000 hours for traditional incandescent lamps, the need for labor-intensive lamp replacement has virtually disappeared. Add in the substantial energy savings that LEDs provide, excellent light quality and superior reliability, and the result is a significant property upgrade. Such an upgrade, however, is about much more than just changing lights. New fixtures need to be installed, and the cost of the LED lamps is substantial. “We started an energy efficiency plan about three years ago, looking first at our exterior lighting.” says Amy Lerseth, Senior Vice President with The Buzz Oates Group of Companies. “The energy savings were going to be significant, but the payback period was five years or more.” That’s where Buzz Oates’ long term partnership with SMUD came in. SMUD Strategic Account Advisor Jane Agatep helped identify which lights were approved under their programs and what the rebates and incentives would be. Agatep and her team of SMUD Energy Advisors crunched the numbers, and the payback period dropped to about three years. That was a much easier sell to the property owners and started the ball rolling. “Sacramento is not like the Bay Area where properties are scarce.” says Agatep. “Sacramento area tenants are very smart and won't rent a space just because of the price. They are looking at a wide range of criteria: Is it energy efficient? Does it have LEED certification? How is the quality of the lighting and the HVAC?” The upgrades that have been done to the company properties have been especially beneficial to Buzz Oates property manager Nicole Clancy because most of the 800,000 feet that she manages is for state government clients. “The state has very specific sustainability standards, and SMUD understands them very well. Jane and I work well together because she is the intermediary between the SMUD engineers and me. She helps us get the applications started and then assigns us an energy advisor who will stay with us throughout the project.” The lighting upgrade was the “low hanging fruit” in terms of its relatively low investment compared to its immediate energy savings. Buzz Oates has saved over fifty percent on its lighting costs because of the program, and has reduced its overall energy bills by more than 20 percent. These savings are shared with the tenants along with other very tangible improvements. SMUD’s Agatep adds: “The color clarity and ambiance from incandescent or CFL to LED is a huge improvement. Work spaces are brighter, safer and make tenants more productive.” Buoyed by the success of its lighting program, Buzz Oates Management Services, with SMUD’s guidance and encouragement, has taken another bold initiative with some of its properties – the replacement of aging cooling towers. “The cooling towers installed in our office buildings are energy saving devices in themselves. They have been aging, though. Some of them are about 15 years old and are reaching the end of their useful lives.” says Buzz Oates’ Amy Lerseth. She turned to her SMUD strategic account advisor and found that demand savings of about eight percent could be achieved with new cooling towers, featuring variable frequency drives. SMUD’s Agatep adds: “You would probably say eight percent is not very much. Actually it is and the benefits go even further.” Additionally, the new cooling tower can keep an HVAC system running much longer. Instead of it being replaced after 10 or 15 years, it can operate 20 years or more because of its energy efficiency. And, tenants will be more comfortable and remain happier with their property. “I would definitely recommend that any property manager use SMUD as their go-to for energy efficiency projects,” concludes Clancy. “SMUD will give you all the information, help develop a plan, and they know where the rebates are.” Property managers with buildings that are 15 to 25 years old are encouraged to contact a SMUD strategic energy advisor to see what cost saving, energy efficiency programs they may qualify for.
