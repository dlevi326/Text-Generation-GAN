They also call for registration of drones. \n\"We need a requirement for registration. That would allow us to identify those abusing the rules and stop them from flying,\" Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head of the DFS German air traffic authority, said. \nMany cities have no-fly areas for drones already, but that has not stopped people from sending them up. Just this year, police have investigated drones over restricted areas in France, and, across the Atlantic, over the White House. \nIn much of Berlin, for example, operators need a licence to fly higher than 30 metres. Scheurle said the DFS awarded 125 permits for people seeking to fly drones on the city's disused Tempelhof airfield on one sunny day, but estimates around eight times as many were actually flying. \nAustraliaâ€™s Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) will soon formally relax restrictions on the use of small drones by commercial operators. \nUnder the changes, operators of the small commercial drones will be able to fly the devices without a certificate as long as they do so within certain parameters. \nThe unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators will need to fly the aircraft outside controlled airspace and restricted areas, be more than 5 km from the boundary of an airport, and maintain a direct line of site with the aircraft. \nOperators will only be allowed to fly over non-populous areas, no less than 30m away from anyone else involved in operating the aircraft, and cannot fly the aircarft any more than 400ft above the ground, and fly during daylight hours only. \nThe authority expects to formalise the new rules later this year, for implementation in 2016. \nThe problem is not going to go away. Scheurle expects drones will proliferate as the technology gets cheaper. \n\"It's fun to fly them,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T02:17:34.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
