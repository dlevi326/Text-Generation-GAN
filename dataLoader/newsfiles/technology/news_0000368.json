Jayakumar said at Sriharikota, about 90km from Chennai. \nThe launch comes one year after India became the first Asian country to launch a successful mission to Mars to study the Red Planet, beating giant rival China and sparking an outpouring of national pride. \nThe unmanned probe, still orbiting Mars, cost a fraction of the missions launched earlier by the United States, Russia and Europe. \nIndia's Astrosat, which includes a telescope that uses x-ray, is expected to orbit 650km above the Earth and will send back data and study parts of the universe including black holes and the magnetic fields of stars. \nAstrosat, which reportedly cost 1.8 billion rupees ($A38.43 million) to build, has been compared by local media to the famous Hubble telescope launched by NASA in 1990. But Astrosat is much smaller and has a limited life span of five years. \nThe rocket also carries six foreign satellites, including the first from the United States. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T21:48:03.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
