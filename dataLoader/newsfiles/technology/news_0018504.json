But will looks matter when you can have a 13MP selfie camera to capture your world in high detail? Who will hold the high ground when ZTE Blade D6 and Huawei Honor 7i come face-to-face? - Advertisement - \nWith only a $20 price difference between the two, it should be a close fight. It is all about what your needs are in getting a new smartphone, and you can use this comparison as a basis before making that decision. Let’s find out a little background information for the both of them first. \nIntroducing the Blade D6 (also known as Blade V6) wich seems to be launched first in Europe as well as in other parts of the world – rather than in its native China. You can say that is a surprising but at the same time, a bold move indeed. \nAs for the Honor 7i, it takes its leaf from the Honor 7 which is a worthy flagship albeit an expensive one. And it comes with a twist where it now put an emphasis on becoming a great selfie phone. We have seen how Oppo has done it before where the primary camera can be rotated to become the secondary camera that is quite cool. This is the route taken by the Honor 7i, and we shall see whether it has all the other necessary hardware to support it. \nFirst up as usual is on the physical department where the Blade D6 comes in weighing in at just 120g and at 6.95mm thin, which is very slim and lightweight for its size indeed. It even gets better because it is using aluminum alloy body to enhance its style further and comes with the benefit of weight reduction. The result is that the Blade D6 simply looks amazing. \nMeanwhile for the Honor 7i, it comes without a metal body like the Honor 7 (presumably to reduce cost) and has a body measurement of 141.6 x 71.2 x 7.8 mm (5.57 x 2.80 x 0.31 in) and weighs 160 g (5.64 oz), which is great. It may lack the style and substance, but there’s the fingerprint sensor that adds value to the smartphone. You can use it to unlock the device or use it for more serious stuff like authorizing payment as part of the biometric system. \nFor good looks, there’s no denying the fact that the Blade D6 wins hands down. Its metal body makes it simply irresistible. \nNow let’s move on to the screen aspect of things and we can see that the Blade D6 is sporting a 5-inch High Definition IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 720 x 1280 pixels or ~294 ppi pixel density. Considering its size, it could have gone for Full HD instead but is still acceptable, though. \nAs compared to the Honor 7i which has a 5.2-inch Full HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~424 ppi pixel density. This upgrade in screen allows you more space to work on, and you should enjoy the IPS technology as well. \nNot only does the Honor 7i has a slightly larger screen, but it also benefits from the higher pixel count as well. \nIn terms of raw processing power, the Blade D6 is equipped with the Mediatek MT6735 chipset paired with a Quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, Mali-T720MP2 and 2GB RAM. The combination makes for a medium level kind of performance where it probably won’t disappoint you as you run all of your favorite apps and games. \nBut it will get slaughtered with Honor 7i and its Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising Quad-core 1.7 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53 and Adreno 405 graphics. There are 2 variants available, with 2GB memory tied with 16GB storage and 3GB memory with 32GB storage. \nThe Blade D6 is still a decent performer well within the mid-range level but the Honor 7i simply blows it away due to a better chipset and doubles the number of cores. - Advertisement - \nCamera-wise, the Blade D6 comes with a 13MP-5MP combination that makes for a decent point-and-shoot camera. The primary camera is blessed with 4128 x 3096 pixels, autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection and panorama which is quite the standard that you would expect from a mid-range smartphone. \nAnd on the camera department is where the Honor 7i is expected to shine the brightest – with its rotating camera. Featuring a 13 Megapixel camera with 4208 x 3120 pixels, autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama, you can rotate its lens at many angles until it is facing you and becomes just like a secondary camera. Produced by Sony, it has an f/2.0 aperture and a 28mm wide-angle lens, plus it’s covered in sapphire crystal which makes it scratch-resistant. Remember the fingerprint sensor that we mentioned earlier? It is placed at the side instead of the back of the device as usual, and this could also double up as a button to snap a photo. It would be very convenient indeed for anyone to take photos. \nBy taking lots of pictures, then you probably need a good amount of storage, and the Blade D6 does not disappoint. With 16GB of internal storage, you can further expand it with the available microSD slot. But do take note that if you do that, you will then have to sacrifice your 2 nd sim. \nAs mentioned earlier, there are two variants when it comes to storage on the Honor 7i – 16GB and 32GB. Plus it also has a microSD slot that can take in up to a maximum of 128GB should you need to expand further. In case you do so, you will then have to sacrifice the 2 nd sim slot as well. \nSo no difference between the two it seems. \nOn the operating system side of things then, the Blade D6 comes with MiFavor 3.2 which is based on Android Lollipop 5.0. The customized version of the OS has its benefits as it provides a clean and responsive interface. \nMeanwhile for Honor 7i, it has the latest Android Lollipop 5.1 which comes with Emotion UI 3.1. The objective is similar, which is to provide a buttery smooth experience. \nFinally we come in terms of the battery, and we have the Blade D6 having the Li-Ion 2200 mAh battery which might struggle to last you for a full day if you are a heavy user. Best if you can invest slightly more to get yourself a power bank. \nYou should expect no such struggles on the Honor 7i as it is powered by a non-removable Li-Po 3100 mAh battery. That’s like almost 50% more and should have no issues supplying enough juice to it for at least a day or two in between charging. \nTo top it all off, both of them do have 4G LTE connectivity and dual sim capability that is a nice addition. - Advertisement - \nWith a metal body, it automatically gives ZTE Blade D6 a boost in terms of its look and feel. Filled with decent hardware, it might not be the latest but it ticks the entire boxes well. Perhaps it could have a slightly bigger battery size, but other than that; it is a pretty solid smartphone. \nAll said and done; Huawei Honor 7i seems to be beating the Blade D6 on almost every quarter except on the good looks part. It comes with a larger screen and higher resolution, rotating camera lens and bigger battery as well. That should justify the slightly higher $20 price difference, but ultimately the decision is up to you. \nThe ZTE Blade D6 is available for approximately $279 USD, or close to the equivalent in your market and is available in Pink, Gold, Gray and Silver. \nHuawei Honor 7i is currently available in China for approximately $299 for the 16GB model. It is available in black, white and gold. News From", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T04:24:05.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
