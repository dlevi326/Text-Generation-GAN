Helping our customers address these through a simple platform is what's helping drive overall health and wellness outcomes â€“as well as the business bottom line.\" \nAccording Mike Gotta research vice president for collaboration and social software at Gartner Research, in the Hype Cycle for Human Capital Management Software, 2015 \"The traditional rationale for wellness programs has been to reduce the health costs borne by the employer. However, an emerging viewpoint is that organizations need to look beyond the cost argument and examine how a consumer-driven wellness scenrio can positively influence employee engagement and an organization's cultural and business productivity.\" \nThe Hype Cycle for Consumer Engagement With Healthcare and Wellness, 2015 tracks the technologies and technology-related ideas that will have the greatest impact on consumer engagement with health and wellness. According to analyst, Jeff Cribbs , \"Health and wellness systems are rising to the Plateau of Productivity by better coordinating with incentive programs, incorporating wellness devices and apps, and using gamified approaches that demonstrate value through improved social cohesion among employees.\" \nHype Cycle for Human Capital Management Software, 2015 helps organizations make the most of their investments in human capital management software by providing insight into the maturity of key applications and technologies. The report found that a growing number of organizations of all sizes are switching to cloud-based HCM offerings versus choosing to continue to invest in their existing on-premises applications. Additionally, digital workplace, smart machines and personalization are beginning to have a greater impact within HCM. \nThe Hype Cycle for Digital Workplace, 2015 demonstrates that the digital workplace is a potent mix of technology, human capital, and consumer trends. Mike Gotta finds that bring your own wellness (BYOW) helps employees achieve personal wellness goals through the use of \"quantified self\" applications that leverage wearable and mobile devices, mobile apps, personalized sensors, communities and social networking (for advice, personal support, coaching and contests or challenges). \nThe Hype Cycle for U.S. Healthcare Payers, 2015 tracks the maturity and adoption rates of technology developments occurring in the U.S. healthcare payer market. Payer CIOs can use this research to stratify investments to become effective digital payers in a new competitive environment. \n1 Gartner, Hype Cycle for Consumer Engagement With Healthcare and Wellness, 2015 Published: 23 July 2015 2 Gartner, Hype Cycle for Human Capital Management Software, 2015, Published: 04 August 2015 3 Gartner, Hype Cycle for Digital Workplace, 2015, Published: 22 July 2015 4 Gartner, Hype Cycle for U.S. Healthcare Payers, 2015, Published: 1 July 2015 \nGartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.
