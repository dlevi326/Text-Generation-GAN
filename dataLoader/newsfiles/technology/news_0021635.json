It has intelligent pairing, which makes connecting and moving back and forth easier between devices. Weighing 140 grams, the ear pads are made of pillow soft memory foam and the ear cups fold flat. The BackBeat Sense is equipped with Signature Plantronics audio and dynamic drives for creating balance of bass, highs and natural mid-tones. It has advanced class One Bluetooth with a range of up to 100 meters and dual mics for HD communication, along with an open Mic technology for cutting down outside noise. \nThe Voyager Focus UC, priced at Rs 18,999, is targeted at a niche audience. This is a wireless stereo UC headset with Active Noise Cancellation. Designed for the enterprise workers who work in an open office or loud work environments, the Focus UC claims to cut down on the surrounding noise using its Active Noise cancellation feature. It has three tuned microphones and extended class 1 Bluetooth range delivering up to 45 meters of wireless range. It is equipped with mute alert technology which senses speech and alerts the user of the mute mode. The headset looks premium with the leatherette ear cushions wrapped around pillow-soft memory foam. The smart sensors allow one to answer calls automatically when the headset is worn and mutes the call when it is taken off. It also supports communication applications from Microsoft, Cisco and Avaya. \nBobby Joseph, senior country director, Plantronics India and Middle East, says, \"Audio experiences are increasingly being challenged, especially as traditional office environments expand to include workers in more remote and non-traditional, open office environments that introduce more external noise factors. We tried to think of every collaboration challenge and built a solution that solves for them. \"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:26:22.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
