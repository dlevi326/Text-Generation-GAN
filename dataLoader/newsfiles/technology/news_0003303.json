The term Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) primarily concerns locating people and things at a distance, securely, using second generation RFID. The subjects are converging with Apple, Samsung, Google, Nokia, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard and IBM clashing for the tens of billions of dollars of business that is emerging. The first $0.5 billion order has been landed. This subject heavily involves short range communications notably WiFi and Bluetooth and inertial navigation and advanced RFID as it progresses to determining 3D position including orientation and line of travel. \nEmergency services, healthcare, retailing, manufacturing, logistics and many other industries will be transformed by what is becoming possible. \nThe winners in making and operating mobile phones will offer the most compelling new functionality, IPS being a major enabler. The winners in making, integrating and operating RTLS will reduce cost and improve usefulness, not least to encompass mobile phones and other mobile computing. The world's largest companies are locking horns on this. \nThe topics of IPS and RTLS embrace a value chain from research and consultancy to software, services, hardware, integration and facilities management. Mobile phone app developers and value added enhancements plus ecosystems of mobile phones, web services and more are also involved. \nKey Topics Covered \n1. Executive Summary And Conclusions \n2. Introduction \n3. Manufacturers, Service Providers And Developers In The IPS And RTLS Value Chains - Up To Nine Parameters And Commentary For 104 Organisations \n4. Case Studies Of IPS And RTLS In Action \n5. Company Interviews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:48:38.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
