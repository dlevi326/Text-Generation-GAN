Japan went into this game in winning form with notable victories over far higher rated teams, whereas the Boks went into this game in losing form as we well know.\nEddie Jones has been absolutely brilliant in his tactical coaching by finding effective solutions for Japan to overcome their physical shortcomings, proving to the Boks that the days of winning by brute force is over in modern rugby.\nWhat had me shouting for Japan to win in the dying minutes of the game was their unwavering self belief, confidence and determination. Demonstrating to the Boks that experience and talent amounts to little without essential psychological coaching. I love the Boks, but I love brilliant passionate rugby even more.\nThe game of rugby is constantly evolving as the rules keep changing to encourage a fast paced running game, and the loss against Japan clearly demonstrated just how outdated Springbok rugby has become. One can just hope that S.A rugby as a whole will finally wake up to the fact that we are no longer able to just physically pummel the opposition into submission , and it's a self delusion S.A rugby has been suffering from for too many years.\nThe old battering ram tactics doggedly performed last night was useless, and it only leads to an ever growing injury bench. Yes, we'll still overpower some lowly ranked teams, but the stats conclusively prove it won't work against the top ranked teams...including Japan, oh and Argentina.\nWe can only wonder what exactly Heyneke Mayer and his couching staff were doing for so long to prepare the Boks for this world cup. He somehow pulled off the remarkable feat by producing the worst Springbok team ever with the most experienced lineup.\nProbably never before in rugby has coaching so terribly undermined player ability. What we saw was not a Boks TEAM performance, but a few individual moments of good play.\nSidestepping, offloading in the tackle, staying on your feet, running through the gaps...these are basic skills we can but only dream of seeing from the Boks with Heyneke in charge. Wouldn't it be a wonderful thing to see Schalk Burger just for once sidestepping his opponents instead of just stupidly running into them, staying on his feet as he surges forward and offloads in the tackle to the support player speeding through the gap for a try? He's capable of doing it, I know he is.\nHe's certainly not one of the lazy ones. The same goes for nearly every other Bok. We habitually groan BEAST when Mtawarira gets the ball, but what we should be shouting is STAY ON YOUR FEET!!! No instead they all seem to dive head first into the ground to gain a dismal metre of ground to no avail.\nOh, how we miss Joost van der Westhuizen! Maybe it's just me, but I have never seen such unpredictable scrumhalf play. Can't they learn a thing or two from Joost on how to surprise the opposition.The Boks are flat footed every time from the moment the scrumhalf passes the ball.\nAnd poor Jean De Villiers. It's not his fault that S.A rugby has this illogical habit of sticking to their chosen captain, seemingly regardless of his playing ability. Did we not learn anything from carting John Smit to the previous world cup? Never pick an injured out of form player for a game, even if he's experienced, and especially not if he's captain. His supposed remarkable captaincy skills certainly didn't steady the ship against Japan. Come to think, when last has Jean actually played 80 minutes of world class rugby?\nWhich brings me to how we perceive S.A rugby in comparison to reality and the other top nations. Selecting players based on some good performances in the distant past, now tinged with nostalgia, is never a wise decision. And S.A rugby certainly don't need to, considering the wealth of talented young players at our disposal.\nI noted with some interest that 7 of the 20 nations in this world cup have a New Zealander as head coach. Quite a remarkable statistic indicating the desire for aspiring nations (Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Fiji, Canada, Georgia and New Zealand of course) to learn from the best for some All Black magic.\nI really hoped The Rugby Paper's Essential World Cup Guide (a U.K magazine) was wrong in their prediction, calling the Boks a 'Jurassic pack may be starting to creak' amongst other sharp and valid critique. But it seems the rugby world is seeing the Boks for what they really are. With Hayneke on his way out, the big question will soon be; Do we have a truly world class coach in S.A? And more importantly; When will we swallow our pride and look for one elsewhere? I believe that without effective couching the Boks will certainly need more Vaseline.\nPS: Perhaps we can buy Eddie Jones back, he was after all our assistant coach of our 2007 world cup victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:04:11.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
