When his heart rate still had not decreased from 145 beats per minute by the evening, Houle brought it up with his trainer, who referred him to the school nurse. \n\"I had pain in my chest and my back whenever I took some deep breaths,\" Houle told Boston-based news outlet WCVB 5. \"I could just feel my heart pounding, so after practice I went and took a nap and my heart rate was still at 145 that I noticed on my Apple Watch.

In extreme cases, rhabdomyoloysis can lead to limb amputation or even death. \n\"I'm just grateful that he's healthy. I remember when the Apple Watch was coming out and I said 'OK, there's no way I'm ever buying one',\" said Houle's father. \"I went out on Saturday and purchased one for my wife and for myself.\" \nHoule has revealed he has an internship with Apple lined up for when he finishes high school next summer.
