Yet, understanding when the perfect time for your body to conceive can be difficult. In order to lessen the stress, we found wearables that will help determine your ovulating days and make your chances of having a baby that much higher. \nMost of these devices are measuring basal body temperature (BBT).

It is also an important clue for women who are tracking their menstrual cycles and want to know their most fertile days. \nYono is an in-ear wearable thermometer that captures your BBT. It creates a closed and controlled environment in the ear canal which makes the measurements that much more precise. It´s very comfortable to wear and you only use it at night.
