The official video stream will go live at exactly 12AM this morning here in Manila. Note, however, that viewers can only watch the keynote online with Safari 6.0.5 or later on OS X 10.8.5 or later, or Safari on iOS 7 or later. For the first time in a long time, Windows users can catch it as well if they're running the Edge browser on Windows 10. You may also watch CNET's live commentary video here: What to expect? Here are some purported 'insider information' about the upcoming iPhone that I've been reading about in tech websites and blogs these past few weeks. These are the ones that - I think - are well founded and could very well turn out accurate. Largely The Same Design According to rumors, iPhone 6S will look almost identical to the current model - the iPhone 6 - but will be available in more colors -- including 'Rose Gold', which is a new device hue introduced by Apple on the 2015 Macbook. Notice that Apple iPhone 4S looks largely the same as the iPhone 4 and you can say the thing about the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5. This pattern reflects Apple's product design strategy so it's a big chance that the upcoming iPhone will simply borrow its aesthetics and design elements from the current model. New Touchscreen with Pressure Sensitivity Apple's new Force Touch technology that incorporates pressure sensitivity for making new touchscreen gestures has made its way to the Apple Watch and the TouchPad of the new Macbook. Off hand, it appears that Apple intends to bring this feature to its entire product line so there's reason to believe that the next iPhone will likewise sport this unique innovation. Improved Internal Hardware The iPhone 6 runs on the 64-bit Apple A8 processor and many iPhone fans already expecting this year's model to feature a faster and more energy-efficient Apple A9 chipset. Analysts say that this CPU will be complemented by 2 GB of RAM for improved multitasking, which will be a welcome boost given that some flagship smartphones from last year already have 3 GB of RAM. 12 MegaPixel Camera with Optical Image Stabilization Ever since iPhone 3GS, the Cupertino company has been introducing considerable upgrades to its smartphone's imaging capabilities via models having the S-suffix (and then retaining the enhancements on the follow-up release flaunting a new design). This year, it is believed that Apple will upgrade the iPhone 6's 8 MegaPixel camera to 12 MegaPixels on the iPhone 6S (which will most likely be the same camera that will be on the iPhone 7 in 2016). Aside from increasing the size of photos that you can take using the handset, Apple is expected to give the camera module a better aperture and image sensor as well as optical image stabilization, which the iPhone 6 doesn't have. iPhone 6S Plus, 'Hey Siri', Apple TV, and iPad Pro Aside from iPhone 6S, Apple is also expected to unveil the iPhone 6S Plus, which is an updated version of the company's first ever phablet release from last year. While the 2015 version is rumored to flaunt the same design as its predecessor, insiders say that it will have improved internal hardware and feature Force Touch technology just like the smaller iPhone 6S . Both handsets, according to various sources, will come with an updated version of Apple's virtual assistant Siri. One key new feature is 'Hey, Siri', which lets the user call on the service and make commands from anywhere on the phone's interface. It works a lot like Android's 'OK, Google', they say. I bet those in the US are excited to see the upgraded Apple TV, which will supposedly run the brand-new 'tvOS' operating system. This software nomenclature goes along the lines of 'watchOS' and 'iOS' for the Apple Watch and iDevice operating systems. tvOS interface is expected to include lots of new iOS 9 interface elements, including many transparency effects across the board. And finally, the Apple iPad Pro is said to be equipped with a monster 12.9-inch display, making it the biggest tablet by the Cupertino company upon launch. This massive screen along with the slate's rumored Apple A9X powerhouse chipset make it possible for iPad Pro users to view and use two full-sized iPad applications side-by-side on the device.
