The inability of the heart and blood vessels to efficiently transport oxygen to the organs is best described as Acute Circulatory Failure (ACF), which leads to organ failure and high mortality rates. This programme of research will leverage off a recent discovery by Professor Chase, which suggests that changes to the elastic properties of blood vessels could significantly restrict blood flows and hence contribute to ACF. In healthy individuals, the elastic properties of the aorta are responsible for effectively cushioning the highly pulsatile blood flow from the heart, which facilitates a more steady and constant flow of blood (and hence oxygen) to the tissues. However, in shock-induced ACF, the elastic properties of the aorta get out of sync with the pulsatile blood flows, which impairs blood flow and oxygen delivery. This study seeks to confirm and validate these initial results through both experimental and modelling work. The study furthermore aims to use a number of biomarkers related to arterial mechanics to identify the physiological and biochemical signalling pathway leading to ACF. This will shed new insight into how arterial mechanics contribute to this high mortality condition, provide new and non-invasive model-based markers for tracking and treating the condition and, if successful, provide new mechanistic insight that can be exploited to develop new and more effective drugs. \nSocial Sciences: Professor Jennifer Hay, UC, for research entitled: \"How Experience Shapes Words and Words shape Grammar\" \nPeople pronounce sounds differently. Some New Zealanders, for example, pronounce ‘fear’ and ‘fair’ as if they rhyme, but many others pronounce them differently. Differences in pronunciation are not random, but are tied to the social characteristics, backgrounds, and identities of the speakers. Words are also distributed differently across people. For example, the word ‘library’ is more likely to be used by a female New Zealander than a male New Zealander; and the word ‘gentle’ is more likely to be produced by an older New Zealander than a younger one. While it used to be believed that our memories for words were quite abstract, there is now good evidence that we store detailed distributions of social and phonetic information for each word (termed \"episodic word storage\"). Listeners use their social knowledge about a speaker to affect how they listen to their speech, and we find it easier to identify words if they are produced by the speakers that are most likely to say them. For example, we are quicker to understand the word ‘library’ in a female voice than a male voice. Likewise, when words are spoken, they drift to resemble the accent characteristics of the speakers that produce them most, and of the linguistic environment that they most often occur in. \nProfessor Hay will conduct a series of experiments which explore hitherto untested hypotheses about the implications of this detailed episodic word storage for morphology (the study of word structure) and phonology (the study of sound structure). These areas have arisen from her many years of study in New Zealand English, and will draw on resources developed through the long-running Origins of New Zealand English project. She will then unify her findings from this study, as well as her previous findings in New Zealand English, into a coherent theory, which she plans to publish as a monograph. \nThe study will increase our understanding regarding accent and social variability in New Zealand, and contribute fundamental knowledge about mechanisms through which speakers from different backgrounds understand each other. \nProfessor Hay, who is Director of the New Zealand Institute of Language, Brain and Behaviour, is also this year’s recipient of the UC Research Medal . \nThe James Cook Research Fellowships are awarded to researchers on: the basis of their academic and research records; the applicant’s ability to demonstrate that they have achieved national and international recognition in their area of research expertise; the applicants’ potential to make a contribution of significance in their research field; and, the level of excellence of the proposed research. \nA few prestigious Fellowships are awarded annually to researchers who are recognised leaders in their respective fields. The Fellowships allow them to concentrate on their chosen research for two years without the additional burden of administrative and teaching duties. The funding package annually is $100,000 (excl. GST) and up to $10,000 (excl. GST) in relevant expenses. \nThe Royal Society of New Zealand received proposals from 29 applicants spanning four broad research areas: Biological sciences (including biotechnology), Social sciences (including research of relevance to peoples of New Zealand and/or the South-west Pacific), Health Sciences, and Engineering Sciences and Technologies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:55:22.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
