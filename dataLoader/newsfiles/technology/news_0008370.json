This is a significant accomplishment for a company in a \"paid model\" type service. With this amount of users, ITU puts themselves in contention with the largest players in this space. \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150918/268067LOGO \nOver the past 3 years, the eLearning market has seen a considerable consolidation with much of the market share being dominated by those that have used acquisition platforms to achieve significant user bases. What's interesting about ITU is they have achieved the benchmark of 300k users without any outside funding or add on acquisitions. ITU was founded in 2012 and self-funded the venture from day one. What's also intriguing is that ITU has produced a substantial amount of proprietary technology to leverage their course offerings. In early 2013, they released what they describe as \"the Next Generation LMS .\" While the name is catchy, many were eager to see if it would just be a similarly designed platform as their competitors. Based on reviews from the market there are some defining differences between ITU's LMS and the marketplace . First, the social engagement platform is really interesting. It allows students to communicate with each other and collaborate into study groups/live forums. The second piece of note is their gamification system. This allows students to compete with each other by gaining points for activities within the system i.e. completing courses, contributing to forums, etc. The system is also designed with mobile in mind, so the courses are accessible from essentially any device. All in all, definitely a step in the right direction compared to many other platform that have that \"90's feel\" still lingering. \nITU has been seeing some serious growth over the past two years and many feel they are primed to start gaining considerable market share in the next 18-24 months. In order to bring that growth to fruition, they will need to continue to develop advancements in the way that eLearning is delivered. It's clear that the market is changing and those that keep changing with it will be the ones that dominate this space. Easier said than done. If accomplished though, ITU stands to be a break out company as the eLearning market is expected to nearly double in size in the next 10-15 years. Their CEO, Brandon Smith , is quoted as saying , \"From the beginning, ITU has been operated on the core principle of constant innovation. We will be first to market, with the best technology and thereby provide the highest quality training solution to the marketplace. We will continue to deliver on this strategy, every day.\" \nITU currently has several hundred courses and expects to reach over 2,000 in the next 24 months.
