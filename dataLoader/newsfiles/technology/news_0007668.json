It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) can also read and write data in the user's clipboard, which could be used to get passwords, according to Palo Alto. \nOnly Chinese apps were known so far to have been infected -- although some of those, including WeChat, are also used outside China. \nChinese apps are thought to be vulnerable because developers often bypass the official, more secure, Apple channels, which can be slowed by Chinese Internet monitoring. \nTencent (HKSE: 0700-OL.HK - news ) , which makes the WeChat software -- used by 500 million in China -- said it had repaired the flaw and that there had been \"no theft (or) leakage of users' information or money.\" \nThe makers of app Didi Kuaidi, which claims 200 million regular users, also reported a fix and said no user privacy was compromised. \n- Bad timing - \nIndependent security consultant and researcher Graham Cluley said the incident is not all bad for Apple. \n\"It suggests that Apple's security is pretty good,\" Cluley said in a blog post. \n\"After all, this was quite a complicated way to get malware into the App Store.\" \nCluley said Apple (Swiss: AAPL.SW - news ) \"has a much much better track record than Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) 's Android one for security.\" \nBut Thomas Reed at the software firm Malwarebytes said it may hurt Apple at a delicate time. \nApple is set to release its new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus handsets on Friday in the US, China and several other key markets. \n\"There is little doubt that there will be some revision of the app review process at Apple as a result, but it's also certain that this incident will erode consumer confidence in the App Store as a (mostly) unassailable malware-free fortress,\" he wrote in a blog.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:41:06.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
