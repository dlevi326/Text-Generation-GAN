This “metagenomic” approach rapidly found a match: a common soil-dwelling amoeba called Balamuthia mandrillaris. \nThe researchers and their colleagues have recently set up a new Center for Next-Gen Precision Medicine Diagnostics to help hospitals make genome-based screens for the root causes of encephalitis part of their standard of care. \nThe technology could save money as well as lives. Over her two-week hospitalization, care for last summer’s Balamuthia victim cost more than $100,000. The metagenomic screen, by comparison costs a mere $2,000 – and typically takes two days. \nOne of the center’s first priorities will be a study to determine when in the course of an encephalitis patient’s care the technique would have the greatest clinical impact. Researchers will comb through databases of encephalitis cases to identify when cheap, existing treatments like a $100 blood draw are effective at diagnosing a patient’s disease and when it’s time for clinicians to turn to the center’s big genomic guns. \n“We all agree these metagenomic screens are happening too late,” said UC Berkeley health economist Brent Fulton, PhD, MBA, part of the center’s team who is leading the study. “When UCSF gets the call, doctors have already tried everything under the sun and it’s a bad situation.” \nBut how early should the test be done? It’s still an open question, according to Fulton. “A $2,000 test is nothing to sneeze at if it turns out to not change the usual course of care,” he explained. “But balanced against a multi-week, half-million dollar hospitalization, it’s nothing.” \nThrough the new center, DeRisi hopes to make such screening a hospital’s go-to test for mystery brain infections rather than a last resort. Currently dpctors generally need to track down DeRisi and his peers directly to request help, he said. “We need to make this into an actual clinical diagnostic so a doctor who doesn't know my phone number can just order up this test.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T18:10:33.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
