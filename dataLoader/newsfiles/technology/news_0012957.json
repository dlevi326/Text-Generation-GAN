(NYSE: NTIP) today announced that the United States District Judge Robert Schroeder III of the Eastern District of Texas issued an Order denying a motion made by Apple, Inc. to certify for appeal the Court's prior ruling denying Apple's motion for summary judgment based on the Kessler Doctrine in a patent infringement suit filed by Mirror Worlds Technologies, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Network-1, against Apple. \nIn December 2014, Apple brought a motion for summary judgment arguing that Mirror Worlds was precluded under the Kessler Doctrine from initiating patent litigation against Apple because of an earlier case brought by the previous owner of the Mirror Worlds patent portfolio against Apple. In July, Judge Schroeder denied Apple's motion and granted Mirror Worlds' cross-motion that the Kessler Doctrine does not apply. Apple filed a motion seeking to allow it to file an interlocutory appeal (prior to a judgment) of Judge's Schroeder's Order to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. \n\"We are pleased with the Judge's Order,\" commented Corey M. Horowitz, Chairman and CEO of Network-1. \"We feel strongly about the merits of our case and look forward to proceeding to trial on our claims.\" \nABOUT NETWORK-1 TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \nNetwork-1 Technologies, Inc. is engaged in the development, licensing and protection of its intellectual property and proprietary technologies.
