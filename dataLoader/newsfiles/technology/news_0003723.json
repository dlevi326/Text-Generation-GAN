These were previously connected using a range of disparate providers that charged the company based on usage.\n\"Dark fibre is about preparing Vodafone for the future,\" Vodafone Australia chief executive Inaki Berroeta said. \"It is the next step in our network evolution and builds on our multibillion-dollar network investment in recent years.\n\"We'll start delivering sites as soon as next week and the full rollout will be completed by 2018.\"\n\"Dark fibre\" refers to unused high-capacity fibre optic cabling that can be leased to customers. Vodafone Australia will be able to send and receive a lot more of its customers' mobile data for a much lower cost.\nLower costs This could lead to a mix of lower costs and much higher data allowances for Vodafone Australia customers if the company chooses to pass the savings and extra capacity on to its users.\nThe fibre services deal will be worth more than $900 million over the next 15 years and will cost TPG about $300 million to $400 million to build over the next three years.\nVodafone Australia's network will also be ready for a 5G rollout, which its chief financial officer James Marsh has flagged will take place from about 2021.\n﻿ The remaining one-third of Vodafone Australia sites could be connected using the national broadband network if its trials are successful and result in the launch of wholesale backhaul services.\nMr Teoh said he was \"very excited and very proud\" about the contracts, but his team added that mobile users would be shifted off Optus and on to Vodafone in batches.\n\"This will help Vodafone enhance their superior network well into the future,\" he said. \"On the MVNO [mobile reseller] side we're excited as well – they have invested $3 billion over the last few years, so they're serious.\n\"We'll bring our mobile business and our customers to the Vodafone network on the 4G superfast network.\"\nValuable weapon Only part of the 4000-kilometre network will be used for Vodafone Australia's services, with the rest for resale and reuse by TPG. This will be a valuable weapon in the battle against rival players like Telstra, Optus and Vocus, which has proposed a $3 billion merger with M2 Group.\nTPG's share price rose by 6.8 per cent to $10.83 a share, beating the overall S&P/ASX 200 index, which rose by 2.1 per cent.\nThe deal could be the first step towards an eventual merger between both companies, because TPG and Vodafone Australia's networks and systems are more intertwined than ever.\nTPG will have a direct link with Vodafone Australia's systems and be able to provision and service new customers in real time. By comparison, Optus had to handle customers' call records and account activations before sending the data on to TPG.\nBut Mr Teoh said recent media reports that he had met Vodafone Group executives, potentially to discuss a merger, were false. When asked if he had ever discussed a takeover or merger with Vodafone executives, he declined to comment.\nA spokesman for Optus said the company respected TPG's announcement and expected to continue working with the telco in the future.\nIt also called on affected customers to contact Optus if they wanted to stay on its network and warned that they would need to get a new SIM card.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-09-30T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:21:03.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
