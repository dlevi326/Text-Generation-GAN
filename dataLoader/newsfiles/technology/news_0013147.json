Lenel is part of UTC Climate, Controls & Security, a unit of United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX). \nThe AlertEnterprise suite of security convergence software delivers one of the most comprehensive IT, OT (operational technology) and physical security solutions available. Its certified interface to the OnGuard® system will offer predictive risk analytics, compliance and advanced insider threat management capabilities. \nLenel and AlertEnterprise are showcasing their solutions at one of the security industry’s largest events — ASIS International 2015 — at the AlertEnterprise booth (#709) and UTC booth (#3910). The 61st ASIS Annual Seminar and exhibition is being held at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California, Sept. 28 – Oct. 2. \n“Customers want to extend OnGuard into new directions, and this new relationship will provide them the opportunity to purchase an advanced PIAM solution. Leveraging the new interface between the OnGuard system and AlertEnterprise’s Guardian™ software, customers can now manage identities for employees, contractors, vendors and visitors across multiple systems such as HR, IT, Security and SCADA – helping to ensure policy enforcement, continuity and more,” said Ron Virden, managing director, electronic access solutions, Lenel. \nAccording to Jasvir Gill, founder and CEO of AlertEnterprise, “AlertEnterprise is changing the face of security with IT-Physical-OT Security Convergence, particularly for large operational environments. We applaud the fact that Lenel is leveraging these capabilities. AlertEnterprise and Lenel can deliver comprehensive solutions to Fortune 500 and Global 1000 customers for both corporate and critical infrastructure protection.” \nGill goes on to explain, “another unique dimension of our solution is that it offers unique enhanced mechanisms to help thwart unauthorized access, for example it will alert on unauthorized configuration changes to an access control server designed to protect against validation of fake badges.” \nAlertEnterprise has PIAM, Physical Security Information Management and compliance validation solutions that complement OnGuard’s industry leading, enterprise security management platform. \n“Lenel and AlertEnterprise share the same view that enterprise solutions should be out-of-the-box and highly configurable, rather than require custom development with expensive deployment and ongoing maintenance,” Virden said. “We look forward to working together with AlertEnterprise on future solutions that deliver added value to our mutual customers.” \nAbout AlertEnterprise \nAlertEnterprise software protects from and uncovers blended threats Information Technology and Operational Technology (IT-OT) and Physical Access and Industrial Control Systems for true prevention of insider threats, fraud, theft, sabotage and acts of terrorism by overcoming the vulnerabilities inherent in security silos.
