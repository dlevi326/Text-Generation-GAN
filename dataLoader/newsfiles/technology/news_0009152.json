Born on Dec. 7, 1912, in Winchester, Ont.; died on April 1, 2015, in Toronto, of pneumonia, aged 102.\nHarold’s mother, Emma Jean, was born on a farm practically in the shade of the first McIntosh apple tree, which had been cultivated by her great-uncle, John McIntosh. Harold’s father, Norman, was born in a dirt-floored cabin in a place known locally as Hellgate Swamp, but eventually became manager of a sash-and-door factory in Winchester, a small community south of Ottawa.\nAs a boy, Harold wandered the factory, tutored by the woodworkers and machinists, whose occasional missing fingers attested to cruel lessons learned at the blade of a circular saw. On the roof, he secretly built what he thought would be a glider. His father discovered it, averting both the glider’s inaugural flight, and Harold’s premature death.\nDreams of flight were followed by dreams of architecture. However, when enrolling at the University of Toronto as the Great Depression began, Harold decided dentistry would be a more practical career choice. After graduation, he began practising in the Ottawa Valley but work was scarce in hard times. He was once paid with a bag of carrots.\nWhen the Second World War broke out in 1939, he enlisted in the Canadian Dental Corps and served in Holland and Italy, where he contracted malaria and hepatitis, resulting in a near-death experience which solidified his Christian faith and led to a lifetime of unwavering moral principle. He was joined in this by his wife Pat, whom he met in Ottawa and wed in 1952, a union that lasted until her death in 2011.\nHarold had a long professional career in Ottawa, serving as president of the Ontario Dental Association and retiring in 1987 after 50 years of practice.\nHe had a passion for sailing and placed second in an international yacht race between Quebec and Charlottetown when he was 71. He was never too old to start something new, whether it was jogging in his 60s, cycling in his 70s, or learning to play trombone in his 90s. On his 100th birthday, he danced with many partners, his only regret being that Pat, the love of his life, was no longer with him. Determined to stay active, he continued practising with the New Horizons Band at his church, and walking the treadmill and lifting weights at the YMCA.\nHarold was a lifelong home handyman who undertook his most remarkable project in his 90s. Beginning with two barrels set up under an eavestrough, he assembled a water recovery system of 10 interconnected 50-gallon drums ringing the house on three sides; he stopped only when his daughter-in-law, a real estate agent, advised him that putting water barrels in front of the house would diminish the property value.\nHaving correctly predicted that water would become the blue gold of this century, he was also ahead of the curve on energy conservation and bought one of the early-model Prius hybrid cars at 91. At 100, he was still driving it, living in his own home and walking without a cane.\nHe took an active interest in current affairs, frequently expressing concern about the world that future generations would inherit. After two years of declining health, however, he told his caregiver that it was time to “go see Pat.” A brief illness followed, and he was on his way.\nNorm Beach is Harold’s son.\n More Related to this Story Submit a Lives Lived column\nComments A A", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:05:51.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
