I do not believe that stopping a comment on an article or story is the answer. You will always get an idiot that passes an unacceptable comment and by so doing messes it up for everybody else; especially if this person has too much bravemaker inside him. I have however seen that by clamping down on comments actually exacerbates the situation instead of correcting it. I therefore want to ask News24 to refrain from blocking comments as I firmly believe in freedom of expression and the inviolate right of freedom of the press.Thank you,Johan de LANGE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T22:03:08.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
