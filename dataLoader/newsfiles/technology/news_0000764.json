So found a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) study in JAMA Internal Medicine: \"Diagnostic Accuracy of Digital Screening Mammography with and without Computer-aided Detection.\"\nThe study used information from more than 625,000 digital mammograms read by 271 radiologists at 66 facilities across the United States. In the whole study, as in various subgroups of women, CAD improved no measure of accuracy of screening mammography: how often cancers were detected, how often they were missed, or how often something was incorrectly labeled as cancer. Radiologists detected cancer in about 4 of every 1,000 women--and invasive cancer in about 3 of those 4--whether interpreting the nearly half-million digital mammograms with CAD or the nearly 130,000 without it. CAD did find more noninvasive, stage-0, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), but finding more DCIS has not been determined to improve outcomes for women in screening programs.\n\"Even more troubling, when we studied the 107 radiologists who interpreted both with and without CAD, we found that a given radiologist tended to miss more cancers when using CAD than when he or she didn't use the software,\" lead author Constance D. Lehman, MD, PhD, said. \"It may be that radiologists reading with CAD are overly dependent on the technology and ignore suspicious lesions if they are not marked by CAD.\" Dr. Lehman is the director of breast imaging and co-director of the Avon Comprehensive Breast Evaluation Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She is also an affiliate researcher at Group Health Research Institute (GHRI). She did this work while at the University of Washington.\nWasting Healthcare Resources?\n\"We're concerned that using CAD for screening mammography does not benefit women--and may even increase the chances a radiologist misses a breast cancer,\" the paper's senior author Diana L. Miglioretti, PhD, said. \"We question the policy of continuing to charge--and pay--for this technology.\" Dr. Miglioretti is the dean's professor of biostatistics in public health sciences at the UC Davis School of Medicine and a senior investigator at GHRI. An accompanying editorial concludes that Medicare should no longer cover the cost of CAD.\nCAD mammography is estimated to cost $400 million a year in current U.S. health care spending, with no added value and in some cases worse performance. This is likely a gross underestimate, Dr. Miglioretti said, as it is based on Medicare reimbursement of $7 per exam for CAD, which is only a third of what many private insurers pay for this technology.\nCAD is a type of digital mammography in which a computer program marks areas on a mammogram that may be abnormal. Then a radiologist needs to determine whether they might actually be abnormal: Around three CAD marks per screening test are \"false positives\" that are normal, creating extra work for radiologists, who must also seek abnormalities that CAD missed--because, like any test, it's not perfect.\nHow Mammography With CAD Spread\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved CAD for mammography in 1998, but it wasn't widely used until 2002, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved reimbursement for CAD for mammography. Studies since then have been equivocal about whether screening with CAD helps detect breast cancer in community practice.\n\"Despite lack of evidence of benefit, use of CAD mammography has taken off,\" said Drs. Lehman and Miglioretti's coauthor Diana S.M. Buist, PhD, a senior investigator at GHRI. By 2012, their study found, 83 percent of all screening mammograms were digital and interpreted with CAD. \"During this same time period, evidence has accumulated demonstrating no added benefit and potentially more harm from this technology,\" Dr. Buist said. \"Yet insurance companies, employers, and women are still paying for CAD.\" You can read a blog post by Dr. Buist about this study. An earlier BCSC study found that, compared to older film-screen methods, digital mammography raised costs with only small health benefits, but that technology is nearly universal now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T03:12:27.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
