The upgraded agency desktop, which will be powered by Travelport, will be made available exclusively to AXESS-connected travel agents and will be known as AXESS CREA Advance. It will replace AXESS’ current CREA desktop.\nThe partnership between AXESS and Travelport was first announced in April 2012 when Travelport was selected as a technology partner on account of its alignment in strategic thinking with AXESS. Since then, the two organizations have been working in close collaboration to assess the needs of the region’s resurgent travel industry and have gone from strength to strength designing a new, enhanced Japanese GDS to meet the demands of Japanese travel agents and travelers.\nThe new AXESS desktop will be powered by Travelport Smartpoint, Travelport’s award-winning point of sale technology. Travelport Smartpoint offers extensive air, hotel and car content as well as a broad range of user-friendly merchandising features all designed to enhance the customer selling experience. Specifically, Travelport has received a number of industry accolades over the past year for its pioneering air merchandising solutions, including Travelport Rich Content and Branding, which allows airlines to display and promote their entire product range, including their ancillary products and fare families, in exactly the same way as they do on their own websites. Travelport also offers an unrivalled B2B hotel inventory of over 650,000 hotel properties as well as a pioneering B2B payments solution offered through its payments partner, eNett. Once migrated onto the new desktop, AXESS CREA Advance-connected agents will immediately benefit from the additional content and technology.\nIn addition to delivering a new agency desktop, AXESS has also partnered with Travelport to launch a new business travel management solution, powered by Locomote technology, to meet the needs of the Japanese business traveller. Locomote is a smart technology platform that gives companies complete control and visibility of their corporate travel, making travel management easier and more efficient and giving Japanese companies access to the business travel management platform, on any device, anywhere in the world.\nThe overall AXESS GDS platform will continue to be hosted as part of Travelport’s state-of-the-art technology infrastructure in its Atlanta (US) data center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:29:21.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
