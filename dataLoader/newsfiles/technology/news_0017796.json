The utility asked the PUC to examine if existing rates were too high, which they claimed could result in solar customers not paying their share of grid costs. The PUC’s oral decision, which is expected to be released in written form in the coming weeks, concluded that no changes would be enacted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T17:58:54.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
