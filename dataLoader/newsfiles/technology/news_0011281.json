FlipHTML5 has revolutionized the industry by allowing HTML to enrich content with media while traditional PDFs don’t have that capability. This new technology will change the way users interact with documents and their ability to share digital content will become much quicker.\nUnlike other companies that may offer variations on the PDF to HTML conversion, FlipHTML5 offers their tool as a free service to users. The benefits of transitioning PDFs to HTML make documents readable on almost all browsers and devices which will negate the need for users to wait for information to download. Additionally, platforms like FaceBook, Twitter, email and other social media sites where users typically share information will accept HTML much more quickly as it integrates seamlessly.\nWhereas PDFs only show text images and links, converting the same document to HTML can allow for greater levels of creativity and connectivity through the incorporation of video, audio, animation and so forth.\nAbove all else, the user experience is the top priority for the company. FlipHTML5 Customer Service team member, Jackie Peng, said, “It’s important to our company to provide our customers with the top-level product and service they have come to expect from us.”\nFor more information, visit the website: http://fliphtml5.com/ .\nAbout FlipHTML5:\nFlipHTML5 is a leading provider of HTML5 digital publishing software solutions.
