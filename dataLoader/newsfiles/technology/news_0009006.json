Bengaluru-based discount-led garment chain Coupon was sold to Future group's discount format Brand Factory, while some discount chains such as The Loot and The Grab Store have completely shut operations in the past two years. \"This model has become stagnant. Going forward, there will be closures and we will soon see the end of factory outlets,\" said J Suresh, chief executive of Arvind Brands. \n\nDiscounted factory outlets started coming up about a decade ago and offered extraordinary savings on merchandise that was two to three seasons old. These outlets were mainly used by companies to attract new customers who could not otherwise afford the brand. According to industry experts 5-10% of the store merchandise is routed through factory outlets. \n\nOffline retailers blame online players for getting \"more enquiries and less sales\" at their stores. \"The growth of discounted format has fallen from high double digits to 7% since the advent of online platform. There are too many offline and online sales that have impacted the factory outlet model,\" said a senior executive of a Bengaluru-headquartered retail company, who did not wished to be named. \"Not many brands are looking to expand in this segment any more. The roll-out of factory outlets will be gradual now.\" \n\nInternationally, value format stores are the third line of business for major brands after offline and online stores. \"Globally 50-60% of the merchandise is specifically manufactured for factory outlets whereas in India these are more of stock disposal outlets,\" said Pankaj Ranjhen, managing director-retail at Jones Lang Lasalle. \"In India, most of the times such outlets are not run well and sizes are not available,\" he said. \n\nS Raghunandan, an independent retail consultant and former chief executive officer of Xander Retail, said e-commerce offers current season stocks at discount, \"which is suicide\", to build customer engagement. \"With this model, these outlets become meaningless,\" he said. \n\nThe other challenges include lack of quality shopping environment, parking woes and non-availability of product sizes. Experts believe that for brands to make this model work, they need to reinvent their stores and follow the factory outlet business model used abroad. \n\n\"It becomes inconvenient for customers to go to each and every store individually. In case your sales of a particular year go well, there will be no stock at the stores making these standalone stores unprofitable,\" said Suresh Sadhwani, head of business at Brand Factory. \n\nThe Future group-owned company started in 2006 and has about 39 stores across India. \"We were as much impacted by these discounts as a full price retailer. Now we need to see what happens after discounts come down,\" said Sadhwani. \n\nAccording to a Crisil report, as online shopping increases in the country bricks-and-mortar retailers are expected to see their growth rate moderate to 13-15% over the next two-three years from an annual average growth rate of 24% seen over the past five years.
