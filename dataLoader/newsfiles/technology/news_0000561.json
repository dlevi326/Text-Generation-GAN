Surely there must be something fishy somewhere? (it must be accepted that fitness, ball sense, agility, etc cannot be taught in one week)\nThere are quite a number of factors that may have played a role in asking the unbecoming question of how many USD ($), Euro (€), Yen (¥) were involved.\n1. This is most probably the oldest SA rugby team we have ever sent to a world cup contest. It is the last matches for most of these players and they are retiring to other countries. So why not a few $, ¥, € extra for a another loss ( no taxes).\n2. The Referees play an important role in deciding the outcome of a match. Penalties and position of the allocation of penalties is most probably the easiest however sending a player off (red or yellow card) is even better to ensure the required result. Furthermore it is clear that there is no standard for refereeing (even TV refs) or applicaton of rules or just being simply blind so a few $, ¥, € can do the trick. Two examples:\n- In the Stormers Blue bulls match in 2014 Graig Joubert penalizes the BB five times in the first 15min for illegal scrumming ( while everyone could see Kitshoff was binding illegally) however in the last 8min of the game – after it was clear that the Stormers will win - he gave 5 penalties against the Stormers for illegal scrumming?\n- In the RWC 2015 matches: SA – Samoa Kolisi and Etsebeth were penalised for playing while on the ground – in the Eng – Wales match no one ever got penalized for doing exactly the same?\n3. Every white SA rugby player must by now know that this standard is too high (among the top six) for the ANC regime. We have to go to a similar position as the untransformed soccer team and that can only be achieved by a completely black team- so this will be their last opportunity and achievements is in any case secondary – a few $, ¥, € will come in handy.\n4. Every SA Coach of a RWC team’s contracts were not renewed so this is the first and last opportunity for them to make a few extra RRR’s.\nWe should not be too critical about SA rugby and the total professional racist sport regimes simply because our own glorious soccer chiefs were paid millions and they paid for other teams to lose against them e.g. the win over Bulgaria before the world cup is sufficient and really helped quite number of (overseas) white players.\nIf Thuli’s team was of any value it could have been a good item to investigate and the culprits brought to book but until such time it will remain an unbecoming question.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:06:20.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
