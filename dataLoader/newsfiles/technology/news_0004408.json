Mexican marines protect the eggs of Golfina turtles from thieves at Morro Ayuta Beach, Oaxaca State, Mexico, on September 10, 2015 \nIn one night, some 70,000 turtles come ashore to lay eggs on those two beaches, according to the federal prosecutor's office for environmental protection (Profepa). \nDespite the drones, soldiers and prison threats, thieves find a way to snatch eggs under the cover of darkness as the aircraft only work during daylight, said Nereo Garcia, the regional Profepa official. \nThe poachers are the first link in a clandestine market that ends with eggs sold in markets of the nearby village of Juchitan and as far away as Mexico City's crime-ridden Tepito neighborhood. \nAbout 100 of the golf ball-sized eggs, which are believed to be an aphrodisiac, sell for just 30 pesos ($1.70). \nOn restaurant menus , a half-dozen cooked eggs are priced at 60 pesos. \nAn austere restaurant in Juchitan offers a \"super-vitamin-added seafood soup\"â€”a spicy broth with herbs, snail, clams and two turtle eggs for 100 pesos. \n\"It sells pretty well. Tourists order it out of curiosity,\" said a waitress, whose restaurant serves boiled eggs on a bed of lettuce with lime. \nEvery year, six of the seven species of sea turtles in the world nest on the coasts of Mexico between July and March. Some arrive all the way from Japan. \nMorro Ayuta mostly sees olive ridley sea turtles that come by the tens of thousands, invading the beach to dig their nests and lay on average 100 eggs each. Golfina turtle eggs are served at a restaurant in Juchitan, Oaxaca State, Mexico, on September 10, 2015 \nIn the 2014 season, more than 1.1 million olive ridley sea turtles nested in Mexico, up from just under one million a year earlier, according to official figures. \nOther threats lurk \nDespite the improvement, Mexican authorities are keeping their guard up as humans are not the only threat. \nBirds and wild dogs feed on the eggs , and only 35 percent hatch after the 45-day incubation period. A drone is launched to keep watch over the nests of sea turtles on Morro Ayuta Beach, Oaxaca State, Mexico, on September 10, 2015 \nOnce the baby turtles are out, they must dodge predators as they scurry toward the ocean. Only one out of 1,000 reach adulthood, according to experts. \nConservationists fear another danger lurking: Mexico's tourism sector. Every year, six of the seven species of sea turtles in the world nest on the coasts of Mexico between July and March \nEduardo Najera, director of the non-governmental organization Costasalvaje (Wild Coast), fears that investors will spot the untouched beachfront and seek to build on the beach. \n\"They'll want to build 40-story hotels, a golf course, an airport, and then the miracle is over,\" said Najera, who is lobbying to have the beach declared a conservation area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:16:37.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
