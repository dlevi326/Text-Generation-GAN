The test reveals some of the expats’ best inner traits and assets when dealing with other people or with the world at large. It can be found under the name ‘What’s Your True Calling’ and is still available on KeepCalling’s Facebook page.\nThe quiz will point out the respondents’ secret weapons, their innate personality traits that shine in every situation. Unfortunately, these weapons can sometimes be so secret that people may not even be aware of them.\nA series of 9 questions leads to the final answer: a profile that expats best represent. There is a total of 4 typologies employed by KeepCalling, so customers can be Protectors, Explorers, Negotiators, or Directors.\nThe test has already been taken by hundreds of people worldwide and the results gathered so far show that most of the respondents are Protectors (43%) and have a very soft, protective side. Many are Explorers (37%), meaning they have a curious nature and enjoy exploring, while some of them (15%) are Directors who like to be in control and take matters into their own hands. Only a select few (5%) are talented Negotiators and born peacemakers.\nKeepCalling ’s interest in its customers goes beyond its business field and into more general areas, that’s why the company periodically launches contests, quizzes, and campaigns meant to involve expats all over the world.\nKeepCalling serves immigrant communities all around the world and provides prepaid solutions for international and national long distance communication.
