While the official listing doesn't mention the price, Mumbai-based retailer Mahesh Telecom has claimed the price to be Rs 12,990. \n\nVivo Y27L sports a 4.7-inch HD IPS screen with 1280x720p resolution. \n\nThe dual-sim smartphone sports a 8MP primary camera along with an 5MP secondary camera. \n\nPowered by a 64-bit quad core Snapdragon 410 processor and 1GB RAM, the smartphone offers 16GB of internal storage and can support microSD cards of up to 128GB. \n\nVivo Y27L runs Android KitKat 4.4-based Funtouch OS 2.0 and packs a 2,260mAh battery. On the connectivity front, the phone offers support for 2G, 3G, 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS. \n\nWith 136.9x68.1x6.99mm dimensions and 137g weight, the device comes with smart gesture controls, Hi-Fi audio control feature and superscreen shot feature -- to capture multiple screenshots that can be saved as one extended picture General 2G Network 850/900/1800/1900 MHz 3G Network 850/1900/2100 MHz 4G Network 2100/188MHz SIM Dual-sim Dimensions 136.9x68.1x6.99 mm Weight 137g Display Size 4.7-inch (1280x720 p) Type HD IPS Display Memory Card Slot Up to 128GB Internal 16B, 1GB RAM Data GPRS Yes EDGE Yes Bluetooth Yes Camera Primary 8MP Secondary 5MP Features OS Android 4.4 KitKat Based on Funtouch OS 2.0 CPU 1.2GHz Quad Core Snapdragon 410 Processor Browser HTML5 Battery Battery Capacity 2,260mAh 5 best smartphones you can buy under Rs 15,000 of 6 In the Rs 8,000-15,000 price band nowadays, you can easily pick up handsets with some serious hardware purring under the hood.\n\nFor instance, USB OTG, 16GB internal storage, support for microSD cards, good cameras, advanced 3D gaming, and great multitasking are a given in this price bracket.\n\nMoreover, the devices in this range come packed with features that not only differentiate one from the other but also allows you to choose a handset that meets your needs perfectly.\n\nHere's a look at the 5 best smartphones you can buy under Rs 15,000 in India right now... The latest Moto G comes with an IPX7 rating, which means it can survive a dip in up to three feet of fresh water for up to 30 minutes.\n\nThe handset has a textured rubberized back panel, which offers excellent grip. And while it has a smaller display (5-inch) when compared to the other phones on test here, it is on a par in terms of quality. The HD screen is scratch-resistant, responsive to light touches, and renders neutral colours with sharp text, and is legible in bright outdoors.\n\nOn the performance front, the third-generation Moto G is snappy and lag-free. This is largely because the handset runs Android Lollipop without any UI customizations or bloatware. You can play 3D games like Frontline Commando 2 and Deer Hunter without any lag, though advanced 3D games could see a frame drop at times.\n\nIts front-facing speaker is loud and phone calls are distortion-free. However, this is the only phone in review here that lacks call-recording.\n\nOn the plus side, you get Moto Assist, which includes an active display for notifications when the phone is nudged while in sleep mode, and gesture activations: shake twice to switch on/off the flashlight, while a twist of the wrist launches the camera.\n\nThe shooters take pictures with reasonable detail and neutral colours in welllit settings. However, photos in dim environments display a cooler bluish tint and at times the white balance goes off kilter. Re-focusing on a subject is annoying and the camera does not adjust light exposure automatically.\n\nLike it is with earlier Motorola smartphones, you can expect to get well over a day's worth of work done on a full charge.\n\nBuy Moto G (Gen 3) if you want a waterproof, durable handset that's a workhorse on the productivity and battery front. We recommend the slightly more expensive variant with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage. Asus Zenfone 2 Laser's aesthetics do not stray from the ZenFone 2 family -­- its curved back makes it comfortable to hold and its volume buttons on the back allow for easy access while adjusting sound levels in portrait or landscape mode. Besides, its rubberized back panel gives it a nice, sturdy feel in the hand.\n\nThe scratch-resistant HD display of Zenfone 2 Laser is bright, and colours are punchy and can be configured to appear vivid or balanced with its colour profiler tool. For readers, a blue light filter is also included to reduce eye strain.\n\nThe smartphone runs the latest version of Android, which is heavily customized with the Asus ZenUI. It includes settings to tweak themes, icons, the app drawer, and even allows you to switch to one-handed mode.\n\nThere are pre-loaded apps like SnapView (to create a private user profile for work), a kids' mode, call recorder, gesture recognition, and more. In spite of all this, Asus Zenfone 2 Laser worked without a hitch during tests, though you will have to prepare yourself for frequent app updates. Call quality and music playback are crystal clear.\n\nThe rear camera, which uses laser autofocus, is capable of sharp photographs with warm tones and excellent detail. Its shutter has minimal lag and is capable of taking stellar close-up photos. The camera, like in all other Zenfone models, comes with multiple shooting modes --­ HDR, manual, low light, super resolution, GIF animation, etc -­- along with editing options that you let you touch-up photos, remove objects from a scene, create timelapse videos, and more. If that's not enough, you also get a collage and slideshow maker.\n\nAsus Zenfone 2 Laser is also capable of lasting over a day, in Balanced mode, without needing a recharge. And with its detailed power management options, it is possible to extend its battery life even further.\n\nBuy Asus Zenfone 2 Laser if you want a hand set for mobile photography, but works just as well for productivity tasks. YU's Yureka Plus is an upgraded version of the Yureka. This handset comes with a Full HD screen, when compared to the HD display of the Yureka, but sports the same good build quality.\n\nThe Yureka Plus packs in hardware that performs as well as -­- and most times --­ even better than devices that cost double its price. When it came to pure benchmarks, it was a close second only to the Panasonic Eluga Icon. Casual games and Full HD movie playback pose no issue, and this device handles 3D games like Frontline Commando 2, Gangstar Vegas and Asphalt 8: Airborne without any hitch.\n\nCall quality is clear and audio playback through headphones is crisp. The output of its dual cameras is sharp enough to be posted on the web. Turn on the flash and you get snapshots that retain minute details under zoom.\n\nThe device runs Cyanogen OS 12 that allows users to fully customize their phones, and it is also packed with security features like Privacy Guard that allows you to manage app permissions and a Blacklist feature to block calls and messages from any number by simply adding it to a list.\n\nOn the battery front, you get slightly under a day's worth of work on a full charge. On the downside, the Yureka Plus takes a while to latch onto networks. Also, it automatically disables mobile data when the battery runs below 20% in balanced mode, with no way to override that setting unless you switch to performance mode.\n\nBuy YU Yureka Plus if you want a no-nonsense handset with powerful hardware in budget pricing --­ and which runs an OS that's devoid of bloatware. Panasonic Eluga Icon sports a unibody design with non-removable rear panel. Its back has a metallic-looking finish and gives it a premium look and feel, save for its lack of a scratch-resistant display and backlit navigation controls. That said, the Eluga Icon is equipped with a clear and responsive touchscreen and is packed with great hardware and features.\n\nEluga Icon breezes through every task, including Full HD movies and 3D games, making it one of the best overall performers in its price range. It latches onto networks quickly, and call quality is clear, though not as loud as the Yureka Plus and Zenfone 2 Laser.\n\nThe cameras on Panasonic Eluga Icon are quick to focus and render colours accurately. The front camera is capable of wide-angle photos letting you squeeze more into the frame. Besides, the snappers are supported by features, including a beauty mode for selfies, HDR, photo filters, and a picture-in-picture mode that uses both cameras simultaneously where one snapshot appears within the other. You also get a Fix Me option that gives you quick access to exposure, contrast, white balance and ISO. This kind of customization runs deep within Eluga Icon.\n\nIn Settings, you can configure up to eight gestures to launch apps, like tracing the alphabet 'E' on the screen to activate e-mail or 'C' for camera. You can also change colour temperature and use presets like vivid and night mode for screen display; audio profiles come with enhancers for earphones, volume booster for speakers and for surround-sound; a scheduler to switch the phone on and off at a fixed time, and more. Besides, on a single charge, you can get a full day of work done, without any hassles.\n\nBuy Panasonic Eluga Icon if you want a fully-customizable device that's supported by powerful hardware and a huge amount of extra features.
