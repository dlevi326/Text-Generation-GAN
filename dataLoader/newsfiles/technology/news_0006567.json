This has now resulted in the two companies, led from Natural Power's Nantes office, being awarded a contract by EDF to oversee the HSE and marine operations for the continued development ofthe Paimpol-Brehat Tidal Farm which is being constructed off the coast of Paimpol-Brehat in North Brittany. \nSeaRoc has been working with EDF on the project since 2011, providing marine and HSE advice and offshore client representation for the marine operations carried out to date. \nThis included deployment and recovery of the Open Hydro turbine, installation of the main export cable, cable stabilisation andprotection works, and the post-installation surveys and inspections. This first-hand experience of theproject, coupled with Natural Power's local, French-speaking team, and their extensive experience ofplanning and development, legislative requirements, planning law and knowledge of the French market,presented the ideal solution to EDF as it moves the tidal farm from the deployment and testing of a single prototype tidal turbine to the installation of an array of multiple grid-connected devices. \nThierry Ripoche, Managing Director of Natural Power France, said: \"We are delighted to be collaborating with SeaRoc to work with EDF in France. This opportunity showcases our ability to meet the growingneeds of the European market and support our clients to safely and effectively develop ground breakingprojects.\" \nThe Natural Power/SeaRoc combination will provide EDF with a local, French speaking team of tidalenergy and turbine installation experts to ensure compliance with health and safety and to carry out therole of client representative during the marine operations. \nNatural Power France has a long standing relationship with EDF having provided consultancy services on arange of offshore developments in French waters. Until now, services provided have mainly focused ondevelopment phases, for example Environmental Impact Assessment and ornithological expertise for the Saint-Nazaire offshore wind farm project (480 MW) and the Calvados offshore wind farm project (450MW). \nSeaRoc has previously worked with EDF in the UK on a number of projects, most recently in the role ofPrincipal Contractor to oversee construction of EDF's first offshore wind farm at Teesside in the Northeastof England. On this project SeaRoc provided a team of construction managers to oversee all aspects of theoffshore construction and the onshore compound, with a team of approximately 50 personnel. \nThisincluded support from Natural Power who acted as package manager to oversee installation andcommissioning of the 27 offshore wind turbines required for the project. \nDavid Wotherspoon, Operations Director at SeaRoc, added: \"Natural Power and SeaRoc have extensiveexperience in offshore renewable energy - combining our expertise enables us to provide a service thatmeets the specific needs of EDF on this project, and harness the strength of this partnership for ourFrench clients in the future.\" \nTidal energy is becoming an increasingly important area for Natural Power and the business has recently been working alongside Tidal Lagoon Power on the Swansea Bay project, which was granted planning permission last month. \nPaimpol-Brehat Tidal Farm The Paimpol-Brehat tidal farm is a tidal turbine demonstration farm located approximately 16km out at sea and 35m deep off Ile-de- Brehat near Paimpol, France. It is being developed by EDF. First initiated in2004, work began in 2008 and the first turbine was installed in August 2011. A turbine named L'Arcouestdeveloped by OpenHydro (selected for its low cost and ease of installation) was tested at the site fromDecember 2013 to April 2014. \nOpenHydro (owned by the French company DCNS) will develop, install and test two turbines inpartnership with EDF from 2015. The turbines are specially designed with an opening in the middle toprovide safety and easy access for fish and other sea creatures. \nAn electrical conversion system developed by General Electric will allow the green energy to betransported as continuous electrical current to a new onshore substation close to the Arcouest Peninsulain Ploubazlanec to finally join the French grid. On completion, the tidal farm will be the first tidal powerproject in the world to be connected to the grid. The pilot project is expected to pave way for the pre- commercialisation of tidal farms from 2016. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T00:35:18.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
