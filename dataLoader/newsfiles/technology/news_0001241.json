But he also sees the group’s presence continuing to be felt in the Indiana Statehouse next year, when advocates want lawmakers to extend the state’s civil rights protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity.\nIndiana having an open and inclusive culture is critical to solving a common problem in the state’s technology sector — recruiting and retaining talent, Oesterle said.\n“Particularly with the emerging Millennials in the workforce. They just won’t tolerate intolerance,” he said.\nINDIANAPOLIS STAR\nBill Oesterle's midlife crusade\nOesterle said he’s had preliminary conversations with technology organizations around the state about joining the coalition. He plans to release a first list of members Monday to coincide with anticipated action on the Carmel ordinance.\nOesterle declined to name specific technology companies he feels will join the coalition on Thursday. But he said there will be more than a handful.\n“It is a list that will be impressive,” he said.\nThe coalition is specifically being organized to support local nondiscrimination ordinances, but Oesterle said he’s hopeful Carmel will “set the stage for a statewide effort.”\n“Very intentionally, we would like tech organizations that are interested in supporting that statewide effort” and voicing how critical those protections are for the technology labor force, he said.\nUSA TODAY\nAmended Indiana law's protections limited, experts say\nOesterle said he’s putting seed money into the group but will attempt to raise “modest resources” in support of the effort as well. He did not say how much money he is contributing to the effort.\n“I like to run things lean, I always have. ... This is going to be more about committing ideas and effort,” he said.\nOesterle announced in April that he was stepping down from being CEO of Angie’s List, the online consumer ratings company that he co-founded in Indianapolis two decades ago.\nAt the time, he said he wanted to help repair damage to the state’s image following the passage of the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\nContributing: Stephanie Wang and Jeff Swiatek of The Star\nCONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Kk4SXq TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.indystar.com/story/money/2015/06/27/ceos-midlife-crusade-became-gov-mike-pences-problem/29344997/?from=global&sessionKey=&autologin=", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/17/Indianapolis/B9318895218Z.1_20150917131843_000_GKNBV3CNA.1-0.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Kk4SXq&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6624e8c29889ee83c6f9f7dc37dc72ad0c56bd29/c=0-88-1023-666&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/04/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635635156829456228-indiana-law.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Kk4SXq&text=Ex-Angie%E2%80%99s%20List%20CEO%20forming%20tech%20coalition%20for%20LGBT%20rights&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1Kk4SXq", "http://indy.st/1iSfMuD", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a8e69869a2dd1fc11546bfb97401f8ca373e4f01/r=500x377/local/-/media/2015/09/17/Indianapolis/B9318895218Z.1_20150917131843_000_GKNBV3CNA.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0537969c231a7a71e3c870fd99d9cbcfda695ff9/c=0-44-799-495&r=x1128&c=2000x1125/local/-/media/2015/06/27/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635710341994901842-GetImageContent-10.jpeg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/994549b66b1c202ed2e6c4662e81d6925889e2c3/c=0-10-3509-2642&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/17/Indianapolis/B9318895218Z.1_20150917131843_000_GKNBV3CNA.1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-18T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T02:48:13.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
