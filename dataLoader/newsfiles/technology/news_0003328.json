Firms in developed nations take advantage of cheaper labor costs in emerging markets. In fact, an increasing number of manufacturers are leaving the United States and Europe and setting up operations in North and Central Asia\" The Miller Industrial Jeans offers comfort and protection, says Cattya Bella, Director of Product Development for World Patent Marketing. Clothes are great for making a fashion statement but, sometimes, its primary purpose of protecting the body has been forgotten. This apparel invention is made of impenetrable material and is designed for hard labor. The Miller Industrial Jeans have pockets that industrial workers and people on the move can easily use as well as having removable knee pads that help protect the wearer. It also ensures comfort as the user walks, kneels, and moves stuff around. This apparel invention makes use of rectangular and flexible pads that allows for air flow and doesnt impede blood circulation. It has a snug fit and makes use of hook and loop fasteners that secures the knee pads in place. It can be used in any environment, be it hot or cold and will not wear down due to constant use. Most jobs, like those of plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and mechanics require people to stand, kneel and move around a lot, says inventor Gilbert M. For people working in a construction site, they may not be aware of the presence of a nail on the floor as they kneel. The Miller Industrial Jeans is an apparel invention that can save people from these accidents while being ergonomic and comfortable to wear. Nick Davis, a foreman and blogger from Kinston, NC, has this to say about the Miller Industrial Jeans: Working on ones knees has proven to be uneasy and difficult. Fortunately, the Miller Industrial Jeans is an apparel invention that provides plumbers and carpenters a little comfort while protecting them from a lot of possible accidents and injuries. The Miller Industrial Jeans is an apparel invention that will make the already hard labor of construction a bit easier to bear.
