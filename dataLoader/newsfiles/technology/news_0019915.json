But how did these murders come about? Agatha Christie, mistress of poison Photo: AFP By Kathryn Harkup \nPeople thinking of an Agatha Christie story usually imagine a country house with a butler , wealthy older relative, avaricious nieces or nephews and a cup of tea containing a pinch of arsenic . \nAgatha Christie in 1912 Photo: Rex \nArsenic has become almost a byword for poison but Christie's training as a dispenser meant she knew about a much broader range of poisons, many of them plant based. \nChristie's poisoners had access to poisons in medicine cabinets, garden sheds , and even the garden itself. So what are Agatha Christie's top five poisonous plants? Castor Oil Plant (ricinus communis) - The House of Lurking Death \nCastor oil plant Photo: Eleanor Bentall \nRicinus communis is the source of castor oil and is grown commercially. However, its attractive foliage means it is also often grown ornamentally in gardens. Apart from castor oil, the seeds of Ricinus communis contain ricin, a protein that can kill an adult in minute quantities. \nThe most famous victim of ricin was Georgi Markov who, in 1978 on Waterloo Bridge, London had a pellet fired into the back of his thigh releasing ricin into his blood stream. He died four days later because the ricin stopped the normal growth and repair process in his cells. \nGiorgi Markov Photo: Reuters \nAgatha Christie used ricin almost fifty years earlier in The House of Lurking Death when three members of the same household fall victim to ricin-laced sandwiches. Her description of ricin poisoning is a rare example of inaccuracies in Christie's science - her victims die far too quickly. \nAlthough ingesting ricin is considerably less risky than direct injection into the body, eating Ricinus seeds is not recommended, a handful of seeds, well chewed, can be fatal. Foxglove (digitalis) - Appointment with Death, Herb of Death, Postern of Fate, Crooked House \nFoxglove Photo: Alamy \nThe medical uses of foxglove are widely known and the plant has been used in medicinal preparations for hundreds of years. The digitalis compounds within the plant affect the heart, slowing and intensifying heart contractions. In the appropriate dose, digitalis compounds are an effective treatment for rapid and uncoordinated heart rhythms. \nToo much however, and the heart slows and stops, bringing about a rapid death. Christie used both the plant and isolated digitalis drugs to kill her victims. \nBecause foxgloves produce flowers in the second year of growth the poisoner in Postern of Fate and Herb of Death planted foxgloves amongst sage so the soft lance-shaped leaves would be collected accidentally and added to the evening meal. Hemlock - Five Little Pigs \nHemlock Photo: Alamy \nThere are two poisonous plants with the name hemlock , but they contain different poisons. Cicuta species contain a nerve toxin which causes convulsions. Spotted hemlock (Conium maculatum) contains coniine, also a nerve poison, but which causes paralysis. The same family of plants includes edible species such as parsley, wild parsnip and carrots. \nAnyone keen on foraged food should be certain they have picked the right thing. If in any doubt, don't eat it (or feed it to anyone else). \nAgatha Christie used this notorious poison in her novel Five Little Pigs. Amyas Crale had been killed by an extract of hemlock, coniine, added to his beer. \nThe slow paralysing effects of the compound caused him to stagger and collapse in front of his easel, still conscious he was unable to cry out or signal his distress. He died when coniine eventually paralysed the muscles for breathing. Deadly Nightshade (belladonna) - The Cretan Bull, The Caribbean Mystery, The Thumb Mark of St. Peter \nDeadly nightshade Photo: Alamy \nAtropa belladonna, or deadly nightshade , is just one of many plants that contain the lethal compound atropine. \nAtropine affects the nerves, increasing heart rate, reducing sweating and, famously, causes the pupils of the eyes to dilate. The juice of belladonna berries was once dropped into the eyes of renaissance women to dilate their pupils. \nAtropine is still used today, in appropriate doses, to dilate pupils allowing better examination of the interior of the eye. Christie's poisoners used atropine to induce terrifying hallucinations in their victims driving them to madness and suicide. Monkshood (aconitum nepallus) - 4:50 from Paddington, They Do It With Mirrors \nMonkshood Photo: Alamy \nThe toxic component of Aconitum plants is aconitine, a potent neurotoxin lethal in tiny quantities in its pure form. Symptoms appear approximately fifteen minutes after ingestion; there is a burning sensation in the mouth and throat. \nThe pain spreads and the victim dies after up to four hours in agony and convulsions. Aconitine can be ingested, injected or absorbed through the skin. Gardeners should think seriously about wearing gloves when handling the plant. \nI love Christie's work and find it all the more interesting for her usually very accurate and inventive use of poisons. There are many other examples of poisonous plants within Christie's writing. \nBut, anyone thinking of using her murderous methods as inspiration should be aware that all poisons are detectable. Dedicated pathologists and toxicologists mean you are very unlikely to get away with it. \nA is for Arsenic by Kathryn Harkup is published by Bloomsbury is available at Telegraph Books", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T16:26:13.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
