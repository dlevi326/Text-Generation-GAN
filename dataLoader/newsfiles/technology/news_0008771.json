Listed as endangered in 2005, the whales are struggling because of pollution, lack of food and other reasons.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/66/44/8612143/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/66/44/8612144/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/66/44/8612143/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/66/44/8612144/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-11T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T15:03:14.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
