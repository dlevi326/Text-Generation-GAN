At the conference, Kevin Huo, the founder of Geekbang & InfoQ China, announced that InfoQ has joined forces with domestic front-line IT technology companies to establish the CNUT Container Technology Club. The aim is to connect the Chinese container community, promote the development and practice of container technology and, more generally, open source software in China. CNUT is the acronym for Container Nut. \"Nut\" signifies tenacity, unity and subversion in Chinese culture, which coincides with the original intention of CNUT. CNUT will start with containers to promote the development of open source in China and enhance the Chinese community's right to speak. \nCNUTCon is the top container technology event held by InfoQ, and its purpose is to promote the development and practice of container technology. The two-day conference mainly serves senior technical staff who are interested in container technology. The conference focuses on technology and is designed to help attendees understand relevant open source projects and technology stacks, so that enterprises can build their own container solutions based on best practices and learn about development trends. \nIn the past two years, container technology has been rapidly developing and has moved into the production environment in China. There are a large number of committers working on container-related open source projects in China. Amongst them is HUAWEI, which ranks third for Docker contribution companies, is a founding member of the OCI open container initiative, and also has the only domestic Docker project, Maintainer. Alibaba has also invested heavily in the containers: Ali Baichuan TAE fully supports Docker, and Aliyun OSS has obtained official Docker support. In terms of scale, for many domestic companies, it is comparable to the large foreign companies. Weibo used Docker directly in its production environment during the last Spring Festival. Tencent games runs a bunch of heavyweight mobile games on Docker. There are also a lot Docker-based start-ups, such as Alauda , Dataman , DaoCloud and TenxCloud , all of which are exploring the commercial value of container technology. \nWhen the Docker project was released in 2013 InfoQ started to cover it. In 2014, InfoQ reported on Docker, CoreOS, Mesos, Kubernetes and other related technologies, interviewed a number of domestic Chinese companies for typical case studies of container technology practice, and produced several series of feature articles and other content. \nIn June, InfoQ held the first CNUT technology committee meeting , participants of which are technology leaders from major internet companies in China. Cui Yubao, chief architect from Mi, argued that the international influence of Chinese technology is not enough currently. InfoQ hopes it can connect domestic technology companies together through CNUT to the mutual benefit of technology, co-build the Chinese technical community, and enhance the Chinese community's right to speak. This is the exact purpose of CNUT container technology club. \nIn the future, CNUT container technology club will dedicate its work in the following fields: content wise, it will publish technical bulletins on container technology and white papers on container practice; activity wise, it will organise various activities and meetings such as technical summit, technical salon, Hackathon, container committer activities, and closed door meetings. This year is the first year of CNUT Con, which will continue to be run in the future. In addition CNUT will select a few domestic open source container projects to incubate in order to promote communication and cooperation in the field of domestic container technologies. \nCNUT founding members include Huawei, Baidu, Tencent, Weibo, Alibaba, Mi, Ctrip, Meituan, Souhu, Dianping, 360, Xueqiu, etc. In addition Google, Red Hat and CoreOS also participated in the CNUTCon, have expressed support for the container technology club, and hoped more people would get involved in the Chinese container technology community in the future. \nAt the end of the speech, Kevin Huo said \"Historically what InfoQ could do for container technology is mainly reports, well now, we together with the top domestic technical companies and experts, are going to do something for the entire container technology in order to promote the development of container technology in China\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T01:53:35.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
