Before they can get busy, drug molecules must run a biochemical gauntlet as the body’s machinery tries to break them down. As a result, much of what is in a pill may be excreted in useless pieces before it has had a chance to work its wonders.\nLast month, though, America’s pharmaceutical regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, received a request to approve a drug, currently called SD-809, that could change this. SD-809 is intended to treat the palsy caused by Huntington’s chorea—a rare and terrible genetic illness. If approved, it will open the gates for a new type of drug that, thanks to a few well-placed atoms of a variant of hydrogen called deuterium, is able to evade metabolic clearance, and thus remain active longer.\nIn this section Drugs that live long will prosper A charge that sticks Drawing the line Slippery customers United States Massachusetts Crime and law Science and technology Patents\nAn atom’s chemical properties are determined by its electrons, which interact with those of other atoms. Those electrons are equal in number to the protons in an atom’s nucleus (electrons are negative and protons positive, so the atom’s overall charge is zero), and this number in turn defines an atom’s elementary nature.\nMost atomic nuclei also contain neutrons, which have no electric charge. Atoms of the same element may have different numbers of neutrons. That changes their mass a little, but generally leaves their chemical behaviour unaffected. The exception is hydrogen. Most hydrogen atoms’ nuclei are lone protons. Adding a neutron, to create deuterium, doubles the mass. This is such a big change that it has an appreciable chemical effect. For instance, the bonds deuterium forms with carbon atoms are stronger than those formed between carbon and normal hydrogen.\nIn many cases, metabolic clearance depends on breaking particular carbon-hydrogen bonds. Replacing a few of a drug’s hydrogen atoms with deuterium can slow that process. Add some deuterium, then, and a drug may last longer.\nThe deuterated abides\nAll this was first noted in a couple of obscure patents granted in the 1970s, but the idea lay dormant until the middle of the last decade. Then, a few medicinal chemists pounced on it simultaneously as a way of making molecules that were novel, potentially useful and (at least at that time) non-obvious: in other words, patentable.\nA series of startup companies intent on making money from these facts duly followed. Most took the route of deuterating established drugs—starting, as Roger Tung, the boss of one of them, puts it, “with a molecule that you know is going to be effective, and has a high likelihood of being safe.” His firm, Concert, is based in Massachusetts. It has created a deuterated version of a drug intended to treat agitation in those with Alzheimer’s disease. This drug, licensed to Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, in Tokyo, is now being put through large-scale clinical trials. Concert is also working on, among other things, a deuterated version of GHB, a substance notoriously used by rapists to spike drinks, but which is actually useful for treating sleep disorders.\nSD-809 itself was developed by Auspex, a Californian firm that sold itself in May, for $3.5 billion, to an Israeli outfit called Teva. It is a deuterated version of tetrabenazine, made by Roche, a large Swiss company. A third firm, DeuteRx, also based in Massachusetts, has a drug called CC-122 which is now being tested against a number of different cancers. And these are only some of the most advanced products. Several hundred other patents for deuterated versions of existing drugs have been granted. However, the time lag between applying for a patent and getting a drug to market means that only now are the first of these approaching the point where they can be used and sold.\nNot every deuteration will lead to an improvement. Some deuterated drugs will merely be equivalent to their existing confrères. Some will fail even to be as good as that. Many, like Concert’s deuterated version of GHB, will work best only when partially deuterated in a specific way. But Graham Timmins, a medicinal chemist at the University of New Mexico who has been studying the field, reckons that when all is done and dusted, perhaps 5-10% of drugs on the market will be deuterated. The question is by whom?\nFor some, this question may ring bells, for there is an intriguing historical example of the essential idea involved: taking existing drugs and improving them by a trick that preserves their essence while altering their substance. That example is the case of optical isomerism.\nMany molecules, including many drug molecules, come in two forms, known as optical isomers, that are mirror images of one another. Often, only one of these isomers is clinically effective. But in the 1980s it emerged that the other can in fact be harmful. In those days, though, patent applications rarely mentioned isomerism, and manufacturing processes usually turned out mixtures of the two.\nThe founders of a company called Sepracor (now Sunovian) noticed this and began developing a set of single-isomer drugs that were not covered by existing patents, and were also often better than the existing versions. At the time it was revolutionary, but separating isomers quickly became standard practice among medicinal chemists, and thus eventually ceased to be patentable. It became, in patent parlance, “obvious to one skilled in the art.”\nA similar fate surely awaits deuterated drugs. In the decade since the idea got going, big pharma firms have learned to mention the effects of deuteration in their new-drug patent applications, so the game is now pretty much up. Moreover, Dr Timmins’ examination of the patent literature found that the American patent office has started rejecting applications for deuterated versions of existing drugs. Deuterating, too, has become an obvious practice.\nThat, and the fact the drugs are now so close to market, spells legal battles ahead. Where exactly the line between innovative and obvious will get drawn, and therefore who, apart from patients, will profit from the new medicines remains to be seen. But whoever does end up winning in court, it will not change a basic fact: deuterated drugs will soon be widespread, and the result will be fewer pills to swallow.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20150905_STD001_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T06:04:55.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
