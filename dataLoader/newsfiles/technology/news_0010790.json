Advantest is a Platinum sponsor of this year's conference. \nProducts Featured in the Booth Live demonstrations of Advantest's on-demand CloudTesting Service and its EVA100 tester for analog, mixed-signal and sensor ICs will be given in booth #323 in the South Hall of the Disneyland Hotel. \nThe first-of-its-kind CloudTesting Service allows users to access various IP selections whenever needed from Advantest's website. Using this on-demand online service, designers can verify their new silicon at very low cost with no capital investment. It allows users to set up their own test environment within a few hours and be ready to test when a device arrives from the fab. With free tester leasing and repairs, Advantest's CloudTesting Service allows customers to avoid maintenance issues and unplanned expenses. \nWith its modular architecture and high-voltage, high-precision analog parametric measurement units, the EVA100 tester has the flexibility to conduct a wide range of measurements over a broad range of analog and mixed-signal devices. The EVA100's GUI interface is highly intuitive so users do not need advanced coding skills to quickly develop test programs and rapidly receive feedback on critical design parameters. This minimizes the time to release the latest ICs to market. \nPaper Presentations In addition to its exhibits, Advantest is involved in several presentations during ITC TestWeek. \nOn Tuesday, October 6 at 1:20 p.m. at the Corporate Forum staged within the exhibit hall of the Disneyland Hotel, Advantest's A. Lum will host a discussion on rapid test development using the EVA100 system. \nThat same afternoon at 2:00 p.m. during technical session #3 in the Magic Kingdom Ballroom 4, a paper will be presented on a new method of measuring alias-free aperture jitter in an ADC output. The authors are T. Yamaguchi and K. Uekusa of Advantest Laboratories, K. Degawa, M. Kawabata and M. Ishida from Advantest and M. Soma of the University of Washington. \nOn Thursday, October 8 at 9:00 a.m. in technical session #21 on RF and high-speed testing in the hotel's Magic Kingdom Ballroom 2, a paper titled \"An ATE System for Testing 2.4-GHz RF Digital Communication Devices with QAM Signal Interfaces\" will be given. The authors are M. Ishida and K. Ichiyama of Advantest. \nIn addition, Advantest will be a corporate sponsor of the 6th IEEE International Workshop on Testing Three-Dimensional Stacked ICs at Anaheim's Disneyland Hotel on Friday, October 9, the day after ITC concludes. S. Neches of Advantest will host a tabletop presentation titled \"Analysis of Advanced Semiconductor IC Devices Using Terahertz Frequency Technology,\" describing the company's new TS9000 THZ system that uses short-pulse terahertz and sub-terahertz frequencies to analyze advanced ICs. \nConnect on Social Media For the latest updates from the global test leader, follow Advantest on Twitter @Advantest_ATE. \nAbout Advantest Corporation A world-class technology company, Advantest is a leading producer of automatic test equipment (ATE) for the semiconductor industry and a premier manufacturer of measuring instruments used in the design and production of electronic instruments and systems.
