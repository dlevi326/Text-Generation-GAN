Photo: supplied\nMany new digital cameras come with ultra high definition video recording – usually referred to as 4K. For instance, the Panasonic DMC FZ300 reviewed today records 4K video, as well as the usual 1080 line high definition format. Which raises the question: does a new camera demand a new TV?\nThe time has come to put the 4K system through some serious testing, and the Panasonic is the camera for the job. We were impressed with the camera's video ability and even more impressed when we viewed the output on a 4K television, in this case the Sony Bravia X83C 123cm ($2299 rrp). And while testing the video system we could also check out the television as a display device for still photos.\nThe X83C is one of the smallest ultra high definition sets. We are not seduced by size in TVs because the larger the screen – viewing distance being the same – the lower the subjective resolution. Also, an important consideration with ultra HD is the issue of upscaling from lower definition source material. The Sony does a decent job of upscaling and our 1080 line videos look very good, but 576 line standard definition free-to-air programs are sometimes barely acceptable.\nThe Panasonic 4K video was edited using Apple's Final Cut Pro X which output a 4K master file, copied to a USB stick. We plugged it into the Sony and were amazed that such a picture could be created and displayed using relatively inexpensive equipment.\nAdvertisement The rendered detail, the sharpness, colour and luminous shadows must be seen to be believed.\nThe Sony is also well set-up for displaying still photos. There is a set of dedicated picture styles for photos, the best of which cancel over-sharpening and high contrast, and render beautiful images on a screen with no visible pixel grid. There is a slideshow function for hands-free picture changing.\nUHD 4K is a sort of interim technology. There are no 4K discs, but they are coming, and there is a small library of UHD programs on Netflix and YouTube. 1080 line programs on Stan, Presto and Netflix are brilliant, as is BluRay source material. The quality of DVD replay is variable and is affected by the DVD player – newer players upscale better. Standard definition TV varies from unwatchable to acceptable.\nThe famous bottom line: we like the Sony Bravia so much that we have bought it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T23:09:23.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
