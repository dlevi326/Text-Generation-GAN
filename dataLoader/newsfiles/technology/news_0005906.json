Often the protagonist is a male character with several potential female partners, but some titles – called otome games – have a female protagonist with male suitors and others feature same-sex pairings or don’t enforce gender restrictions. The game is won by building up enough of a relationship with a chosen partner to fulfil a relationship goal such as dating, sex, or marriage, often within a time limit. The inclusion of multiple available partners adds replay value.\nHow do you play them?\nMost dating sims feature simple graphics, commonly still images, and lots of text. Players interact with the game through dialogue with the other characters and choosing actions from text menus. Often your character has stats that you can build up through choosing certain activities to focus on in the time limit, which may make the character more or less attractive to a partner.\nThe popular date\nHuniePop is a mature dating sim for PC, Mac and Linux, with a female or male character who has several female partners to choose from. You buy them food, ask them questions and can take them on dates by playing match-three puzzles, after which you can sleep with them.\nA YouTube video explaining Hatoful Boyfriend. The offbeat date\nIn Hatoful Boyfriend you play a female student at a school for birds. Humans have been relegated to a lesser role in society and she is expected to date a bird. Originally Japanese, Hatoful Boyfriend was released on PC, Mac and Linux in the UK last year and recently on PS4 and Vita.\nBest date for a beginner\nHakuoki tells a supernatural tale of a girl who ends up in the 19th-century world of Japan’s shinsengumi and can have a romantic relationship with several of the warriors she meets. It’s available for iOS and Android, making it a good choice for those interested in learning about the genre.", "external_links": ["http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/hatoful-boyfriend", "http://www.hakuoki.com/", "http://www.huniepot.com/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynGhR81w-ZE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynGhR81w-ZE"], "published": "2015-09-11T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T15:22:38.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
