From vital sign monitoring in ICU to 3D skull printing analysis for Neurosurgery, ONYX ZEUS all-in-one surgical workstation powered by Intel technology enables surgeon to make real-time clinical decisions with simultaneous access to high precision medical images and electronic health records. 6th Generation Intel® Core™ processor Skylake is the first Intel CPU supporting DDR 4 Memory. Applying the increased processing power, 30 percent graphic performance enhancement, and multiple display outputs with Ultra HD 4K resolution display capability, next generation 22” ONYX all-in-one multi-touch access surgical workstation (ZEUS-228) featuring both U-series dual core and H-series quad core i7 CPU unlocks the possibility of true 3D medical imaging to empower surgeons with advanced clinical diagnosis during the procedure.\nCombining with Intel IoT infrastructure, ONYX technology enables real-time patient monitoring through implanted medical sensors and connected patient care environment through encrypted patient data transition powered by Intel Security.\n“The lack of real-time access to EHR systems by the patient side has resulted in a reduction in productivity”, said John Chuang, President of ONYX Healthcare USA, Inc. “By continuing to build on the latest Intel technology, we are able to fast track our medical grade computing platform development for intelligent medical device design.”\n“By using the new 6th generation Intel® Core™ processor Skylake family, the medical computing technology provider Onyx can incorporate dramatically higher CPU and graphics performance, a wide range of power and feature scalability, and new advanced features into their medical device designs”, said Samuel Cravatta, product line director, Internet of Things Group, Intel.\nAs the trend of Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) and the requirement to reduce readmission rate keep rising, healthcare organizations will continue deploying more medical grade computing platforms like ONYX Healthcare’s technology powered by evolving Intel technology in the surgical suite to achieve precise clinical outcomes and improved patient experiences.\nFor more information about ONYX products, please visit http://usa.onyx-healthcare.com\nAbout ONYX Healthcare Inc.\nONYX Healthcare Inc., with 15+ years of medical design experiences, leverages embedded computing technology to design and manufacture medical grade (UL/EN60601) embedded boards and fanless medical AIO system platforms as the building block to medical device OEM and healthcare IT business.\nONYX Healthcare Inc. is an associate member of the Intel® Internet of Things Solutions Alliance.
