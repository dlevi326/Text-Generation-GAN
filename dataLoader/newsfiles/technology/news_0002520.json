Today's announcement includes new HIPswitch security appliances and major software enhancements that enrich the user experience and increases platform performance by up to nearly 85 percent, depending upon model. In support of this news, Tempered Networks also announced its new CyberGuardian partner program and portal . \n\"The Tempered Networks solution adds another layer of security through network micro-segmentation to protect high value and vulnerable endpoints and systems,\" said Jeff Wilson, Research Director, Cybersecurity Technology at Infonetics Research. \"Their solution helps tame the complexity of deploying and managing highly segmented networks, and adds a layer of security for non-traditional unmanaged or unmanageable endpoints that are connecting to all types of networks.\" \nFacts \nNew capabilities in Product UI The latest release delivers key enhancements to the SimpleConnect user interface (UI), giving customers the ability to easily handle large scale deployments -- up to thousands of devices. New UI features allow customers to: Easily import or export devices and assign them to specific HIPswitches Automatically discover devices Easily create multiple device groupings, making granular micro-segmentation and complex communications policy configurations easy Enforce MAC address lock down on a device or group of devices -- One Click! Group HIPswitches and perform firmware updates on groups of HIPswitches \nSoftware enhancements for improved performance The new software release has improved the performance of the HIPswitch appliances by approximately 85 percent (depending upon model) preserving customers' current investment in Tempered Networks. \nNew 2nd Generation Hardware The new HIPswitch-100e and HIPswitch-100g security appliances deliver increased performance, a wider operating temperature range to function across extreme conditions, and expanded connectivity options with serial to IP encapsulation. \n\"Part of the value proposition for Tempered Network's solutions is ease of use at scale,\" said Jeff Pancottine, SVP of Sales and Marketing at Tempered Networks. \"Our new discovery and grouping functionality allows an administrator to configure policies on very large installations in seconds. Coupled with automated orchestration, the human error component of legacy security solutions is all but removed. Time is money, and these new capabilities allow administrators to get on with other things in their busy days.\" \nHelping customers cut the IT complexity The exponential growth of devices and systems converging onto the corporate network correspondingly creates more network connections and consequently a broader attack surface. Tempered Networks' platform provides a completely different approach to secure networking, enabling organizations to 'cloak' assets. Unlike traditional firewalls, VPNs, VLANs, etc., the Tempered Networks solution encrypts host identities creating cryptographic IDs that hide devices from all but trusted peers -- rendering the devices undetectable outside the Tempered trusted network. The trust relationships -- and all aspects of secure policies -- are then centrally managed through the integrated orchestration engine. The result: a micro-segmented network based on device-whitelisting that reduces the attack surface by an order of magnitude. \nThe new software release builds on the solution's overall value proposition with added capabilities enabling customers to: Significantly reduce risk of human error / misconfiguration Easily deploy and manage large scale environments -- up to thousands of endpoints Have greater flexibility for change management \nAvailability The new software release is available today. The new HIPswitches 100e and 100g are available today. Customers under current maintenance agreements have access to the new release at no additional charge.
