Though still under construction, the 117-story mixed-use building achieved its maximum height of 597 m (1,958 ft) on September 8, thus ensuring its status as one of the world's tallest skyscrapers. \nDevelopment firm Goldin Properties refers to the skyscraper as the second tallest in the world, and the tallest in China in terms of structural height. This is a contentious and complex issue though, as the influential Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat dropped this method of measuring skyscrapers in 2009 in favor of height to architectural top, highest occupied floor, and height to tip. \nUsing these yardsticks, the Walking Stick would stumble several places in the world's tallest stakes, and even lose out on bragging rights to China's tallest skyscraper, in favor of the Shanghai Tower. \nThough architecturally rather dull, the Walking Stick's design is enlivened by its distinctive diamond-shaped glazed upper section that comprises a luxury hotel, revolving restaurant, viewing point, and a swimming pool. \nThe main body of the tower is earmarked for rented office space, while villas, residential buildings, retail spaces, a convention center, entertainment center, and polo club are also slated for the development. \nThe construction team is shooting for LEED Platinum (a top green building award) certification, though we've no information at this time as to what green design elements are integrated into the tower. Goldin Finance 117 is due to open for business sometime in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:24:55.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
