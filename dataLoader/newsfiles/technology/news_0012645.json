The deal comes little more than a year after merger talks between Dialog and Austria's AMS broke down and less than a month after Atmel announced the launch of a strategic review. \nThe Deal flagged Atmel as a potential target back in March, noting that the company could get caught in a wave of consolidation changing the chipmaking landscape. Atmel was then added to The Deal's Watch List of possible activist targets after industry sources identified the company as a \"perpetual favorite\" of insurgents. Last month, Jaewon Kang reported that Atmel could be worth $4 billion in a sale. \nMicrochip Technology ( MCHP - Get Report ) , Qualcomm ( QCOM - Get Report ) , Intel ( INTC - Get Report ) and Taiwan's MediaTek were all seen as likely suitors. \nThe agreement continues a long line of M&A transactions in the semiconductor sector, including Intel's June deal to buy Altera ( ALTR ) for $16.7 billion. \nMust Read: Warren Buffet's Top 10 Stock Buys \nDialog, which is domiciled in the U.K. but listed in Frankfurt, said it expects savings of $150 million within two years of combining with its Californian peer. The acquisition will boost earnings per share in 2017, the first full year, Dialog predicted. \nThe offer is worth $10.42 per Atmel share, split into $4.65 in cash and 0.112 of a Dialog share, and would leave Atmel shareholders with 38% of the combined company. \nAt $10.24 per share, based on Dialog's Friday closing price, it's a 43% premium to Atmel's closing price of $7.27 on Nasdaq on Friday . Dialog would pay $4.6 billion for the stock but the enterprise value of the deal falls to $4.4 billion, since Atmel has about $200 million of net cash. \nFunding will include a new $2.1 billion financing package, Dialog said. \nAdvisers include a Jones Day team led by Khoa Do and Daniel Mitz for Atmel. Scott Wornow is leading the internal legal team at Atmel, while Qatalyst Partners LP's George Boutros and Jason DiLullo are its financial advisers. \nMorgan Stanley bankers including Mark Solomons are Dialog's financial advisers and Davis Polk & Wardwell lawyers including William Kelly and Steve Salmon, and Reynolds Porter Chamberlain are providing its legal advice.
