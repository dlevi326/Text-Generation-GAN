Now it's more like once every two weeks.\" \nChan bought his license in 2004 for $240,000, but he is worried its value could be plummeting. \n\"I don't know how much it's worth now, if it's worth something,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T11:02:30.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
