The speed limit is 80 km/h on that section and I gustily reach my speed limit( in a effort not tohold up other people) in the fast lane in my trusty old Ford Ranger and keep in the fast lane as I wanted to turn off to the right at the next robot.\nSuddenly I saw a gray/silver Mercedes Benz in my rear view mirror coming at a M@#rse speed. Now this is normal as some rich young idiot always wants to go 160 km/h in town and when you don’t move quick enough they start flashing their headlights at you like I’m the idiot! Funny if he maintained the speed limit none of us would have had this problem in the first place!!!\nI decided I’m gona keep in the fast lane cause in 900 m I have to turn right so this idiot can just wait a bit, but he is persistent and is in the back of my bakkie so close I can’t even see his headlights!!! I thought well I’m not gona move I adhere to the speed limit and so should he!!.\nWhen I arrived at the robot with my blood boiling I wanted to straighten this dude out, cause what if I was an innocent old lady that was doing the speed limit and ………………….then I opened my window to start my speech …..When I saw it was a woman and her husband next to her was having a STROKE!!! And she wanted to get past to get him to the hospital.\nShe obviously swore at me in the most animated language “you f%&$ng idiot my husband is having a stroke ” Then I did feel like an idiot! When she drove off I saw her taillights hazards and it made sense why the dude was so persistent.\nNow I can make allot of excuses and blame the idiots that always flashes and tails someone that drives the speed limit but in this instance I Just want to Apologize whole heartedly and say “I AM VERY SORRY MAM” If I saw the hazards earlier I would not have hesitated and I am sorry I was not more attentive. If the lady in question ever reads this apology (which I hope as I thought that News24 will reach the largest audience) or a friend that knows this person (cause I can imagine that she would have told someone about the incident) “I AM TRULLY SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY ” ” I WAS WRONG AND YOU WHERE RIGHT”\nI really feel bad and it’s all my fault. I really hope you managed to get your husband to hospital on time and that he is well. I will leave my email address at the end of this letter if you do read this contact me and I will personally apologise as a gentleman and Christian should and I will be forever great full for your forgiveness as this was entirely my fault and wrongdoing and should not have occurred I AM TRULLY SORRY!!!\nMy sincere apology to whom this may concern\nPaul Euvrard\nmtbxcoxt@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T22:05:12.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
