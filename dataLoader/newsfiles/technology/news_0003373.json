This news follows a recent announcement that the port was looking into using robotics technology in the next three months as a way of developing port operations.\nContainer volumes increased to 0.4% to more than 972,000 TEU from more than 968,000 TEU in the financial year prior. Container handling productivity hit record highs on all measures\nTotal group revenue was recorded at US$245.1 million, down from $248.3 million the year prior, reflecting the sale of its subsidiary Connlinx part way through the year.\nUnderlying profit was $68.8 million compared to $71 million in the previous financial year, which is a decrease of 3.2%.\nTony Gibson, CEO of the Ports of Auckland, said: “We have delivered another strong dividend for the city and are well-positioned for further growth.\n“There is much about our performance of which Aucklanders can be proud. We have made better than expected progress replacing container volumes after Maersk moved a major service away from Auckland early in our financial year.  Container volumes finished the year 0.4% up, against expectations that volumes might fall.\n“Multi-Cargo volumes have held up well, with car volumes increasing 17.4% to a record 243,801 units. Total breakbulk tonnage (including cars) was up 4.4% on the year before.”\nGibson continued: “By growing export volumes through the port we will balance the volumes of imports being driven by Auckland’s strong growth and achieve greater supply chain efficiencies.  It is a win-win for Auckland and for New Zealand on the global stage.”\nAs part of this strategy we are actively growing the use of rail to move containers.  Rail services increased from eight per week to 21 and rail volumes are up to over 100,000 TEU a year. \nGibson concluded: “Overall, our performance has been good given the challenges we have faced.  We have a comprehensive range of initiatives underway that will ensure we continue to deliver strong dividends to the city.”\nFor all the latest on the ports of Auckland, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:39:25.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
