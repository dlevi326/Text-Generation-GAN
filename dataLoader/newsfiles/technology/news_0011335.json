KeyRadar combines multiple bands with sophisticated processing and target detection/recognition software to find concealed targets in the most challenging operational environments. Furthermore, our software-defined, modular open system architecture enables users to rapidly field new capabilities to operational systems, significantly lowering total life cycle costs. \nThis product sale to the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center is part of a $6.7 million program to integrate KeyRadar into an MQ-9 unmanned aerial system pod and demonstrate its unique capabilities for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and targeting applications. \nSeparately, KEYW was also awarded a $4.4 million contract by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to develop a next-generation multi-INT, plug-and-play pod that enables the Air Force to rapidly reconfigure sensor suites in the field. The Agile Manufacturing for ISR (AM-ISR) program will also develop novel manufacturing techniques to reduce the cost and time to field new sensor systems using aircraft pods. \nFinally, KEYW is pleased to announce the successful completion of the first year of its four-year Contested Environment RF Exploitation Research (CERFER) program for AFRL. This year’s activities culminated in a series of airborne flight tests, using our next-generation radar integrated into our KEYW-modified aircraft. In the CERFER program, KEYW is developing innovative software and hardware enhancements that will enable in-place upgrades to the KeyRadar products during their operational service. \nMark Willard, interim CEO, stated, “We are truly excited about the opportunities ahead for our new KeyRadar product line. These competitive awards demonstrate the agility and innovation of KEYW in both the radar and broader markets we serve.” \nCommercial pricing and delivery options for KeyRadar are available by request.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T09:42:33.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
