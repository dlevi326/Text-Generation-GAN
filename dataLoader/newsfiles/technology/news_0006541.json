Using data to target improper payments will help ensure that payments only go those who are eligible and that the Department can determine eligibility in the most cost-effective and efficient way for recipients.\" \nThe RFI is part of a recent DHS announcement regarding the use of innovative data analytics and technologies to modernize its handling of program integrity functions that block improper payments. \nThe Department is soliciting prospective data management contractors for ideas about where DHS can use technology, nationally-proven methods, and predictive data analysis to track provider payments and identify any patterns that require more investigation. Currently, data mining is time-consuming and conducted manually by staff through review of claims data. Respondents may be asked to perform demonstrations of their capabilities to DHS staff. \nFor more information, visit www.emarketplace.state.pa.us/Solicitations.aspx?SID=RFI Data Analytics 2015 . \nMEDIA CONTACT : Kait Gillis, 717-425-7606 \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pennsylvania-dhs-continues-modernization-of-program-integrity-efforts-300141138.html \nSOURCE Pennsylvania Department of Human Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:34:01.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
