Every city is different and will move on a unique timeline, so we’ll keep in touch with residents about our progress along the way,\" Szuchmacher wrote.\nAnalysts estimate that installing Google Fiber, including burying fiber-optic cable, costs more than $500 a home. Fiber is one of Google's newer projects such as Nest that are now a part of Alphabet.\n190 CONNECT 135 TWEET 34 LINKEDIN 7 //usat.ly/1UK23BY TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635775035826909285-GoogleFiber.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UK23BY&text=Google%20Fiber%20considers%20three%20new%20cities&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8c5748c73f4e80cbcff09e84bed41761bc2045b7/c=45-0-723-510&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635775035826909285-GoogleFiber.JPG", "http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2015/09/exploring-three-new-cities-for-fiber.html", "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2015/09/10/google-fiber-city-examine-ultrafast-internet/71930034/", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UK23BY&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1UK23BY", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/31ea35e0a9763722cbfc8d483e85b96aea33c15e/c=100-0-804-704/local/-/media/2015/08/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635761947922608986-goog.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-11T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:32:09.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
