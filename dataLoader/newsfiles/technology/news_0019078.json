That’s good to know! I guess I’ll take a shower then!”\nJust three months after Microsoft paid billions for his company Notch reportedly paid $70 million for a Beverly Hills mansion, complete with a 2,500 bottle wine room, a candy room, and 15 bathrooms.\nSome Twitter users suggested Notch use his billions for good, therefore giving the programmer-turned CEO a sense of purpose, but Notch said that would just compound his issues.\n“I would [emulate Elon] Musk and try to save the world, but that just exposes me to the same type of assholes that made me sell minecraft again,” he wrote.\nIt seems the online vent worked, with Notch concluding that the impromptu therapy session had helped him work through some issues.\n“I really appreciate all the offers to hang and talk and all. As an introvert, new friends is hard to do even when fine, but it means a lot!” he wrote.\nd”And just venting and not feeling like I had to hide made it feel a bit easier to cope with already.”\nThe tech industry has been grappling with issues related to work-life balance and the immense pressure placed on CEOs and executives recently, with giant e-retailer Amazon coming under fire over past weeks for having an especially harsh and unforgiving workplace culture.\nA New York Times article which cited more than 100 current and former employees, describedw a wildly successful but ruthless company where workers are encouraged to report each other to supervisors for transgressions such as “inflexibility and openly complaining about minor tasks.”\nThe article said the firm’s employees are expected to answer emails well into the night and workers are commonly seen crying at their desks.\nThis article was first published in The Australian Business Review.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/minecraft-creator-notch-hates-being-a-billionaire/story-e6frgakx-1227506044627"], "published": "2015-08-31T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:30:42.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
