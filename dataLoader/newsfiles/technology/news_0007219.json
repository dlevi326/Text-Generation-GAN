It's a real challenge,\" said Drezet, who urges a complete \"rethink\" of France's tax system to plug the internet holes. \n\nGovernments of developed economies have acted in the past year to dissuade companies -- especially internet titans -- from registering their headquarters abroad in countries with lower taxes. \n\nThe fear now is that as the digital revolution continues, increasing numbers of traditional businesses will join the flight offshore, taking with them the tax revenues societies in developed countries rely on. \n\nConscious of that danger, members of France's Senate finance committee have authored two reports proposing solutions to a national tax system they term \"obsolete.\" \n\nTo combat online tax evasion, the reports propose replacing the current VAT collection procedure, where vendors collect the money from customers and are then supposed to pass it along to the state. \n\nInstead the taxes would be withheld by the buyer's bank during the transaction and paid directly to the government. \n\nMore broadly, legislators suggest taxes on revenues generated in the shared economy be centrally collected by an independent platform that can automatically transmit those to national administrations. \n\nUnder that plan, only income above 5,000 euros ($5,600) would be subject to taxation -- a limit the reports' authors say will help distinguish individuals involved in sharing services from high-volume professionals posing as private parties. \n\nOfficials at France's finance ministry say before a wider reform of the nation's tax system is undertaken, there must be greater clarification of rules designating commercial activity, on one hand, and personal income on the other. \n\nMeanwhile, ministry authorities are already focusing on ways to prevent tax avoidance by online businesses, while also appealing to the civic sensibilities of larger Internet actors to contribute their part of the collective effort. \n\nOne success in that came in late August, with the announcement by apartment sharing service Airbnb that it will begin retaining a 0.83 euro nightly bed tax applicable in Paris from hosts' accounts.
