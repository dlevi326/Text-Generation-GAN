Unlike all existing solutions, this tool can change backgrounds on secondary monitors as well. The tool is available for all Windows versions since Windows Vista.\nChanging the picture that Windows displays on its Logon screen is a popular request among Windows users. There are several reasons: standard images do not suit the user theme, do not satisfy user's taste or just become boring. In addition, those users who have a multi-monitor system want to get rid of \"pure blackness\" on their secondary displays, as the system (including the latest Windows 10) simply shows nothing there.\nTo meet the wishes of such users, Actual Tools has introduced the Logon Screen Background Changer feature in the new version of their multi-monitor utility Actual Multiple Monitors. The feature allows users to change the background image of Logon Screen not only on the main display, like any other similar solution, but on all the additional ones.\nMoreover, it is possible to run a slideshow on each secondary monitor: the user can customize a set of picture files and folders and then enjoy the favorite pictures changing on secondary monitors while the computer is locked or is not logged on. This extension can please not only home users but also business owners who use multi-monitor Windows stations to run ads and promos on secondary displays: with this extension, it is enough just to boot a PC to run promo slideshows.\nPricing and availability\nActual Multiple Monitors runs on all Windows platforms from Windows 2000 onwards and costs 24.95 USD for a single-user license. Discounts for volume buyers are available (please refer to http://www.actualtools.com/multiplemonitors/order/#volume_discounts). Additional information on Actual Multiple Monitors, a collection of tutorial articles and success stories, and a 30-day evaluation copy are available on the Actual Tools website.\nAbout\nActual Tools delivers desktop and window management software since 2002. Highly acclaimed products keep receiving positive reviews both from press and end users. Each program by Actual Tools, a user friendly piece of software itself, brings more convenience to Windows by adding quick-access yet powerful functions.\nLinks\nCompany website: http://www.actualtools.com\nProduct page: http://www.actualtools.com/multiplemonitors/\nDownload: http://www.actualtools.com/multiplemonitors/download/#current", "external_links": ["http://www.actualtools.com/multiplemonitors/download/#current", "http://www.actualtools.com/multiplemonitors/", "http://www.actualtools.com/multiplemonitors/order/#volume_discounts)."], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:07:46.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
