And almost 50% of teens believe that cyberbullying is a bigger problem for teenagers than drug abuse. \nThis is according to the results of a global survey released by Vodafone today. The survey spanned 11 countries, includng South Africa, and interviewed nearly 5,000 teens. \nThe survey, conducted by YouGov, found that an average of 18 percent of teens around the world had been cyberbullied. Other findings include: \n- 41 percent said cyberbullying made them feel depressed or helpless (also 41%) \n- 26 percent felt ‘completely alone’ and 18 percent experienced suicidal thoughts \n- 21 percent had ‘not gone to school’ and 25 percent closed down their social media accounts \n- 38 percent said they did not tell their parents or guardians, as they felt ashamed (32%), scared their parents would get involved (40%), or worried what their parents might do (36%). \n43 percent of those surveyed said they would find it hard to support a friend who had been bullied on social media, as they ‘could not find the right words’ to show support. 72 percent of teens said they would be likely to use an emoji to express compassion or support for friends being cyberbullied. \nOf the 11 countries surveyed, children aged 13-18 surveyed in the UK are the least likely to think cyberbullying is worse than bullying face to face (35%), whereas over six in 10 (64%) of the children surveyed in South Africa would agree that cyberbullying is worse than bulling face to face. \nOf the 11 countries surveyed, children aged 13-18 surveyed in New Zealand are most likely to have ever personally been bullied; 3 in 10 children in New Zealand, followed by 27% of those surveyed in USA and 26% of those surveyed in Ireland. \nChildren surveyed in the Czech Republic are the least likely to have personally been cyberbullied of the 11 countries surveyed. \nOf those children surveyed in New Zealand who said they had personally been bullied, over 3 in 5 reported feeling upset (62%), over half said they were angry with the bully (53%) and 47% said they felt depressed. \nOf the children surveyed from the UK who had said they had been cyberbullied, over half (54%) said it made them think of themselves in a more negative way. \nChildren aged 13-18 surveyed in South Africa would be most likely to share an emoji that has been created to show support/ compassion for people who are being cyberbullied (90%), followed by Italy (83%) and Greece (77%) \nIn response to the findings, Vodafone today launched the #BeStrong anti-cyberbullying emoji initiative, which involved the creation of a suite of ‘support emojis’ to raise awareness of the importance of conveying compassion, sympathy and support when friends are being bullied online. \nPsychologist adviser for ‘Inside Out’ film, Berkley University Professor Dacher Keltner, explains the importance of teens being able to offer support and show sympathy to their peers being cyberbullied. He said: “A lot of emojis can be limited for communicating emotions. The bystander needs better tools. Specific emojis that they can send their friends to show that they are there for them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:46:02.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
