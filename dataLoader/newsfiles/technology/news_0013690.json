Click here to learn more.\nAccording to Dr. Eldad De-Medonsa, bestPTs’ President and PhD in Artificial Intelligence, the effects of the transition to ICD-10 will remain unknown for some time. “The only thing that is certain about the transition to ICD-10 is that insurance companies leverage its challenges and uncertainties to delay longer and underpay more insurance claims. Because of a huge increase in the number of codes, a simple one-to-one mapping between the old and the new codes does not exist, as demonstrated in the standard GEMs tool. We leverage the cloud, billing experts, and Artificial Intelligence to analyze millions of insurance claims and generate effective transition rules,” says De-Medonsa.\nClick here to learn more.\nAbout BestPT and Billing Dynamix, LLC\nBestPT by Billing Dynamix is a comprehensive cloud-based Physical Therapy Practice Management system that includes intuitive EMR, industry-leading billing, scheduling, and powerful yet simple workflow management.
