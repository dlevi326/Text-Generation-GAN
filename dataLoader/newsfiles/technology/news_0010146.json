There have been many documented cases of congressional staffers sprucing up their boss's biographies on Wikipedia. The website even has an entry dedicated to the subject.\nThe study didn't determine who removed the negative facts, but it did track how long it took for the information to be deleted.\nThe study was done by two political scientists, one at the University of California and one at Yale University. It was published on the website, PLOS ONE.\nIn the summer and fall of 2014 - right before congressional elections - researchers gathered two verifiable facts about each senator that were not already on their Wikipedia pages. One fact was complimentary and the other was negative.\nResearchers then added the facts to senators' Wikipedia pages and tracked whether they were removed.\nAn example of positive information used by researchers: During the government shutdown in 2013, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., donated about $8,000 of her salary to North Dakota charities.\nAn example of negative information: The Annenberg Public Policy Center (Factcheck.org) has accused Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., of lying to voters by insisting that if they liked their health insurance plan, they would be able to keep it.\nThe results: Negative facts were 36 percent more likely to be removed within 12 hours and 29 percent more likely to be removed within three days.\n\"We find strong evidence of an editorial bias toward positivity,\" the study said.\nThe results were consistent across party lines, for longtime senators and newer ones, for those from big states and those from small states.\nBut when researchers did the experiment on former senators who no longer held public office, they found that positive and negative facts were removed at about the same rate.\n\"Our findings suggest the editorial bias is limited to active politicians, the types of people for whom the stakes of a positive public image are the highest,\" the study said.\n___\nUnhappy about a congressional investigation you consider one-sided and want to see halted? When you're a member of the minority party in the House, you can complain about it and ... well, that's about it.\nThat's where House Democrats find themselves as four congressional committees investigate Planned Parenthood and secretly recorded videos showing the group's officials talking about giving fetal tissue to medical researchers.\nThose videos were produced by a group of anti-abortion activists calling themselves the Center for Medical Progress. Democrats want the congressional committees to suspend their investigations or to also probe the center, which Planned Parenthood says is a bunch of ideologues who have released misleadingly edited tapes.\nThe center \"may have violated numerous state and federal laws in their clandestine effort to roll back the rights of millions of women\" seeking care from Planned Parenthood, Reps. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and John Conyers, D-Mich., wrote in a letter Thursday.\nThe center has already become a target of U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, whose office says the group hasn't paid required fees or submitted certain IRS forms. It is also under investigation by Democratic Attorney General Kamala Harris of California, where the center lists its address.\nThe Democrats' letter went to Reps. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who respectively chair the House Judiciary and Government Reform committees. Both chairmen made clear they'll keep moving ahead.\n\"Our investigation will continue to ensure that no federal funds were used in potentially illegal activity involving fetal tissue at any Planned Parenthood facility or affiliate,\" said MJ Henshaw, spokeswoman for the Oversight panel.\n___\nHouse Republicans from contested districts who want financial and logistical help have been able to get it from the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP's political arm.\nNow, it turns out that in exchange, some of them have to sign a detailed memorandum of understanding that promises to give the committee a detailed description of their legislative agenda and the political rational behind it.\nThe memo, first obtained by The Washington Post, must be signed for lawmakers to join the committee's Patriot Program, which lists 23 vulnerable members it is helping. Lawmakers must agree to do more than a dozen things, including raising at least $100,000 for the NRCC this year, using staff and vendors who meet NRCC standards and reporting on plans for campaign events and demographic targets.\nAlso required: \"Detailed, written legislative strategy that provides short, intermediate and long-term legislative goals, including political justifications for those goals. Be sure to include local issues unique to the district or region,\" the memo says.\nDemocrats suggested that the GOP has gone too far. Spokeswoman Meredith Kelly of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said the House Democratic political operation makes sure its candidates run smart campaigns \"but would never require submission and approval of a legislative agenda, especially in exchange for financial and political support.\"\nNRCC spokeswoman Katie Martin said the question about legislative agendas \"is for informational purposes only to know what members are interested in or going to be advocating for.\"\n___\nAssociated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report.\n___\nOnline:\nWikipedia study: http://tinyurl.com/opp86st\nFollow Stephen Ohlemacher on Twitter: http://twitter.com/stephenatap\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
