The reduced figure was due in part to double-counting of vehicles in previous estimates, the NHTSA official said.\nThe NHTSA recalled Takata air bags after some of them exploded with too much force, sending deadly shrapnel into the vehicle.\nThe NHTSA also said it has not yet been able to determine the root cause for the defective Takata air bag inflators.\n(Reporting by Bernie Woodall in Detroit; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T23:08:33.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
