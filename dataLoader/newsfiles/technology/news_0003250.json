Starting today, through its partnership with Utah Youth Soccer Association (UYSA), UYSA’s youth soccer clubs, teams and individual athletes can launch and run their own fundraising campaigns at affinitysports.flipgive.com. Part of an umbrella of new service enhancements called Affinity Advantage, the program will make it easier for soccer teams across the state of Utah to raise money to cover the rising costs associated with sports gear, equipment, tournaments, travel and training. Athletes and their friends and family will be able to support a fundraising campaign by shopping online with popular retailers like Under Armour®, Starbucks®, Nike and REI®. Depending on the retailer, up to 50 percent of the purchase will go to the athlete or team’s fundraising efforts.\n“Technology should make people’s lives easier,” said Mark Skeen, CEO, Affinity Sports. “We’ve enjoyed tremendous success helping partners like Utah Youth Soccer Association streamline many of the labor intensive administrative activities involved in running soccer, including implementing online registration for the state and youth soccer clubs.”\nThe results are impressive. Since moving to online registration, Utah Youth Soccer Association now collects 100 percent of their funds -- freeing up time and resources previously dedicated to collecting 40 percent of their receivables.\n“Tackling the burden of fundraising seemed like a natural next step,” added Skeen. “We partnered with FlipGive because they share our passion for leveraging technology to make fundraising fast and easy, so kids and their parents can focus on the thing they love most – playing the game.”\n“Young athletes and their parents are often shocked by the money required for travel, tournaments and skill development camps,” said Brian Smith, President, Utah Youth Soccer Association. “Our collective goal is to help our clubs, teams and individual athletes break down the financial barriers of competitive play by giving them the ability to run simple and effective online fundraising campaigns.”\nThrough Affinity Advantage, team data is seamlessly integrated with the FlipGive fundraising platform so soccer teams can activate their campaigns and provide live updates with little effort.\n“Affinity Sports’ Affinity Advantage program is a shining example of how technology is helping to save many youth sports programs, said Steve Croth, CEO and Co-Founder, FlipGive “We believe our simple and intuitive ‘shop to give’ fundraising platform is a perfect complement to Affinity’s vision, and will give athletes and teams an easier way to fund the sports they love, simply by having their families and friends shop online with popular retailers.”\nAbout Affinity Sports\nAffinity Sports is the largest and most successful integrated software service provider to state youth and adult soccer associations in the USA.
