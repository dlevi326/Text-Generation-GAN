Net Access hosts and manages the Virtual Environment in their next-generation, Parsippany III data center. \n\"What we bring to the table is an absolute rock-solid foundation for DJJ to build their software stack on top of our co-location and cloud-infrastructure products,\" explains Net Access CEO Raul Martynek, adding that DJJ customers don't have to think about the infrastructure and whether it performs. \"They can focus instead on what they can do with this new solution.\" \nMartynek expressed admiration for DJJ's bold move to be one of the first PBX player to fully embrace the cloud. \"It's fantastic to have a partner that's thinking so thoughtfully about the evolution of the marketplace. It speaks volumes to their thought leadership in the sector and that's why it's exciting to work with them. They are really helping to drive the thinking around how we evolve this product.\" \nDolan explains that DJJ's expanded voice portfolio delivers two benefits to customers: greater choice and simplicity. \n\"Our customers now have deployment choices based on their budgets and their needs. Our portfolio fits any connectivity requirements -- allowing our customers to make decisions about the business and their needs without concerns of performance, stability, reliability or feature sets based on where or how solutions are deployed.\" \nTo learn more about DJJ's Enhanced Voice Product Portfolio, register for a webinar to be held Oct. 8 at 2 p.m. EDT at: https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/2648930588782851074 . \nAbout DJJ Technologies \nSince 1992, DJJ Technologies has been a premier full service provider, specializing in best-of-breed solutions within the voice, video, data and support arena.
