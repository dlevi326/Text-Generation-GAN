That means their movements and numbers signal changes in the ocean's food supply, the newspaper reported.\nCenter spokesman Russ Curtis says more than 250 common murres have been brought into the center in the last month. Curtis says the center usually sees about 10 birds each month in late summer and early fall.\n———\nInformation from: The Sacramento Bee, http://www.sacbee.com \n  California Rescue Center Overwhelmed With Starving Seabirds   2 Students From New York and London Die in New Zealand Clerk  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T13:32:15.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
