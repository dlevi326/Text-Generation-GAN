Utilising innovative design, state-of-the-art products, and high-class fabrication, EHL makes even the most challenging project achievable.\nSpecialist automation, motion and control technology for naval and maritime applications For any process requiring automation or control, EHL Group is an expert in designing a solution that will suit its clients.\nThe EHL Group specialises in automation, motion and control technologies for marine applications on ships and yachts, as well as for a variety of other industries. The company creates products that are unique, durable, safe, and effective at meeting the needs of each crewmember.\nEHL’s gangway systems can be tailor-made to meet varying requirements in the naval, commercial, leisure boat, and cruiseship markets.\nIn addition to gangways and accommodation ladders, EHL has successfully designed, built and installed shell doors, and stabilisation devices used when moving items overboard.\nRetractable gangway solutions minimising docking time and required manpower EHL’s gangway for the HMNZS Canterbury navy ship is a full size non-telescopic cantilever solution that has significantly reduced the personnel needed to deploy a gangway, dramatically increasing safety.\nIt is capable of carrying multiple troops boarding and exiting the ship at the same time, with fullsize backpacks or gear bags.\nThe gangway retracts into a small space inside the ship so it is contained and out of the way, not taking up valuable space along the exterior.\nThis solution allows for docking in places other ships are unable to, and with the swift deployment of the gangway, the troops can be on the ground in 15 minutes, rather than having to await a crane to unhitch the ladder, as was the case previously.\nOffshore and onshore servicing and maintenance EHL employs highly skilled technicians for the service and repair of both onshore and offshore equipment and plants.\nWith an exceptional reputation in providing quality service at a fair price, EHL is renowned for getting the job completed on time and to a high standard.\nEHL forms close relationships with customers, contractors, suppliers and fabricators, achieving the best outcome for the total project.\nIndustrial and mobile hydraulic technologies Hydraulics is the technology of controlling pressurised fluids to create force and motion. Parker hydraulics, specified and installed by EHL, enable and improve industrial and mobile machinery performance.\nFor those planning a new motion control system, or to upgrade existing ones, EHL is a reliable source of hydraulics expertise.\nRegulator-approved gangways and maritime equipment EHL’s marine gangways are built to meet rigorous international standards, including Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), Lloyds, and AS / NZS, and to withstand the harsh conditions they are exposed to.\nEvery customer can also seek ongoing support from EHL through the service and maintenance of their gangway, and other equipment.\nEnergy Hydraulics Ltd\n19 Corbett Road\nBell Blck\nNew Plymouth\nTaranaki\nNew Zealand\nContact: Abby Jones – Business Services Manager\nTel: +64 21 550 631\nEmail: office@ehltd.co.nz\nURL: www.ehltd.co.nz\n ", "external_links": ["http://Asia.us2.list-manage1.com/subscribe/post?u=8b0255d591085d1f5c2356475&id=6d9617d27d"], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T07:02:07.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
