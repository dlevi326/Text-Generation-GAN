( News - Alert ) (NASDAQ:HMSY), today announced that its Dependent Eligibility Verification Audits have received an exclusive endorsement from the American Hospital Association (AHA) for the second time. \nAHA Solutions, Inc., a subsidiary of the AHA, awards endorsements to products and services that help member hospitals and healthcare organizations achieve operational excellence. \nOn average, 4% to 8% of dependents on an employer's health insurance plan - and an even larger percentage for hospital employers - are ineligible for coverage. This represents a significant unnecessary health care expense for self-insured employers - and potential savings if prevented. Dependent Eligibility Verification Audits from HMS help hospitals ensure that only eligible individuals are enrolled in the hospital's health plan. \n\"As hospitals transition to value-based care, it is imperative that they balance the ability to attract and retain the best talent, while ensuring their money is being spent appropriately,\" said Anthony Burke, senior vice president of the AHA, and president and CEO of AHA Solutions, Inc. \"We again endorsed Dependent Eligibility Verification Audits from HMS because of its vast experience inthe healthcare market, its employee-sensitive approach and its results. The HMS system allows employer hospitals to ensure benefits are being spent only on qualified dependents.\" \n\" HMS is proud to have this endorsement,\" said Doug Williams, President of Markets for HMS . \"It speaks to our track record of success with employers across many industries, including hospitals.
