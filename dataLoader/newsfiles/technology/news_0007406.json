Fine-grained access control on HDFS, the storage layer used by all Hadoop components, is a milestone achievement. For the first time, enterprises get a catch-all security blanket for Hadoop that not only blocks users from bypassing security controls to access data directly in HDFS, but also eliminates the risks that come with security policies being siloed in specific applications. \n“In today’s world, companies need new weapons to fight the massive data breaches that have become all too commonplace. By empowering companies to let their users access the data they need to do their jobs, and not a byte more, BlueTalon’s data-centric security enables Hadoop to be fully embraced for sensitive data storage in the enterprise,” said Eric Tilenius, CEO of BlueTalon. “Data filtering and dynamic masking are a game-changing next step on our strategic roadmap to ensure that enterprises can deploy security policies that meet their most stringent business needs to protect their sensitive data.” \nBy introducing fine-grained control on HDFS, in addition to the data-centric granular security already provided on Hive, Impala and relational databases, BlueTalon is delivering on its commitment to empower enterprises to take full advantage of Hadoop by itself and as part of their larger enterprise data infrastructure. As the only provider of consistent data-centric controls and auditing across a wide range of data repositories, BlueTalon is being used by leading Fortune 500 companies both on-premises and in the cloud – including Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. \n“To avoid costly breaches, organizations must enforce precise data authorization,” said Nik Rouda, senior analyst, ESG Global. “With access controls directly at the HDFS level, BlueTalon delivers a much needed security solution for enterprise Hadoop deployments and beyond.” \nBig data has transformed the way companies store, access and process data for business insight. \nTo solve the industry-wide challenge of having silos of security policies, the BlueTalon Policy Engine was developed to enable consistent, precise and dynamic user access policies across the enterprise regardless of repositories and applications in use. By bringing its Policy Engine to the core of Hadoop, BlueTalon has overcome a major challenge in making big data technology enterprise-ready. \nIn response to customers’ demand for data-centric security, last month Cloudera certified the BlueTalon Policy Engine to integrate with its Apache Hadoop distribution. \nBlueTalon will demo the BlueTalon Policy Engine and its revolutionary ability to enforce fine-grained access control at the HDFS level at Strata + Hadoop World (Innovator Pavilion, Booth #P15) in New York on September 29-October 1, 2015.
