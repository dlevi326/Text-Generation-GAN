Registered in the home-town country of Costa Rica, the name “Oveedia” has become official property of Pure Hospitality Solutions, just in time for a global beta test of the OTA platform.\nThe International Classification of Goods and Services (NICE), was created in 1957, by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The NICE treaty was enacted to protect a trademark’s registration and security, in the majority of countries throughout the world. In today’s times, over a half-century later, there are 84 signatory nations that adhere to the NICE agreement, in addition to 65 non-member countries.\nPure Hospitality Solutions trademarks Oveedia, after pre-beta launch chatter has increased significantly. Following the exclusive listings by the Tango Mar , Guarumo , Samasati and the Playa Escondida Lodge , Pure has continued to receive significant interest from many properties and hoteliers, wishing to list on the platform. Management has indicated that due to the anticipated success of the beta launch, “the Company has taken additional measures to protect the Oveedia brand.”\nUnder the terms of Pure Hospitality Solution’s trademark, Oveedia, the word will be recognized and protected for a term of 10-years, with 10-year renewal options thereafter. Management also indicated that “Oveedia has been officially transferred to Rackspace and last minute wrinkles are being ironed out.” The Company is thankful to its long-term shareholders and supporters, “we would not be here today without all of you. We are thrilled to soon deliver the platform that everyone has been waiting for.”\nThere’s one thing for sure… There will be a major disruption within the tourism industry, among all of Central America and the Caribbean.\nAbout Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc.\nPURE provides proprietary technology, marketing solutions and branding services to hotel operators and condominium owners.
