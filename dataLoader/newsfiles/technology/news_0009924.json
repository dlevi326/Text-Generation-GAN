The training, Finding the Right Prescription for Life Science Data Governance, will be available in October from Morf Media Inc. on its innovative training delivery platform for the mobile workforce. The experts from Morf Media and Performance Works share their expertise on how managers at life sciences companies can protect and manage sensitive data to meet compliance regulations. They cover effective ways to significantly decrease the risk of data exposure, including that of highly-regulated Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) data. The training includes the following:\nIncreasing risk to PII, PHI, and IP data in an age of breaches and growing data dispersion Changing regulatory landscape that adds greater complexity to corporate workflow Best practices to monitor and respond to compliance and legal requirements for dispersed sensitive data, including mobile technologies and cloud services Proactive approach to compliance to help your business avoid data risks and better address compliance and legal requirements\n“Any data breach is costly and disruptive, but for pharmaceutical businesses, medical device companies, and others in the life sciences field, the need to protect and manage sensitive data (PHI, PII, and IP) make these challenges even more complex,” stated Bazigos. “The real world costs of compromised data can be staggering, not just in fines, but in employment and business reputation loss as well. Patient and consumer safety is at stake. But training can make all the difference and the training delivery platform from Morf Media offers the most effective training prescription for life sciences data governance today. ”\nAbout Performance Works\nPerformance Works helps CMOs and CEOs make better decisions by bringing them the voice of their customers and guiding them on how to apply what we hear.
