It wasn’t easy for him to make that decision either.\n“He’s given it a long period of thought and came to that decision.\n“Our main focus is to try and keep him . . . but he seems pretty set on it at the moment but we’ll see how we go.\n“I don’t think there’s anything I can do, to be honest, to change his mind.\n“His issues are with other things within the footy club.”\nRockliff said rumours of a player exodus from the Gabba was a worry.\n“That’s probably the concern at the moment, yeah,’’ he said.\n“ I think when one (player) goes you are always worried. There’s speculation about a lot of players.\n“We don’t know until they come and tell us.\n“I think most of the group is pretty happy and can see the future and where we are heading.
