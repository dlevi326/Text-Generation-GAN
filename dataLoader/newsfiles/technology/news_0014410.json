The iOS version is available in the app store now. Viper is making a beta version available for Android users here , and the full version of the Android app will be available within two weeks. \nViper SmartStart 4.0 works with virtually any after-market car, allowing drivers to talk to or tap on their smartwatch to find, lock, unlock, and remotely start their vehicle, as well as manage alerts. Drivers can follow turn-by-turn directions back to their car, pop their trunk, hit the panic button, and receive low battery alerts all from their wrist. \n“Have your watch guide you to your car. Tap your wrist to unlock your doors. Say the word and your engine starts. Wearable technology has the potential to connect drivers to their cars like never before,” said Frank DeMartin, Senior Vice President of Product Development and Engineering for Viper. “Viper SmartStart 4.0 capitalizes on that potential and offers drivers unprecedented control of their vehicle, whether they’re using a smartwatch or smartphone.” \nIn addition to its smartwatch functionality, the Viper SmartStart 4.0 app for iOS and Android, announced earlier this year, offers a number of features for smartphones. Its improved, easier-to-use speed alert can show when young drivers are speeding, and users can set a SmartFence to designate certain areas as restricted—they receive an alert when the car enters or exits that perimeter. When maintenance is needed, the app notes diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) and explains the issue. Drivers can call upon roadside assistance in an emergency with a tap of their finger. \nThe new app is compatible with all existing Viper SmartStart hardware, providing current and future users with an intuitive user interface and quick access to key features. Viper SmartStart 4.0 now uses CDMA/3G wireless connectivity for nationwide coverage and to reduce power consumption in the vehicle by up to 30%. \nDuring last week’s Super Mobility 2015 event, CTIA – The Wireless Association named Viper SmartStart 4.0 a Hot for the Holidays winner in the ‘connected car’ category. \nVisit www.viper.com/SmartStart/New for more information. \nAbout Directed \nDirected, recipient of hundreds of technology patents and awards, is a world leader in automotive electronics.
