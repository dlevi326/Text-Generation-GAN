We are enabling world-class applications so they can put their software on top and integrate with the sensors. Stable hardware platform; that's our business,\" said Aase.\nCentral to the RECAB business plan is building computers and systems that literally are on the move, whether on the ground, in the air or at sea. Its four major markets served include maritime and offshore, avionics, defense and communications.\nIn particular the company specialized in building Advanced Modular Computers, scalable system with mega processing power for use in scientific, engineering or subsea arenas. According to Aase, about 30 to 35 percent of its business comes from the combined maritime niche, with the subsea industry and its thirst for advance computing solutions a ripe market for penetration.\nAt Norshipping in Oslo earlier this year RECAB sealed the deal via a contract with AKVA group ASA for delivery of embedded computer systems for its solutions to the global fish farming industry. \"We have developed pilot series with great success, and this agreement formalizes a long-­term relationship with AKVA group which is a world leader in its market,\" said Michael Ullskog, CEO of RECAB Embedded Computers AB.\nThe broad product portfolio of products from RECAB includes Embedded Servers, Vehicle-­PCs, Medical-­PCs, Ruggedized COTS, MicroTCA, ATCA, ATR-­systems, CompactPCI, VME, communications servers, rackmount systems and solutions designed and built to customer's specifications. The products are often designed and tested to meet harsh environmental conditions including, dust, humidity, extended temperature, shock, vibration and EMC-requirements.\nRECAB MPU (Maritime Processing Unit)\nThe RECAB MPU (Maritime Processing Unit) is designed to be versatile; easy to change or add hardware functionality such as AIS or other GPS system modules. This flexibility enables deployment in several other application areas.\nCompact and scalable fanless high performance Maritime Processing Unit using Intel Ivy Bridge Core i3. Flexible design enables a range of optional modules and functionality to be added. Examples include DGPS, AIS receiver, UHF radio with Diplexer through a Single Antenna connector. Optional Power over Ethernet 802.3af interface, and standard PC I/O interfaces. Recessed IP-65 shielded compartment for USB dongle and/or service port. Designed and tested for Maritime applications,including oil and gas sector. Wide operating temperature range: -10 to +60° C ambient temperature. Completely sealed unit, water resistant using rugged IP-65 connectors. Wide range DC input (9-30 VDC). Power supply designed for harsh maritime environments with unstable power sources. Modular backpack-solution with optional touchscreen.\n(As published in the August 2015 edition of Maritime Reporter & Engineering News - http://magazines.marinelink.com/Magazines/MaritimeReporter )", "external_links": ["http://magazines.marinelink.com/Magazines/MaritimeReporter"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:05:40.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
