We will cooperate fully with the responsible agencies, with transparency and urgency, to clearly, openly, and completely establish all of the facts of this case. Volkswagen has ordered an external investigation of this matter.\"\nOn Friday, the EPA and California charged Volkswagen with willfully installing software in its 4-cylinder diesel cars that would allow cars to bypass emission standards. The cars cited for violations include signature Volkswagen cars manufactured between 2009 and 2015, including the Jetta, Passat, Beetle and Golf, as well as the A3 from Audi, Volkswagen's luxury line.\nAll together, about 482,000 diesel passenger cars sold in the United States since 2008 are included in the allegations.\nThe statement promises that Volkswagen will \"re-establish trust\" it may have lost and that the company will reverse any damage done.\n\"We do not and will not tolerate violations of any kind of our internal rules or of the law,\" Winterkorn added.\nThe EPA issued a notice of violation to Volkswagen, while the state of California sent an In-Use Compliance letter. Both the EPA and the California Air Resources Board are conducting separate investigations into the alleged misbehavior.\nRecalls are likely, and the combined fines could add up to $18 billion if the result of the investigations support the allegations.\nThe EPA alleges that the Volkswagen cars are fitted with software to trick emission testers, but that under normal operation emit nitrogen oxides at up to 40 times the standard. Under the Clean Air Act, such an instrument is classified as a \"defeat device.\"\n\"Using a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal and a threat to public health,\" said Cynthia Giles, EPA assistant administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. \"Working closely with the California Air Resources Board, EPA is committed to making sure that all automakers play by the same rules. EPA will continue to investigate these very serious matters.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T02:22:46.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
