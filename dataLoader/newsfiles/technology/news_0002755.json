The LaserTower™ BulletMaster™ is designed to provide traditional munitions marking information with the ability to incorporate unique ID codes allowing traceability to the individual ammunition purchase. By tracing the associated sales record, law enforcement personnel are able to trace the ammunition involved in a crime, thereby creating an additional avenue that traditionally has not existed.\nbAccording to the United States Department of Justice, there is a greater than 30% chance of never identifying a suspect in homicides involving firearms unless ballistic evidence can be quickly linked to the shooter. The LaserTower™ BulletMaster™ system provides ammunition manufacturers the ability to add unique ID codes on their shell casings, providing law enforcement with modern crime fighting tools.\nMost major ammunition manufacturers already use bar coding for inventory control and management. Ammunition manufacturers would include the ID code in their current bar coding system. Ammunition retailers will scan the bar code on each box of bullets along with the purchaser’s driver’s license, linking each shell casing to the individual purchasing the rounds.\nClick here for more information regarding the BULLETMASTER™\nAbout Fonon Corporation\nFonon Corporation is the recognized leader of industrial-grade 3D Additive and Subtractive laser-based material processing systems.
