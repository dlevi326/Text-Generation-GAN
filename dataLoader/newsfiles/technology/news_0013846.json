The biggest names in 3D printing — including industry champions Stratasys, EOS, EnvisionTEC, Renishaw, Materialise, SLM Solutions, Autodesk, Arcam, citim GmbH, Declam, ExOne, Höganäs, Proto Labs, Mcor, Makerbot, Roland DG, 3D Systems, DSM Somos, and Ultimaker — will all be present at TCT Show, bringing together the largest number of additive manufacturing technology manufacturers in one place. This year, TCT also boasts over 60 brand new exhibitors that have never before shown their products to a TCT audience.

For the maker community, TCT welcomes back the RepRap Hub, a renowned hotbed for sharing ideas and making connections. \nIn the main conference arena, keynotes will kick off morning and afternoon sessions on both days of the show including: Al Siblani, CEO, EnvisionTec; J. Scott Schiller, Worldwide Director of 3D Printing, HP; Andy Middleton, President EMEA, Stratasys; Max Lobovsky, Founder & CEO, Formlabs; Dr Conor MacCormack, Co-founder and CEO, Mcor Technologies; and finally, Todd Grimm, President, T.A. Grimm & Associates. \nThe rest of the sessions will cover the myriad applications of 3D technologies across a diverse range of industries. Day one features sessions focusing on Design, Prototyping and Manufacturing looking at the processes themselves; Day two will then cover applications of the technologies in the Transport, Healthcare, and Jewellery & Heritage sectors. For the full list of confirmed speakers, click here . \nThe Technology Stage will feature a host of interesting and informative seminar sessions carefully crafted to educate both new and experienced users of 3D technologies. The ever-popular Introduction to Additive Technologies session will return to the show as well as industry-focused sessions on software, inspection, digitising and metrology. A new session for 2015 called Introducing the UL AM Training Curriculum will look at training standards in the 3D printing sector. \nFinally, making a welcome return to TCT Show will be TCT Inspired Minds in association with Black Country Atelier and 3D Systems, giving schoolchildren the chance to get hands-on 3D printing experience. \nHead of Content at TCT, James Woodcock, said: \n“The 20 th anniversary edition of TCT Show + Personalize was always going to be special and the whole team is exceptionally proud of the event we’ve put together for 2015. The TCT show floor has become the benchmark against which other shows are measured, and the conference stage attracts the biggest names in the industry year-on-year. To have all of this available free for visitors is an unparalleled achievement. We’ve seen an incredible evolution of 3D technologies in the last few years but TCT Show remains the very best place to see everything together under one roof.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:06:15.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
