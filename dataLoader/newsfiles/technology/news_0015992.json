This allows organizations to implement an automated end-to-end production workflow and fully leverage the capabilities of their inkjet presses quickly, efficiently and cost effectively.\n“The move to production inkjet printing is a very high priority for many transactional printing shops and the capabilities offered by ‘PRO Inkjet Express’ are critical to the success of most implementations,” said Ernie Crawford, CEO of Crawford Technologies. “For years, we have been working with inkjet press manufacturers to supply their customers with solutions that will prepare them before their presses are on the floor, greatly reducing the time it takes to see a return on their investment.”\nThe printing industry is seeing the deployment of inkjet presses grow at nearly 30% annually. Industry consultants state that one of the biggest challenges facing inkjet adopters is migrating their existing applications to the inkjet presses. Since the investment in production inkjet technology is costly, the need to generate a fast return on the investment (ROI) is paramount to an organization’s success. ‘PRO Inkjet Express’ fills this need with a powerful and flexible solution to prepare organizations for success with inkjet presses.\nWith PRO Inkjet Express, users will be able to:\nAutomate file processing to ensure presses run at full speed Selectively add inline color, create inserter files, modify impositions and more to existing jobs Combine small jobs or segment large jobs, improving throughput, and ensuring that production and post-production processes are optimized Work with an easy-to-use, graphical user interface and be up and running quickly Use the powerful dashboard to manage their production workload\n“At the last Inkjet Summit, one of our customers was speaking on a panel and shared that he is able to regularly get new inkjet presses fully in productive use within about two weeks,” said Crawford.\n“He also noted that this is in stark contrast to other shops who often take months, or even years, to get their workloads moved over.”\nAttendees at Graph Expo 2015 will have the opportunity to see live demonstrations of PRO Inkjet Express and it’s capabilities at Crawford Technologies booth 344. Graph Expo 2015 takes place at Chicago’s McCormick Place from September 13-16, 2015.\nTo learn more information about the capabilities of PRO Inkjet Express, please click here .\nFor more information about Graph Expo, please click here .\nAbout Graph Expo 2015\nGraph Expo 15 is recognized as the most innovative and comprehensive annual exhibition of inkjet, digital, offset, flexo, gravure, and hybrid technologies, products and services for the commercial, package printing and converting, display, in-plant, transactional, publishing, mailing, photo imaging, marketing, and industrial printing industries.
