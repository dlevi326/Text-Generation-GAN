(NASDAQ: JKHY) is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for the financial services industry. Its Symitar ® division announced today that CFE Federal Credit Union is live with Episys ® for in-house core processing. \nAccording to Kevin Wright , SVP of information technology at CFE Federal Credit Union, \"Partnering with Symitar ultimately means that our institution is not limited by technology. The openness of the Episys system offers the flexibility for us to pursue any avenue that delivers a competitive advantage and supports our long-term growth goals. It was important for us to select a core provider that could drive this strategic movement, so that we can provide both our staff and our members with superior functionality and automation. Through this partnership, we have been able to change the way we operate IT, eliminating nearly 90 man hours each month in processing time; giving those hours back to our staff has been greatly appreciated.\" \nEpisys' open architecture integrates with hundreds of vendor applications and offers credit unions the option to independently add on additional offerings with ease, encouraging rapid adoption of new technologies. \nIn addition to partnering with Symitar for Episys, CFE Federal Credit Union will also implement several complementary solutions for further cohesiveness and functionality: ImageCenter ™ for Check 21 processing; RemitPlus ® Remittance/Lockbox ™ ; Synergy Document Management ™ ; Synapsys ® for customer relationship management; and Advanced Reporting for Credit Unions ™ (ARCU) for ata warehousing and reporting. Wright continued, \"Added reporting capabilities has removed a data bottleneck and allowed a larger set of information from which to pull – enabling us to provide a faster reaction. We couldn't be more pleased with the interaction between these solutions. Synapsys alone is bringing in more business with home banking and account opening; we're experiencing $1 million a month in referrals already.\" \nTed Bilke , president of Symitar, said, \"A core conversion has the potential to impact nearly every function within a credit union. Converting to Episys has given CFE Federal Credit Union a strong technology platform that directly supports its business needs and growth strategy.
