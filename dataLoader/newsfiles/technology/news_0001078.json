Each year, over 3,000 publicly traded companies are invited to participate in this corporate sustainability assessment and Liberty Global’s inclusion is evidence of the company’s continued progress in delivering its Corporate Responsibility strategy. \nHighlights from Liberty Global’s Corporate Responsibility program in 2014 included: Empowering young people to acquire and grow their digital skills through programs such as CoderDojo and YouRock. Liberty Global became a partner of both programs, which are part of its ‘promoting a digital society’ strategy and demonstrates its commitment to the European Commission's Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs; Engaging with thousands of entrepreneurs across a number of markets in online competitions and initiatives to support innovation in digital society. Projects included Pitch to Rich in the U.K., Telenet’s Kickstart accelerator in Belgium, and Think Big in Poland; Continuing to make advances in conserving energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions relative to the company’s key measure - the amount of data traffic consumed by our customers. In 2014, the company improved its energy efficiency by 34% and its carbon efficiency by 31%; Refurbishing 4.4 million set-top boxes and modems, avoiding approximately 7,200 metric tons of waste that would otherwise have ended up in landfill sites. This also resulted in a financial saving of $320 million; Continuing Liberty Global’s partnership with global supply chain assessment specialist EcoVadis to implement a robust approach for assessing social and environmental performance of Liberty Global’s suppliers. \nRick Westerman, who oversees Liberty Global's Corporate Responsibility program, said: “We are committed to maximizing the positive social impact of our products and services and to conducting our operations both responsibly and sustainably. Our inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for the last four years reflects that commitment, and we look forward to building on our success in this area.” \nAlongside its inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices this year, Liberty Global continues to be a member of the FTSE4Good Index and earlier this year became a constituent of the MSCI Global Sustainability Indexes.
