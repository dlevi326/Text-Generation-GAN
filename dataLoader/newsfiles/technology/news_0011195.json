It vanishes from Malaysian civilian radar at 1:30 am, just before passing to Vietnamese air traffic control. It appears on military radar until 2:15 am, but Malaysia's air force takes no action. Vietnam launches a search operation that expands into a multinational hunt in the South China Sea. \nMalaysian police later say background checks of all on board produced no red flags. \n- March 14: The hunt spreads far south to the Indian Ocean after the White House cites \"new information\" that the jet may have flown on after losing contact. \n- March 15: Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announces that the plane appeared to have flown for hours, veering sharply off-route at roughly the same time that its communications system and transponder were manually switched off. \n- March 24: Malaysia's Razak announces \"with deep sadness and regret\" that MH370 is presumed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean, citing new analysis of the satellite data. The next day in Beijing, emotional Chinese relatives of passengers scuffle with guards outside the Malaysian embassy, demanding answers. \n- April 14: Australia deploys an American deep-sea drone to scan the seabed for debris near sites where suspected black box pings had been heard. It ultimately finds nothing. \n- April 28: Australia announces the search area will be expanded across a huge swathe of ocean. The focus shifts for several months to mapping the uncharted seafloor before searching can resume. \n- May 27: After weeks of pressure from families, Malaysia releases raw satellite data used to determine the search zone. Relatives say crucial data was omitted. \n- January 29, 2015: Malaysia's government declares MH370's passengers and crew \"presumed dead\", angering next of kin who demand proof. \n- April 16: Malaysia, Australia, and China say the oceanic search area for flight MH370 will double in size to 120,000 square kilometres (46,300 square miles). \n- July 29: A piece of aircraft debris is found by a beachcomber on the French island of La Reunion in the Indian Ocean. The wreckage, determined to be a wing part from a Boeing 777, is sent to France for analysis. \n- August 6: Malaysia's PM Razak announces that a team of experts has \"conclusively confirmed\" the wreckage is from MH370. \n- August 8: France launches new searches by air, land and sea from Reunion island to hunt for more possible MH370 wreckage, but calls off the search on August 17, saying it has yielded no results. \n- September 3: French prosecutors confirm that the wing part found on Reunion was from MH370. \nFrench prosecutors confirmed Thursday that a wing part found on a remote Indian Ocean island was from ill-fated Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, a month after tests on the flaperon began. \n\"It is possible today to say with certainty that the flaperon discovered on Reunion island on July 29 came from flight MH370,\" Paris prosecutors said in a statement, confirming claims made by Malaysia's prime minister last month. \nThe Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8 last year, inexplicably veering off course en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. \nThe disappearance turned into one of the biggest mysteries in the history of aviation, sparking a colossal hunt in the Indian Ocean based on satellite data which hinted at MH370's possible path. \nIn late July a man on Reunion island, a French overseas territory, found the two-metre-long (almost seven-foot) flaperon wing part washed up on a beach. It was then flown to France for tests by aviation experts. \nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was quick to announce, in early August, that the piece of debris belonged to MH370, but French investigators were initially more cautious, saying only there was a \"very high probability\" it came from the plane. \nIn the statement Thursday, prosecutors said investigators discovered three numbers on the wing part, and later concluded that one of the figures corresponded to the serial number of a flaperon from the MH370. \nThe discovery of the flaperon, while confirming that the plane crashed into the ocean, has not shed any more light on the location of the crash. \nIt has also not brought investigators any closer to the crucial black box that could indicate what caused the mysterious disappearance that has baffled aviation experts and given rise to myriad conspiracy theories. \n- Speculation over plane's fate - \nSpeculation on the cause of the plane's disappearance has focused primarily on a possible mechanical or structural failure, a hijacking or terror plot, or rogue pilot action. \nInvestigators believe the aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. \nMalaysia's deputy transport minister Abdul Aziz Kaprawi said in August that investigators from his country would meet with those from China and Australia this month to \"refine\" the search for the MH370 after the discovery of the flaperon. \n\"Definitely, the search will continue in the same area,\" he said then. \nThe wing part also led to a wave of excitement over pieces of debris found elsewhere on the island as well as in the Maldives. \nHowever, a 10-day air and sea search by France around Reunion for more debris turned up no new clues, and the Maldives items were found to have no links to any aircraft. \nAustralia has been leading the search for the plane, the largest multinational search operation in history. \nMore than 60,000 square kilometres (23,000 square miles) of the seafloor have been searched so far, with no trace of the missing Boeing 777 found until last month's discovery. \nIn April it was announced that the search area could be expanded up to 120,000 square kilometres if needed. \nmbx-fb/gj/pvh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:43:54.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
