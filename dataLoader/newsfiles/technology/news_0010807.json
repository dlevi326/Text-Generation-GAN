The game will feature additional content specific to the Oculus and make use of the unique gesture recognition technology of the Oculus Touch controllers.\nPhaser Lock CTO John Nagle said, \"We feel the Touch controllers set a new high water mark in controller design and functionality that will give players an even stronger sense of immersion in virtual environments.\" Chief Creative Officer Michael Daubert added, \"We're proud of our partnership with the Oculus team and honored to be a part of gaming history.

The player's missions will include firefighting, search and rescue operations, shooting down armed drones and so much more. Final Approach is played from 2 vantage points, a \"god mode\" in which the player controls the entire world and its inhabitants from an aerial perspective, and a \"toy mode\" where the player becomes toy-sized and can interact with the life-sized environment.\nAbout Phaser Lock Interactive:\nPhaser Lock Interactive LLC is an Austin-based VR-focused game company composed of industry veterans whose gaming pedigree stretches back to the days of the Playstation I and Super Nintendo systems.\nAbout Oculus:\nOculus is focused on enabling players to experience anything, anywhere through virtual reality.
