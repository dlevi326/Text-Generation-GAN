Chief HR officers and HR IT leaders developing workforce strategies use this research to help them identify key and best-fit vendors….Talent Management suites support a variety of capabilities and are typically composed of four or more of the following applications: workforce planning, recruiting and onboarding, performance and goal management, learning management, career and succession planning, and compensation management.”\nThe report also states that “In 2014, the overall market for TM suite solutions (license and subscription software only) reached an estimated $3.4 billion and continues to grow at more than 17% annually… Already strong in the midmarket, this trend of ‘core HR plus talent’ on a unified platform is also starting to appear in large complex global enterprises….They are increasingly reconsidering the Talent Management software landscape as part of this decision process — to reap the benefits of vendor consolidation, integrated user experience, integrated data for reporting and business intelligence, and more.”\nThis is in alignment with Technomedia’s recent announcement earlier this month of their new Core HR Hub module , which is the latest in their talent management platform and expands on its already robust talent profile management functionality. Technomedia believes that inclusion in the Magic Quadrant reaffirms that their product roadmap is focused on the right areas and has been recognized for its strong recruiting, learning and performance management capabilities.\n“We believe that our recognition this year from Gartner is aligned with our customers’ needs and that of the industry at large,” said Alain Latry, President and CEO of Technomedia. “We are extremely happy to be showcased for a second time and believe that our high customer satisfaction rankings further validate Technomedia’s commitment to our clients and their growing people management needs to recruit, engage, grow and retain their top talent.”\nTechnomedia also launched its second 2015 Feature Pack in August adding a new Core HR Hub module as well as over 75 product enhancements and innovations across their entire Talent Management suite. In addition to the new module and features for each of the existing platform pillars, the August release focuses on improved User Experience, Mobile Capabilities and Community features designed to recognize, reward and deepen the social collaboration between employees.\n[1] Gartner \"Magic Quadrant for Talent Management Suites\" by Yvette Cameron, Jeff Freyermuth, Ron Hanscome, Helen Poitevin, 10 August 2015\nDisclaimer:\nGartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or designations.
