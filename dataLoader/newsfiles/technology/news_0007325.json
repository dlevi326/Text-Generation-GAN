SAXX will be using Tagga’s Marketing Intelligence Platform to consolidate fragmented customer profile data, which will allow the industry-leading underwear company to deliver a more personalized customer experience. A company with innovation at its core, SAXX was quick to implement a number of cutting-edge technologies to assist in the delivery of an optimized customer experience. Those technologies provided SAXX with a large amount of raw customer data, and the company will now be working with Tagga, whose platform was built to consolidate fragmented customer profiles, to surface new insights and behaviours that will allow for an deeper level of customer engagement.\nJean-Guy Faubert, CEO of Tagga, has seen the fragmented data problem grow to become one of the the biggest challenges facing the modern-day marketer: “Almost every brand operating in the B2C space is battling the fragmented data issue right now. As marketers, we can collect a mind-boggling amount of customer data but unless it can be consolidated and correlated, it bears no real value.”\n“We are delighted to be working with a brand as forward-thinking and innovative as SAXX, and we’re thrilled that we can be a part of their continued success.”\nChrista DePoe, Senior Vice President Technology & Digital at SAXX, is confident that the Tagga Marketing Platform will allow SAXX to deliver a much enhanced customer experience: “We are fortunate to have an incredibly loyal following, and we want to ensure that we continue to converse with our customers on their terms, not ours; we want to let them dictate the conversation. By consolidating all of our customer profile data, Tagga’s Marketing Platform will surface some otherwise-unavailable insights and trends that will allow us to drive deeper engagement and deliver hyper-personalized content that really resonates.”\nAbout Tagga: Tagga (@tagga) is a developer of a B2C marketing platform that consolidates fragmented customer profile data to deliver a unified customer view, which allows marketers to gain valuable insights into customer behaviour, drive deeper engagement, accurately predict campaign outcomes, and maximize ROI. Tagga has been working exclusively with consumer marketers since 2008 and is trusted by some of the world’s most respected brands, including adidas, Red Bull, Gordmans and Paramount.\nAbout SAXX Underwear: A subsidiary of No Limits Sportswear Inc. and based in Vancouver, Canada, SAXX manufactures innovative, life changing underwear.
