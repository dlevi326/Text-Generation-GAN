In the past decade, the university has steadily moved from more traditional forms of education to hybrid, online, and adaptive learning environments. Now, ASU joins a growing list of universities using Dropbox for Education to make it easier to get work done by storing and managing staff files and faculty research documents in a secure, centralized way. \n“With Dropbox, our reach becomes as immediate and broad as the Internet,” says ASU Chief Information Officer Gordon Wishon. “An ASU curriculum specialist working in Singapore can develop and upload a shared graduate curriculum and connect with an educator teaching in Paris, an administrator in China, and IT support in Tempe.” \nASU chose Dropbox to help people collaborate and work remotely across all departments because of its ease of use, integrations with popular systems, and advanced collaboration features. The service works with the university’s identity and access systems, which means faculty and staff don’t need to create new credentials to use Dropbox. And its integrations with industry-leading providers including CloudLock and Splunk allow ASU to continue using its existing security solutions. \nEducation-centric features like file requests, and capabilities like unlimited version history and deletion recovery also factored into the decision. Dropbox’s simple platform will replace thumb drives and slow servers, allowing faculty and staff to communicate and exchange information wherever they are. Making it easy for staff to more effectively share information and collaborate on any device will expand the university’s scope and research quality, school officials say. \n“Leveraging the Dropbox for Education platform for ASU faculty and staff means boosting efficiency, speed, access, data sharing, and the quality of our academic, research, and administrative operations,” says Wishon. \nDropbox makes it easy for more than 400 million individuals and 8 million businesses around the world to securely access, share, and collaborate on files. In addition to ASU, Dropbox is used by universities and educational institutions worldwide including MIT, CSU-Fullerton, and the University of Oklahoma, as well as global brands like Hearst, Under Armour, News Corp and Spotify. \nDropbox has already been incorporated into select departments at ASU, with full deployment planned by the end of the calendar year. \nDropbox Head of Education \nTo continue advancing its work with tech-forward educational institutions, Dropbox announced that Jason Katcher has joined the company as its first Head of Education. \nJason comes to Dropbox after more than 10 years at Google. Most recently he served as the Americas Lead for Google for Education, which includes Google Apps for Education, Classroom, Devices and Content. Jason will use his expertise to continue to bring the best in secure and scalable collaboration tools to higher education and K-12 institutions around North America. \n“Faculty, staff, and students are looking to simplify the way they work together — on and off-campus. Our vision at Dropbox is to help these institutions move into the next phase of collaborative work, which is not only easier and more efficient, but produces better results in the end,” says Katcher. “I look forward to working more closely with our partners to help shape the future of education, as more pioneers like ASU turn to Dropbox to work the way they want.” \nAbout ASU \nArizona State University is a public flagship metropolitan research university located on five campuses across the Phoenix, Arizona Metropolitan Area, and the largest public university by enrollment in the United States.
