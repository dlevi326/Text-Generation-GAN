It is touch. \nIn real-time, thanks to super swift signals bouncing off a dedicated complex system of satellites working in synchronisation, the astronaut manoeuvered the robot into place. \nHe then very slowly lowered a metal pin held by the robot into a tight hole in a task board with less than a sixth of a millimetre of wriggle room. \nUsing a joystick \nFor the first time—thanks to force-feedback technology—when the pin was not aligned correctly Mogensen felt it hit the sides of the hole via the joystick he was operating on the space station . \nCheers erupted when after several long nail-biting minutes the rover—which slightly resembles Disney's WALL.E cartoon character—dropped the pin successfully into place. \nScientists and engineers believe applications of this kind of tactile technology are huge—allowing humans to guide robots in delicate tasks by feeling their way. \nThe technology will allow people \"to project a human-like presence into the robots, to do human-like tasks on the surface\" of a planet, Andre Schiele, head of ESA's Telerobotics and Haptics Laboratory, told AFP. \nWith space engineers hoping at some point to fly people to Mars, \"we have to bring them back\" which means before they first step foot on the planet \"you would have to build an entire launch-platform on the planet.\" \nRobots like the Centaur—also affectionately dubbed the \"blue bug\" by some of its designers—could be put in place first to do the building. \n\"There's going to be a need for a set-up, some building before a human even sets foot on the planet and for that we could send down robots and control them from a space station,\" said industrial designer Emiel den Exter. \nThe 18-month project was a collaboration between the European Space Agency (ESA)and students from Delft University of Technology. \n\"Even something like lacing your shoe is something you rely entirely on your tactile senses\" for, Schiele told journalists gathered at the ESA headquarters in the Dutch town of Noordwijk. \nEarthly uses \nOn Earth this cutting-edge technology known as haptics could also be used \"everywhere where you basically don't want to send humans,\" said Schiele. \n\"Feeling\" robots would have been useful to cap the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, or help seal the reactors at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant after the 2011 meltdown. \nProfessor Frans van der Helm, from Delft University's mechanical engineering unit, said one scheme was looking at using such robots to work in a massive nuclear fusion project in France. \nInside the costly, multipartner International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)—if it is built—\"the heat will be about one million degrees,\" Van der Helm told AFP. \n\"So everything starts to deform\" making it hard for robots to complete a task which they have been programmed for, he said. \nIn this case, telepresence technology would allow a human to feel their way through and fix a problem. \nFor 27-year-old Turkish student Doga Emirdag, who helped design the Centaur's exo-skeleton as part of his masters degree, Monday's demonstration was a big day. \n\"The robot as it is wouldn't go into space. But the technology being developed will go to space,\" he said with a broad smile.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:34:43.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
