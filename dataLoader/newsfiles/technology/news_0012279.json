We have been very pleased with MRPEasy. The process from watching the demo to implementing the system and inputting data has been both smooth and efficient. — Paula Staples, Owen Mumford APAC Director LONDON, UK, September 17, 2015 / EINPresswire.com / -- Software company MRPEasy, one of the first to offer production planning software as a service, unveils expansion to Asian markets, and has signed a supplier deal in Malaysia with Owen Mumford Sdn Bhd, a global leader in medical device design and manufacturing. “With the expansion we are tapping into the global manufacturing heartland,” said Konstantin Klugman, Chief Executive of MRPEasy. MRPEasy is an easy-to-use, cloud-based production planning (MRP) software for small and medium-sized manufacturers. The business model is subscription-based, dramatically reducing clients' up-front costs, which are often barrier for new companies. “I’ve experiences these problems myself as a small entrepreneur. The entry-barrier for legacy software is just way too high,” said Klugman. “Our business model allows us to expand fast in Asia and globally as small and midsize manufacturers seek to reduce their costs and work more effectively.” Owen Mumford, which has recently set up a new manufacturing operation in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, selected MRPEasy when it was looking for manufacturing planning software to support its startup. “We have been very pleased with MRPEasy. The process from watching the demo to implementing the system and inputting data has been both smooth and efficient,” said Paula Staples, the APAC Programme Director at Owen Mumford Ltd. \"The package has been very well designed to the point you can successfully start the project without any dependence on a project manager or several consultants.\" “The team at MRPEasy understands the requirements of the medical device/pharma industry and has been prompt and co-operative in providing responses for our supplier approval process.” To support the Asian expansion Tallinn, Estonia headquartered MRPEasy is hiring extra sales and support staff and is taking efforts in software localization. MRPEasy MRPEasy provides the main MRP (manufacturing resource planning) functionality of SAP, Epicor or Microsoft Dynamics AX for small and medium sized manufacturers.
