Until 2012, growth rates had been in double digits for years. \n\n\"We have reached a transition point in the growth of the internet,\" the report said. \n\nThe commission, set up in 2010 by the International Telecommunication Union and UNESCO, the UN scientific and cultural agency, said the milestone of four billion internet users was unlikely to be passed before 2020. \n\nIt said growth in Facebook subscribers was outpacing growth in the internet. \n\n\"Over half the world's population -- some 57%, or more than 4 billion people - still do not use the internet regularly or actively,\" the report said. \n\nIt blamed the cost of extending last-mile infrastructure to rural and remote customers, and a sharp slowdown in the growth of mobile cellular subscriptions globally. \n\nBy the end of this year, 3.2 billion people will have some form of regular access to the internet, up from 2.9 billion in 2014. That is 43.4% of the world's population, still far short of a UN target of 60% by 2020. \n\nWomen in poorer countries were particularly disadvantaged, the report said. In the developing world, 25% fewer women than men had internet access, a number that rises to 50% in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. \n\nOnly about 5% of the world's estimated 7,100 languages were represented on the internet, the report said. Many internet users could not understand Latin script, so even reading domain names was a challenge, it added.
