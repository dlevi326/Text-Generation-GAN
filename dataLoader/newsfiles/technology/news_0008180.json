The footage pans down the man's body to a gaping gash in the middle of his left leg. \n\"Love you, brah,\" a friend standing near him says. \"Love you too, brah,\" Rocha replies before the clip ends. \nA 13-foot-long tiger shark bit Rocha's leg Sunday afternoon as he spearfished off the northern tip of the Big Island, officials said. He swam to shore after the attack, and his fishing companion called 911, the state Department of Land and Natural Resources said in a press release. \nRocha was flown by helicopter to a hospital for surgery. His condition was not immediately known. \nState officials said they did not close beaches because the attack happened in a remote area off Upolu Point. It had rained heavily, and they warned people not to go into the ocean afterward because murky water can attract sharks. \n___ \nFollow Caleb Jones: https://twitter.com/CalebAP  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:30:57.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
