A study published by the Atlantic Council and the Zurich Insurance group earlier this month estimated that cyberattacks could cost up to $90 trillion by 2030 if cybersecurity fails to advance at a rapid pace.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2572021 That study identified the Internet of Things, or Internet-connected household appliances, as the most vulnerable of any modern technology, with a potentially positive impact on GDP of up to $6.2 trillion by 2030. However, that figure could be diminished if cyberattacks substantially degrade the technology.\nIn response to such vulnerabilities, Gartner suggested that endpoint detection and remediation tools are becoming increasingly commoditized.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2571998 Another study released by PricewaterhouseCoopers earlier this month suggested that companies and consumers are also preparing for the event their security software fails, projecting that global cybersecurity insurance premiums will increase from $2.5 billion to $7.5 billion over the next five years.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T07:03:23.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
