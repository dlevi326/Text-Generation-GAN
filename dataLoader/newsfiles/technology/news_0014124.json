AT&T Inc.  ><- stripped tags -> DALLAS   AT&T* saw significant growth in 2015 with its cloud connectivity solution, AT&T NetBond ® . We built a robust ecosystem of 13 leading cloud providers. Many enterprises now count on NetBond to help manage their suite of cloud services. \"Businesses are embracing the security and flexibility of cloud solutions,\" said Jon Summers , senior vice president, AT&T Mobile & Business Solutions. \"NetBond is a large part of our strategy to deliver highly-secure cloud connections to leading providers. We provide our customers access from anywhere, at any time and on any device.\" 82% of enterprises will have a multi cloud strategy according to RightScale's1 2015 State of the Cloud Survey. We saw this growth firsthand in 2015. We noted increased customer adoption from a range of segments such as financial services, insurance, government, energy, healthcare, manufacturing and retail. \"We move at a fast pace at Topgolf, offering nearly 8 million guests a year a unique interactive experience. It's essential to have our back-end systems running smoothly so we can provide the best experience possible,\" said Andrew Macaulay , chief information officer, Topgolf. \"AT&T NetBond is a key part of our progress toward virtualizing key assets and moving business applications to the cloud. It gives us a robust level of integration so we always have fast and reliable connectivity to the cloud.\" \"The adoption of Salesforce across our 40-plus locations created bandwidth problems at our branch-office locations,\" said Brian Rubarts , vice president IT, BenefitMall. \"NetBond allows us to precisely allocate bandwidth for Salesforce without having to scale up the firewall to accommodate it. The onboarding was effortless and the management platform is so powerful. We are confident that we can use AT&T NetBond for reliable and highly secure access to other third-party services in the future.\" In the last year, we have launched 9 new leading cloud services: Salesforce, Box, HP, VMware, Amazon Web Services, SoftLayer, Blue Jeans Network, Sungard Availability Services and Equinix. The suite will continue to grow with 3 new members being announced today: Microsoft GovCloud, Amazon Web Services GovCloud and Cisco. The design of NetBond allows us to continually add capabilities. For example, earlier this week we announced the addition of a leading cloud management solution with CSC. This new platform uses a unique set of application programing interfaces (APIs) exposed by AT&T. The APIs and predesigned templates from the CSC Agility Platform let users manage cloud partners, modify and automate policies, adjust bandwidth and apply governance controls. Accolades have come from industry watchers as well. Frost and Sullivan recognized NetBond with its 2014 Product Line Strategy Award. They awarded it with a score nearly doubling that of other competitors. \"The deep level of integration between AT&T's network platform and cloud providers' platforms is unmatched by other providers. It enables AT&T NetBond to deliver a more consistent, secure and reliable user experience,\" said Lynda Stadtmueller , vice president, Cloud Services, Frost & Sullivan. \"Combined with the extensive AT&T cloud ecosystem, NetBond can enhance any cloud strategy.\" AT&T NetBond addresses key concerns about shifting to the cloud.
