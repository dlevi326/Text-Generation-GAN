The Cupertino-based company is courting major Hollywood producers to create original content to compete with Netflix, according to a report from Variety on Monday. While the company is not commenting on those meetings, Apple did confirm Monday that it is teaming up with Cisco to bring more iPhones and iPads to business users. So what will these new partnerships mean for the company? Here are some answers. How serious is Apple about original content? Conversations are in preliminary stages, the report said, but Apple’s ultimate intent is to create development and production divisions for long-form streaming content to compete with Netflix. It remains unknown if the focus will be television series, films, or a little of each. The Apple content unit on the prowl in Tinseltown reports to Eddy Cue and may headhunt Hollywood-based executives in the upcoming weeks. Will the content business be good for Apple? Content production is not a core business for Apple, but its major tech rivals, including Amazon, have already made a major play for the market. Apple has plenty of cash on hand to enter into the fray in a move that would bolster its exclusive offerings on iTunes. Like streaming music, Apple would be late to the party, but the company could also build a solid business model based on its competitors’ successes and failures. Winners include Netflix, which has built a solid reputation as a content producer that spends top dollar and gets nominated for Emmys. Losers include Microsoft’s Xbox, which built an entire studio that flopped. Would Apple content move away from the current a la carte model to a monthly subscription? Or would it go ad-supported in light of its new Apple TV offering? What’s the deal with Apple and Cisco? Corporate technology spending represents a $2 trillion annual market, according to the Wall Street Journal . The partnership with Cisco will broaden Apple’s appeal to businesses and help its mobile devices communicate more effectively on corporate networks where Cisco is used. The company plans to focus on Cisco’s collaboration products, including its video- and Web-conferencing services. “IOS is the world’s best mobile platform, and nearly every Fortune 500 and Global 500 company today has put iOS at the center of their mobile strategy,” Cisco -Partner-to-Deliver-Fast-Lane-for-iOS-Enterprise-Users.html\">Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, said in a press release. “Together with Cisco, we believe we can give businesses the tools to maximize the potential of iOS and help employees become even more productive using the devices they already love.” Apple has seen a sharp drop in tablet sales, with iPad sales falling for six straight quarters and revenue from iPads down 24 percent in the nine months ended June 27, compared with the same period a year ago. A major reason for the decline is the larger iPhone 6, which is big enough for Apple fans to forgo a tablet. The partnership follows another enterprise deal last year between Apple and IBM to create apps for the workplace. Cisco sued Apple back in 2007 over the name “iPhone,” which Cisco claimed it had acquired. The suit settled with an agreement that both companies could use the name. Apple is expected to unveil the latest iteration of the iPhone at an event in San Francisco on Sept. 9. \nGet Silicon Valley  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:12:11.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
