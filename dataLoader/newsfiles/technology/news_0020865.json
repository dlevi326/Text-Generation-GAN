This incredible app is a global resource directory of music professionals, enterprises, products and services, available at a person’s fingertips. The MPO Online Resource Directory Application project enables access to a valuable source of information about music; music elements needed by the public. The information is online and free.\nThis is information the public needs to participate and improve their careers and interests in the musical arts; in a single location! The MPO Resource Directory is a single integrated database using six classes (independent databases) of a global music community; online music people, places and things. This includes professionals at every level, enterprises, sheet music, instruments, accessories, and services. However, before this app can be created, MPO needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $25,000 by October 1, 2015. The funds raised will go towards creating this application.\nTo help bring this innovative application to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered by January 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help the MPO Online Resource Directory Application reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: Stephen DeVaney\nTitle: Founder\nPhone: 312-421-3821\nemail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
