It has 55 employee in seven states, up from eight last year. The company expects to earn $3 million in revenue in 2015. \nThe new financing is an extension of a $4.3 million round announced in July led by TLSG Investments. Other investors included Kapoor Capital, Relativity Healthcare Partners, Serious Change, Kevin Hill, Martin Babinec, ARC Angel and George V.
