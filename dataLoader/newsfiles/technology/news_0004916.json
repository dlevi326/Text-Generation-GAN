These meaningful trends are referred to as threats. The process has gained prominence now than it ever had, since the internet revolution is in full swing now and the risk of frauds in online transactions has increased drastically due to the complexity of online transactions and activities. Barring a few minor constraints, the opportunities in this technology are many. The technology has yet to realize its optimum potential in automating business process based on rule based algorithms and more efficient integration with business program management. The primary aim is to find a trade-off between the accuracy of the processing and the run time.It is essential to sustain a minimum amount of latency alongside to have sustainable business environment. Additionally, the situations are intensified by an ever expanding service industry generating enormous data volumes from an enormous collection of distinct sources. It is extremely impractical to expect human resource to manage this huge data, process and represent the event outcome for any organization. Therefore, Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology has shown its market importance of low latency filtering, aggregating, correlating, and computing, based on a broad collection of chronological and real time streaming data.The global CEP market is expected to grow from $1.41 Billion in 2015 to $5.12 Billion in 2020, at a CAGR of 29.41% during the period 2015 to 2020. Internet Revolution, Development in the field of Machine Learning and Data Analytics and rise in risk and complexity of the web are the factors which are making the CEP market to grow lucratively in the coming future. Lack of consistency in results, Difficult to generate a fool-proof system and event data management are the factors hindering the growth of CEP market.
