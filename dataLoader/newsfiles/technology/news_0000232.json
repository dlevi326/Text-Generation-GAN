The console will now sell for 34,980 yen ($289) starting Oct. 1.\nThere were long lines at Sony's booth for its VR headset, which offers virtual reality games, promised for next year.\n___\nFollow Yuri Kageyama: http://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/yurikageyama"], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:52:33.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
