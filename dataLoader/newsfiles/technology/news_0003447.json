The drug, which fights parasitic infections, cost AIDS patients 55 times more than before. \nIt was only after a wave of critical national news stories -- and damning comments by politicians about drug \"price gouging\" -- that Shkreli announced he would \"lower the price of Daraprim to a price that is more affordable.\" It's not clear what his pharmaceutical company, Turing, will now charge. \nShkreli's actions shocked the nation this week, leading many to cry for punishing revenge on Shkreli himself. It was only a matter of time until someone exposed his personal details -- an act called \"doxxing\" in online slang. \nAt 11:29 p.m., someone posted a photo of Shkreli smirking. Attached was this message: \"If you want to discuss the increase of AIDS medication with Martin personally.\" \nSubsequent online comments suggested ordering pizza to his Manhattan apartment and sending prostitutes who demand pills as payment. \nOne person who supported exposing Shkreli's information wrote, \"You're doing God's work.\" Another said Shkreli deserved it: \"It's extortion of the terminally ill.\" \nCNNMoney called the number and got Shkreli's voicemail -- which was full. He did not respond to say whether prank phone calls and text messages kept him up Wednesday night. \nThat's usually the price people pay when their personal contact information ends up on a website like 4chan. \nThe image-sharing board has a reputation for being one of the seediest places on the Internet, where juvenile humor and unrestricted speech often results in discussion and sharing of illegal or unsavory content. Artists share images -- but hackers also share stolen goods. \nLike so many subjects of hackers' ire, Shkreli now has to worry about personal attacks.
