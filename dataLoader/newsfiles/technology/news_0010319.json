[Credit: Walt Kelly][/caption]Stereotypes about science are bad: the old white man with crazy hair and a lab coat is still the mental image that comes first to many people's minds. That means anyone who isn't a white male might feel they don't belong in science, to the detriment of society and science itself. If non-scientists think women can't do science, that attitude trickles into their assessment of stories in the media, the way they raise their children, and the respect they give to working researchers.But how widespread are sexist opinions about science, and what do those attitudes actually translate to in action? A survey by the L’Oréal Foundation set out to answer those questions. Their conclusions were grim: \"67% of Europeans think that women do not possess the required capabilities in order to access high-level scientific positions.\" Additionally, respondents — approximately 5000 men and women, sampled from five different European nations — said overwhelmingly said women had strong aptitude for any profession except science.The problem is that the survey sucks, so it's impossible to draw any strong conclusions from it.Survey design is hard, because people themselves are tricky. The way a question is asked can prime people's responses, prompting them to answer in a way that doesn't fully reflect their opinions. If the responses are multiple-choice, the options may not reflect all the possible attitudes people have. Then there's the matter of analyzing and interpreting the results. (I often say people are too complicated, which is why I studied something simple: the whole Universe.)In the case of the L'Oréal Foundation survey, both the questions and the interpretation seemed geared to making the problem of sexist attitudes look impossibly bad. I'll let others examine the question of why they would want to do such a thing, or if it was deliberate or not. Instead, let's look at the questions on the survey and the way the responses were interpreted in the L'Oréal Foundation's press release. (I'm basing my analysis on the survey description in this PDF document .)The survey started this way:\nIn your opinion, is a woman who does everything in her power to advance in her career A woman with something to prove t A woman who puts her work before her family t A woman who loves money t A woman who is prepared to walk all over other people t A woman who thinks she's a man There was no equivalent question asking about how they felt about men who do anything to advance their careers, so women's ambition is singled out from the start as something to be questioned. Those were also the only five options given: women who advance their careers because they want to be successful or because it's a smart thing to do are out of luck. If I'm interpreting the document correctly, this was the very first question the respondents answered, before anything about scientists or women's abilities.The next large chunk seems OK: it addresses perceptions of what areas of science people work in, and how those fields are populated by men and women. Consistent with earlier surveys, they found respondents are more likely to think of women as nurses and biologists than physicists or doctors (a stereotype rooted in reality). And as other surveys have found, respondents identify the same few scientists (Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Marie Curie, Galileo, and a handful of others) as the most prominent.Next, the survey prompts people to examine their perceptions of who does science, but they aren't allowed to pick either a gender-neutral representation or both a man and a woman: they had to choose one. (See the screenshot below from the survey.) By restricting respondents to one stereotypical image, the survey again seemed to reinforce the notion that they should be picking sexist and other stereotypes.[caption id=\"attachment_303\" align=\"\" width=\"800\"] Sample question and response from the survey on sexist attitudes about scientists. (Credit: L'Oréal Foundation survey)[/caption]Question 10 is listed out of order in the analysis, but it's the one that seems like the key to what follows: \"And in your opinion, what abilities do women lack that stops them from becoming high-level scientists?\" As University of Melbourne astrophysicist Katherine Mack pointed out , \"the survey asks the respondent to start with the assumption that women are stopped from becoming high-level scientists by a lack of abilities, and then asks what abilities women lack.\"And we can see the fruits throughout the rest of the survey: the questions that ask whether women have the proper abilities to do science or not. Question 11 reads: \"In your opinion, are men or women more suited to 1) Being high-level scientists or 2) Being high-level communicators\", which is a false dichotomy in every way. One can be a good scientist and a good communicator, or neither. The term \"high-level\" is never defined for the purposes of the survey, either, which means the survey-takers are allowed to interpret it how they choose, which probably is not consistent from person to person.Then Question 12 asks \"In your opinion, which of the following fields do women have the most aptitudes for?\", demanding respondents to pick just one option out of a list. As you can see from the results below, science came in fourth with 10%, above \"the arts\", \"business\", and \"politics\". But now we get to some skulduggery in the analysis: science is put last in the list, below the other responses to make it look like it performed worse than it did. Similarly, the top bar in the chart combines all the non-science options into one, to make it look like nobody thinks women are good at science — even though respondents said women perform better at science than business. (There are problems with that, too, but that's a story for another day.) If you wanted, you could say this survey found \"95% of respondents think women are better at anything else other business\". I hope you see how silly that sounds.[caption id=\"attachment_304\" align=\"\" width=\"800\"] On this chart, note that \"science\" is listed last, even though with 10% of responses it should sit higher in the ranking. Also \"anything but science\" was not actually a response on the survey: it's just the combination of all the possible responses that weren't science. (Credit: L'Oréal Foundation survey)[/caption]Again, no reasonable person doubts that sexist (and racist and ableist) attitudes about who can do science are a big problem. White women are promoted to upper-level positions at much lower rates than white men, and non-white scientists of all genders face prejudice in hiring, retention, and promotion. However, surveys like the one from L'Oréeal that are designed to produce certain responses don't help matters. At best, they exaggerate the extent of the problem to the point where many will think it's too big to solve; at worst, some people recognizing the methodological problems may think the whole issue is just made up by someone with an agenda.The lack of diversity in science is a real problem, and one that shouldn't be confused by poorly-designed and -interpreted surveys. I encourage L'Oréal and anyone else who is interested in solving the problem to get it right, for all our sakes.", "external_links": ["https://storify.com/AstroKatie/who-believes-women-have-the-skills-to-be-scientist", "http://www.loreal.com/media/press-releases/2015/sep/the-loreal-foundation-unveils-the-results-of-its-exclusive-international-study", "http://t.co/LSFYUUloNq", "http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2015/04/no_sexist_hiring_in_stem_fields_a_vaunted_new_study_makes_that_claim_unconvincingly.html"], "published": "2015-09-24T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T19:36:59.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
