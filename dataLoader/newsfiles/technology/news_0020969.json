It is said that you are paranoid if you think everyone wants to throw you over a barrel and rape you. Just because you are paranoid does not mean everyone is out to get you. It is a fact that every year business will lose money to unscrupulous customers and even worse suppliers. Here are few tricks any small business owner needs to understand.\nDo not buy equipment that you rely on from any of the big name stores. I have now learned my lesson. About a year ago I bought a laptop from Makro, It broke down within it's warrantee, but outside of the 6 months allowed by the consumer protection act. I had one of two choices wait 6 weeks for a repair, or buy a new one to keep my business running. I chose the latter, 6 weeks later after having heard nothing from Makro I queried the time and was told that the supplier had not yet done the assessment. I waited another week before insisting on a refund.\nOn the 25 th of July 2015 I bought a Bosch Battery Drill Driver from the same store, It is a professional machine and I would expect it to last more than 5 and a half weeks, It didn't, I returned to Makro where I asked for a replacement as this is what the consumer protection act allows. I was told that I would have to wait for an assessment of the tool before this can be done. I live in a one horse town pretending to be a city, so it needs to be sent to Johannesburg first. This can take wait for it six weeks. This machine is mission critical for my business so I will have to buy another today so that I can do my job.\nThere should be no argument that a machine that is less than 6 weeks old should not break. If I were the owner of Bosch I would have instructions that any person in industry using my goods does not wait two days to get back to work, but Makro doesn't seemingly give enough of a damn to phone Bosch and tell them that this is a problem. They don't care that I have to spend much needed funds on a replacement machine while they have my almost new one for 6 weeks. I will not buy anything mission critical from any Walmart store again.\nWayne thanks for your lack of assistance. As a Manager you are in my opinion not an asset for Makro. Support other small businesses and teach them to support small business.\nHave a water tight contract and make your client sign it. If they don't you are going to be laid over a barrel and raped. A written Quote: is not a contract as much as we would like to believe it is. I got screwed in the Small Claims Court because the client never accepted my terms, He made an allegation that we had verbally agreed to a different price, because the Quote: was not within his budget. This alleged agreement that I was assuredly not party to was accepted as fact by the commissioner despite my written Quote: being in evidence.\nBrand names are not as good as they used to be. I will be doing a few articles where I discuss the different tools of my trade and the lack of quality from big names like Bosch, Ryobi and Makita. Ryobi have recently released a “pro” range and I am concerned about trying them because of my experiences with the DIY range, having said that I have had bad experiences with Makita and Bosch as well. My Dad swore by Makita and had tools in his box that had lasted years. I have two Makita tools that haven't lasted two years. I am also on my second Bosch Drill Driver in only two years. The new one didn't last 6 weeks before it broke. It may be worth buying cheap tools because you know that they will need to be replaced in a year or two. The expensive ones don't seem to last much longer.\nTreat all your clients with suspicion until they prove not to be out to get you. I was told the other day by a chap that install gate motors and stuff that he was called out by a client, He got the heebie jeebies decided he didn't need the business and referred him to some one else. The someone else didn't get paid. It is becoming more and more common that you are going to get robbed. A friend of mine calls these people shop lifters, not clients. They follow the processes, take delivery and just don't pay. One simple rule, If you ask for a deposit and there is any hesitation or fuss about it, walk away. People who don't pay deposits don't pay for the work either. Sometimes they will pay the deposit and not pay the balance as well. Stage payments can reduce your risk. I for instance have a deposit, a stage payment on completion of manufacturing prior to delivery, and a small balance payable on completion of installation. If the stage payment is not made, do not deliver, it's funny how they come up with the money when you outright refuse delivery.\nIf someone runs you down on social media, do not engage and become embroiled in a flame war. It does you no good, Write a blog on your own website listing the facts and link the social media article to the facts. No more, no less. I lost a lot of money by becoming embroiled in a social media spat about 10 years ago. Once was enough. The truth is ignored, Terry Pratchett said it best. A lie will get half way around the world before the truth gets his boots on.\nGuy runs a small business on a shoestring, Sometimes cash flow is a dream, but every month it improves just a little. I sometimes write articles to help other small businesses learn from my errors and so that you know you are not alone battling the forces of darkness that attempt to destroy your dream.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T12:05:08.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
