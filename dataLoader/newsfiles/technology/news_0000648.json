Online offers clients dedicated infrastructures in order to provide powerful outcomes for a variety of applications and end uses including virtual private servers, databases and high performance computing.\n\"With IBMs POWER8-based servers, we can increase our levels of service to clients seeking a dedicated cloud platform alternative to x86 servers,\" said Sébastien Cassier, Team Leader, Online. \"We wanted to approach the business differently than in the past. The dedicated bare metal Power Systems running Linux differentiate us from other service providers because we can now say that our clients have the opportunity to run the most powerful servers in the world in a native environment for their business needs.\"\nThe IBM POWER8-based servers to be used at Online are based on the first open server platform (1) and the first processor designed for Big Data (2) . The bare metal, dedicated systems will be equipped with Power KVM, an open-source virtualization solution used to manage Linux systems, allowing clients the ability to standardize their clouds with a single open-source virtualization technology. The Power Systems S822L servers benefit directly from innovations co-developed by members of the OpenPOWER Foundation – a 150-member global organization of leading technology suppliers and users supporting and contributing to open development on top of POWER's open architecture.\nWith Power Systems incorporated into its bare metal environment, Online can have the ability to support more users at a lower cost. For example, when compared to a similarly configured x86-based server, a Power S822L server can support 1.87 times more MariaDB transactions per minute per core at 40% lower cost (3) .\n\"Today's cloud service providers require systems that will increase the performance for their existing clients as well as attract new clients with alternatives to x86,\" said Doug Balog , General Manager, IBM Power Systems. \"Power Systems can give MSPs like Online a more cost effective and powerful solution than an x86 environment for customers analyzing and managing massive amounts of data in the cloud.\"\nDeploying IBM Power System S822L servers, Online will look to attract larger enterprise-class clients by offering a dedicated physical POWER8-based server to effectively manage and meet the demands of the staggering amounts of data that clients, large and small, face each day. With the help of IBM POWER8 dedicated servers, Online clients will have the ability to gain fast insights to data, in a security-rich cloud environment.\nTo order or find out more about Online's Power Systems bare metal offering, visit: http://www.online.net/en/dedicated-server/dedibox-power8 .\nAbout Online\nSince 1999, Online has provided hosting services for Internet stakeholders of all sizes, worldwide. Today they are one of the leading Web hosting providers, hosting several hundred thousand Interface sites in three datacenters. Online offers a range of services including domain names, Web hosting, dedicated servers and hosting in datacenters.\n(1) By \"first open server platform\" , this means that the IBM POWER server is the first server that has made its systems, processor, and chip design and architecture fully available to an open development alliance, the OpenPOWER Foundation, for comprehensive licensing and collaborative design allowing third parties to co-innovate.\n(2) By Big Data, IBM means handling both extraordinary large volumes of structured (relational databases) and unstructured (noSQL, Map Reduce) data from which customers derive analytics and insight. The POWER 8 processor is the first processor with differentiated capabilities designed to handle both structured and unstructured data. Such capabilities include:\na. the CAPI (Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface) Architecture with key data capabilities e.g.: a). CAPI Flash Access Efficiency, b). Storage reduction via CAPI Attached Compression Accelerator, and c). Throughput and latency advantage of CAPI Attached Mellanox RDMA Fabric.\nb. DBMA (dynamic balanced memory architecture) in the form of key capabilities, e.g. a). Internal Processor Data Flow b). Memory Bandwidth advantage c). Cache capacity advantage\n(3) Results are based on IBM internal testing of comparatively configured single system image systems running Sysbench OLTP version.05 @ 32M and are current as of May 29, 2015 . Performance improvement figures are based on multiple G2 processes running a 32 million record workload . Individual results will vary depending on individual workloads, configurations and conditions.
