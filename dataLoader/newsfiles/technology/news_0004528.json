In the new role, Quinn will be evangelizing Altitude's programmatic platform and video products to premium publishers. \nQuinn has more than two decades in the advertising and technology industry, leading sales, publisher development and account management teams at several innovative digital media companies. He joins Altitude from flytedesk, where he served as COO. Previously, Perry was the CRO of Linksmart, and prior to that served as SVP of Publisher Development at Federated Media/Lijit Networks, now Sovrn Holdings. \n\"Altitude has created a company culture focused on helping online publishers succeed in this complex environment,\" said Jeremy Ostermiller, CEO of Altitude Digital. \"Perry understands that one of technology's primary jobs is to create value for publishers -- simplifying the work of ad management so they can focus more on what they do best, which is creating compelling content. He has spent a career improving business opportunities for online publishers, and we're thrilled to add his experience to our team.\" \nAltitude Digital has built one of the fastest video platforms, designed to help publishers generate the most value from their video advertising and understand their performance and data in real-time. As advertising technology solutions proliferate, publishers have found themselves at a disadvantage compared to advertisers. Much of the investment in analytics and tools has been on the advertiser side of the business leaving even the most premium publishers at a disadvantage. \n\"Video and mobile are still the highest growth segments of digital advertising, and Altitude Digital has developed technology that will help publishers approach these new revenue opportunities with ease and efficiency,\" said Quinn. \"Publishers today have many disparate tools at their disposal, but few integrated solutions. At Altitude, we're looking to simplify programmatic selling, putting everything publishers need into one powerful and elegant platform.\" \nIn addition to his role at Altitude, Quinn is a mentor at Techstars and Boomtown. He will be based in the company's Denver office. \nAbout Altitude Digital Altitude Digital delivers powerful video and mobile advertising technology and actionable big data to online publishers to help them expand their available ad inventory, increase the value of their supply and grow their revenue.
