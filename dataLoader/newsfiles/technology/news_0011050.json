Students spent the semester learning about the latest in smart technologies, brainstorming how they could be applied to cities, and transforming them into business propositions. After reviewing all of the entries, three students’ projects were recently selected to receive grants from Verizon.\nFirst Place: PHXflow\nFirst-place winner Alex Slaymaker is in her second year in the School of Sustainability’s Master of Sustainability Solutions program and has a passion for eliminating waste.\n“Cities of the future will view sending waste to the landfill as an outdated inefficiency that hurts their bottom line and reputation,” she said.\nSlaymaker’s waste-reducing proposition, PHXflow, is a vibrant online waste networking platform created for small- and medium-sized businesses interested in selling, donating, purchasing or exchanging unwanted materials with other businesses in the Phoenix metropolitan area.\n“Picture a Match.com for all different kinds of waste, from wooden crates to leftovers,” Slaymaker explained.\nIn Phoenix alone, enough waste is generated in one year to fill Chase Stadium seven times. Although recovered materials account for one stadium’s capacity, the Brookings Institute estimates that over $500 million worth are exported from the Phoenix metropolitan area each year. Half are sent across the world to Asia, where they are transformed into new products that are sold back to the United States.\nThe remaining six stadiums worth of waste are sent to landfills, even though 50 percent is compostable, 15 percent is recyclable, and 23 percent is recoverable. PHXflow aims to correct this by allowing companies to inject by-products back into the regional supply chain so that others can create wealth from what would otherwise be waste — a matchmaking proposition now backed by a $5,000 grant.\nSecond Place: BetR-block, LLC\nChristopher Frettoloso, the second-place recipient of $2,000, conceived BetR-block, LLC.\nRead Entire Article at: http://realstreettech.com/smart-city-designs-earn-asu-sustainability-students-verizon-grants/\nAbout Us:\nTechnology’s impact on commercial real estate is moving at an exponential rate.
