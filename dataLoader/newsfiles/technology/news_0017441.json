The fund, Accel-KKR Capital Partners V LP (\"Fund V\"), will continue Accel-KKR's long-term focused strategy of investing in lower-middle market and middle-market software and IT-enabled services companies. \nAccel-KKR said the fund received strong support from its investors in prior funds, as well as attracted a number of new investors. Commenting on the fund closing, Tom Barnds, Managing Director of Accel-KKR, said, \"We are heartened by the support we received from our existing investors, and are quite pleased to welcome a number of new investors to the fund. The missions of our investors, who include leading academic institutions, medical research foundations, health care institutions, and corporate and government pensions, resonate deeply with the Accel-KKR team.\" \nThe firm formally went to market with Fund V in Spring 2015 and closed on its hard cap earlier this month. This brings Accel-KKR's total committed capital to $4.0 billion across its current and previous funds. \nThe new fund includes a $100 million commitment from the firm's general partners. \"We believe in strong alignment of interest with our limited partners,\" commented Rob Palumbo, Managing Director of Accel-KKR. \"One of the many ways we seek to achieve this alignment is by making very significant financial commitments to invest alongside of our limited partners.\" The $100 million commitment represents the largest such general partner commitment in the firm's history and also makes the general partner the largest investor in the fund. \nAccel-KKR invests through two different types of funds - its Buyout funds for majority ownership positions and its Growth Capital funds for minority ownership positions. Accel-KKR raised its second Growth Capital Fund in 2014 with $350 million of committed capital. Fund V also follows the firm's fourth buyout fund, which it started investing out of in 2013 with $800 million of commitments. \nThe firm has continued to expand its investment efforts outside of North America. In 2013, it opened a London office, and since 2013 the firm and its portfolio companies have acquired or invested in over eight technology companies in Europe. Accel-KKR has also expanded its investor base outside the United States, such that in Fund V over one third of the committed capital is from international investors. International investments continue to be an integral part of the firm's strategy going forward. \nThe close of Fund V also comes amidst a period of significant activity for Accel-KKR, in terms of new investments, add-on acquisitions by portfolio companies and realizations of investments. -- Recent new platform investments include: -- Motor Vehicle Software Corporation (MVSC) - Based in Agoura Hills, CA, MVSC provides innovative process management software for state government agencies and businesses including an electronic vehicle registration solution. -- Banker's Toolbox - Based in Austin, TX, Banker's Toolbox is a leading provider of Bank Secrecy Act anti-money laundering compliance and fraud prevention solutions for the financial industry. -- Five Accel-KKR portfolio companies made add-on acquisitions over the last several months, including: -- Oildex, a leader provided of revenue and expense management software to the oil and gas market, acquired the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) business of Automatic Data Processing. -- HighJump, a global provider of supply chain management solutions, acquired Wesupply, a United Kingdom-based provider of supplier enablement and B2B integration solutions. -- MEA|NEA, the leader in secure health information exchange for medical and dental providers, acquired The White Stone Group, Inc., a provider of healthcare communication management solutions. -- Kerridge Commercial Systems, a global provider of enterprise resource planning software to the distributive trades, acquired Dancik International, a provider of software to the flooring and tiling industries. -- Datapipe, a global leader in managed hybrid IT solutions for the enterprise, acquired DualSpark, an Amazon Web Services assessment, automation, and migration company. -- Accel-KKR has achieved a series of successful exits recently including: -- RiseSmart, the leading provider of contemporary career transition services, which was acquired by Randstad Holding nv. -- On Center Software, a leading construction automation technology company, which was acquired by Roper Technologies. -- Applied Predictive Technologies, a leading cloud-based analytics provider, which was acquired by MasterCard for $600 million. \nAbout Accel-KKR Accel-KKR is a technology-focused investment firm with $4.0 billion in capital commitments to its current funds.
