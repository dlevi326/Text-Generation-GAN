All devices automatically transfer data to a digital platform, where it can be stored and analysed.\n\"Data and data-related services will increase significantly,\" Nota said. \"Step by step we will develop from a company offering products into a company that offers products and services.\n\"Services will increase strongly ... and so will our profit margins.\"\nNota said that he is happy with Philips' consumer health portfolio but is keeping an eye open for potential acquisitions.\n\"If we can get a critical mass through an acquisition or a specific capability, we will do that deal,\" he said.
