Computed radiography is similar to conventional radiography; however, it uses imaging plates made of photostimulable phosphor instead of films. Computed radiography and digital radiography are preferred over conventional radiography because they require lesser processing time, do not require chemical processing, and are able to produce high-quality digital images.Technavio's analysts forecast the global computed radiography and digital radiography market to grow at a CAGR of 5.19% over the period 2014-2019.
