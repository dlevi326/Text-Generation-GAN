The new module will offer a robust and secured platform for building products targeted toward IoT applications. Using this COM, designers can leverage the asymmetric multi-core architecture on Freescale i.MX 7 to develop products with excellent user-experience without compromising on real-time constraints.\nHorw, Switzerland, September 04, 2015 --( PR.com )-- The announcement of Freescale’s i.MX 7 processor has created a lot of excitement here at Toradex, a leading vendor of ARM-based Computer on Modules (COMs). Toradex will be among the few hardware partners showcasing a platform based on the i.MX 7 processor, during Freescale’s official launch of the same, early next year.\nToradex is pleased to extend its existing portfolio of COMs, by announcing its commitment to launch a new COM-based on Freescale’s i.MX 7 processor. The new module will offer a robust and secured platform for building products targeted toward IoT applications. Using this COM, designers can leverage the asymmetric multi-core architecture on Freescale i.MX 7 to develop products with excellent user-experience without compromising on real-time constraints. Toradex already offers COMs based on Freescale Vybrid and i.MX 6 processors.\nToradex’s 16 different COMs from its Colibri family, even though based on different processors, offer pin-compatibility and thus enable a seamless migration path for customers to enhance their end-products by accommodating leading edge technologies without redesign cost and effort.\nAvailability and Pricing\nThese modules will be available during the official launch of Freescale i.MX 7 processor early next year. Prices of these modules will be also announced then.\nAbout Computer on Modules (COMs)\nA Computer on Module (COM) / System on Module (SOM) is a small form-factor, ready-to-use computing solution that consists of a generic hardware along with a highly optimized operating system.\nReusing an off-the-shelf COM for an embedded product will accelerate time-to-market and while in parallel significantly reduce the risk of the development project. Due to the generic architecture of Toradex' COMs almost any application can be built from it, whether it be medical, industrial automation, aerospace, robotics, etc.\nAbout Toradex\nToradex is a leading vendor of ARM-based Computer on Modules (COM) / System on Modules (SOM) that can be used for diverse embedded applications. Powered by Freescale® i.MX 6 & Vybrid™, and other leading processors, the COMs families offer variety in terms of price, performance, power consumption and interfaces. This makes Toradex COMs ideal for meeting the diverse needs of embedded market. Toradex stands out in the embedded computing market with its product pin-compatibility, longevity, free premium support and transparent pricing.\nFounded in 2003 and headquartered in Horw, Switzerland, the company’s network stretches across the globe with additional offices in the USA, Vietnam, China, India, Japan, and Brazil.
