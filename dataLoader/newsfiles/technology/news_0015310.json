Based on that figure, the workers could have received more than $US100,000 apiece if they prevailed at trial.\nNearly $US41 million of the settlement will be paid to lawyers representing the technology workers. That's less than half of the roughly $US85 million in fees that the lawyers had sought.\nThe approval granted on Wednesday by US District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, dispenses with a case that exposed internal emails casting former Apple CEO Steve Jobs in an unflattering light.\nKoh had rejected a $US324.5 million settlement of the case reached last year as inadequate.\nApple Inc, Google Inc, Intel Corp and Adobe Systems Inc will pay the revised settlement.\nLast year, Koh approved a separate settlement requiring Intuit Inc., Pixar Animation Studios and Lucasfilm to pay a $US20 million settlement to resolve allegations made against them in the same case.\nThe lawsuit depicted Jobs, who died in 2011, as the conniving ringleader of a scheme designed to minimise the chances that top computer programmers and other talented employees would defect to other technology companies.\nKoh approved the latest settlement after finding little resistance to the deal. She said only 67 of the 64,666 workers represented in the case objected to or opted out of the settlement.\nThe lawsuit accused Apple, Google and the other companies of forming a \"no-poaching\" cartel that secretly agreed not to recruit each other's workers. Lawyers for the employees argued the pact illegally suppressed the wages of the affected workers.\nThe alleged collusion stopped after the US Justice Department opened an investigation that culminated with an antitrust complaint being filed against Apple, Google and the other participating companies in 2010.\nThe Justice Department's case was settled without the companies acknowledging any guilt or paying any fines.\nAll the companies denied wrongdoing in settling the case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:57:27.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
