Paramount Pictures\nNo comic book or pop culture convention is complete without an appearance from legendary \"Star Trek\" actor William Shatner.\nThe geek icon will host a special 50th anniversary celebration for \"Star Trek\" alongside other stars from the acclaimed TV and film series at Silicon Valley Comic Con at the San Jose Convention Center in California between March 18, 2016 and March 20, 2016.\n\"It's only logical to celebrate the 50th anniversary of 'Star Trek' alongside technology that was just science fiction when 'Star Trek' first began to broadcast,\" William Shatner said in a press release. \"I'm looking forward to participating in the inaugural Silicon Valley Comic Con.\"\nTechnology pioneer Steve Wozniak created the new convention to celebrate both technology and entertainment. Silicon Valley Comic Con promised to feature Hollywood celebrities and tech leaders involved in movies, TV, music, gaming, electronics, apps and emerging technologies.\n\"Not only did 'Star Trek' captivate a legion of science fiction lovers, it also inspired generations of engineers, scientists, directors, writers and artists,\" Wozniak said in a press release. \"Just like 'Star Trek,' Silicon Valley Comic Con will bridge the gap between entertainment and technology. We have many more events and surprises planned, so fans should grab their tickets now to join all the fun.\"\nSilicon Valley Comic Con tickets are available to order now, including VIP packages where fans will have a chance to meet Wozniak in person.", "external_links": ["http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/09/08/8b7a8e25-f0f2-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/resize/570xauto/0e69251d0ab6261b114dd48d856d2eea/kirk-khan-shout.jpg", "http://www.svcomiccon.com/tickets"], "published": "2015-09-22T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:40:19.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
