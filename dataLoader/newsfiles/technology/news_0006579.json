Apple said last week that watchOS 2 would be available on Sept. 16. \nApple limited the availability of the Apple Watch earlier this year after a component supplied by a Chinese company was found to be defective, the Wall Street Journal reported in April. \nThe company also had issues this year with a bug that could cause iPhones to crash when a message containing a specific string of text was received. \nLast year, a bug in Apple's HealthKit health and fitness application platform prevented its release along with the iOS 8 operating system for iPhones and iPads. \n(Reporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru and Julia Love in San Francisco; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Ted Kerr)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T23:01:39.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
