Utilizing cameras that take 28,500 high-definition pictures per second, you can literally see the pain sink in. Interesting fact: Every piece confetti that explodes when the taser is fired, contains the serial number of the cartridge that fired it, making it easy to trace back the history of the firing incident.\nLoki the Wolfdog is a beautiful, snow-loving Husky-Arctic Wolf-Malamute-mix. This majestic footage was taken while playing with his owner mostly in passes of the Rocky Mountains in central Colorado. Check out Loki's Instagram page. It's breath-taking.\nWant more of The Feed?
