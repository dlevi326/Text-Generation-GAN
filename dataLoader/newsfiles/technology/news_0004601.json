In a month, the company plans to complete combining the reservations systems of American and its US Airways subsidiary and retiring the US Airways brand. \nCombining technology systems is a difficult feat that has tripped up other airlines, notably leading to several outages at United Airlines after it merged with Continental Airlines in 2010. United suffered two major outages this summer. \nAmerican has made meticulous plans to avoid a similar fate. Among other moves, it will reduce flights to lighten the load on its network while it combines the two reservations systems. \nShares of American Airlines Group rose $1.37, or 3.2 percent, to $44.43 in afternoon trading Thursday.
