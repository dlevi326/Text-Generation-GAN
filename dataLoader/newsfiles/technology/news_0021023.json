Asahi Breweries was founded over a century ago and brews some of the world’s best known beer brands, including Asahi Super Dry. Asahi will leverage APT’s software to identify, measure, and improve key initiatives across their sales, marketing, pricing, and retail operations. Asahi has already started using APT’s software to further fine-tune their support for restaurant partners. APT collaborated with an IT Service Provider, ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation, and worked with Asahi to pilot the Test & Learn® software. During the pilot, the software helped Asahi analyze multiple high-potential initiatives.\nMr. Toshiya Onozato, Director of Asahi Breweries said, “It is our top priority to support our clients to help increase their sales and profits. To do this, it is very important to learn how each initiative works and to identify what is the ‘winning pattern.’ Traditionally, to figure out which initiative would generate profits, we used to roll it out and wait to understand the results. But by introducing APT’s Test & Learn software, we can predict the impact of the initiative before rolling it out. This enables us to understand the impact of new programs with higher accuracy. For example, when we were considering introducing a new beer menu at a restaurant network, we tested the idea using APT’s software. We found that the new beer menu did not lead to the expected increase in margin and also decreased the sales of beer. Based on this result, we decided not to roll out the initiative. Instead we tested an alternative initiative and found out that the impact of the new initiative was profitable for both the restaurant network and us. APT’s software identified the profit improvement opportunities for this initiative and improved collaboration with the restaurant company.”\nAPT SVP Naohiko Oikawa said of the relationship, “We are excited and pleased to be working with Asahi’s innovative and analytical team. We look forward to continuing to help Asahi and their partners use a data-driven approach to decision-making.”\nAPT’s client relationships span various industries and include many global manufacturing and restaurant organizations, including Coca-Cola, Kellogg, P&G, Costa, KFC UK, and Pizza Hut Restaurants, among others. These organizations leverage APT’s software to analyze a range of initiatives, from retail servicing, sampling, and marketing to menu, promotions, and operations changes.\nTo learn more about APT’s software, please visit http://www.predictivetechnologies.com .\nAbout Asahi Breweries\nThe Asahi Breweries aims to satisfy its customers with the highest levels of quality and integrity, while contributing to the promotion of healthy living and the enrichment of society worldwide.\nIts focus is to further cultivate our mainstay brands such as Asahi Super Dry.
