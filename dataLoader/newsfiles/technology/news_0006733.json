The main goal of this office is to employ software engineers who will further develop the Vectorworks product line, serving the AEC, landscape and entertainment design industries. Located in the heart of Midtown Atlanta on Regions Plaza's 19th floor, the new office boasts 3,700 square feet and can hold up to 25 people. Additionally, the location is in close proximity to the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), four MARTA stations and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\n\"Several factors contributed to our decision to open the Atlanta office, but location was a prime reason,\" said Dr. Biplab Sarkar, chief technology officer of Nemetschek Vectorworks. \"We wanted our next location to be easy to travel to and in the same time zone as our headquarters in Maryland. The impressive Georgia Tech feeder system was also a highly attractive factor.\"\nGeorgia Tech is graduating some of the best talent in the engineering industry. Further, Georgia Tech’s College of Engineering has been cited as one of the best values in American higher education by publications such as the Fiske Guide to Colleges, The Princeton Review and Kiplinger Business Magazine because of its high academic quality and relatively low cost. The undergraduate engineering program at Georgia Tech ranked 4th in the 2015 “America's Best Colleges” edition of U.S. News & World Report.\nAdditional contributing factors to the opening of the Nemetschek Vectorworks Atlanta office include:\n The affordability for emerging professionals and families because the cost of living is $0.90 below the national average The 2.4% job growth rate, which is above the national average Startups and major corporations, such as Coca-Cola, Home Depot and UPS, make their corporate home in the Atlanta area, which is positive for the local economy\nSoftware Engineer Jack Gruendler is among the initial employees hired for the Atlanta office. \"Writing Vectorworks software is the perfect career combination for my academic background as I have civil engineering and computer science degrees from Georgia Tech,\" said Gruendler. \"The Midtown location also drew me to the position because I was previously commuting out of the city to the suburbs, where most engineering and software development jobs are currently offered. Now, my commute will be significantly shorter, and I can have an eco-friendly and healthy bicycle commute on the Atlanta BeltLine instead.”\nThe opening of the Atlanta office is another milestone in Nemetschek Vectorworks' growth.
