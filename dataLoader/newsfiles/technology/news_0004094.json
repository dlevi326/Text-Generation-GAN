Each year more than 13,000 batches of drugs, food and cosmetics are tested and more than 2900 reference standards are distributed by NIFDC. \nLincoln University’s Business Development Manager Dr Samuel Yu says the visit is a great ways for scientists, international regulatory authorities, and businesses and companies to discuss together the issues faced in the food testing and export sectors, and see how to design pathways to problem-solve potential challenges. \n\"Establishing and building these connections and relationships becomes increasing vital, as New Zealand is a large exporter of foods and other high-value products, and being able to participate with the regulatory authorities that we export into, is an important way to build understanding about their requirements.\" \nIt can also help the ability of New Zealand and Lincoln students, and scientists, to formulate solutions that can have a global impact, Dr Yu says. \nThe group was officially welcomed by Dean of Agricultural and Life Sciences (AGLS), Professor Bruce McKenzie, followed by an overview of Lincoln University. Lincoln toxicology specialist, Associate Professor Ravi Gooneratne, and Food Safety and Microbiologist specialist, Dr Malik Hussain, also presented their collaborations in southern China, and discussed with NIFDC the latest contamination trends in New Zealand. \nYili Oceania Dairy’s R&D Manager, Dr Philip Wescombe, based on the Lincoln University campus, was also invited by NIFDC to participate in the discussions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T02:36:46.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
