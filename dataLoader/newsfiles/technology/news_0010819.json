This year, they feature improved camera quality and 3D touch, a display technology which uses a \"Taptic Engine\" to gauge how hard users press the screen.

The company has said there is room to grow this year since most iPhone users are due for an upgrade.\n\"The stage is set for Apple to show year-over-year growth over the Herculean iPhone 6 sales,\" FBR Capital Markets senior analyst Daniel Ives told Reuters.\nThis report contains material from Reuters.", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1OxY5xs"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T23:40:52.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
