(AMGN).\nThe acquisition of the LakeCentre Facility, for an undisclosed price, is the U.K.-based drugmaker's latest move to expand its biologics manufacturing capacity, following a $285 million investment in a new facility in Sweden announced in May.\n\"This site will play an important role in our future commercial production and give AstraZeneca and MedImmune, our global biologics research and development arm, the flexibility and capacity to meet the needs of our rapidly growing biologics portfolio,\" said Pam Cheng, an executive vice-president at AstraZeneca.\nAstraZeneca's staff will oversee refurbishment and infrastructure improvements at the site before it becomes fully operational and licensed for commercial production by late 2017, the company said. It added that up to 400 high-skilled jobs could eventually be created at the facility.\nThe company said the investment won't affect its financial guidance for 2015.\nWrite to Ed Ballard at ed.ballard@wsj.com\n 11, 2015 02:44 ET (06:44 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:34:41.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
