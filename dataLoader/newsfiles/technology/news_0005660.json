The machine can print objects up to 1.8m high at a speed of up to 35cm per hour. This means that something like a 5ft life-size print of a person could only take around 5 hours to produce. \nThe machine utilises a unique Gel Dispensing Printing (GDP) technology which deposits a special printing gel and is then cured by UV light. The speed of the print and curing engine allows for instant solidification. With its unique software developments, Massivit 3D has also developed techniques that allow printing of non-vertical walls and ceilings without the need for support structures. \nGershon Miller, one of Massivit founders says, “In developing Massivit 1800 we had to reinvent 3D printing, we had to invent a whole new technology – the GDP: Gel Dispensing Printing. The result is a 3D printer with remarkable performance, stunning design, and some of the most \nadvanced 3D printing algorithms in the market enabling very fast and very economical printing, saving on printing material and printing time of superfluous support structures.” \nThe first Massivit 1800 system was installed at E.S. Digital in Israel, a large print and digital communications provider. Eyal Shemesh E.S. Digital CEO, commented: “We are delighted and excited to own the Massivit 1800. We have great plans for this printer, and many of our customers are already awaiting this solution that will enable them to create unique, stunning promotional campaign in all kind of formats – from unique point of purchase displays all the way to amazing launch events. With the Massivit 1800 we can now offer our customers more ways to grab attention, call for engagement and make their marketing campaigns attractive & entertaining – we can add another dimension to marketing.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:59:40.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
