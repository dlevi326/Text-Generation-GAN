Kudu opens up the Hadoop ecosystem to real-time analytics by simplifying the architecture for building analytic applications on changing data, complementing HDFS and Apache HBase. \nZoomdata is the first big data visual analytics solution optimized for Kudu, available in open source as a free beta download here . Working closely with Cloudera and the Kudu community, Zoomdata has fine tuned its solution for the Kudu storage technology. Zoomdata supports both real-time monitoring and analytic queries over billions of rows of historical data, now taking advantage of the simplified storage architecture that Kudu provides. \n\"Zoomdata has long been a proponent of simplified architectures that treat all data as streams, instead of complex lambda architectures that have one data pipeline for real-time data and a separate pipeline for historical data,\" said Nick Halsey, CMO of Zoomdata. \"What Zoomdata can now do with Kudu is allow big data customers to store enormous amounts of data in Hadoop and still stream that data in real-time. With Kudu, Zoomdata can perform analytics on Hadoop and big data at web-giant scales and at significantly lower cost than proprietary solutions.\" \nPrior to Kudu, Hadoop developers were forced to choose between fast analytics with HDFS or updating data with HBase. Ideally, developers would have a way to combine the two features to build fast analytics on changing data. Kudu complements the capabilities of HDFS and HBase to provide this capability and is designed for use cases such as time series analysis, machine data analytics and online reporting. \n\"Kudu represents a crucial milestone for Hadoop and we are excited to work with Zoomdata and others in the community to enable fast analytics on fast data with this new, revolutionary storage engine,\" said Charles Zedlewski, vice president, Products of Cloudera. \"With Kudu, streamlined real-time architectures are now possible in Hadoop and integrated with tools such as Spark and Impala, and complete with Zoomdata visualizations, next-generation analytics are available to users like never before.\" \nMore information on Zoomdata and Kudu: Visit Zoomdata's booth #332 at Strata + Hadoop World in New York, September 29 - October 1, 2015 for a hands-on demo of Zoomdata showcasing how Kudu can help your data-driven organization better improve business results today.
