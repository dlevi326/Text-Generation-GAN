EE Connect provides us with even more flexibility, giving us the ability to offer granular level support to our customers and faster, tailored M2M systems.” \nEE’s announcement came on the same day as the launch of a government-backed IoT development project called IoTUK . \nWith a £40m funding pot to draw on, IoTUK will be backed by the Digital Catapult and the Future Cities Catapult , and has been designed to enable IoT entrepreneurs to get their projects up and running.
