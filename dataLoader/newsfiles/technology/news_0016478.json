No announcement was made about his departure until a few days before he was announced as minister.\nLast week, it also emerged that Zwane was flown to Cape Town by Magashule’s office, catching off guard the troop of parliamentary officials who are usually involved when a new MP is to be sworn in.\nA source in the National Assembly Table (senior parliamentary staff) told City Press that officials in Parliament were surprised when Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli informed them that Zwane, the new MP, was already in his office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T22:59:31.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
