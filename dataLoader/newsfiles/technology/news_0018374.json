This is supported by all web browsers for instance. \nIf you try to run these operations on Windows apps, regardless of whether they are designed for Windows 8 or Windows 10, you will notice that they don't work. \nA double-click on the Microsoft Edge icon does nothing for example if the browser is already open, and this is the case for all Windows apps currently. \nThis does not mean that they don't support multiple windows though. It is easy enough to open a new window in Microsoft Edge using the menu for instance, the right-click context menu of links, or the shortcut Ctrl-n. \nThe Mail app supports multiple windows as well, for instance to display the inbox and a compose window next to each other. \nThe majority of applications don't support this however. The multi-window functionality of Windows apps is powered by an API that apps need to utilize to make multi-window functionality available. \nThe API is compatible with Windows 8 and 10, and works on the desktop and for mobile. Apps need to support it to provide multi-window functionality but even when they do, it won't have the same functionality that desktop programs offer in this regard. \nThis explains why you cannot just double-click an app icon to launch another instance of it as Windows apps handle things in a different manner than programs that run on the operating system. \nThe main issue here is that the behavior is inconsistent, especially if you don't know about the limitation and wonder why you cannot launch another instance of an application on your Windows system that is already running. Summary Why you cannot launch multiple instances of Windows apps the usual way Author Martin Brinkmann Description Find out why you cannot double-click on apps to run a second instance (window) of them on your Windows 8 or 10 system.
