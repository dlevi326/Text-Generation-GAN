The new Canon-developed CMOS sensor achieves an ultra-high signal readout speed of 1.25 billion pixels per second, made possible through advancements such as circuit miniaturization and enhanced signal-processing technology. The sensor enables the capture of ultra-high-pixel-count video at a speed of up to five frames per second. Despite the high pixel count, Canon has achieved high-sensitivity, low-noise imaging performance through an architecture developed over many years and adapted for miniaturized pixels. \nVideo footage captured by Canon’s prototype camera outfitted with the approximately 250-megapixel CMOS sensor achieved a level of resolution that was approximately 125 times that of Full HD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) video and approximately 30 times that of 4K UHD (3,840 x 2,160 pixels) video. The amazingly high definition made possible by the sensor lets users crop and magnify video images while maintaining fantastic image quality. Canon is considering the application of this technology in specialized surveillance tools, ultra-high resolution measuring instruments and other industrial equipment, to expand and enhance the field of visual expression. \nAbout Canon U.S.A., Inc. \nCanon U.S.A., Inc., is a leading provider of consumer, business-to-business, and industrial digital imaging solutions to the United States and to Latin America and the Caribbean (excluding Mexico) markets.
