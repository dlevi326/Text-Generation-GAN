Hurst, university president of CTU. “It’s an honor to be recognized by NUTN, a group so dedicated to the advancement of higher education.” \nFor CTU’s MBA program, the university sought to establish a platform to address incoming students with varying knowledge levels. More specifically, CTU needed to implement an alternative to standardized exams, and a solution to increase foundational business knowledge to ensure students were better prepared for their futures. CTU saw the potential to leverage its adaptive learning platform, intellipath™, to address these educational needs. \n“Using intellipath™ in our MBA program allows adult learners to focus on areas they where they need to improve and allows instructors to better provide for their students,” said Dr. Gail Whitaker, CTU university dean, college of business and management. “Incorporating adaptive learning into the program demonstrates CTU’s continued focus and commitment to help students prepare students for a successful journey in their degree program.” \nHow Intellipath™ Works \nCTU’s intellipath™ technology provides an improved learning experience by tailoring students’ course materials and uses student interactions to provide a personalized learning experience. This creates a tailored learning plan giving students extra support where they need it, while quickly moving over areas of existing competency. As a result, students develop and sustain learning that builds a foundation for success both in the classroom and beyond. \n“Dr. Whitaker’s forward thinking and innovative use of intellipath™ has been a benefit for our MBA students who may need additional information prior to starting their program of study,” said Dr. Connie Johnson, CTU provost and chief academic officer. “Our current and future MBA students will continue to benefit from this use of our adaptive learning technology and are encouraged by what they learn in this prerequisite course.” \nCTU accepted the NUTN 2015 Distance Education Innovation Award at the NUTN Network 2015 Conference in Savannah, Georgia. The conference brought together distance and blended learning leaders and innovators, and focuses on trends and issues in the online higher education sector. The three day conference included presentations from college and university presidents, entrepreneurs, accrediting agencies and more. \nCTU’s Top-Tier Online MBA Program \nIn addition to recognition from NUTN, CTU was ranked in 2014 as a top-tier online Master of Business Administration (MBA) program in the world by CEO Magazine. Striving to provide a real-world education and deliver a quality program, CTU designed its MBA program with the assistance of knowledgeable business leaders who understand business today.
