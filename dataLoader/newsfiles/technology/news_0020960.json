The rocket lifted off from a Russian launch facility in Kazakhstan on schedule at 10:37 a.m. (0437GMT) Wednesday. The new three-man crew will arrive at the orbiting outpost on Friday after a two-day flight through space, bringing the number on board to nine for the first time since November 2013. Andreas Mogensen is the first Dane in space. Russia's Sergei Volkov is following in the footsteps of his father, who 24 years ago launched into space with the first astronaut from Kazakhstan. The Kazakh on the current mission, Aidyn Aimbetov, got his seat when British singer Sarah Brightman pulled out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T09:04:54.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
