Bright, and Ann Ferriter, all with the FDA.\nThe agency says that proprietary information is not included. “The information doesn’t contain anything that potentially could be used to identify individuals or reveal confidential commercial information,” according to the post.\nThe agency concedes that there are limits to the data, noting that some query results may be incomplete and that if a manufacturer’s name is listed with different spellings, search results could be fragmented.\n“Moreover, the types of information that FDA has collected has changed over the years, which can make it difficult to look at data over time,” reads the post. “Also, the data may not have enough information to establish cause and effect, incidence, or prevalence.”", "external_links": ["http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2015/09/openfda-makes-medical-device-related-data-easier-to-access-and-use/?source=govdelivery&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery", "https://open.fda.gov/index.html"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T00:07:10.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
