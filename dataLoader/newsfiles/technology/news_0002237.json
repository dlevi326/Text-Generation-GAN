The rebrand reflects both the evolution of the company as well as its vision for the future. Established in 1998, STG was founded by New Hampshire natives and has been based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire since 2010.\n“Smart organizations constantly think about how they reach and connect with their stakeholders, including clients, consultants, vendors, partners, and staff,” said Barbara Cassidy, STG’s President and Chief Operating Officer. “Following a thorough evaluation of how STG shares its value proposition with all audiences, we’ve rebranded to more clearly communicate our broadening products and services offering, new and expanded partnerships, and significant growth.”\nSTG’s evolved brand image highlights the factors that drive the success of the company in today’s marketplace including:\n How STG finds the RightFIT for their clients needs and budgets, Their growing global network of experienced STG-Sourced consultants.\nThe STG logo is the cornerstone of the new STG brand. The three triangles represent the three core pillars that underpin STG’s business: Business, Innovation, and Resources. The logo’s simplicity reflects the order, consolidation, and seamless ‘flow’ STG brings to its customers. STG’s new tagline, \"Aligning Intelligence with Business,\" invites customers to engage with STG to discover greater opportunities for success with insightful IT business solutions.\nSTG’s newly branded dynamic resource strategy, RightFIT, further differentiates the STG experience.\n“We know the best and brightest IT professionals in the industry,” said Bob Dell Isola, STG’s Senior Vice President. “Our thorough and personal talent scouting, vetting, and retention program, RightFIT, sets us apart from our competition.”\nSTG’s rebranding represents its successful and ongoing transition to a company well beyond its contingent workforce heritage. Today the company competes in key growth markets that include Business Process Transformation, Organizational Change Management, Enterprise Applications, IT Strategy, and Program and Project Management services – all focused on applying targeted subject matter expertise to address client business needs.\nWhile the logo, tagline, and website have changed to better represent what the company is today, STG’s value proposition remains the same – their combination of deep technology expertise, global network of “gold standard” IT professionals, and exceptional customer service remains unique, and enables them to develop long-lasting and rewarding customer relationships.\nFor more information, visit STG’s new website at http://www.spencer-thomas.com .
