This can be through graphics, sound and text, most often together. For instance on Windows, you interact with the operating system by using your cursor to click on desktop icons,\" Mr. Chad Lieberman New York began his introduction in a talk about future UIs. The well-known internet marketer and technological wizard delved into the history of the UI, tracing the current UI systems to the introduction of graphics by Apple in 1984 with its Mac OS. In recent times, interactions have extended to touch (smart phones), voice (SIRI) and gestures (MS Kinect), all of which are still in the rudimentary developmental phases. \"These are precursors of future technologies, four of which are given below,\" Mr. Chad Lieberman 6WSEO proceeded to outline four UIs of the future, whose summaries are as follows: 1. Gesture interfaces - the best example of this was portrayed in Minority Report, a sci-fi movie starred by Tom Cruise. He wore special gloves and used gestured to manipulate data sheets, videos and images in his computer. This will be possible now that we have motion sensors like Kinect and PS Move, increasing capabilities of two-dimensional UIs through the introduction of a Z-axis. 2. Brain-computer interfaces - did you know that every thought in the brain generated a unique electrical signal? These interfaces will be able to decipher these electrical impulses and carry out the action they describe, effectively enabling man to think and make things happen. The precursor of this is an EPOC neuron-headset, which can detect brainwaves produced by thoughts. This will however take a while before its perfection from its presently primitive form. 3. Versatile OLED displays - these are the future of the rigid touch screens on our smartphones today. The organic LED display will be able to display light even when stretched or rolled. This, when attached to a pliable plastic substrate, will give a flexible touch screen that can be used on smartphones, allowing more actions and greater sensitivity which will be a welcome break. 4. Augmented reality - this is already here, with apps like Drod i shooting and Wikitude applying primitive forms of the concept. The concept has also seen implementation in the soon-to-come Google's Project Glass, which are eyeglasses that you can use to create virtual extensions of your present reality. You can also use this on other things, not just glasses. In conclusion, Chad Ian Lieber stated that the new technologies would bring exciting capabilities, which are definitely worth looking forward to.
