Since the DB5 debuted in Goldfinger more than 50 years ago, Bond and Aston Martin have gone hand-in-hand. Now the British sports car marque has created a special edition DB9 to celebrate the long-running relationship. \nThe Aston Martin DB9 GT Bond Edition will be made in limited numbers to celebrate the release of the latest Bond film – Spectre – in which 007 will be behind the wheel of a DB10 . \nUnder the hood, the DB9's V12 engine has gained 30 hp (22 kW), bumping its power output up to 540 hp (403 kW). \nThat's enough to shoot it from standstill to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.5 seconds, 0.1 of a second faster than the standard car and (hopefully) fast enough to get owners clear of any international supervillains chasing them. \nJust like a quality spy, the DB9 Bond manages to stay under the radar on the outside. Although it's fitted with GT badging, special Bond Edition badges on the front fenders and sterling silver wings on the Aston Martin badge, only trainspotters will notice the difference between the Bond Edition and standard DB9s . \nInside, all 150 DB9 Bond Editions are fitted with a numbered sill plate, gun barrel embroidery on the divider between the rear seats and a special Bond edition startup sequence on the new DB9's touchscreen infotainment system. \nIncluded in the £165,000 (US$252,438) price of the DB9 Bond is a limited edition Omega Seamaster watch, another tie in with the James Bond franchise. \nOrder books are open for the 150 DB9 GT Bond Editions, all of which will be finished in a special Silver hue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T12:03:27.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
