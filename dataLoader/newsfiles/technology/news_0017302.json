The latter were larger than the better known wooly mammoth and stood as tall as 13 feet at the shoulders and weighed as much as 10 tons. A photo taken by Cornerstone Communities shows a huge mammoth bone being unearthed. \nThe bison fossil , which includes a skull and partial skeleton, will eventually go on display at the San Diego Natural History Museum. \nTom Deméré, curator of paleontology at the museum, said the animals lived during the Pleistocene Epoch or last Ice Age. \n\"It's really an exciting project in terms of the geology and paleontology,\" he said. \"The fossils have the potential to tell us a great deal about the climate, the environment, the ecology of that time.\" \nMeanwhile, grading on the housing project continued, and more fossils could be found. \nConstruction is expected to begin early next year.
