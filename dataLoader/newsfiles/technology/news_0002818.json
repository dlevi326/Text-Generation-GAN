Eventually she got in just about 8AM today and purchased it with an American Express card that was originally blu-tacked to her back.\nMs Kelly was chatting to confused passers-by from her home yesterday while she made Vegemite toast for breakfast. She said she would stay online throughout the day, and night, and make her way to the store this morning to buy the phone.\nLucy Kelly has prime position in the Apple line thanks to her Atomic 212 robot, controlled remotely. AP Photo/Glenn Nicholls She said Atomic 212, the media agency that she works for, had many of the robots around the office and came up with idea to put one out the front of the Apple store last week.\n“I want an updated version of the iPhone but I wasn’t going to wait in the cold and rain to get one,” she laughed. “I want to be the first robot to buy an iPhone.”\nWith the iPhone 6s release today, telcos and Apple stores have been inundated with iPhone fans on their Apple Christmas morning.\nAlready, all models are sold out online from Apple and if you haven’t pre-ordered from a carrier it’s likely you’ll miss out on the most popular models.\nLimited stock was available, with Apple stores and carriers already sold out of several models. There were reports that some stores had as little as 6 iPhones in total to sell from day one that all sold out in minutes.\nVodafone has reported that they’ve shipped around 15,000 of the new iPhones today to customers, with the most popular being the new “Rose Gold” colour in 64GB form.\nInterestingly, telcos have found that both the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have sold in near equal levels - much different to last year when the iPhone 6 heavily outsold the iPhone 6 Plus.\niPhone Despite it raining overnight hundreds have lined up outside Sydney’s Apple Store.\nWith Australia being one of the few launch countries, the majority in the line have come from overseas to buy a device to bring back home.\nMost of them spent the night playing mahjong, like a first world hipster camp fire.\nOriginally published as Incredible lengths to get new iPhone", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0a24d062921134ff16b643ea3037b225", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/07c4e322b16d72e12116bc386a936907", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/869b9f145e116794edec24273786f093?width=366&api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0141987f84dd2aed4c86736a7e4e87bd", "https://instagram.com/p/8B6wstvPUE/embed", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/120a899984c32c29f2c5947e0598a147", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e0accf1e79dd076186c35ecbcfae011c", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/theres-someone-lining-up-at-the-apple-store-with-an-ipad-robot/story-fn6vihic-1227543083018?sv=bb4f9f75b88856941a3fec9974307112", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d7b4dc82ab06294ba8ea6f1346c7600f", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-25T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T12:24:13.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
