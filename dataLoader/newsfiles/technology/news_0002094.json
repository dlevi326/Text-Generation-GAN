In the past, there have been a number of contracts delivering the maintenance works on the network. \"The network outcomes contracts are a new way of doing business.\" \n\"With one contract for the whole area, for all of Southland except the Milford Road (SH94 Te Anau to Milford), the transport agency is expecting savings across the board.\" \nExpected to be awarded next month, the contract is said to be performance-based, and will primarily focus on the delivery of good quality outcomes for the network and all road users. \nDuncan said: \"SouthRoads have been working on the Northern Southland state highway network for the last seven years, undertaking the general maintenance and keeping roads operating safely over winter. \n\"The company has established depots throughout the area and have a good working knowledge of the region.\" \nSouthRoads have collaborated with professional engineering services provider MWH and contracting companies Downer NZ, McDonough Contracting and Carran Scott Contracting to execute the new contract. \nWork under the contract will start on 1 March 2016, and is scheduled to run over the next seven years.
