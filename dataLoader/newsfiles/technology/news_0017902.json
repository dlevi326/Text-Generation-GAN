The project is led by Professor Stuart Bradley of the University’s Department of Physics in partnership with AgResearch and agricultural supplies industry leader Gallagher. \nA project to make electricity supply smarter and more efficient, called Local Demand Control (LDC), receives $2.39 million in funding over four years. This research, led by Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Grant Covic and Emeritus Professor John Boys, focuses on smart technologies that are able to take advantage of renewable energy sources without compromising the integrity of the existing grid. \nOther University of Auckland projects include developing sustainable fish aquaculture foods from seaweed which receives $990,500 over two years. The project is led by School of Biological Sciences Professor Kendall Clements. \nDevelopment of dairy goat milking output for increased production of dairy goat infant formula is led by Professor Russell Snell and Associate Professor Klaus Lehnert from the School of Biological Sciences. The project receives $3.63 million over three years. \nModulating pathogen-host communication to develop new targets for antimicrobials receives $999,346 in funding over two years and is led by Dr Anthony Phillips, also from the School of Biological Sciences. \nA device for assessment of visual function for use with young children is led by Research Fellow Jason Turuwhenua of the Auckland Bioengineering Institute and receives $999,986 over two years. \nA project to mitigate methane emission from livestock receives $836,000 over two years and is let by Research Fellow Verne Lee from the School of Biological Sciences.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T07:49:30.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
