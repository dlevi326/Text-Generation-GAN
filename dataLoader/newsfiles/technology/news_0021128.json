The YOGA Tab 3 Pro features four front-facing powerful JBL® speakers to reproduce high-octane sound, and for the first time ever, a virtualized Dolby Atmos® 1 experience over built-in speakers that creates a sensation of sound moving in all three dimensions around the listener. The tablet comes loaded with a Netflix app to deliver personalized recommendations and content, right from the home screen of the tablet, in high-quality optimized HD. The YOGA Tab 3 Pro also features Dolby Digital Plus, which Netflix streams with its HD content, allowing for crisper dialogue and immersive sound on Netflix.\nAdditionally, the YOGA Tab 3 8” and 10” models are also great for entertainment and tout a new rotating camera with nifty gesture control, perfect for taking photos and videos at nearly any angle. With one of the largest battery capacities around, users can binge watch their favorite shows and stay connected via LTE support. 2\n“Today’s tablet market is largely dominated by general-purpose devices. At Lenovo, we strive to deliver tablets that closely match consumers’ needs to enhance their tablet experience; we know from research that a tablet is a consumption device and most frequently used for watching videos of all sorts. The latest YOGA Tab 3 series represents the epitome of entertainment for users on the go and home alike, realizing a whole new level of visual and auditory experience never before possible on a tablet platform. We are giving them flexibility to access their on-demand content anytime and anywhere, without being tethered to their couch,” said Jeff Meredith, General Manager and Vice President, Tablet Business Unit, Lenovo.\n“We are excited for the fantastic viewing experience Netflix members will have on the YOGA Tab 3 Pro,” said Neil Hunt, Chief Product Officer at Netflix. “Lenovo has raised the bar for watching videos on a tablet, providing 1080p image quality and audio comparable to a home entertainment system through Dolby Digital Plus. We’re also thrilled to have the Netflix widget pre-installed on these tablets so members can quickly and seamlessly start watching their favorite TV shows and movies.”\n“Great sound is essential for any entertainment experience – no matter how audiences are consuming content. With the Lenovo Tab 3 Pro, Dolby and Netflix are able to deliver premium Dolby Audio surround sound with HD video, wherever and whenever fans want,” said John Couling, Senior Vice President E-Media Business Group, Dolby Laboratories. “We are thrilled to continue working with Lenovo and Netflix to bring Dolby Audio enabled superior movie and TV shows to the Android tablet for the first time. Netflix has long been a Dolby supporter and we are proud to continue to bring groundbreaking entertainment experiences to fans everywhere.”\nYOGA Tab 3 Pro: The Ultimate Video Tablet\nThe experience of watching Hollywood blockbusters, playing video games and browsing the Web is vastly improved on the YOGA Tab 3 Pro with its new 70” screen. The tablet flaunts a better optimized projector placement and is now 180-degree rotatable to beam life-sized images onto a wall or ceiling and project significantly brighter and cinematic pictures up to 70” wide. At 299 pixels per inch, the onboard 10.1” QHD (2560×1600) screen is considerably sharper, and renders richer colors with its Smart Display technology.\nTablet users can immerse themselves in a cinematic sound without headphones through its powerful inbuilt JBL sound bar and Dolby Atmos technology – an industry first for tablets. To achieve even greater clarity and a louder output, the sound bar is also fitted with 4 front-facing speakers, which are fine-tuned with Wolfson Master Hi-Fi technology.\nSleek and exquisite, the YOGA Tab 3 Pro is carefully assembled with premium materials such as aluminum and a leather-like fabric back, while maintaining its ultra-slim design. Splash proof and perfectly balanced for an uncompromised holding experience, the tablet truly shines in a sea of lesser tablets, given its versatility and long battery life to deliver all the power a user needs for all day use.\nLoaded with Smart Window 2.0 for enhanced multitasking, 3 users can now do more things, faster. The YOGA Tab 3 Pro allows you to run a background app as well as two windows on top, with the added benefit of phone apps layout to easily fit everything on one screen.
