Chen. In a closely watched fight over whether Uber drivers should be considered employees, Uber's lawyers have argued that its 160,000 drivers in California are too different to be considered a single class. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen has rejected that claim, approving class-action status for the lawsuit proceeding in San Francisco. The status would raise the number of plaintiffs in the Uber trial to 160,000, representing the total number of drivers in California. In the ruling, the class is defined as \"UberBlack, UberX, and UberSUV drivers who have driven for Uber in the state of California at any time since August 16, 2009.\" An Uber spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the company has previously suggested that it will appeal a class-action certification and that it will take the issue to trial. The Silicon Valley Business Journal has more on the topic. \nGet Portland  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:50:57.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
