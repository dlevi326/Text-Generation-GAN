They also need to see where they stand with robotic surgery. Are they performing the right procedures on the right patients? Have they adopted best practices for safety? Should they plan to expand their robotic surgery program in the future?\nECRI Institute, which has nearly 50 years’ experience evaluating the cost, safety, and efficacy of medical devices, announces a new robotic surgery planning service designed to help hospitals and health systems navigate the complexities of robotic surgery.\nAs part of this service, ECRI Institute’s experts work with hospital decision makers to define the clinical, safety, technology, and business requirements of robotic surgery. The service helps hospitals focus on the following critical areas:\nPracticality: Explores the feasibility of implementing a robotic surgery program with evidence-based guidance, surgical caseload assessment, and unbiased purchasing recommendations. Patient safety and quality: Examines whether a hospital is implementing best practices to promote exceptional patient care, quality, safety, and clinical operations. Cost: Offers a nuanced analysis of the cost-effectiveness of procedures and processes, OR time optimization, robotic-specific consumables, and staff efficiency. “We developed this service to help hospitals decide if this costly mode of surgery—which currently has limited clinical evidence and the potential for overuse—is appropriate for their needs,” says Thomas E. Skorup, MBA, FACHE, vice president, applied solutions group, ECRI Institute.\n“Whether hospitals have a robotic surgery program in place or are considering one, we want to help them implement best practices and support their use of informed decision making so their programs are safe and cost effective,” he continues.", "external_links": ["https://www.ecri.org/components/Pages/robotic-surgery-planning.aspx"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T11:44:36.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
