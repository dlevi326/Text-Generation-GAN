The Port of Tilbury in London has recently taken delivery of a new Sennebogen 875 M ‘special’ port material handler. This is the first of this recently released model delivery into the UK.\nMore than 13 million tonnes of goods are handled each year at the Port of Tilbury. All manner of construction materials, bulk goods, paper and wood products as well as a large number of shipping containers are handled by the port every day.  \nDavid Housden – Head of Engineering & Procurement at the Port of Tilbury, said: “ As a group we have been more than happy with both Sennebogen and E H Hassell & Sons, our requirement was for a similar machine to what we already have at Tilbury, but we needed more reach and capacity. \n“We were also very interested in the green hybrid energy recovery system which will save us fuel and therefore money over time. The flexibility of the SENNEBOGEN 875M port material handler, with its high capacity and relatively small travelling dimensions now gives exactly what we needed.”\nIan Hassell, Managing Director of sales and service partner E.H. Hassell & Sons, concluded: \"We have been working closely with Forth Ports since 2008. The decision to add another machine shows that we are on the right path. Our goal is always to give the customer the perfect solution for their specific requirement and application.”\nKeep your eyes peeled for Sennebogen's upcoming Technical Paper, which will be published in PTI's next journal: The Mega-Ports Edition\nFor all the latest on Sennebogen, click here \nWatch a video interview of Sennebogen at TOC Europe 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:39:38.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
