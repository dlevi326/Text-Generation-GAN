Louie Douvis Share on twitter by David Ramli Former Telstra chief executive David Thodey says the latest $15 billion blowout on the national broadband network should its last, and that the $56 billion project cost could fall as construction continues.\nMr Thodey has unique insight into the project having led Telstra for five years before leaving the telecommunications giant earlier this month. He was instrumental in negotiating an $11.2 billion deal to hand its assets over to NBN, which will form the basis of the national broadband network.\nLast week NBN revealed it would be forced to increase the project's total construction cost from $41 billion to up to $56 billion, partly because new data showed earlier estimates were too low.\nNailing down the final cost for building the NBN is vital because the federal government has said it will not provide any more than $29.5 billion. This means any further increases will need to come from more expensive private sector sources such as bond raisings, bank debts and other borrowings.\nNBN CEO Bill Morrow said he could not rule out a further increase in costs but said this was unlikely because the company had a solid understanding of the technologies and systems involved. Edwina Pickles Mr Thodey told Fairfax Media it was not unusual to get increases in costs during large technology projects and that the NBN had many variables.\n\"As Bill Morrow said it's very hard with these very large projects to get all the details right,\" he said. \"There may be a bit of an upswing [in costs] at the moment but they may be able to pull out some technology that might reduce the costs.\n\"So I'm not surprised that within the total project … you're talking about maybe 20 per cent swing or something like that.\"\nNo further blowouts NBN Co director Simon Hackett said the increase in project costs was less a blowout, and more a reflection of NBN now having accurate forecasts. David Mariuz But he also said the company should now have a firm understanding of its costs and that there should not be any further blowouts.\n\"There are always unknowns in technology, but I think they've got a pretty good feel for it now,\" he said. \"I'd be surprised to see it go up and I would hope to see them bring it down. But I'm not close to the numbers to be able to give a detailed comment.\"\nNBN chief executive Bill Morrow said he could not rule out a further increase in costs but said this was unlikely because the company had a solid understanding of the technologies and systems involved.\n\"You can never say that and that's why we put the range out there,\" he said. \"Do we feel at this point in time that we're confident the peak funding will stay within that range? The answer is absolutely yes.\n\"But there are so many uncertainties about a project this size you can only give an estimate on where you're going to be.\"\nNot 'blowout', just realistic NBN director Simon Hackett also disputed the increase in project costs was a blowout and said the company was just the messenger for bad news.\n\"It's not that the costs have blown out; it's that we finally have accuracy about what it really costs to build a network this big – we're no longer building networks based on costs on the back of an envelope,\" he said. \"NBN as an organisation is the messenger here for this cost and [it's] undertaken incredible work in the last year to really work out what it costs to build this thing.\n\"Everything before that was necessarily a different form of estimation.\"\nOvum research director David Kennedy, who has authored detailed reports into the project on behalf of the company, said he, too, was not surprised NBN was forced to increase its cost estimates.\n\"I've always believed the final costs would be higher than the estimates that were around 12 months ago,\" he said. \"Looking at the moving benchmarks from rollouts around the world in the various technologies, it became apparent the cost per premises Quote: d by NBN Co were too low.\n\"So it was inevitable and it's better that it gets brought to light earlier [and] I think the sort of range they're talking about now is right.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-08-31T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:27:38.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
