The pack provides additional assistance for those specifically taking driving holidays such as the costs of emergency car hire cover should their own vehicle break down, cover for shopping, driving licences and any camping equipment they may take with them.\nThe RAC contract follows a competitive tender process. Under the terms and conditions of the contract and in addition to providing the insurance package, Hood Group has created a dedicated team to drive digital marketing of the RAC travel insurance product and provide further advisory services to help drive sales.\nRAC insurance director Mark Godfrey said: “In refreshing our travel insurance offering we saw an opportunity to make things simpler for our customers as we know there are a huge number of different policies available on the market, offering wildly varying levels of cover. That’s why we now offer three straightforward standard cover levels – orange, silver and black – to give anyone travelling complete peace of mind. Our standard policies, all underwritten by AXA, are supplemented by a wide range of optional add-ons, which allow people to quickly and affordably customise their policies. Our members are also well catered for with a complimentary Driving Holiday Pack offered to anyone already holding RAC cover.”\nCEO for Hood Group, Simon Hood comments: “We are delighted to have the opportunity to work with one of the UK’s most prestigious motoring organisations to reinvigorate its travel insurance proposition. RAC wanted to refresh the benefits available to its customers and make it easier for them to buy cover. We have created a quality product at competitive prices that remains true to RAC’s brand values while developing a quick and easy customer journey, both on and offline.”\nHe continues: “We are focused on delivering sustainable, profitable books of business for our affinity partners. We do this by building bespoke insurance products and services, delivering marketing programmes that drive sales and selecting the right partners to work with to create solutions tailored entirely to meeting the specific needs of individual brands.”\nTo ensure the highest level of customer service extends to overseas emergency assistance and claims, Hood Group has appointed Rightpath Claims to provide these critical services for the duration of the agreement with RAC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:14:19.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
