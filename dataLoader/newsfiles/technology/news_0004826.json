Victoria is the only state where the use of credit has risen.\nQueenslanders are spending more across the board -- except for the use of credit. Spending on utilities is significant.\nAlthough Queenslanders are spending more, Queensland was the only state where anxiety rose.\nIn Western Australia, there has been a big shift away from spending on children.\nSpending in Tasmania is volatile, with consumers favouring travel, charity and personal goods. Tasmania is the least anxious state.\nBut in South Australia and the Northern Territory, there were cuts across the board, especially in savings, superannuation and investments, home improvements, travel and the use of credit.\nAlthough concerns over the cost of living fell, it is still the biggest cause of consumer stress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T05:36:48.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
