Investors were not impressed, and the stock fell. Bobbi Rebell reports.   \nApple wants you to spend a lot more time looking at screens. They were everywhere at the company's big special event in San Francisco. New iPhones, a bigger iPad, the iPad Pro, and new features on its watches. And the biggest screen of them all: Apple TV. Manhattan Venture Partners Max Wolff: SOUNDBITE: MAX WOLFF, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MANHATTAN VENTURE PARTNERS (ENGLISH) SAYING: \"I think, the TV was the buried lead here. I think, the idea of having a new, more Apple-like TV experience is going to be interesting. It launches them into the living room, where they, kind of, had been frozen out in any major way, and it pushes an app store approach to consuming TV. And it pushes a kind of Apple universe there. That's a big deal.\" It starts at $149 and has an app store and a voice controlled remote control, and Siri. Apple's newest phones feature 3D touch interface and other upgrades. Phones drive nearly two-thirds of Apples revenue, and have been a source of concern as China's economy has suffered. But the upgrade impressed Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy: SOUNDBITE: PATRICK MOORHEAD, PRESIDENT, MOOR INSIGHTS AND STRATEGY (ENGLISH) SAYING: \"I, actually, believe that this is going to show those doubters that they are going to keep on a roll in China. They didn't have to make as big changes as they did. But they did do it. I don't think they are showing any mercy to Samsung either, who I think is going to be the biggest loser in here. \" Apple also unveiled a larger iPad aimed at businesses, along with a keyboard and Apple Pencil.  //www.reuters.com}/assets/iframe/yovideo?videoId=365551095\"></iframe> http://reut.rs/1LY8Rth", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T07:14:36.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
