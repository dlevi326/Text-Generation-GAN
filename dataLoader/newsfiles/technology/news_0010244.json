Led by cloud, big data, and an expanding social universe – highly agile data centers are now the foundation upon which new revenue, cost efficiencies and great customer service are built. But enterprises must act quickly and align their infrastructures to capitalize on this emerging opportunity. What’s required is a new breed of Managed Service Provider (MSP) – a specialty partner with the technology and track-record to help embrace the journey toward a hybrid infrastructure. The new agile MSP is your “IT Wingman.”Companies realize this transformation must happen quickly to remain competitive, but they need help: With know-how, strategy development, and just getting started. A dedicated, agile MSP fully supports these requirements – with a strong platform and expertise capable of optimizing current business, while injecting the necessary flexibility to keep pace with innovation and any direction the business may take. Big IT projects promise big rewards, but only if their complexity is effectively managed. It’s not unlike a challenging home improvement project. Multiple tasks require a range of expertise – from carpenters and plumbers to electricians and flooring specialists. While a home project might seem straightforward, tasks like building a new deck require more expertise than might be obvious.For example, carpenters do the woodworking, but the ground must be leveled and concrete anchors poured. In a big project, few tasks are as simple as they seem -- and it takes a team to accomplish these goals. It’s unlikely a homeowner would know all the best carpenters, plumbers, and electricians in their region. That’s why the general contractor’s role is so important – delivering a portfolio of qualified people and expertise to the project.The same dynamic applies to businesses undergoing a digital transformation, as agile MSPs offer a portfolio of services and expertise to the larger project. Similar to a general contractor, these MSPs provide ways to reduce the complexity associated with a digital transformation. This partner can play a leading or supporting role depending on the situation. Agile MSPs assist with the “plumbing” or basics of keeping the traditional IT function operating, while augmenting internal capabilities to build new business strategy and bringing new, flexible platforms and methods to accelerate delivery.In a recent IDG Research report commissioned by CenturyLink , more than half of IT managers surveyed said they expect to use multiple MSPs within the next two years; and a whopping 85 percent are at least somewhat likely to use MSPs. Much of this work will lay the groundwork for new strategic initiatives.Survey respondents highlighted several points when evaluating MSPs. The top criterion involved expertise in both public and private cloud technology , as well as application management . These points of emphasis may reflect both strategic and tactical sentiments: 1. Companies are urged to invest maximum resources into the cloud over time; and 2. IT staff wants to be removed from the exacting nature of managing applications like Oracle or SAP, which have daily maintenance requirements and need administrative focus in managing the license.IT managers also have high-level, yet practical, concerns in evaluating MSPs. Everyone wants to secure the environment from ever-increasing threats of hacking and data theft. The escalation in this arms race is putting the prospect of self-maintaining a security strategy beyond the reach of even the largest enterprises.Managers also recognize their environments are moving towards Hybrid IT architectures, if they aren’t already there. Hybrid IT extends beyond the four walls of an organization, as resources can be positioned wherever it makes the most sense -- in your own data center, or with a partner. You don’t even need to own every box. As many IT managers are new to this approach, each wants to work with a partner who has the ability to provide and manage these environments.These concerns surrounding security and Hybrid IT experience are stressed in IDG’s research: Speaking to a larger dynamic of risk-sharing that impact the search for a partner. Turning to agile MSPs, you’re able to share the risk of building, managing and evolving IT strategies in a rapidly changing world. And once it’s acknowledged a partner will share the risk, it’s time to explore other evaluation criteria.How easy is this partner to work with? Pricing is certainly a component, but that’s just a start: How are services billed, and can certain costs be spread over several months? Dollars aren’t the only consideration. At CenturyLink, we team with many large enterprises, but also partner with rural education or healthcare networks and want to ensure everyone in the network understands the bill. We have also started projects before contracts were finalized, because the customer had a tight window of deployment. Your partner MUST to be part of your team, and flexibility is key.In choosing teammates to share the risk, you also need to evaluate the people. Are they truly willing to commit to your team, and available at any time? CenturyLink customers regularly compliment members of their team for “going the extra mile.” Human capital still matters in a Hybrid IT architecture.When choosing a general contractor, expectations must be set high -- because you must live with the results. The same can be said when choosing an MSP. Your digital transformation is far too important to place in the hands of an unreliable partner. Ready for CenturyLink to be your IT wingman?
