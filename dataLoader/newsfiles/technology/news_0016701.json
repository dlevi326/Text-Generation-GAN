In Canberra, demand has grown to its highest level this decade on new projects in the public and private sectors.\nMr Acheson said the data ­analytics trend among major ­retailers, telecommunications companies and utilities was fuelling demand for data scientists.\n“A number of organisations in those industries are all hiring reasonably large numbers — 40 and 50 data scientists to help do much better analysis of customer data with the objective to better predict what customers will want to buy in the future and to better package offers to customers,’’ he said.\nThe survey indicates SMEs are hiring ICT skills in larger numbers. New hires increasingly sit in the broader business sector rather than traditional IT departments.\n“In both Sydney and Melbourne, the small and medium enterprise markets are strong in terms of their IT hiring,’’ Mr Acheson said. “It’s certainly good double-digit growth.’’\nHe said there would be no major increases in salaries or rates apart from specialised skill sets around digital transformation. “I think that IT as a category of employment will withstand the (economic) turbulence because the core benefits of these digital transformation projects are so compelling; they have got a very good ROI, they are either reducing cost, improving ­efficiency or driving improved revenue,’’ he said.\nAmbition technology division managing director Andrew Cross said contracting growth was up by close to 10 per cent.\n“The focus that we are seeing is still on contract labour resources,’’ Mr Cross said.\n“From a digital perspective, anything and everything is in demand with iOS developers, Android developers. The two predominate skill sets.’’\nThe E.L. Consult Executive Demand Index, released this month, shows demand for Australian executives increasing a further four per cent in August due to a boost in jobs for management and IT executives.\nIT, with a 14 per cent rise in the number of jobs on offer, was a standout performer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T09:54:56.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
