Despite upbeat US economic data, consumer inflation remains below 2%, rekindling deflationary concerns which had been worsened by China’s recent devaluation of the yuan.\nThis is likely to hit emerging markets more severely when the Fed eventually hikes rates.\nThe Dow was 1.11% lower at the JSE’s close with European markets dragged down by the firmer euro, which gained ground against the dollar following the Fed’s decision.

The share has been heavily punished on debt concerns following its recent rights issue announcement.\nSasol was hit negatively by a combination of the stronger rand and lower oil prices, closing 3.25% off at R413.60.\nSABMiller took a breather after its earlier run, closing 0.73% lower at R748.59 as the market awaits AB InBev’s takeover proposal next week.\nIndustrial conglomerate Remgro shed 1.75% to R248.46 following the release of results on Thursday indicating headline earnings per share rose by 20.3% in the year ended June.\nAmong gold stocks Harmony soared 7.87% to R12.20.\nPlatinum producer Lonmin’s woes continue, with the group’s shares shedding a further 2.39% to a low of R4.50.\nAmong banks FirstRand dropped 0.68% to R52.59.\nOld Mutual ended the day 2.93% lower at R39.76.\nAmong property stocks New Europe Investments lifted 2.06% to R138.80.\nMondi closed 3.16% lower at R285.91.
