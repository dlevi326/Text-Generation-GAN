He said revenues for that part of its business grew 19 per cent to $74 milllion during the quarter. \nThe company also anticipates returning to profitability in the fiscal fourth quarter, it said. \nAnalysts had set the bar low for the second quarter report. \nThe Waterloo, Ont.-based company has issued widespread layoff notices to its workforce this summer. \nOver the past few weeks, those reductions have centred on deep cuts to its hardware development and manufacturing business as it puts a lower priority on smartphone development, according to two sources who were familiar with the cuts. \nSome of those employees have been told they will lose their jobs in November, one of the sources close to the matter said. \nThe sources both say hundreds of additional jobs have been quietly shed over the summer, affecting offices in Ottawa and BlackBerry headquarters in Waterloo, in particular. More recent cuts have also impacted BlackBerry manufacturing facilities in Cambridge, Ont. \nThe company, which confirmed some job reductions earlier this summer but refused to disclose numbers, declined late Thursday to say how many jobs were part of more recent cuts. \nBlackBerry said it had 6,225 full-time global employees as of Feb. 28, its most recent filing with regulators, but though those employee numbers are likely much lower after various other waves of cuts throughout its international operations this year.
