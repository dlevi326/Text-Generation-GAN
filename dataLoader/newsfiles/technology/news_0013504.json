They have to move around a lot in order to earn their bread, meet their loved ones or even to enjoy themselves. So they come across situations when they want to know the correct path to reach their destination. Of course, there is Google Maps, but what if you had a navigation device that told you about the right path by shifting its shape? Introducing “Animotus” developed by Yale engineer Adam Spiers: a wirelessly connected, 3-D printed cube that acts like a hectic compass. This device in order to point in a particular direction uses the top half of the cube. When it wants to point in a direction, the top half of the cube twists around towards their next destination and then slides forward to give a relative indication of the distance to get there. Thus, instead of repeatedly looking at the device one could actually find their way by just touching the device. Spiers had designed this device when he was involved in an interactive play based on Edwin A. Abbott’s 1884 story, Flatland. As part of the production, audience members – both sighted and visually impaired – were kept in complete darkness and walked four at a time though the performance space with narrative voice-overs and sound effects telling the story as they wandered through. In their hands, each participant held an Animotus that guided them by changing shape to point them in the right direction. With a multi-sectioned body created in a 3D printer, that Animotus alters shape in response to wireless instructions to indicate the user’s position in their environment. There were many trial and errors to get this device right, as there are almost negligible studies on the subject of shape-shifting navigation systems. Spiers has a strong belief that this navigation device, Animotus can find great use in the world outside the theatre, especially as a silent guide for walkers and trekkers which would enable them to enjoy the environment around them without bugging them with vibrations and sounds. Spiers says: “The simple idea is that when you’ve arrived at your target destination, it becomes a little cube again.” Hope this idea clicks as simplicity always does!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T08:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T04:00:39.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
