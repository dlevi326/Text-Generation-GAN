Looking at a will is like pulling a thread on family history.\n“What you find in probate records and wills are the rich stories about what mattered enough to pass down and a wealth of information about family history,” said Jennifer Utley , senior manager of research at Ancestry.com’s Utah headquarters.\n“They paint a more beautiful picture of people’s lives.”\nAmerican elementary school students learn about Revere’s 1775 ride to warn about British troop movements, and his career as a master metal worker, but his will reveals some interesting facts — not just about his relationship with his daughter, but about his relationships with his grandchildren, Utley said. They all got $500 in his will, except for one, “who shall have no part of my estate” except for $1, the will says. Exactly what that grandchild did to deserve his famous grandfather’s snub isn’t explained, Utley said, but the will offers clues into Revere’s thinking.\n“These are details you just cannot find anywhere else,” she said.\nThe information has for centuries been held in basements and storage areas in courthouses across the country. Ancestry.com’s three-year digitization project brings it all together in one place for the first time.\n“This is an extraordinary resource for all researchers,” said Laura Lovett , an associate professor of U.S. history at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who specializes in the history of women, childhood and the family, and is an Ancestry.com subscriber.\n“A will allows us to really look at their daily life: What did they possess? What did they value? What’s important enough to write down?” she said. “They let us understand the material life across the centuries. It allows us to tell history from the bottom up.”\nIn some cases, a will may be the only written evidence that someone even existed, Lovett said.\nPeople researching family history often look to marriage certificates, birth certificates and census information, said Ruy Cardoso , a Massachusetts genealogist. But those records aren’t as detailed as wills and haven’t been kept for as long.\n“Wills can give a lot more insight into their lives and thoughts as well as the times and places where they lived,” he said. “They contain the language of the day, weird bits of terminology, words we don’t use today.”\n“People are going to get lost in this collection,” Ancestry.com’s Utley said.", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-04T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T11:26:11.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
