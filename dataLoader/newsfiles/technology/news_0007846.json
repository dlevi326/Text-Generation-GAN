Localz is hoping that the SmartCamp win opens similar doors in Australia.\nLocalz was one of five Australian start-ups invited by IBM to participate in this year’s SmartCamp — a global competition that brings together entrepreneurs, investors, industry experts and experienced mentors. Previous winners include Temando, an intelligent fulfilment platform and shipping software that went on to secure a $50 million investment by manufacturing company Neopost.\nMicro-location technology enables an organisation to digitally connect with people via their smartphone, based on their position next to someone or something in the real world. Examples of micro-location technology include Apple’s iBeacons, Geofences, WiFi, GPS, QR codes and NFC. The initial use of beacon technology has focused on the delivery of marketing and offers to consumers, making it attractive to retailers.\nHowever, Localz’s software service exploits all available micro-location technologies, opening the door to a broader range of use-cases such as tracking pallets of goods for logistics firms, frictionless payments while the phone remains in the customer’s pocket, instant check-in at hotels and behaviour analysis to gauge movement of patrons around a venue or to automatically generate a boarding pass on to a passenger’s phone.\n“Companies don’t have the decision engines to make the content truly relevant to a customer,” said Localz business development director Jason Were. “Our solution can use GPS to know that a customer is 10 minutes away from a retailer, en-route to collect their online order, the organisation can have people doing other valuable activities until they receive the alert that the customer is nearby, which improves customer experiences and offers back-of-house operational efficiencies.\nLocalz has set its sights on the retail, logistics and financial service industries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:21:58.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
