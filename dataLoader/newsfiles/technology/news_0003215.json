The new S Series Heathered collection comes in 4 color ways, purple, orange, white and yellow, each inspired by heathered pattern sportswear. Each timepiece features the interwoven speckled pattern of a sporty heathered top or pant.

This is the brand's second season working with Charles Harbison, who took the this season's runway placement to the next level with custom lucite halos that encase the white S Series Heathered watches created just for his show. \n\"S Series feels like a very natural pairing for HARBISON,\" says Creative Director Charles Harbison. \"Our girl is feminine with a masculine edge, and she's not afraid to pair a cocktail dress with a sporty watch.\" \n\"Following the success of our first season working with Charles Harbison, we are happy to introduce the Heathered collection at his SS16 NYFW presentation, with the addition of custom HARBISON halos,\" said David Johnson, Vice President of Timepiece Division Casio North America. \"The Heathered collection is geared toward the fashion forward female that is looking for an accessory that makes a personal statement, similar to the consumer of the HARBISON brand.\" \nThe S Series line uplifts the G-SHOCK brand into the contemporary fashion space for the female consumer who loves G-SHOCK watches, but feels they may be too large for her wrist. G-SHOCK continues to offer brilliant technical innovations through S-Series but now extends itself into presenting watches as a sporty fashion accessory. \nCasio will release the S-Series Heathered watches globally to retail this October and the new collection will embrace all the features usually associated with G-SHOCK. They are all equipped with an auto LED light with afterglow, 5 daily alarms, an hourly time signal, 1/1000 second stopwatch, countdown timer, 48-city world time with 29 time zones and are shock resistant, magnetic resistant and water resistant to 200M. \nThe S Series collections are available at Nordstroms, Macy's, select department stores and fashion boutiques, as well as G-SHOCK Soho NYC store , and online at www.gshock.com/s_series . Price point is $160.00. \nAbout G-SHOCK CASIO's shock-resistant G-SHOCK watch is synonymous with toughness, born from the developer Mr. Ibe's dream of 'creating a watch that never breaks'. Over 200 handmade samples were created and tested to destruction until finally in 1983 the first, now iconic G-SHOCK hit the streets of Japan and began to establish itself as 'the toughest watch of all time'. Each watch encompasses the 7 elements; electric shock resistance, gravity resistance, low temperature resistance, vibration resistance, water resistance, shock resistance and toughness. The watch is packed with Casio innovations and technologies to prevent it from suffering direct shock; this includes internal components protected with urethane and suspended timekeeping modules inside the watch structure. Since its launch, G-SHOCK has continued to evolve, continuing to support on Mr. Ibe's mantra \"never, never give up\". \nAbout Casio America, Inc.
