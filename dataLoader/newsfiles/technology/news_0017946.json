Users can avail of a six-month package for Rs 999 while full year subscription is priced at Rs 1,799. \nThis is considerably lower than the US subscription rate, which starts at $9.99 or approximately Rs 660 per month. \nIndia is the first Asian country where ‘Kindle Unlimited’ is being launched. It is already available in the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Mexico, and Canada. \nThe Unlimited catalogue allows Amazon to compete more effectively with Flipkart, which operates India’s largest platform for books. A report by BMS Index recently suggested that Flipkart is the world’s second largest book seller, ranking ahead of global players such as Barnes and Noble, FNAC, Waterstones and The Book Depository. \nAmazon was one of the first companies to launch an e-reader in India when it introduced the Kindle three years back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T11:24:23.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
