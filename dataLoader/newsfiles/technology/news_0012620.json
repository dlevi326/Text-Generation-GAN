As reported by Marcus Miller in a recent Search Engine Land post , Google has reduced the number of local search listings shown in the so-called Local Stack. Local search listings are the lifeblood of many businesses, which rely on mobile search in particular for traffic and custom. Google has now limited the number of Local Stack results to three. The reduction applies across all platforms. With the display of fewer results, businesses suffer from lowered search visibility and a reduced opportunity to appear in one of the most prominent search result positions.\n\"We've seen many business doing well out of the local stack, but since Google's user interface changes, the opportunities to appear in that segment of the search results has been limited,\" commented ASEOHosting’s Vice President of Customer Relations, Daniel Page, \"Of course, businesses should continue to list themselves on Google My Business and make every effort to appear in the Local Stack, but that should be complemented by investment in content and local SEO efforts that focus on improving organic search rankings.\"\nBusinesses that have limited their search engine optimization efforts to the Local Stack are likely to be hardest hit, which is why AHosting's local search optimization experts have advised site owners to adopt a comprehensive approach to local search that includes traditional local SEO techniques like entries in Google My Business, directory citations, and reviews, alongside strategies such content creation to enhance organic search positions and paid search advertising.\nAHosting advises that a comprehensive local SEO strategy is more robust in the face of unpredictable changes to search algorithms and the evolution of user interfaces.\n###\nAbout ASEOHosting:\nASEOHosting is the leader in providing all types of SEO Hosting, including Shared SEO Hosting, Dedicated SEO Hosting, US Dedicated SEO Servers, and EU Dedicated SEO Servers, based in Orlando, FL, and Detroit, MI, owned and operated by Ahosting, Inc., supplying hosting services that are truly beyond imagination.
