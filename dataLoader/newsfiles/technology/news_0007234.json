With this added platform support, customers will have faster application delivery, better visibility across all environments, and stronger security, including process-based enforcement, anywhere applications are deployed. This capability will be demonstrated at the AWS re:Invent conference, October 6-9. \nThe software-based Illumio ASP provides a continuous delivery security system for IT organizations. It enables one security architecture that works across data centers, and the private and public cloud without any dependencies on the network or hypervisor. Illumio ASP visualizes all applications and their communications, enabling visibility into real-time policy violations or security incidents; programs the ideal security policy, and manages enforcement across applications. With Illumio ASP, IT Security and DevOps teams can reduce the attack surface within their data centers and cloud by over 99 percent. \nSupporting Quotes: \n\"Docker and Mesosphere are giving organizations new abilities to more rapidly deploy applications and operate applications in micro-services architectures,\" said PJ Kirner, CTO, Illumio. \"With Illumio, security is no longer handcuffed to the network or hypervisor; it is free to move with any type of workloads anywhere they reside -- inside containers, bare metal or VMs -- to continuously keep the data center and cloud secure. By enabling continuous security at DevOps speed, organizations can have both fine-grained controls of their computing and security.\" \n\"Mesosphere is redefining how successful businesses run their applications and services at scale across on-premises, cloud and hybrid compute environments,\" said Florian Leibert, CEO and Co-Founder, Mesosphere. \"The Mesosphere Datacenter Operating System can scale to tens of thousands of compute nodes, running hundreds of thousands of containers. In this environment Illumio's adaptive and rapid scaling approach to security perfectly aligns with the continuous delivery model for applications we're seeing. We're very excited about the benefits our ongoing partnership will bring to our joint customers.\" \nAbout Illumio Illumio delivers adaptive security for every computing environment, protecting the 80 percent of data center and cloud traffic missed by the perimeter. The company's Adaptive Security Platform visualizes application traffic and delivers continuous, scalable and dynamic policy and enforcement to every bare-metal server, VM and container in data centers and public clouds. Using Illumio, enterprises such as Morgan Stanley, Plantronics, NTT and Creative Artists Agency have achieved secure application and cloud migration, environmental segmentation, high value application protection from breaches and threats and compliance with no changes to applications or infrastructure.
