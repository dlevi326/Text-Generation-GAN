Atlassian has hired Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley to work on the offering.\nA spokesman for Sydney-headquartered Atlassian declined to comment yesterday.\nWhile the company is based in Sydney, it has a large Silicon ­Valley presence, and is unique among software firms for funding its growth by being profitable.\n“It’s an amazing validation of what the guys at Atlassian (Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes) have achieved,” said Sam Chandler, a technology entrepreneur and founder of document management service Nitro. According to Mr Chandler, rather than try their luck on the Australian Securities Exchange, Atlassian would be far better served by securing an entry into Wall Street or the tech-focused exchange Nasdaq.\nThe major benefit, according to Mr Chandler, is the presence of a sophisticated analyst community that can provide the appropriate evaluation and guidance to the market on what has made ­Atlassian so successful since its ­inception.\nAtlassian builds software to help IT departments, computer programmers and other professionals work together online.\nMr Farquhar said in an interview in April last year that the company’s sales had risen an ­average of 40 per cent annually over a five-year period.\nThe Australian duo have run the business and relied entirely on its profits to fund expansion, an unusual feat in an era when most tech start-ups raise hundreds of millions of dollars from venture capitalists before they make profits or even think about an initial public offering.\n“If Atlassian listed on the ASX, it would be the only pure software company listed on the market, while in the US it would be one of many such companies. There’s a level of maturity there that’s very important,” Mr Chandler said.\n“One of the problems with the ASX is that all technology businesses get bundled into one. We have had some successes but they are either online marketplaces or IT-managed services.”\nMr Chandler added that a lack of specialisation within the analyst community, coupled by the relatively limited knowledge of the investor community about a niche business like Atlassian rules the ASX out as a viable stop.\nLatest ASIC filings show Atlassian generated revenue of $215 million in financial 2014, up from $148.5m a year earlier. The business returned an operating profit of $21m in 2014, up from $13.1m. The net profit of $2.8m in 2014 was affected by financing costs.\nAtlassian welcomed a $US60m minority investment from US-based venture capital firm Accel Partners in 2010 and said at the time that it was hoping to publicly list in the US.\nIt has since then successfully moved its domicile to Britain in 2014, in what has widely seen as a precursor to a potential IPO.\nIn 2014, US-backers T. Rowe Price and Dragoneer Investment Capital made an additional investment, valuing the company at $US3bn. Just a handful of US tech firms valued at more than $US1bn privately have gone public this year. Many companies are avoiding the hassles and scrutiny of going public while ample capital is available from mutual funds, hedge funds and banks. That, plus poor performance of some deals, has sparked concern that the IPO market might not be able to accommodate the volume of deals needed to facilitate exits from those start-ups. Stockmarket investors will be watching Atlassian’s offering to see whether the IPO market still has life in it.\nAdditional reporting: Dow Jones Newswires", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T03:54:01.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
