The business sells a fully branded line of Essential Oils. Both the blends as well as the brand they sell under are proprietary. For the right buyer, this business could be purchased for as little as 10% down via an SBA transaction using our network of lending and deal prep experts. The company was launched in 2014 and is achieving massive sales and high levels of growth. The company is averaging growth of 40% month over month, and that growth is continuing in 2015. Although the company does own and operate its own eCommerce storefront via its branded website, the current sales driver is Amazon.com, where 99% of sales are currently derived. The company is achieving BEST SELLER status on at least one of its SKUs and has 4.5-5 STAR ratings on virtually every product available on Amazon.com. The company is also 5 STAR rated with over 700 ratings. All products are fulfilled by Amazon, making them available for Amazon's Prime membership, fast-ship placement. The company has a number of scale opportunities that haven't been touched, including the development of an SEM campaign for the branded website, adding SKUs to the product line, adding wholesale as a channel of trade, and beginning to sell outside the US, including in Europe, where Essential Oils have the highest demand in the world. This is an amazing opportunity for a Private Equity Group, Investor or Enterprise to either expand their line of proprietary brands in a highly niche sector, or to get in on the ground floor of a rapid-growth Internet Company that is just scratching the surface of where it can go.
