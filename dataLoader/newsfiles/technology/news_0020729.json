By doing so, we achieve what for a single experiment, would have meant running for at least 2 more years,” said Heuer.\nThere are different ways to produce a Higgs boson, and different ways for a Higgs boson to decay to other particles.\nFor example, according to the Standard Model, the theory that describes best forces and particles, when a Higgs boson is produced, it should decay immediately in about 58 per cent of cases into a bottom quark and a bottom antiquark.\nBy combining their results, ATLAS and CMS determined with the best precision to date the rates of the most common decays.\nSuch precision measurements of decay rates are crucially important as they are directly linked to the strength of the interaction of the Higgs particle with other elementary particles, as well as to their masses, CERN said.\nTherefore, the study of its decays is essential in determining the nature of the discovered boson.\nAny deviation in the measured rates compared to those predicted by the Standard Model would bring into question the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism and possibly open the door to new physics beyond the Standard Model.\n“This is a big step forward, both for the mechanics of the combinations and in our measurement precision,” said ATLAS Spokesperson Dave Charlton.\n“With such a result and the flow of new data at the new energy level at the LHC, we are in a good position to look at the Higgs boson from every possible angle,” said CMS Spokesperson Tiziano Camporesi.\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 9:35 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:56:17.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
