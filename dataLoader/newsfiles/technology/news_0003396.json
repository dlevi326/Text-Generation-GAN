(Photo: File photo)\n18 CONNECT 42 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Microsoft lawyers argued in court Wednesday that a U.S. search warrant can't be used to force tech companies to turn over emails stored on servers outside of the United States.\nThe case was heard in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City.\nMicrosoft is appealing a ruling against it in 2014, when U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ruled the company has to hand over email stored on its servers in Dublin to comply with a U.S. warrant in a narcotics case.\nMicrosoft and other tech companies say that email stored on computer servers overseas can't be obtained through warrants because warrants don't reach outside of the United States.\nThe case is part of an ongoing battle in the tech world over who has jurisdiction over users' data, at a time when it can be stored anywhere in the world.\nPreska said in 2014 that because the servers are run by Microsoft, a U.S. company, where they are located doesn't matter.\nMicrosoft’s argument is about jurisdiction and sovereignty, said Faiza Patel, a law professor and expert on surveillance at the New York University’s Law School in New York City.\nCourts are struggling to decide whether data located in another country is like a physical object within that country’s domain, where its laws — and not those of the United States — apply, she said.\nA secondary question is over business records. The U.S. Department of Justice has clear legal right to request a U.S.-based company’s business records using a subpoena, said Patel.\nMicrosoft says \"business records\" include what’s known as subscriber information — information about the account itself, such as name of the account holder, the date it was created, and the email address and billing information. It’s already given Justice the subscriber information which was stored in the U.S., said Patel.\nJustice is arguing that \"business records\" include not just the subscriber information, but also the content of the emails.\nMicrosoft says the contents of the emails stored in Ireland don’t belong to it and Justice can’t ask it to hand them over, said Patel.\nThe case is part of a broad push by the tech industry to get lawmakers to update laws that govern data stored in the cloud.\nThe difficulty is how laws passed \"before email, instant messaging and social media should now be applied in a digital world where communications and technologies continue to evolve,\" said Craig Newman, a data privacy lawyer and expert with the law firm of Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler, who attended the hearing.\nIf American companies can't protect customer privacy for information stored elsewhere, the concern is that foreign companies that can make a privacy promise and stay outside the jurisdiction of U.S. law enforcement could take business away from them.\n18 CONNECT 42 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1EVq1bq TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EVq1bq&text=Microsoft%20argues%20email%20stored%20in%20Ireland%20not%20subject%20to%20search%20warrant&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/08/USATODAY/usatsports/ap_microsoft_mover_70369726.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1EVq1bq", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/adfec0678da49bb96878f0cae11af19a9e2078f0/c=128-0-896-576&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/08/USATODAY/usatsports/ap_microsoft_mover_70369726.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EVq1bq&mini=true"], "published": "2015-09-09T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T14:34:25.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
