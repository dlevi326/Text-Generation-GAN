You may use Ctrl-P in most applications to open it, click on buttons in the interface or use the file menu to do so. When it comes to printer selection, pick Microsoft Print to PDF from the list of installed printers. Once done, hit print and a file save dialog should pop up. Pick a location and name for the file you want to create and hit the save button afterwards to complete the process. \nThe printing is fast, it takes a couple of seconds to create a 20 or 30 page PDF document, and there is little delay before the process itself starts. It may take considerably longer if you are printing very large documents to PDF but in most cases, the conversion should be near instant. \nWindows saves the converted PDF document to the selected directory from where you can use it. \nThe native solution lacks options apart from selecting the orientation and paper format. Third-party solutions may add numerous customization options to the process, from merging multiple files into a single document to image compression or making use of PDF features such as encryption. \nMicrosoft Print to PDF is the Notepad of the virtual PDF printing world. It works fine out of the box but lacks options that you only get when you use third-party solutions that are more powerful than it.
