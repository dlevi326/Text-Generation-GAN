Source: Supplied\nA discount of 25 per cent was also given due to guilty pleas \"entered at the earliest opportunity\", the court heard.\nDetails of Van Ryn's crimes were detailed in the sentencing, including that he had propositioned one young victim in a pool and said \"do you want to be my special friend?\" before fondling his genitals.\nIn another incident with a teenage boy Van Ryn began watching porn on his laptop and masturbating, and then tried to have anal sex with him, causing the boy to begin bleeding and cry out in pain.\nVAN RYN VICTIM ‘SO ANGRY’ OVER STOLEN DREAMS\nIMPACT ON VICTIMS ‘SHOCKING AS MURDER’\nThe fact Van Ryn was on bail when he committed an offence would not be taken into account as an \"aggravating factor\" when it came to sentencing on particular charges, Judge Jeffreys said.\nThis was because that charge was dealt with under a form one, which means Van Ryn acknowledged it happened but didn't enter a plea to it and Judge Jeffreys wanted to avoid \"double counting\" when calculating the sentence. He noted Van Ryn had \"an extremely good work history\" and added that Bega Cheese \"under his guidance and management became very successful.\" \"I am satisfied offender, in my view, has shown deep contrition,\" he said. \"He has voluntarily taken positive steps by involving himself with anti-libido treatment.\n\"He has been progressing extremely well in relation to anti libido treatment and has reasonable prospects of not ever offending while he is on this treatment.\n\"I need to take this into account.\"\nVan Ryn gave evidence at a sentencing hearing in February, saying he regretted the offences and considered them \"a few minutes of stupidity\".\nHe will be eligible for release on parole in December 2021.\nIncrease Text Size Decrease Text Size Print Email Share Add to Digg Add to del.icio.us Add to Facebook Add to Kwoff Add to Myspace Add to Newsvine What are these?
