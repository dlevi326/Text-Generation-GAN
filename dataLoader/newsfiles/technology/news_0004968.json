(LBA), a unit of LBA Group, Inc., continues growing its PLP-Series lightning protection product line with the introduction of the PLP-38-MOB Roll-away, Fold-over Lightning Protection Mast. This latest addition to LBA’s highly successful PLP-Series of portable lightning masts is designed for fast field implementation of a redeployable fold-over mobile lightning protection system. The system permits cost effective protection within sites like yards and staging areas for critical assets whose locations and numbers may vary day-to-day.\n“PLP-38-MOB systems include streamer discharge dissipation technology to reduce the probability of lightning strikes, but are also fully compliant to NFPA70 requirements for lightning strike termination,” LBA Business Development Specialist Byron Johnson said. “The PLP-38-MOB provides the same level of protection as a PLP-38 standard system”, Johnson added.\nThe rugged patent-protected system breaks down for compact storage and transportation in provided man-carry cases. All fasteners and installation hardware are captive. This provides for reliable deployment logistics, fast installation and avoids loose parts that could cause foreign object damage at sensitive sites. Deployment is straight-forward with no tools required for installation. The system can be installed or deinstalled in under one hour by two people and is rated to survive 100 mph wind gusts. The system base utilizes water-ballast and is suitable for non-penetrating applications on rooftops and other critical surfaces.\nPLP-Series lightning masts are in use by such organizations as the US Army, US Air Force, Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, US Border Patrol, and more worldwide.\nFor more information on the new PLP-38-MOB and the wide variety of lightning protection solutions offered by LBA, visit http://www.lbagroup.com/products/lightning-protection-systems-for-towers-antennas-and-structures , or contact Byron Johnson, at Byron(dot)johnson(at)lbagroup(dot)com, 252-757-0279.\nThe LBA Group\nLBA Group companies have over 50 years of experience in providing electromagnetic protection and management for industrial and telecommunications infrastructure.
