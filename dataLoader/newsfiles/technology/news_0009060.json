This was the first CFDA marketing approval for an additively manufactured orthopaedic implant. \nSince 2003, Beijing AK Medical has specialised in the orthopaedic industry in researching, developing, manufacturing and sale of artificial joint prosthesis and its complete set of surgical instruments. These newly acquired production systems will be used for volume production of orthopaedic implants. \n\"We are happy to present this order from Beijing AK Medical, a customer since long and a leading Chinese Implant manufacturer, driving the adaptation to Additive Manufacturing in China,” Magnus René, CEO of Arcam, explained. “This order also shows that the implant industry in China is now moving to volume production of medical implants with our EBM technology.” \nThe Arcam Q10 is a new generation EBM machine designed for industrial production of orthopaedic implants. It is specifically designed to meet the implant industry’s need for high productivity, high resolution, ease-of-use and quality control. \nMr Li Zhi Jiang, CEO of Beijing AK Medical, added: “We are excited to move into volume production with the EBM technology. Having worked with Arcam since 2010 we are now ramping up our activities, following the recent approval by the CFDA.” \nArcam will exhibit at the upcoming TCT Show + Personalize on 30th September - 1st October at NEC, Birmingham.
