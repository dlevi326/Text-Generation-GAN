Source: Supplied\nAustralia enjoyed a moment of glory at today’s Apple launch when Melbourne-based Hipster Whale developer Andy Sum took the stage to talk about Crossy Road.\nCrossy Road is a game where the user helps weird looking characters cross the road without being run over and smashed to smithereens.\nAt today’s event , Sum announced that Crossy Road would be immediately available for Apple TV. Further, it was now multi-user, so several players could play at once on the same TV using their iPhones and iPads as consoles.\nThose attending today’s launch laughed loudly as one character helped another across the road only to nudge it into oncoming traffic when they turned “competitive”.\nIt was a moment of triumph for Sum who told The Australian that he had been “really excited to work with Apple”.\nThe game was originally created for iPhone and iPad and had received 40 million downloads as a single-user game.\n“We’ve focused on the community aspect and sitting around a big TV with a friend,” he said.\nSum said Hipster Whale had looked at how it could implement Apple TV’s new remote control. “One player can use the remote to move around, swipe to move sideways and hop forwards.”\nThe game was still under development.\n“We had a lot of fun making the game and it was really nice to see everyone laughing today.”\nHe said Australian gaming had really grown in the past few years especially with small teams. “Melbourne in particular is pretty big. It’s a really great community. I’m really proud to be up here today.”\nCrossy Road is Hipster Whale’s first game but Mr Sum and business partner Matt Hall, who hails from an Australian sheep farm, had developed games previously. Hall’s former studio KlickTock achieved successes including hidden object game Doodle Find and seek and find game Little Things for Ever.\nThe Australian Business Review", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/the-verdict-on-apples-iphone-6s-ipad-pro-and-apple-tv-updates/story-e6frgakx-1227520695967", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/10/1227520/856473-5b7a66ba-5757-11e5-83fc-3eca1aa25b46.jpg", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/whale-of-a-time-for-millions/story-e6frgakx-1227204364540"], "published": "2015-09-10T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:08:44.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
