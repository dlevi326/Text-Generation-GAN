And they've designed their visa systems accordingly.\"\nA survey from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation earlier this month showed that job placements had been held up by a lack of skilled candidates.\nThe Hays survey showed other countries also struggle with a severe mismatch of talent, including Ireland and the United States.\nOfficial figures on British productivity for the second quarter are due next Thursday, after it returned to modest growth in the first three months of the year. Output per hour is still around 1 percent lower than its level in early 2008, before Britain tipped into recession.\nThe Bank of England is keeping a close eye on wage growth as it mulls the first rate hike in over seven years. The ongoing productivity puzzle could cast doubt over the central bank's ability to gauge the speed with which pay will rise.
