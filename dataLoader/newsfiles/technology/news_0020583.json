PSFK and IBM Watson have been collaborating through The Good Data Contest to discover how IBM Watson’s capabilities can improve the lives of communities everywhere and spark a conversation around what cognitive computing will mean for our future. \nAs reported in July, the winning entry was Inquisite, a platform for determining passions, defining success, and kickstarting a life of informed explorations, designed by Shuya Gong, Matt Sebek and Noah Sebek. \nAs part of their prize, the Inquisite team have joined the IBM Watson ecosystem, will take part in future collaborations, and were flown to New York City to visit the Watson Lab and meet with Watson execs as our video details below. \nBy analyzing unstructured data, Inquisite helps users define and discover new passions and meaning so as to lead to a more explorative and knowledgable life. The platform aims to help high school students face the dreaded question of “What am I going to do with my life?” A question made the worse when a student’s passions fall outside of a traditional professional trajectory. \nIt’s no secret that we tend to excel at the things we love doing. However, in a world where we are consistently overloaded with visual and cognitive stimuli, it can be difficult to filter out the noise and outline the steps needed to convert a dream to a reality. \nHigh school is a time of self-discovery, and Inquisite aims to provide insights fed by users’ passions, providing venues for discovery and development and kickstarting a journey of informed exploration. \nAs Internet-browsing, tech-savy people, we convey, feed, and exhibit our interests and passions in a multitude of ways. Multiple searches for nautical wind conditions might offer a clue that a user is passionate about sailing, or avid participation in manga forums might suggest that a user is visually inclined. Inquisite harnesses these unstructured insights and develops algorithms to gauge interest, highlight trends and outline suggestions by tapping into a variety of sources of diverse content and exploring the relationships that emerge. \nCross-checking behavioral insights with books read, movies seen and events enjoyed will further inform Inquisite’s discovery. \nStudents can input known academic interests through transcripts and grades, letting Inquisite see what they have already learned and how proficient they are in that area. Inquisite can then make use of the multitude of learning softwares used by thousands of schools across the world, using their native insights to find out not just what students learn, but how they learn the best . \nInquisite tailors content through cross-platform mobile and desktop applications to give the students varied opportunities to pursue interests and grow and learn as individuals. This may be through traditional routes of higher education, preparing students with relevant coursework and academic opportunities, or it might be suggesting a backpacking trip or service opportunity. Relevant events relating to your interests and passions are put on your radar as well as on your calendar. \nWhile learning and growing is a lifelong endeavor, Inquisite strives to help teach and guide students well beyond the classroom. While initially targeting high schoolers, the potential for the tool applies across all walks of life and is applicable to a wide range of age groups. Inquisite lets you discover, define and realize your passions to kickstart a life of informed exploration. \nPSFK and IBM Watson would like to thank all wonderful participants for providing an incredible amount of creative ideas spanning a wide range of subjects that all aspired to make our world a better place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T15:47:08.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
