More than 3,700 firefighters are battling the blaze which is 40 percent contained, according to the US Forest Service. \nThousands of firefighters further north are also battling two fast-moving wildfires -- the Valley Fire and the Butte Fire -- that erupted at the weekend killing at least one person, forcing the evacuation of more than 23,000 people and destroying more than 700 homes. \nOf the two fires, the Valley one has been the most devastating and difficult to contain. \nMiddletown, a small hamlet north of San Francisco, was completely gutted by the flames that left an apocalyptic scene and shocked even seasoned firefighters with its speed and strength. \nResidents trickled back to the town on Tuesday to check on their still smoldering homes. Officials said at least 400 homes and businesses had burned to the ground. \n\"Everyone in here could tell you a horror story you wouldn't believe,\" Ashley Mayhew, manager at Hardester's, a market in the heart of Middletown that stayed open during the inferno, told AFP. \nShe said desperate residents had flooded the store over the weekend, buying everything from water, groceries and other supplies. \n\"People... were hosing down their houses to try to save them,\" Mayhew said. \n- 'Going to get worse' - \nFire officials said there was reason for hope in battling the Butte Fire, and that some residents of the San Andreas area should even be allowed back to their homes. \nBut although temperatures are expected to be much cooler this week than last, fire officials remain on alert due to hot conditions and landscape left bone dry by a four-year drought. \nGovernor Jerry Brown, who has declared a state of emergency in the affected counties, said Monday he did not see an end to the fire season in the months ahead, blaming climate change in part for the blazes. \n\"It is going to get worse because of the nature of climate change,\" he told reporters. \nThe fires for now have not affected vineyards in the Napa Valley. \n\"The pattern of the Valley Fire as it is now does not indicate an imminent threat to Napa Valley,\" said Cate Conniff, spokeswoman for the Napa Valley Vintners organization. \n\"So we have been very lucky.\" \nFirefighters this summer have also been battling wildfires in other West Coast states, including Washington and Oregon, that have stretched resources thin. \nOfficials say the wildfires, which have mobilized 30,000 firefighters, could be the costliest on record with more than $1.23 billion spent so far. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:25:05.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
