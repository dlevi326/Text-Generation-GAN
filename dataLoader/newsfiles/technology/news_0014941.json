Evensen said it took them an hour to reel the shark toward the boat. They then harpooned it and it took another hour to hand line it into the boat.\n( Credit: Mike Evensen) Evensen said when he saw the white patch by the dorsal fin, he knew it was a porbeagle.\nWhile he was reeling it in in, his son, Cameron, 9, helped man the boat. Both Cameron and Hanna took turns reeling in the shark.\nOnce back to the dock, the Division of Marine Fisheries came to take the shark apart and weigh it. In total, it weighed 483 pounds, just shy of the 490-pound state record.\nThe shark was cut up into steaks and Mark Evensen and his family now have about 200 pounds of shark meat to eat.\nTrending on Facebook\n6-month-old baby found dead in teacherâ€™s car in Deltona, Fla.
