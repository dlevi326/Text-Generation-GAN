Aligning with recent updates to the IAB Video Suite technical specifications , this revised set of digital video ad formats and creative submission guidelines further enables cross-screen ad portability. \nThe new guidelines include file submission recommendations that detail “ready-to-serve” files for streaming, progressive download, and adaptive bitrate streaming formats. In addition, they advise providing the source mezzanine file, so that a publisher can transcode the file to best suit the environment into which it is served. \n“It is incumbent upon the industry to provide the best digital video experience possible for audiences, whether on a smartphone or watching on a TV screen,” said Scott Cunningham, Senior Vice President, Technology and Ad Operations, IAB, and General Manager of the IAB Tech Lab. “These guidelines for video ad file submissions will help streamline ad development and placement operations, while meeting the growing demand for high-quality digital video from consumers, and the advertisers that want to reach them.” \n“Audiences expect gorgeous high-definition when they turn to digital video programming, so the advertising on this medium must follow suit,” said Anna Bager, Senior Vice President, Mobile and Video, and General Manager of the IAB Digital Video and Mobile Marketing Centers of Excellence. “These updates will be critical in driving momentum for the digital video marketplace, keeping pace with today’s viewers by giving them the best that interactive advertising can offer.” \nTo review the updated “IAB Digital Video In-Stream Ad Format Guidelines and Best Practices,” please visit www.iab.net/dvadformats . \nThe public comment period will run through October 16, 2015, after which the IAB Digital Video Ad Format Guidelines Working Group will evaluate the comments received, make any necessary revisions, and release a final version.
