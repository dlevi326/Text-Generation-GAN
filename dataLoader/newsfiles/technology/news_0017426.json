The institute selected the ACE channel emulator for its critical research in exploring the application of LTE for TV white spaces (so-called “abandoned” frequencies in the broadcast spectrum), public safety, and WLAN-to-LTE traffic offloads. \n“We are happy to announce that we have chosen the ACE MX for our advanced research on LTE applications. Our group has been focusing on research in broadband wireless. We have been investigating many novel ideas in LTE, Wi-Fi, and TV White space, with specific reference to Indian scenarios,” says Professor Abhay Karandikar, who heads up IIT Bombay’s LTE project. “ACE’s unique capabilities will help us in our test-bed development. We are happy with the excellent support we have been getting from Azimuth.” \nIIT selected the ACE based on its ease-of-use, RF excellence, and field playback. The ACE MX is a part of Azimuth’s industry-leading portfolio of channel and environment emulators, purpose-built for testing real-world device-network interactions and their impact on end-user performance. \n“Albert Einstein once said, ‘I never teach my pupils; I only provide the conditions in which they can learn.’ We, too, believe, that great things come about when you enable eager minds with optimal conditions for innovation,” says Vivek Vadakkuppattu , VP of product management and marketing for Azimuth Systems. “This is one among many reasons we are really excited by this engagement with IIT. Working with leading faculty and students at IIT provides us not just visibility into cutting edge research, but also the opportunity to work with some of the world’s smartest minds.” \nAbout Azimuth Systems \nAzimuth Systems, Inc. is a leader in mobile performance test solutions for network operators, device OEMs, chipset vendors and infrastructure providers.
