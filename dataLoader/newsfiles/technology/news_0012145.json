It recognizes a pedestrian and marks it with a red box. A red line is displayed in the direction of the pedestrian. For this image, a 1-Mpixel backside-illuminated CMOS sensor was used to detect the pedestrians to the rear side of the vehicle. [Click to enlarge image] \nSharp Corp will commercialize a surround view system that can detect pedestrians even in the dark in 2018. \nWith a backside-illuminated CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) sensor that realizes a high image quality, the system has a sensitivity about 100% higher than that of a system using a conventional front side-illuminated CMOS sensor. Also, with an image processing function to recognize pedestrians, it can detect pedestrians in the blind spots when the vehicle is being parked. \nThe surround view system is equipped with a 1.3-Mpixel backside-illuminated CMOS sensor and realizes a high-quality, wide-dynamic-range image even with a low illuminance (e.g. at night). Especially, it is useful in detecting obstacles that are located to the sides of the vehicle and hardly illuminated by the lights of the vehicle. \nIn the future, Sharp will consider adding functions to detect vehicles and record a video. It started to provide samples to some manufactures in the spring of 2015, aiming to supply them to automakers both in and outside Japan. \n\"Automakers are trying to detect obstacles at night by improving the performance of low-cost CMOS sensors,\" Sharp said. \nThe European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) will include the evaluation of nighttime pedestrian detection capability in 2018. Therefore, the company expects that the demand for high-sensitivity CMOS sensors such as backside-illuminated types will increase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:32:08.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
