Lynch\nWASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - A St. Louis-based investment advisory firm will pay $75,000 to settle civil charges alleging it failed \"entirely\" to protect its clients from a July 2013 cyber attack that was later traced to China, U.S. regulators said on Tuesday.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said R.T. Jones Capital Equities Management did not even encrypt its customers' data or install a firewall on its servers, and the hack compromised the personal details of about 100,000 people.\nNo customer has reported suffering any financial harm as a result of the attack, the SEC added.\nNeither an attorney nor a representative for the firm could be reached for comment.\nR.T. Jones is a relatively small advisory firm, with only about $481 million in assets under management as of June, according to a filing with the SEC.\nBut the cyber security concerns at issue in the case, as well as the origin of the attack, are likely to generate attention.\nIn recent years, high-profile companies including Target Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co have been hit in hack attacks.\nIn some cases, Chinese hackers have been implicated in various cyber crimes, including a major breach at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management disclosed earlier this year.\nThe topic of cyber spying is expected to come up when President Barack Obama meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Washington.\nThe SEC's charging documents against R.T. Jones say the hack was traced to mainland China by a cyber-security consulting firm. The full nature of the breach could not be determined because the hacker destroyed digital log files.\nThe agency said the breach was discovered at the firm's third party-hosted Web server.\nFrom September 2009 through July 2013, the SEC said, the firm did not have written policies and procedures to safeguard customer data. After the breach was discovered, it notified affected parties and offered free credit monitoring.\nA brochure that R.T. Jones filed with the SEC in June promises that the firm has \"physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards\" to protect personal information.\nThe SEC has been ramping up its focus on cyber security protections at Wall Street firms. About a year ago, it conducted a series of compliance exams at advisers and brokerages to make sure they had adequate policies to protect against cyber crime. (Reporting by Sarah N.
