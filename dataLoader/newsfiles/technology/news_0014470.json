Using TTR’s software maintenance decision tree, subscribers now have the ability to answer a short series of questions and immediately obtain a tax answer for the type of agreement they are researching. Subscribers can also compare results across all states.\nBusinesses have long struggled with the complexities of applying sales tax to software maintenance agreements. This is because the taxability of these agreements depends on several factors, including (1) whether the purchase of the agreement is mandatory or optional; (2) whether the software is custom or prewritten (“canned”); (3) how the software was delivered to the purchaser; (4) whether, under the agreement, the purchaser is entitled to support services, software updates, or both; (5) if the agreement includes software updates, how those updates are delivered to the purchaser; and (6) how the purchaser is invoiced.\n“This new feature will allow businesses that have entered into software maintenance agreements to feel secure knowing that such transactions are taxed accurately every time,” said Ken Webster, Head of Research at TTR. “We have taken a body of law that requires hundreds of hours of legal research and put it together in a way that is accurate and simple to understand. It’s exciting to think about the amount of time this will save our clients.”\nTTR is pleased to provide this additional content to its subscribers in the technology industry.\nAbout TTR\nTransaction (buying or selling things), Tax (the tax on this activity), Resources (our people, our website, our support services) - TTR, Inc.\nTTR has a website that companies subscribe to and use daily.
