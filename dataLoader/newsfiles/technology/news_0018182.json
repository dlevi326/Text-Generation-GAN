Internet provider would clearly do well to put more general effort into both promoting the capabilities of their bundled kit and ensuring that they don't fall behind on the features front.\"\n\"Some ISPs, such as TalkTalk, EE, BT and Virgin Media, appear to have reasonably capable routers that can match many of the mid-range models you'd find in the shops. However a few other providers, such as Sky Broadband and PlusNet, appear to have fallen behind in this area and would benefit from an upgrade,\" concluded Jackson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T01:26:05.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
