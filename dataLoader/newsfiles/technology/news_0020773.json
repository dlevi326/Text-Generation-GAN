E-books comprised only 9 percent of the market. The remaining 4 percent was made up by file sharing.\" \nReasons commonly cited by students for preferring traditional books include: They are easier to read; Students like to physically highlight selections; They're cheaper; They're easier to navigate and bookmark; E-books make students' eyes hurt; Students find it harder to concentrate on e-books; Traditional books do not require Internet access; Students like to write on the pages; Tablets or laptops are not allowed in class; Availability of e-books is limited; and Students end up printing the pages of e-books anyway. \nAmong the 27 percent of respondents who do prefer e-books, common reasons for the preference include: E-books are cheaper; They don't have to be returned; They are more environmentally friendly than paper books; They are searchable; Print size and brightness is adjustable; They can convert text to audio; and They can be used with apps. \n\"Given the ubiquity of e-book-reading devices on college campuses, it's interesting that students prefer print textbooks over e-books, and that purchasing behavior supports that sentiment,\" said Morgan MacArthur, chief technology officer at Direct Textbook, in a prepared statement. \"What's even more interesting are the differences in perception: both students who preferred textbooks and those who preferred e-books cited lower prices as a reason.\" About the Author \nJoshua Bolkan is the multimedia editor for Campus Technology and THE Journal.
