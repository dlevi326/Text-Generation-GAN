Stewart won more than 20 Emmy awards.\nNow, stage left, enter Noah.\nHe kicked off his debut monologue by thanking the man who plucked him from relative obscurity and anointed him the new host.\n“Thank you Jon ... I’m not quite sure what you saw in me, but I’ll work hard every day to find it,” the 31-year-old South African comedian said. “And I’ll make you not look like the crazy old dude who left his inheritance to some random kid in Africa.”\nAfter a long monologue skewering the week in US politics, mainly the resignation of House speaker John Boehner, Noah quipped: “and of course, the Mets won the playoffs!”.\nThe shout-out to the basketball squad elicited a deafening roar of delight from the audience.\n“Jon told me that would work,” he said with a smile.\nThe pressure has been mounting for Noah since it was announced he’d take over as host. And all eyes were on him to see if he’d crash and burn.\nHe didn’t. But he also didn’t do anything extraordinary. No segments went viral. But that was expected.\nTrevor Noah’s debut was steady but not extraordinary. Taking on a late night show, with a desk you could potentially be sitting behind for 20-plus years, the goal for the debut episode is probably just to not accidentally light the set on fire.\nNew York Times TV critic James Poniewozik summarised Noah’s first crack.\n“So the mission of that show was, ‘Trevor Noah can host the Daily Show you&apos;re used to and not burn it to the ground, and it worked,” he tweeted.\nVariety’s Brian Lowry noted that “for now, anyway, it doesn’t look like anything here is cause to make that globe suddenly spin off its axis.”\nPerhaps the edgiest part of the show came after the opening monologue in a segment about the resignation of House speaker John Boehner. Two quips divided people: An AIDS joke and a Whitney Houston joke.\n“Boehner has final say about which laws come in and which laws don’t. He’s basically the bouncer at Club Congress, which is probably the worst club ever,” Noah said.\n“I mean, first of all, there’s hardly any women in the club. There’s always a bunch of old guys talking about laying pipe. Oh, and everyone at the club has aides.”\n“Aides, the people that help you!” he told the somewhat shocked audience, joking about the double meaning.\nRiffing on the opinion some people have that John Boehner wasn’t conservative enough, Noah then drew a comparison between crack and meth (and Whitney Houston).\n“It’s like crack telling meth it’s not addictive enough,” he quipped. “‘You make teeth fall out? Big deal. I took down Whitney Houston.’\n“Too soon?” he asked the audience.\nNeedless to say, jokes about AIDS and Whitney Houston drew a mixed reaction on social media.\n“In his first 12 minuets, Trevor Noah has made an AIDS joke and a Whitney Houston crack joke so it looks like were off and running!” wrote Nate Gilbert.\n“Poll: When did he lose you, the AIDS joke or the Whitney Houston joke? #DailyShow #TrevorNoah,” Kevin Fallon offered.\n“A d everything is gonna be just fine. @Trevornoah already took a shot at Whitney Houston being a crackhead. *sigh of relief*,” Chris Robinson wrote.\nThe risky jokes were probably the punch this debut needed.\nOriginally published as So, is Jon Stewart’s replacement funny?", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0a24d062921134ff16b643ea3037b225", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/07c4e322b16d72e12116bc386a936907", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0141987f84dd2aed4c86736a7e4e87bd", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/120a899984c32c29f2c5947e0598a147", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e1d94f7d4d506197f2dcd9d6511973e9?width=650", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/is-he-funny-trevor-noah-debuts-as-jon-stewart-heir/story-e6frfmyi-1227549518454?sv=3fd7f1836f30690c631926324d89199c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e0accf1e79dd076186c35ecbcfae011c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d7b4dc82ab06294ba8ea6f1346c7600f", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-29T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T12:33:23.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
