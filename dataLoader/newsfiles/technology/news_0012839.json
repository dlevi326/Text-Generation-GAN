But with the help of Ariba , an SAP company, the University of Washington, one of the world’s preeminent public universities, is achieving it. On October 8, Laurie Hunt, Director Procurement Services IT & System Support, will share the secrets of the institution’s success at the Ariba Commerce Summit in San Mateo, California. Part of a 14-city global tour, the exclusive event will be held at the San Mateo Marriott. \n“Like many organizations, we struggled to gain visibility into and control over our spend,” Hunt said. \nTo remedy the situation, UW began looking for a technology partner that could help it fuel a comprehensive procure-to-pay process and deliver solutions in a hybrid manner so that it could maximize its existing systems and extend the value they deliver. It found one in Ariba. \nUW started by implementing on-premise versions of Ariba’s procurement and expense solutions, which it used alongside homegrown systems to: Create a standard, best-practice procure-to-pay process that would provide a clear view into spend and improve controls and compliance Enable suppliers to collaborate electronically on everything from orders and invoices to payments. \nThen the university added Ariba’s solutions for invoice management to reduce the cost of reconciling invoices and payments, which Hunt estimates was around $100 per invoice. In doing so, it lowered this number to less than $20 and raised accuracy rates to 80 percent. \nHunt attributes this in part to the consumer-like experience Ariba creates for both internal buyers and external suppliers – which UW enabled by adopting the company’s cloud-based applications for sourcing and contract management . “This has really helped to get everyone on board and using the new system,” she said. \nHunt joins an all-star roster of companies set to attend and present at the Ariba Commerce Summits, a unique global series of free, one-day events designed to provide executives and practitioners across procurement, finance, AP/ treasury, legal, IT and sales and marketing with the intelligence and insights needed to manage their commerce activities with greater simplicity and efficiency.
