Only 24% said the decision was \"great news\". Way to listen to your readers!\nTo those who despise the comments section, I get your view. You read an interesting (or not so interesting) piece, and then suddenly feel a pull (like a Jedi has control over you) in your index finger towards the scroll wheel on your mouse. Against your will, you suddenly arrive at the comments section and are subjected to the torture of having to read them. Reminds me of the time my doctor warned me of high cholesterol. Some time after, a Mc'Donalds opened up near my house. I had to move. Thankfully it closed down and now I can return.\nTo News24, I get that many of the comments amount to hate speech, which I can handle, and then there are threats to incite violence against my race. This is against the law. But I'd rather not have a false sense of security and know how people feel. From there, I'd like to think that moderators could take action if comments are unlawful. And then I have one last point. On many occasions, authors have been caught out by knowledgeable readers for either inaccuracies, preaching political correctness or for pushing a biased agenda. Removing the comments section is the perfect way to let authors dictate their own versions of the truth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:56:30.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
