Forward redemptions as a percentage of SS&C GlobeOp's assets under administration on the SS&C GlobeOp platform have trended significantly lower since reaching a high of 19.27% in November 2008 . The next publication date is October 21, 2015 .\nPublished on the 15th business day of the month, the SS&C GlobeOp Forward Redemption Indicator presents a timely and accurate view of the redemption pipeline for investors in hedge funds on the SS&C GlobeOp administration platform. Movements in the Indicator reflect investor confidence in their allocations to hedge funds. Indicator data is based on actual investor redemption notifications received. Unlike subscriptions, redemption notifications are typically received 30-90 days in advance of the redemption date. Investors may, and sometimes do, cancel redemption notices. In addition, the establishment and enforcement of redemption notices may vary from fund to fund.\nSS&C GlobeOp Hedge Fund Performance Index\nBase\n100 points on 31 December 2005\nFlash estimate (current month)\n-1.02%*\nYear-to-date (YTD)\n6.22%*\nLast 12 month (LTM)\n7.28%*\nLife to date (LTD)\n121.58%*\n*All numbers reported above are gross\nSS&C GlobeOp Capital Movement Index\nBase\n100 points on 31 December 2005\nAll time high\n150.77 in September 2013\nAll time low\n99.67 in January 2006\n12-month high\n149.53 in December 2014\n12-month low\n144.51 in July 2015\nLargest monthly change\n- 15.21 in January 2009\nSS&C GlobeOp Forward Redemption Indicator\nAll time high\n19.27% in November 2008\nAll time low\n1.85% in January 2012\n12-month high\n5.87% in December 2014\n12-month low\n2.08% in July 2015\nLargest monthly change\n9.60% in November 2008\nAbout the SS&C GlobeOp Hedge Fund IndexÂ®\nThe SS&C GlobeOp Hedge Fund Index (the Index) is a family of indices published by SS&C GlobeOp.
