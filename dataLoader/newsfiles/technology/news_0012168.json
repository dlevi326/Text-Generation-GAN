Sanofi bought Genzyme in 2011.\nSeprafilm is a clear film used to reduce abnormal internal scarring that can cause organs and tissues to stick together following pelvic and abdominal surgeries known as laparotomies.\nBut the Justice Department said some sales representatives taught surgeons how to turn Seprafilm into a \"slurry\" for use in increasingly popular laparoscopic surgery, even though U.S. regulators had never approved the film for that use.\nAccording to papers filed with the federal court in Tampa, Florida, Genzyme admitted and accepted responsibility for the facts underlying the two criminal counts.\nThe two-year deferred prosecution agreement calls for improved oversight, and steps to halt Seprafilm sales for off-label uses. If Genzyme complies, the government will dismiss the charges.\nGenzyme, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nIn December 2013, Genzyme reached a $22.28 million civil agreement to resolve claims related to Seprafilm under the federal False Claims Act.\nThe Justice Department said Thursday's settlement reflects Genzyme's \"significant\" cooperation during the probe.\nThe case is U.S. v. Genzyme Corp, U.S. District Court, Central District of Florida, No. 15-cr-00352.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Diane Craft )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T02:03:02.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
