There are plenty of progressive priests, just as there are plenty of conservative ones. Priests can and do have ideologies, just as politicians have religious convictions. (And unlike a rank-and-file priest, Francis is a head of state who conducts foreign policy.) And there are, in fact, reasons why Francis strikes political observers as having a lot in common with American Democrats.", "external_links": ["http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/09/pope_francis_in_the_united_states_why_he_isn_t_the_liberal_rock_star_american.html", "http://www.newrepublic.com/article/122879/stop-treating-pope-francis-americas-liberal-hero"], "published": "2015-09-24T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T16:30:09.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
