They burn tyres, loot, block roads, destroy property, stone cars, and tangle with the cops. But they refuse to actually pay for service delivery.\nNews24 is a business, and like any business, they are here to make money.\nNow let’s be honest: Commenters do not generate income. Commenters are not forced, or coerced, into commenting. Commenters do not pay a cent towards comment publication (service delivery). News24 do not owe them anything. News24 has no obligation to publish their comments.\nIf the news and articles that get published on News24 are of a sufficiently high standard (which it certainly isn’t at this point in time), readers will flock to this website, regardless of whether they will be able to comment or not.\nLet me put this in another way: News24 is like a house. As the owner of the house, it is up to News24 to decide what is allowed in their house and what is not; just like you do in your own house.\nBut, be that as it may, commenting on articles and news reports should be a God-given right in our beloved Notion of a Rainbow.\nAfter all, we, the people of South Africa, recognize the injustices of our past, and honour those who suffered for justice and freedom, nê, Sakkie?\n“ Surely, comrades, surely there is no one among you who wants to see Jones come back? ”\nSorry, I got carried away by George Orwell’s Animal Farm. It won’t happen again. I promise.\nSo here’s my solution to the problem:\nOpen the comments section again.\n· Let commenters have their say.\n· Let them say whatever they want – no restrictions on foul language, swearing, blasphemy, discrimination based on differences due to age, ability, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic by which people differ, whatever.\nBut here’s the catch:\nCommenters have to pay R50.00 into a fund for each and every comment they make. The fund will be used to pay back the money that was stolen to build Nkandla.\nOf course News24 will be allowed to skim some money off the top of this fund for admin and handling fees. That is perfectly in order. After all – this is a business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:16:46.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
