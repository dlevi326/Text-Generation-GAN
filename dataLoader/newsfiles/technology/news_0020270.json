Specifically, SmartSource Rentals has been playing a critical role providing its leading-edge technology to the National Interagency Wildland Firefighting Teams, as they lead the battle against raging wildfires which have been prevailing in several U.S. Western states. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150916/267113 \nAccording to a recent release by the USDA Office of Communications, \"So far this year, 39,254 wildfires have burned nearly 6.4 million acres in the U.S.\" For its part, SmartSource Rentals and its team of experienced Information Technology (IT) technicians, logistics experts and account managers, has been responding with a 24 hour turnaround in an estimated 85% of requests for equipment ranging from laptops and iPads to printers, related networking components and customization services. The technology, all of which is custom-imaged and labeled for the National Wildland Incident Management Teams, includes a plug-and-play product that is used to provide dynamic and responsive planning in terms of updating GIS software to speed up reaction time in order to save lives, structures and acreage. This product, and other technology provided by SmartSource Rentals have been deployed across the United States, from Alaska to Florida, and New York to California. Currently, it is being deployed by multiple National Incident Management Teams directing the firefighting effort across the five Western states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Nevada. \nAccording to SmartSource Rentals President and CEO Peter Handal, \"We are extremely proud of the confidence the National Interagency Wildland Firefighting Teams have placed in SmartSource Rentals and its ability to deliver technology that is helping this vital agency in its mission to protect and preserve the nation's forests and grasslands. While its elite wildland firefighting team members are in a vigorous battle against intense wildfires, being able to help with the right equipment, delivered on a just in time (JIT) basis, is clearly something in which we take great pride. We are fortunate to have a team of people on staff willing to go above and beyond standard operations to support firefighters during this unprecedented wildfire season.\" \nHandal added, \"Our teams in Phoenix, Las Vegas, San Diego, and Chicago, in particular, have managed a demanding logistical task with great efficiency and the highest standards of customer service. With solid people on staff and the most extensive IT inventory available for short-term rental, we are uniquely positioned to provide customers with consistently reliable service under the most challenging circumstances.\" \nSmartSource Rentals' nationwide branch network and, in particular, strong presence in the West has enabled the company to meet the quick turnaround needs of the National Wildland Incident Management Teams, while also containing delivery costs. Response time is critical, and SmartSource Rentals' Phoenix branch has been creatively finding ways to get equipment to remote locations within 24 hours after receiving the order; even on weekends and holidays. \nAs the wildfire season, which runs from May to September, begins to wind down, SmartSource Rentals will continue to remain on the technology frontline ready to ship out its high performance technology and provide essential services to arm the USDA National Forest Service's Incident Command Teams with the equipment they need to direct a massive, valiant firefighting effort. \n\"Our fire clients have never heard us say, Sorry, we're out of equipment, \" said SmartSource Rentals Senior Account Executive Tom Joanes, serving in the company's Phoenix office. \"With creativity and dedication, our team has always found a way to make it happen - literally helping put out fires.\" \nAbout SmartSource Computer & Audio Visual Rentals \nSmartSource Rentals provides a unique range of rental products and services under the overall brand \"Total Technology.\" SmartSource has the largest national footprint in the computer and audio visual rental space.
