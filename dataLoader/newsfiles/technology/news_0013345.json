Now he is running for president, provoking a power struggle within the opposition whose outcome will help decide the country's future stability.\nWhile N'Guessan appears likely to lose in October, the fact that the former prime minister is even contesting the election for the main opposition Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) ought to mark a step towards national reconciliation.\nBut the party's founder, former president Laurent Gbagbo, is awaiting trial in The Hague over his role in the 2011 war, and FPI hardliners have called for an election boycott, which would be the party's third in the past four years.\nUnder the incumbent President Alassane Ouattara, Ivory Coast is emerging as one of Africa's star economies, but it also needs a credible election and political calm to maintain the revival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T00:46:52.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
