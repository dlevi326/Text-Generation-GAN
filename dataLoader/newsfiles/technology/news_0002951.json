The fake stores are also taking pre-orders, but say they will have the new phones from Friday.\nSeveral workers at the stores said they were buying iPhone models in China and in overseas markets such as the United States and Hong Kong, from where they would be smuggled across the border into the mainland.\nApple declined to comment on the proliferation of unauthorised stores in China.\nKnock-off industry Another photo of inside one of the stores posted on the BirdAbroad blog. Some analysts said the presence of fake Apple stores could be a good thing for the company as they promote brand awareness in a country that had just 22 Apple stores in the third quarter, with plans to raise that number to 40 by the middle of 2016.\nBut the widespread unauthorised reselling of even genuine goods can make it harder for companies such as Apple to manage their brands and risks disrupting longer term plans.\nWashington has repeatedly pressed China to do more to protect intellectual copyright in the country, a call reiterated by the White House this week as Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in the United States for a week-long visit.\nThe fake Apple store model is proving so lucrative it has even spawned a cottage industry servicing such businesses.\nJust a stone's throw from the street of copycat stores, tucked away in a giant tech mall, two shops offer the logos, uniforms, display shelves and shopping bags needed to make an unauthorised outlet feel like a genuine Apple store.\nA recent raid by authorities on fake Apple stores has, however, made some cautious. Some shops have blocked signs that read \"authorised Apple seller\" with promotional banners and covered Apple logos on staff uniforms with stickers, although several vendors said business had not been affected.\nOthers in the industry said the fake Apple store had become so popular that it was just a matter of time before some shops would be forced to close as the market becomes saturated.\nBack at the tech mall, Yang Fei, owner of a shop that helps unauthorised dealers set up specialised mobile phone stores, said it might be time for Apple dealers to think about switching to other brands.\n\"Look at all the shops out there on the street. It would be tough to do the Apple business this year,\" she said. \"It might be better if you do Huawei.\"\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:18:48.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
