It will involve firing warning shots upon spotting suspicious movements at the International Border (IB). Any retaliation, including mortar shelling, will only take place after the newly established communication channels have been “exhausted”. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh today met a delegation of Pakistan Rangers, led by its Director General Major General Umar Farooq Burki, which had called on him. The Pakistan Rangers are here for the Director General-level talks with the Border Security Force (BSF). The Home Minister conveyed to the delegation that India would not fire the first bullet across the border. Stressing forces or civilians should not be targeted on either side, he said India wanted “cordial relations with Pakistan” as the government followed the policy of peace with its neighbours. Responding, Burki said Pakistan also wanted to have cordial relations with India and would follow the decisions taken in the meeting. He said there could have been some incidents at the border where firing took place due to misunderstanding or by mistake. Discussions between the two forces continued on the second day today. A BSF officer, privy to the meeting today, explained about the firing protocol. He said if there’s firing from one side, the other side would immediately try to contact and find out the reason. If the side which opened fire is not able to respond within an hour, only then will there be retaliation. “The other aspect is that if all the levels of communication fail, only then will mortar firing be resorted to,” said the officer. The new levels of communication have been established at the level of Commandant, Deputy Inspector General and Director General, in the form of mobile phones, email and fax.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T22:47:15.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
