The big ships are coming. They’re no surprise. They didn’t sneak up on us. We’ve been talking about them for years.” \nThe Maersk Line executive believes that larger ships are an appropriate response to ‘deflationary rates’, adding: “I think that’s something that is just a reality. All carriers have to find a way to reduce costs and reducing your average slot cots is a big element of that. \n“I think big ships are an opportunity, and like it or not there are going to be more of them.” \nThe growth in ship sizes has accelerated massively in the last few decades, with the growth rate reaching as much as 1200% since 1968. \nNow that big ships are becoming more of a reality at ports and terminals, other methods of adapting to them must be considered, such as carrier-terminal collaboration, more streamlined vessel-stowage activities and greater communication between cargo owners across the supply chain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:01:23.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
