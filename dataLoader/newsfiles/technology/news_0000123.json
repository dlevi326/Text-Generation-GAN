Puyat Avenue and Jupiter Street in Makati City opens its doors again to the public as a must-experience venue for its “Countdown to Christmas: Celebrating the Regions” beginning September 21 until December 18.\nThis Yuletide countdown will showcase the best tourism products and services of the Philippines’ 16 regions for a period of two weeks each. It will be the tourism regions’ yearly showcase during the Christmas season by promoting their diverse cultures through vignette fiesta performances, native arts and crafts, locally processed and packed food products as well as travel packages featuring both popular and emerging tourist destinations. The kick-off is also in time for the tourism month.\nThis year, the focus will be on Community-based Ecotourism (CBET) sites with their products and services. There will be a travel consultant or concierge to share information and give professional advice to visitors. The building’s ground and second floors will be converted into an Eco Store where the regions’ native products, especially gifts for Christmas, will be on sale on said duration.\nTourism Secretary Ramon R. Jimenez, Jr. remarked, “The Philippines holds the distinction of having the longest Christmas season in the world, starting early in September and even lasting until January 6 or the feast of the Three Kings. The success of this project which debuted last year inspired us to continue and give our foreign and local tourists alike a glimpse how Christmas is celebrated across the archipelago and how our brand of fun becomes more vivid this time of the year.”\n“No need to do heavy shopping when you travel out-of-town during the holidays. Through the ‘Countdown to Christmas: Celebrating the Regions,’ we are bringing the best local products and tour packages for the most affordable price right here for the next three months. This is our humble way of bringing Yuletide’s good cheers and warmest greetings to all Filipinos and our visitors,” says Undersecretary Maria Victoria V. Jasmin of the Tourism Regulation, Coordination and Resource Generation (TRCRG) sector.\nThe clusters which will be on display are: Metro Manila (September 21-October 2), Southern Luzon (October 5-16), Mindanao (October 19-30), Northern Luzon (November 3-13), Visayas (November 16-27), and One Philippines: All Regions (November 30-December 18).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T16:03:35.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
