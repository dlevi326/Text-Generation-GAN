This headset detection IC is targeted at cost- and power-sensitive consumer electronics such as mobile phones, tablet computers and media players. The integration of a comparator, OR gate and N-channel MOSFET into a miniature package enables the connection of a headset with microphone to be quickly and simply detected. \nThe AZV5001 has two detect inputs that together determine when a headset has been inserted into the equipment’s audio jack. The presence of a left audio signal drives the internal comparator output low, which when logically OR’ed with a ground connection from the jack will result in a low output from the IC, indicating the headset is properly connected. Internal pull-up resistors on both detect inputs ensure that connection is not indicated when either signal is absent. When a headphone is not detected, an on-chip N-channel MOSFET is enabled, which can be used to mute the microphone input to the equipment’s audio codec. \nA miniature 6-pin 1.2mm x 1.0mm x 0.4mm DFN1210H4-6 package helps the AZV5001 reduce board space. A low supply current, typically 7.5μA when operating from a 1.8V supply, reduces system power consumption while low voltage operation, down to 1.6V, is also supported.
