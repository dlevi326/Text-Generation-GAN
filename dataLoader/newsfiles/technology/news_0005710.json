Keeping that in mind, it has (or had) decent specs which make it a well-rounded smartphone at a budget. Perhaps you would consider it for your second phone? - Advertisement - \nYu which is a sub-division of the popular Indian manufacturer Micromax decided to spring a few surprises with this deal. For starters, the entire Yu lineup was particularly made as a partnership with the Cyanogen modding community. This allows users to fully modify the device to their needs, but not with Yunique you don’t. It’s still fine if you don’t like to tweak with your smartphone and want to use it as it is with slight customization here and there. Or if you don’t have the luxury of time to be testing out which mod works best for you. \nTo kick things off, Yunique which earlier debuted on September 15 th sold off their entire first batch in just 9 seconds. We don’t have the exact figure how many smartphones were sold, but that has to be with the inexpensive pricing to begin with. \nSo without further ado, let’s check out its specs shall we? Coming in with a body measurement of 134.5 x 67.5 x 8.3 mm (5.30 x 2.66 x 0.33 in) and weighing in at 128 g (4.52 oz), Yunique surely is thin and light indeed. \nSporting a 4.7-inch HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 720 x 1280 pixels or ~312 ppi pixel density, it might have felt as though it got stuck in time 2-3 years back. But to think of it, it is still relevant these days because some users do not want a huge screen to begin with. As an added bonus, there’s also Gorilla Glass 3 available which is great stuff. \nAs we move on to what’s powering up Yunique, we can find the Qualcomm MSM8916 Snapdragon 410 chipset, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, Adreno 306 graphics and 1GB RAM. Although not the best out there, it won’t have any issues to run your favorite social media apps and some light browsing. To play intensive 3D games is a big no-no here. - Advertisement - \nCamera-wise, there’s the 8MP-2MP setup which again should be able to satisfy your basic needs in taking photos. It will still look good as you proceed to share your favorite moments with family and friends. \nWhat about storage then? Yunique comes with 8GB of internal storage which might seem a little, thankfully there’s a microSD slot available which you can put in a maximum 32GB SD card which is good. \nAs far as battery is concerned, there is a quite smallish non-removable Li-Po 2000 mAh battery supplying juice to it. But that’s still ok considering that it won’t be as power hungry as others. According to the manufacturer, it has a standby time of 271 hours which is ~11 days. \nBy ditching the Cyanogen mod, Yu has decided to go with just Android Lollipop 5.1 for this smartphone. Not sure why because we thought the whole reason Yu was setup was to allow their devices to use Cyanogen mod. Did we sense any problems between the two over here? But still, the latest OS does bring all the latest improvements and bug fixes and is nice to have. \nTo top it all off, Yunique does have 4G LTE connectivity and dual sim capability which further elevates its status. - Advertisement - \nIt really is perplexing to know that Yu Yunique is selling at that kind of unbelievable price. No wonder people are frantically lining up to buy this smartphone and it is, a no-brainer thing to have the specs at that kind of price. If you want to try your luck in getting yourself one, the next sale is expected to be on September 22 nd . \nYu Yunique is available for $4,999 Indian Rupee or ~$79 USD. It is only available in black color, though. News From", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T17:36:45.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
