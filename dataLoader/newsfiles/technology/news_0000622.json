MTN’s announcement comes days after Cell C said it was spending R427m in the Western Cape. Vodacom is also spending R180m in selected areas in the Western Cape.\nLast year Vodacom completed a R1bn network investment in the Western Cape to increase speed, capacity, range and improve signal clarity.\nMTN said its high-speed network, which was capable of delivering speeds of up to 100 megabits per second, would provide residents in La Lucia with multiple benefits including the ability to stream high-definition videos, play online games, home automation and the remote surveillance of their homes and businesses.\nGlobal research firm Ovum stated in a report released on Monday that the majority of fixed-line consumer broadband users surveyed in 30 countries including SA, needed a download speed of at least 10 megabits per second.\nMichael Philpott, co-author of the report, said \"demand on broadband services provided to consumers is compounded by the rise in connected devices\".\n\"Homes in mature markets were found to typically have up to four devices connected to the network, all of which have the potential to support a wide range of applications,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=MTN", "http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=VOD"], "published": "2015-09-16T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T13:54:04.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
