The amoeba entered his nasal passages and made its way into his brain.\nRiley's cousin Jennifer Hohman said in a statement Sunday he was taken to Texas Children's Hospital and placed in a medically induced coma until tests proved he had lost all brain function and couldn't breathe without support.\nThe hospital disconnected the ventilator Sunday. Hohman confirmed that he died.\nHealth officials say the amoeba infected 35 people in the U.S. between 2005 and 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:50:49.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
