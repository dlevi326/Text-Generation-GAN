But because the cost to do so can run into the millions of dollars, it prices out many potential competitors from using the NBN.\nMr Morrow admitted today that because of Australia’s size, about 40 of these hubs were more expensive for many retailers to connect to but that the NBN was looking into ways to reduce the costs.\n“What’s on our minds is whether this will present a barrier to entry that might limit retail offers, and in turn limit choice,” Mr Morrow said.\n“If this turns out to be the case, there are a number of options we could explore to boost competition. However before we do anything, our preference would be to see the market respond.\n“We are working with others who see a market opportunity by solving this remote regional point of entry (issue). At the end of the day, it’s about levelling the playing field and ensuring there is a low barrier to entry and we would hope the markets will do just this.”\nWhether or not the nation’s larger internet providers come to the table and work with NBN to help smaller retailers connect to the network remains to be seen. Telcos like Telstra, Optus, TPG Telecom and M2 Group have made substantial investments to connect to these hubs and are understood to strongly oppose any changes.\nMr Morrow also used his speech to talk about how the NBN would create a “seismic digital eruption” by providing a platform to inject innovation as a real economic contributor.\n“No-one knows this better than our new prime minister. He’s spoken many times of the fact that convergence and globalisation offer much more competition, but they also offer us much more opportunity,” Mr Morrow said.\n“At the end of the day, the NBN will be the backbone of the digital economy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:35:51.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
