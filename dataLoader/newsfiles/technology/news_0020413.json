Fiksu Mobile Audience Platform puts an enormous store of proprietary data to work for brands, agencies and app advertisers, with dynamic segmentation tools and the ability to create and reach valuable target audiences, at scale, across the mobile ecosystem. \nAs a result of the incredible shift of consumer time spent on mobile, and the influx of corresponding data -- unimaginable in other mediums -- today's marketers need a new breed of advertising technology to harness its massive potential. Fiksu's platform and data management tools incorporate information from multiple sources: its own massive collection of mobile-native data, clients' first-party data about existing customers and prospects, and third-party data from leading providers. Once this data is all in one place, the Fiksu Mobile Audience Platform continually refreshes and turns out smart segmentation suggestions to deliver more valuable, actionable audiences. Turning all that data into audiences is the key to helping brands and app advertisers take advantage of the pervasiveness of mobile. \n\"Audience is the hinge of any advertising campaign in any media, from TV to digital. On mobile devices, however, audience is more than just a proxy for promising customer prospects. The integral role that mobile devices play in our daily lives has enabled marketers to deliver relevant messages to large numbers of customers,\" said Scott Denne, research analyst at 451 Research. \"The improvements we are seeing in audience segmenting and targeting technologies are bringing marketers closer than ever to the adage 'right audience, right message, right time.'\" \nFiksu's unique access to both the advertising and measurement APIs on Facebook and Twitter, along with programmatic access to Google, Yahoo!, and leading RTB exchanges like MoPub, Ad-X, Rubicon, and more, ensures advertisers can reach audiences wherever they are. That reach also allows for reduced costs by targeting consumers on the most cost-effective channels first, while maximizing volume over the long run. \n\"In our initial roll-out of mobile ad campaigns with Fiksu Mobile Audience Platform, we were incredibly impressed with the value delivered from the very specific audiences we targeted,\" said Peter Knudson, Senior Product Manager at Activision. \"It's clear that Fiksu understands and can help us grow our mobile games portfolio in both scale and quality of players.\" \nFiksu Mobile Audience Platform is built on a foundation of channel-independent data, unmatched in the industry: over 320 times as many data points as the number of pages Google has indexed, and growing by more than a trillion per month. Fiksu's data comes from real user behaviors on over 2.6 billion mobile devices across the globe. \nThe core of the platform is built on that data: Fiksu Mobile Personas, a collection of 250 unique advertising personas, or pre-defined sets of users with similar mobile behavior patterns. These personas contain anywhere from one to 50 million users, with an average of 23 million. Fiksu Mobile Personas are comprised of commonly sought after groups of consumers including Millennials, frequent mobile shoppers, travelers, mobile casino players, and more. \nIn addition, Fiksu Mobile Audience Platform lets advertisers take advantage of the data they already have, either on its own or in combination with Fiksu Personas and third-party data. Fiksu can put the valuable data advertisers have locked up in their CRM systems or web site logs to work for re-engagement campaigns or loyalty marketing, maximizing customer lifetime value. \n\"Mobile should be at the center of how all brands engage with their consumers,\" said Micah Adler, president, CEO and founder of Fiksu. \"Advertisers realize that mobile data allows a deeper, more scalable type of tailored messaging than has ever been possible. A solution like our mobile audience platform allows them to elevate their marketing strategy and address the entire customer journey.\" \nFor more about Fiksu Mobile Audience Platform visit https://www.fiksu.com/technology/mobile-audience-platform. \nAbout Fiksu \nFiksu is a data-fueled mobile marketing technology company that connects brands, agencies, and app advertisers to precise audiences throughout the customer journey.
