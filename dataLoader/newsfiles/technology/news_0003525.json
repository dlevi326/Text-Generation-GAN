Similar to Instagram but specifically for fashion and with a buy button, it’s a virtual dressing room on the user’s phone. \n“I suppose that scene in Clueless where the computer puts an outfit together from Cher's wardrobe really stayed with me.“ says Alexa Chung. “Clothes are fun, making mistakes is fun, being inspired is fun. VILLOID celebrates the process of getting dressed and showing your friends.” \nVILLOID offers users a platform where they can share their style by uploading products and photographs onto a mood board, follow friends and fellow style mavericks, love boards and individual items. For anything they can't live without – there is the option to click the handy buy button and purchase the item. Consider this the paper dolls for the modern age. \nIt’s the British style guru’s first delve into the world of technology, an area she didn’t know a vast amount about when she teamed up with tech entrepreneur Jeanette Dyhre Kvisvik and her team who had been working with a similar idea. \n“Alexa and I immediately bonded, merging our ideas and utilizing her style genius, we have managed to make the best dressed app on the market.” says Dyhre Kvisvik. \n“I wanted to get to learn something about a field I knew nothing about and I felt I could offer the tech field something I knew a lot about….clothes. Most decisions I make when it comes to new projects are based on whether it could further my education. The tech world was something I was incredibly curious about. Silicone Valley sounds like a bouncy castle I want to play on.” says Alexa Chung \nThink of window shopping as a social game, only this time it exists in the palm of your hand. VILLOID offers an opportunity to view a curated feed of style choices chosen by you, the user. Take yourself on a journey into the VILLOID world, discover people, endless brands and ways of pairing items together that until now, only ever existed in your mind. \nEarly adopters of VILLOID include model and singer Pixie Geldof who has already crowned VILLOID as “the most addictive app in life.” One Direction hair stylist Lou Teasdale and British designer Ashley Williams are also devotees. And it’s not just the girls who are fans, British X-Factor judge Nicholas Grimshaw also spoke of his need for a men’s version of the app when he posted on his Instagram: ‘Congratulations to Alexa who is this generation’s Tom from MySpace. Can I do the menswear one? Please employ me @chungalexa’ Watch this space. \nThe app is now available in App store globally. The Android version is in planning, set to launch late 2015/early 2016. \nThis information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.com Contacts \nFor more information or images, contactMagnus S.
