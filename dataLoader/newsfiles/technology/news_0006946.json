It was prompted by protesters' around-the-clock presence to prevent construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope.\nProtesters say officers hauled them away while they were praying. In video footage provided by the state, officers are seen walking toward a group of people huddled in a circle and chanting. A man's voice is heard saying, \"Eh, they're praying you guys, they're praying.\"\nThe footage shows officers putting plastic handcuffs on women and putting them into the back of a vehicle. \"Why do I have to have my hands behind my back?\" a woman asked. \"Because you'll be placed in restraints, ma'am,\" an officer responded.\nOfficers had to pry the arrested man, Bronson Kobayashi , 23, off the roof of a wood-and-straw hut. Four officers carried him away. He couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\nHis bail was set at $1,000 because he's a repeat offender, the state said. Bail for the women was set at $250.\nThe emergency rule, in place for 120 days, is intended to make the mountain safe for protesters, visitors and workers of the 13 telescopes already on the mountain, the state said. Attorney General Doug Chin told the land board that even though camping is already prohibited on the mountain, a targeted rule is necessary because of bad behavior by some protesters — ranging from putting boulders in the road to threats and harassment — created unsafe conditions.\nThe nonprofit company building the Thirty Meter Telescope hasn't indicated when there will be another attempt to resume construction. Workers weren't able reach the site during two previous attempts when they were blocked by hundreds of protesters, including dozens who were arrested.\nThis was the fourth time telescope opponents have been arrested on the mountain.\nUniversity of Hawaii law school professor Williamson Chang has filed a lawsuit seeking to repeal the rule, arguing it prevents telescope opponents from legally exercising their right to peacefully protest.\n__\nFollow Jennifer Sinco Kelleher at http://www.twitter.com/JenHapa .", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://www.twitter.com/JenHapa", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-10T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T03:48:28.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
