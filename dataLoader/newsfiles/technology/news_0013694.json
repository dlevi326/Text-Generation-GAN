Dunlop Baghdad (AFP) Sept 20, 2015 Hungary activists race to help migrants by smartphone Budapest (AFP) Sept 19, 2015 - As migrants are shunted by countries between borders on trains and buses, a team of Hungarian activists are racing to send them accurate information, straight to their pockets on mobile phones.\n\"Bewildered people don't know what is happening to them, they are starved of information -- sometimes deliberately, if it suits the authorities,\" says Nina Kov, one half of a husband-and-wife team who dreamed up InfoAid, a free smartphone app available in six languages. \n\"We are sending anyone who downloads it the latest news on border closures, who is bussing from where to where, the latest asylum procedures, news on Hungary's new laws and so on,\" she told AFP during an interview in Budapest. \nEnlisting the help of two friends to code the app, InfoAid was ready to go in two days around two weeks ago, the urgency triggered by what Kov calls \"misinformation by the Hungarian authorities\". \nEarlier this month, when migrants crowded onto a train in Budapest, many said later they thought it was going to Austria -- only for it to halt at a refugee camp not far from the capital. \n\"It is one thing that they were not getting proper information in Hungary, but to be apparently misled was really outrageous,\" Kov says. \nSince then, as events have moved rapidly on the ground from borders between Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, and back to Hungary, the team have been scrambling to keep up, now working closely with Croatian activists. \nOnce users download the Android-based software to their phones, they can select one of six languages: Arabic, Urdu, Pashto, Farsi, English and Hungarian. \n\"If we can find more translators we can add more languages. Greek is next in line so that activists there can let refugees heading north what to expect,\" Kov said. \nOne of the two coders behind the app -- 28-year-old Afghan-Hungarian Enys Mones, who Kov calls the \"brains\" of the operation -- told AFP there are already 700 daily active users, and around 100 new ones every day. \n\"One user can then spread the word, so more and more people are getting real-time info,\" Kov says. \nA half-Hungarian born in Paris, 34-year-old Kov says her ethnic-German grandfather was forced to leave his home in Romania in 1946, while her Russian father swapped \"anti-Russian\" Hungary for France in the late-1970s. \n\"Everyone in Europe has refugee blood, if you look deep enough inside,\" she says. \nAli's friends told him to bring a life jacket, so the young Iraqi man headed to a Baghdad sports shop and bought a bright orange one with a whistle attached. \nHe wore shorts and a T-shirt, but was not planning a vacation or a day at the beach. Ali sees no future for himself in Iraq and intends to make the perilous sea journey to Europe that has claimed thousands of lives this year. \nThe trip by sea in overcrowded boats begins on the Turkish coast more than 1,500 kilometres (930 miles) from Baghdad, but Ali and other Iraqis are preparing in advance, driving a major increase in life jacket sales. \nBorn the year Saddam Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait, Ali lived through that war, a decade of punishing sanctions, years of fighting between US-led forces and insurgents, and the conflict with the Islamic State jihadist group, which overran large parts of Iraq last year. \nHe has had enough. \n\"I want to immigrate to any place that is better than this country,\" Ali said. \"Greece, Germany... any country.\" \n\"The important thing is that I leave Iraq, because there is no life in Iraq,\" he said. \"There is no safety in Iraq... and no employment.\" \nSome of his friends already reached Greece and have encouraged him to come as well, telling him to bring a life jacket when he does. \nSmugglers may not provide enough life jackets, and while estimates of costs vary, they are said to be much cheaper in Iraq than in Turkey. \nMany Iraqis are making the trip, with more than 9,000 arriving in Greece between January and the end of August this year, the fifth-largest group by nationality, according to the International Organisation for Migration. \nBut travelling to Europe by sea carries deadly risks: more than 2,800 people have died in the Mediterranean this year, including over 380 from the Middle East and North Africa, the IOM said. \n- Unprecedented demand - \nIraqi children are among those who have died at sea, and the Islamic State group has even used the shocking image of drowned Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi, who washed up on a beach in Turkey, to warn refugees against fleeing to the West. \nAli is not the only Iraqi heading to Baghdad's Rashid Street, where many of the city's sports shops are located, to buy life jackets for the trip to Europe. \nShopkeepers and employees on the street say sales of life jackets have reached a level they have not seen before. \n\"In general, demand for life jackets was higher than any year\" previously, said Jawad Tawfiq, a shop owner who has sold sporting goods for some 30 years. \nBut Tawfiq, who lived in the Netherlands for more than 15 years before returning to Iraq, warns young people against viewing Europe as a magic solution to their woes. \n\"I advise the young people not to (emigrate). What is their future there?\" said Tawfiq, noting that racism in Europe has increased and finding work can be difficult. \nAmer, who works at another shop, said he tells customers the life jackets he sells are not designed for use at sea -- information that deters some buyers, but not all. \nWhile some Iraqis are purchasing life jackets to increase their odds of safely arriving in Europe, others are practicing swimming to do the same. \nAli Mahdi Alwan, a 52-year-old former member of the Iraqi army club swimming team, is providing lessons to some of those seeking to reach Europe by sea. \nFifteen people received swimming training from him before leaving Iraq, Alwan said on the bank of the Tigris River. \n\"This is the second group that I am training now, and their families are waiting,\" he said, pointing to a group of boys swimming in the river. \n\"Swimming helps you -- it helps you in wars, it helps you in travel, it helps you anywhere,\" Alwan said. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:43:42.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
