That compared with a 5.1 percent decline in the MSCI India Mid-Cap index this year, and a 2.1 percent gain over the past year.\nPOCKETS OF STRENGTH\nWith developed markets' growth improving and Asia slowing, betting on companies tied to the former may not seem like a bad strategy.\nBut Asia is still the fastest growing region in the world. The International Monetary Fund forecasts Asia will expand 6.6 percent this year compared with the pedestrian pace of 2.5 percent for the U.S. and 1.5 percent for the euro zone.\nAnd the region has pockets of growth, which domestically focused businesses are exploiting, van der Linde said.\nFor instance, while China is slowing, retail sales rose 10.8 percent in August.\nSporting goods retailer Li Ning Co. is benefitting, with shares up 3.7 percent this year, versus a 9.2 percent drop in the benchmark CSI300 index.\nOnly two of the 10 biggest companies on the main regional MSCI benchmark, Tencent and China Mobile, have a significant domestic focus. Four - Samsung Electronics , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Hon Hai Precision and C. K. Hutchison - are major exporters or have large overseas operations.\nIn the small cap index, four of the 10 biggest companies are almost entirely domestically focused. The three with the biggest overseas exposure - Hong Kong-listed VTech Holdings and Esprit Holdings, and Singapore-based electronics services provider Venture Corp. - maintain a large local presence.\n\"The main stock market indices around the globe are generally constructed based on market capitalization, which will not necessarily reflect the proportionate economic footprint,\" said Sabrina Callin, global head of equity product management at PIMCO in Newport Beach, California.\nBut getting to know small companies is often not worthwhile for large funds, HSBC's van der Linde said, noting that many of them do not meet funds' liquidity requirements.\nInvesting even a miniscule proportion of their substantial assets in a small company could also leave these investors with a larger stake than they like.\nThe price they pay, however, is not getting the benefits of the domestic growth story.\n\"Merely constructing a portfolio in relation to a specific index is, in our mind, the wrong approach,\" said Matthew Vaight, portfolio manager of global emerging markets equity at M&G Investments in London.\n\"There's no point in holding shares in a company you don't like just because it's in an index.\"\n(Reporting By Nichola Saminather; Editing by Nachum Kaplan & Shri Navaratnam)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T10:51:48.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
