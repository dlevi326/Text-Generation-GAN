Source: ThinkStock \nMINORITY Christian groups have predicted the world will end later this month when, they say, a ‘blood moon’ will cause an apocalyptic meteor strike. \nScientists state that a ‘blood moon’ will occur on September 28 as the moon passes into the shadow of the earth cast by the Sun (a lunar eclipse) it appears copper red in colour. \nThis will be the fourth ‘blood moon’ since April 15 last year and Christians, in particular minority American groups, say it will bring about global destruction. \nThe ‘blood moon’ is the fourth and final eclipse in a tetrad — four consecutive total lunar eclipses, each separated by six lunar months — which fulfils biblical prophecy of the apocalypse. NASA deny any evidence of a meteor that may impact on Earth. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nWhen promoting his 2013 book Four Blood Moons , Cornerstone Church founder John Hagee , of San Antonio, Texas, said that the tetrad was a signal being sent by God. \n“The coming four blood moons points to a world-shaking event that will happen between April 2014 and October 2015,” he said. \nHagee, whose book was the ninth biggest seller in the US in March last year, and El Shaddai Ministries ’ Pastor Mark Blitz claim that the blood moon on September 28 heralds the end of the world and the second coming \nThey, and others, cite passages from the Bible to justify their fears. \nJoel 2:31 states: “And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.” \nActs 2:20: “The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.” \nRevelation 6:12: “(...) and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood”. The doomsayers say that the end of the world and a second coming is predicted in the Bible.
