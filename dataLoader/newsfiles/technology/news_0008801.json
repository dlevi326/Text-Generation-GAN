Now, timing is on his side.\nThe short seller notched gains in three hedge funds during August as China's stock market plunged and investors fretted that the world's second-largest economy may be in worse shape than many had thought. For Mr Chanos, easily Wall Street's most vocal naysayer on China, the developments marked a long-awaited dollop of vindication.\n\"The story has yet to play out,\" he said in July, before the worst of the news gripped markets. \"As long as China adds credit faster than its growth, the real story is months and years ahead.\"\nAt his Kynikos Associates LP, the Kynikos Opportunity fund, which bets on and against stocks, returned 4 per cent in August and was up nearly 10 per cent through the first eight months of the year, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal . The Ursus and Kriticos funds, which bet only against stocks, gained 6.2 per cent and 8.2 per cent in August, according to the document.\nThose same funds lost money for three straight years starting in 2012 as markets rose, according to another document. Kynikos recently started marketing a fourth fund.\nMr Chanos told the Journal in July that 20 per cent of his firm's global funds, Kriticos and Kynikos Opportunity, had bearish Chinese positions and that those bets had made money since being placed. Kynikos can get paid performance fees even when it loses money as long as it outperforms its benchmarks. Kynikos's short, or negative, energy bets have also driven profits recently and are larger than its bearish Chinese wagers, said a person familiar with the matter.\nThe dynamics underlying Mr Chanos's recent turnaround appear to be boosting more broadly the fortunes of short sellers, who bet against companies they consider fads, frauds or failures. Their strategy can backfire if a company's shares rise instead of fall.\nShort-biased funds lost an average 35.3 per cent in total from 2012 to 2014, according to research firm HFR Inc. The S&P 500 gained 75.5 per cent, including dividends, over the period.\nBut the funds broke into positive territory this year on the back of a volatile August, turning in the best monthly performance of any hedge-fund strategy, according to HFR. They are now up an average 1.1 per cent through August compared with a 2.9 per cent loss, including dividends, by the S&P 500.\nOther recent winners include New York-based Dialectic Capital Management LLC, whose short-biased Antithesis fund is up for the year through August after a 9.5 per cent gain last month following three straight years of losses, according to a person familiar with the firm. Another Dialectic fund is also up for the year after recent gains.\nShort sellers face the challenges of retaining clients during losing periods and managing their bearish positions, which investors say is generally trickier than maintaining bullish stock bets. That's partly because there is no limit to how far a stock price can rise; the higher the price, the more costly it is to close out a bearish wager.\nThe years 2012 and 2013 were particularly tough for short sellers because of the rush into stocks amid accommodative monetary policies, said Dialectic co-founder John Fichthorn -- as the moves helped lift stocks across the board. That wholesale move \"has materially changed\" recently, Mr Fichthorn said.\nMr Chanos, 57 years old, gained fame as a short seller by predicting the fall of Enron Corp. before the energy giant filed for bankruptcy in 2001. The former Wall Street analyst started Kynikos, Greek for \"cynic,\" in 1985 with $US16 million. In the 1990s, he won the financial backing of the Ziff brothers, known for early investments in hedge-fund managers, including William Ackman and Daniel Och.\nOutsize gains during the financial crisis, including a 62 per cent gain in Ursus in 2008, added to his reputation. Clients and other investors flock to a winter gathering he regularly hosts in Miami called \"Bears in Hibernation,\" where he discusses his investments based on analyses of companies' filings.\nSince at least 2010, Mr Chanos has warned of a coming Chinese collapse from what he called an overheated property market fueled by unsustainable levels of debt. He has said he shorted companies at risk if China's economy slumps, such as iron-ore shares in Australia and casino companies in Macau. He has never visited mainland China and doesn't speak Mandarin, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nMr Chanos has also shorted H-shares, or the stock of mainland Chinese companies trading in Hong Kong.\nThose wagers didn't look like winners for a long time, as H-shares rose steadily along with many markets around the world. Kynikos's assets under management shrank to $US2.5 billion earlier this year from about $US6 billion in 2010. The firm now manages $US3.4 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:15:42.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
