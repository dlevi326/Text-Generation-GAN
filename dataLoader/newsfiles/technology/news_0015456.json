Over the years, the project that was launched on social media platform Twitter, has grown into the country’s biggest online book club with more than 30 000 followers. \nDitshego, 30, who grew up in Kagiso township in Johannesburg, has been recognised by Forbes as one of 30 African entrepreneurs under the age of 30 who are game changers in their fields. \n“We see Read a Book SA as a disruptive innovation and essentially we’re making it more convenient for book lovers to interact about their current reading material. \n“There are over 18 million South Africans on social media, so by utilising Twitter and Facebook we are making it easier for them to be a part of a book club,” says Ditshego. \nFollowers are encouraged to read a book a month and then “twitpic” a mini review of the book, as well as recommend books to other followers. \n“We started out simply by inviting people to check out the initiative. Read a Book SA is a catchy name and it wasn’t the first time I had started a popular social media campaign. I had already gained the necessary insights from studying communications at the University of Johannesburg and also from having marketing experience, so I was confident that it would become as big as it is today,” he explains. \nEncouraged by his parents, Ditshego started reading books at a young age. \n“The seeds which were planted that made me an avid reader started when my mother Elsie Ditshego was pregnant with me. While she was studying at tertiary level, she would read out loud to me. When I was born, my interest in reading books for leisure was also inspired by my father Sam Ditshego who so loves reading that he built a library in our home,” he says. \n“I enjoy reading because it helps me in my career. My vocabulary, concentration span and creativity constantly improves due to reading books and with the hectic schedule which comes with being an entrepreneur, it also helps to reduce stress.” \n\nDitshego often reads three books simultaneously and it takes him about two weeks to finish a book. He is currently reading The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch and The New Korea: An Inside Look at South Korea’s Economic Rise by Myung Oak Kim and Sam Jaffe. \nRead a Book SA has partnered with Vodacom which has financed eReader libraries in their communication centres across the country, making reading more accessible to people. \nThe library is equipped with a series of Kindle eBooks recommended by the Read a Book community and is free to the public. \n“In future we’re planning on building mobile applications where users can access reading material at a minimal fee if we obtain enough commitment from potential sponsors,” says Ditshego. \nFollow Read a Book SA on Twitter at @ReadaBookSA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T13:17:21.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
