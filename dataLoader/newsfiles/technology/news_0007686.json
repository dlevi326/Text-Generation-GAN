Plainlegal clients, law firms and corporate legal departments, have already been migrated to Alt Legal’s domain so they will have no interruption or change in their software due to the rebranding process. \nFounder and CEO Nehal Madhani comments: “Plainlegal has had incredible success simplifying the preparation and management of IP for lawyers. However, because our company has grown and evolved significantly, we needed to rebrand. As of today, we are officially Alt Legal, a name which reflects our commitment to pioneering an alternative way for intellectual property professionals to practice IP law.” \nHe further explains: “We don’t believe in offering expensive legacy software, requiring long-term contracts or charging extra fees for technology, training, support or data migration. Alt Legal's innovative software automates IP docketing to eliminate repetitive work and prevent missed filing deadlines. We will continue to provide the same powerful, intuitive software backed by exceptional customer support.” \nAbout Alt Legal, Inc. \nAlt Legal, Inc. is a New York City-based legal software company started by Nehal Madhani, a lawyer who left a top-tier international law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, taught himself programming, and created Alt Legal (previously known as Plainlegal).
