With digital platforms transforming every other creative industry from video to music, Pronoun meets the need for authors who seek technology to help them create, distribute, and intelligently market their work without sacrificing control or paying exorbitant fees. \n“The publishing industry treats authors like cogs in its machine – not as the creative foundation upon which their long-standing businesses are built,” said Josh Brody, Chief Executive Officer, Pronoun. “With Pronoun, we put authors at the heart of every decision we make as we invest in the power of technology to transform this market. Digital platforms are paving the way for creators across every media industry. We believe books are next.” \nUnlike any other digital book publishing platform, with Pronoun authors pay no upfront costs, sell on all major retailer channels, and retain 100% of their books’ earnings after standard retailer fees. As the most author-friendly publishing model, Pronoun enables bestselling writers and first-time novelists alike to publish for free immediately, without handing over their earnings or control over their rights, and with no gatekeeper approval. \n“We’re clearing away more than a hundred years of dust that has settled on the publishing industry and its business model. Over the past few years, our team built a platform that respects everything we love about books, but embraces the new reality of how people discover, purchase, and read them,” said Ben Zhuk, Chief Product Officer, Pronoun. “With Pronoun, authors get the control and support they need so they can spend more time doing what they love – writing.” \nAt launch, Pronoun lets authors: Create Beautiful Digital Books: Convert an edited manuscript to a professionally designed ebook that is compatible with every e-reader and mobile device.
