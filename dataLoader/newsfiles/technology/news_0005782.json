Yours faithfully Ch. Darwin”.\nDarwin, who passed away two years later, is still regarded as the greatest naturalist of his age.\nThere were rumours he converted to Christianity on his deathbed but they were denied by his daughter.\nMcDermott kept his word and his eye-opening letter from Darwin remained unknown to scholars for the next 100 years.\nThe letter will be sold by Bonhams at its History of Science and Technology auction on September 21 in New York.\nIt has been given a guide price of £45,000 - £60,000.\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-09-10T04:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:44:40.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
