PSII is an extremely large membrane protein complex consisting of 20 subunits with a total molecular mass of 700 kDa for a dimer. The catalytic center for water-splitting is a Mn 4 CaO 5 -cluster organized as an asymmetric, distorted chair form embedded within the protein matrix of PSII. \nThe crystal structure of cyanobacterial PSII has previously been reported at a resolution of 1.9 Å using synchrotron radiation (SR) X-rays. However, due to the intense and continuous SR X-rays, the Mn 4 CaO 5 -cluster has been suggested to suffer from radiation damage, leading to slight changes in the inter-atomic distances within the cluster. \nNow, a joint team led by Jian-Ren Shen at Okayama University, and Masaki Yamamoto and Hedeo Ago at the RIKEN SPring-8 Center, has solved the damage-free crystal structure of PSII at 1.95 Å resolution using the femtosecond X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) provided by SACLA, an XFEL facility located within the same campus of SPring-8. \nThe research group prepared a large number of highly isomorphous, high quality, large sized PSII crystals, and used the femtosecond XFEL pulses to collect diffraction data from a fresh volume of the crystals after illumination by each pulse. In this way, completely damage-free diffraction data was collected, allowing the analysis of the structure by the \"diffraction before destruction\" approach. \nThe structure obtained revealed the precise inter-atomic distances within the Mn 4 CaO 5 -cluster, enabling the mechanism of water-splitting to be examined in more detail. Based on the structure of the native Mn 4 CaO 5 -cluster, a research team consisting of scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Free University Berlin (Germany), and Okayama University (Jian-Ren Shen) has succeeded in synthesizing an artificial compound resembling to a large extent the structure of the native Mn 4 CaO 5 -cluster and exhibiting some distinctive characteristics of the native cluster. \nThese studies not only greatly advance our understanding of the mechanism of photosynthetic water-oxidation, but also are a large step forward towards the development of artificial photosynthesis that will ultimately provide us with a source of clean and renewable energy. \nMore information: \"Native structure of photosystem II at 1.95Å resolution viewed by femtosecond X-ray pulses.\" Nature 517, 99 (2015).
