They want to continue their trip toward Western Europe, with most eventually hoping to reach Germany and other, richer European nations and seek asylum there.\nThe migrants, mostly Syrians fleeing the war at home, boarded the train in Budapest at noon on Thursday, after spending at least two days in Budapest, blocked by police from further travel.\nBut police stopped the train as it headed to Sopron, on Hungary's border with Austria, at Bicske, only 40 kilometres west, and ordered the migrants out, saying they must be registered at a collecting centre for migrants in the town.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:47:11.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
