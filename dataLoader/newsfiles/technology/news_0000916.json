He's now receiving care at a neonatal intensive care unit in Miami.\nMorgan, aged 28, said the baby was due in December, but contractions began on August 31 during a seven-day cruise around the eastern Caribbean. Her doctor approved the cruise to celebrate her daughter's third birthday, Morgan said.\nThe pregnancy had been uneventful, so she was shocked when the contractions began just past the halfway mark in her pregnancy. She thought they might be false labour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:05:45.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
