According to a recently filed class action pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California , C.A. No. 8:15-cv-1560, QLogic falsely failed to disclose that it was being adversely impacted by lower than expected demand due to weakness in its enterprise server and storage markets and that it was being negatively impacted by operational issues, including an inventory build-up at a major OEM customer. On July 30, 2015 , QLogic disclosed that its financial results had been adversely impacted by \"operational issues including an inventory build-up primarily at a major OEM customer. On this news, shares of QLogic fell over 22% in one day. Our investigation concerns whether the Company board of directors has breached its fiduciary duties to shareholders, grossly mismanaged the Company, and/or committed abuses of control in connection with the foregoing.
