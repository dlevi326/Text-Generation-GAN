We believe that as the Young Communist League we should look at the matter before us objectively and with care without attaching emotions to it. A popular view which most people hold is on the basis of damage to property and the risk of persons who might have got hurt in the burnings however neglecting what might have caused the situation to explode out of proportion.\nThe matter at hand is an issue of class and race as perceived by the victims. These entire issues boil down to economic challenges that face majority black South African families every day and this subject families to abject poverty whilst there is hope already created to these families in questions when the children of the working class were admitted to University. YCL has a stance on the release of these comrades so that negotiations would continue and Westville students can be represented fully.\nIt is indeed true that there is a public outcry from various people within our society for reasons mentioned above but we have to address these with responsibilities given to us and in saying that, let us allow the courts to carry out their constitutional mandate which is known to us all living in South Africa without jumping into their roles. There are already judgments made against those detainees in prison (Westville) by various members of the University by refusing to employ a legal representative for another co-governor colleague who has been arrested while executing his responsibilities entrusted to him by students and a document of council by students (SRC Constitution). We will not dwell on the facts because the matter is still before the court but the University by merely refusing to help a student representative is worrying. Our point is that if ordinary members of the public make a predetermination regarding the outcomes or the supposedly outcomes of the court using emotions and being spread to many people, it undermines the very essence of existence of these courts. It makes it difficult for people to adhere to the law because they are made to believe whatever by those who want a certain perception to prevail as a court judgment. If the outcomes don’t cater for their wishes but are based on the rule of law, courts will then be pointed with fingers. Let us protect the judiciary.\nOur current legal system it seems to us that it deals a lot with suspects than probative evidences because arrests over previous years in the University of KwaZulu-Natal students’ protests, have been made to secure a reasonable number of suspects or at least someone for purposes of “accountability” for damage as escape goat; a number which correlates with the amount of damage. It seems to us that there is a high level of dishonor or misuse or abuse of section 46 of the Criminal Procedure Amendment Act of 1977. It is unfortunate that in those random picks by police, only one race is attached with the stigma of criminality and that on its own, we believe it is a contributing factor to such riots. However we stand to be corrected.\nIn 2011, comrades after hours, were visited and assaulted by police officers, some without uniform and arrests not been made, that is, students were taken from their rooms and get assaulted in Westville campus by the Sports Centre. This semester Risk Management Service of Westville was accompanied by Public Order Police, chasing behind comrades with “warrants of arrests” while there were no papers carried and police jointly with RMS bumping into meetings held by leadership (trying to resolve these issues one campuses), displaying a high level of disorder and lack of professionalism on their side. They are seeking vengeance like in 2011. Hence we went to Westville Police station to seek information because it is our right to access information relating to these alleged warrants. Comrades found nothing and police officers said that the University through RMS was trying to use P.O.P like its on campus securities, hence it they pulled out.\nAnother concern that we would like to raise is the one having a Student Disciplinary Court Chaired by someone paid by the University, Prosecuted by someone (proctor) employed by the University and being compelled to be represented by someone employed by the University. There is already a 2003 TUT case if we not mistaken, which the court held that depriving any person a legal representation of their choice is unconstitutional hence the rule was deemed unlawful but we still have it. This is the only way that this brutal system can be used to purge student leaders by exposing them to the internal courts which by the way, the manner in which it is being ran, we have lost faith in it. This is based on the understanding that we are all sophisticated persons in the University environment, and many of us believe that, the student court is not functioning properly. That is a general statement to make and some of the specific incidences are the handling of the 2013 Renaissance case, the “UKZN Big 4” to mention but a few. Today SRC has lost its legal status that it exists as a juristic person. SRCs if they were involved in an SRC organized activities on their capacities as SRCs; the principle of vicarious liability is selectively neglected for example, Edgewood SRC members are targeted hence will be excluded. We believe since the very same student court is bias, students then undermine it because it is dysfunctional according to our view as it serves the interests of management. Any legal expert can look at the student rules book of the University in its website and will see what we talking about. It is designed in bad faith.\nWe are calling for media to keep contact with student leadership of UKZN, including the Progressive Youth Alliance (SASCO, YCL and ANCYL) from now onwards. This is because we apply a different effective method than in Stellenbosch University hence media does not become our tool all the time. We would like to assure all that, the Progressive Youth Alliance will report thoroughly on issues including their outcomes. We further like to request the media to be present on Wednesday 23 rd Sept 2015 at 9:00am for the court bail hearing of these comrades in Pinetown magistrate. We believe that our comrades will be granted bail on Wednesday so that we can assume negotiations with Westville being represented.\nThe negative image that students are striking for tenders should be squashed out because questions such as the following should be asked. Which tenders is the University Management talking about? Who issue tenders? (a committee). How many SRC members sit in that committee (only one) and for which specific tenders? How many tenders does the university issue which require SRC to sit? Does the University have money for every year’s January tenders or second semester tenders? On one that we protest because of SRC elections, the question then becomes, does UKZN have elections in February? These are questions that a reasonable person will see before answering that it’s a Public Relation game played to undermine the students’ struggle because the issue of Registrations Appeals Committee is no way interrelated to tenders, the list goes on but the PYA shall clarify the public on all issues.\nOur closing remarks are that, students should not burn property and the University must compensate those students (whose belongings were caught up with fire) fully for any of their loss. The university must assure the public in writing that undertakings are made to the satisfaction of those postgraduate students. UKZN issues must be resolved in a manner that will yield a permanent or long term solution so that students do not “strike over tenders”. We call upon the university to provide additional academic time to avoid students being bombarded with tests and other submissions. We further call upon public to refrain from taken the roles of courts but may comment fairly not making judgments because that is the role of courts for these current circumstances. Let the presumption of innocence until proven guilty by courts of law prevail even if we dislike individuals. We call upon government to intervene for mending of scars that might have arisen as a result of the protest by establishing the Commission of Inquiry by the Premier of the Province so that all parties are fairly protected from any form of unlawful and unjust purging and permanent solutions are made. We are confident that the University’s student leadership is willing to negotiate in good faith hence call upon management to negotiate in good faith too. The negotiations will sit pending the outcomes of the court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:03:40.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
