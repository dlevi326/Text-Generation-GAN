The nurses wait for them to come in and try to cure them. I thought, 'we can do something to prevent this'.\"\nThe mHealth project will target adolescents in junior high school using mobile technology that appeals to this age group.\n\"I know it's not possible to try to prevent all children getting sick in the first place. But at least to minimise it, or even make it less traumatic for them,\" Professor Lee said.\n\"For example, obesity is an issue. You don't wait until children are obese, have a heart attack, or have hyperlipidemia. Instead, you tell them at the very beginning at school that they should pick up a healthy snack, develop healthy eating habits and do regular exercise.\n\"These are all the good things we can do in the early stages to prevent complications and chronic illnesses when they're older.\n\"That will also have a big impact on the healthcare system. If they're really healthy during adolescence, they will transition to a healthy adulthood.\"\nDuring phase one of the mHealth project, Lee and Dawson will arrange focus group interviews with adolescents in Hong Kong and Australia to get their input and engage them in the development of the program.\n\"We're also looking at collaboration with industry, such as telecommunications and computer companies in Australia and Hong Kong. Technology is changing every day, so we need their input,\" Professor Lee said.\nLee came to UTS on a grant as part of the Key Technology Partnership (KTP) Visiting Fellow Program. It was also a chance to explore opportunities beyond the mHealth project such as facilitating a PhD exchange program.\n\"The KTP program is a really nice strategy to allow visiting scholars to be more focused. And talking face-to-face is really different to email,\" she said.\n\"I'm always so busy when I'm in Hong Kong, but it's been a very good opportunity for me to concentrate on the present project.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T19:06:20.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
