The Ally+ product allows AudioEye's clients to reach more customers , build more brand loyalty , retain more customers and secure more repeat business . \nMost companies fail to provide full access to their websites. As a result, they exclude 5% to 10% of their potential customers, even though the law requires equal access and digital inclusion. Each month, AudioEye fixes millions of website problems for its clients; without these fixes, site visitors are left behind -- including those customers accessing websites through the use of assistive technologies provided by Microsoft, Apple, Google, and others. AudioEye clients that implement the Ally+ solution receive a compliance certification seal that, through the adoption and application of internationally accepted accessibility standards, allows them to clearly and confidently demonstrate and promote their conscientious commitment to ensuring equal access to their digital properties (limited exclusions apply). \nAlly+ is the most inclusive web accessibility solution available -- period. It goes beyond simply fixing issues that inhibit access to client information and services by also providing site visitors with a help desk resource for reporting usability problems, along with free cloud-based access to a customizable screen-reader-like user experience. By simply embedding the AudioEye JavaScript, the Ally+ patent-protected multi-language audible reader \"in the cloud\" provides new and returning customers the opportunity to thoroughly engage and interact with client websites in a unique and fully customizable way, regardless of their device type or preferred method of access. These tools have benefits for all site visitors, in particular aging populations and individuals who have vision, hearing, motor and intellectual disabilities, including those who are color blind, dyslexic, learning to read, and looking to maintain focus, or multi-task. \nProviding full access is the right thing to do, but it is also empowers customers, which makes it great for business.
