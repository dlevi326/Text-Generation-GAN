Visitors can now easily zoom in on any part of the website, and can have any section read aloud. With this added functionality, the IALVS is furthering its core mission to help people with low vision maintain independence and enhance quality of life. According to Dr. Richard Shuldiner, Low Vision Optometrist & Founder of the International Academy of Low Vision Specialists, “Many of the patients that visit low vision websites find it frustrating to read the information presented. We chose to add sitecues to our website because it significantly increases the ease with which visually impaired people can use the information to get the help they need.”\nBy adding sitecues® the IALVS website is now easily digestible by an even broader audience, many of whom may not yet use screen magnifiers or screen readers. “Sitecues was designed to help a wide variety of web users, including seniors and boomers experiencing age-related macular degeneration.” said Marc Zablatsky, General Manager of sitecues.\nAbout sitecues\nSitecues is a flexible and intuitive SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) technology that makes any website easier to see, hear, use, and enjoy.
