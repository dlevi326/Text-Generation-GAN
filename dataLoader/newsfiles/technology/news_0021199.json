Achieving this milestone on schedule demonstrates our continued commitment to meet our operational targets.\" \nProduction at the facility is expected to rise during 2016 and 2017, increasing production by 118,000 barrels of oil per day (BOD) gross capacity. \nCombined oil production for Surmont 1 and 2 sites is expected to go up to 150,000 BOD. \nTotal Exploration and Production president Arnaud Breuillac said: \"This is Total's fifth startup since the beginning of the year, and it contributes to our upstream growth. \n\"Surmont will produce substantial reserves, with a long plateau that will generate cash flow for decades to come.\" \nImage: Oil production at Surmont 2 facility is expected to rise in 2016 and 2017.
