The 7kWh household unit, capable of being cycled up and down daily, is seen as ideally suited to the Australian market where household solar owners are keen to minimise solar exports (at prices as low as 5 cents per kWh) instead using this to avoid consumption from the grid (at between 20 to 50 cents). However Tesla has said it will also provide the 10kWh system suited to providing periodic back-up power during black-outs, as well as the commercial and utility-scale Powerpack units that come in units scaled in 100kWh battery pack increments from 500kWh to as much as 10,000kWh+.\nTesla is yet to release information about pricing and availability, merely saying the Powerwall will be sold through \"a growing list of Tesla Energy partners\" ranging from \"major utility companies through to solar supply companies.\" An announcement on distributors will be made in the coming weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T08:06:26.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
