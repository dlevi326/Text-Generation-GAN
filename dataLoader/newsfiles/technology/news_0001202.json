The telemax 4×4, an optimised derivative of Cobham Unmanned Systems’ suite of telemax robots, incorporates a new four-wheel drive system (top speed of 11.5 Km/h) and WLAN-based data and video transmission technology to achieve improved effectiveness, connectivity and functionality. \nIncorporating over 2 decades’ worth of Cobham Unmanned Systems experience in the development and production of explosive ordnance robots, the 4×4 offers the same diverse range of tools, accessories and sensor options as all members of the telemax family, including critical capabilities such as Tool Centre Point (TCP) control and automatic tool change. The utilisation of the mission-proven manipulator arm and other telemax specifications allows for the option to upgrade the 4×4 to the telemax PRO or CBRN at a later date. \n“Cobham’s investment in the development of the telemax 4×4 highlights our commitment to improve our offering to the unmanned systems market through the diversification of our telemax family. The telemax 4×4 offers increased value to the customer, whilst still delivering the high performance and functionality expected of a telemax robot in critical missions,” said Thomas Biehne, Director, Business Development and Sales.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T02:23:30.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
