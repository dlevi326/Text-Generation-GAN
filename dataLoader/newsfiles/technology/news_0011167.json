The list represents a comprehensive snapshot of a key segment of the U.S. economy--America's independent entrepreneurs. \n\"We're honored to be recognized along with other young companies that are changing the face of business in the United States,\" said Phone.com CEO Ari Rabban. \"What I value most, being part of the Inc. 5000, is that it shows we are performing and growing consistently over the years.\" \nRabban added that the award speaks to the tenacity of a handful of companies in the telephony space. \"Cloud-based phone service is a growing market, of course, but it is also a very tough and competitive one. We believe Phone.com's ongoing success can be attributed to offering an outstanding product at the best possible price, and giving our customers exceptional service year in, year out.\" \nThe 2015 Inc. 5000 rank is based on percentage revenue growth when comparing 2011 to 2014. Companies must be U.S. based, privately held, for profit and independent, not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies. \n\"The story of this year's Inc. 5000 is the story of great leadership,\" says Inc.
