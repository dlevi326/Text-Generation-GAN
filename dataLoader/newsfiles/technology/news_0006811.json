We're introducing AT&T Work Data Rate Plans. Now, businesses can add an additional data rate plan to an employee's personal device 1 . This makes it easier for business to move employees to a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) platform. Employees can keep personal and work activities separate with this new plan. They pay for their personal data usage, but don't need to worry about work data usage. It's billed to the company. According to Gartner, half of businesses plan to move exclusively to BYOD for [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTloWW05MWRDNWhkSFF1WTI5dEwyNWxkM012ZDJseVpXeGxjM011YUhSdGJGd2lJSEpsYkQxY0ltNXZabTlzYkc5M1hDSWdkR0Z5WjJWMFBWd2lYMkpzWVc1clhDSStjMjFoY25Sd2FHOXVaWE04TDJFK3w=]] by 2017 2 . As BYOD adoption rises, businesses face more concerns for security, device management and costs. The AT&T Work Platform launched in March to help simplify BYOD. It allows businesses to add voice, data and messaging plans to employees' personal devices — so that billing is automatic and predictable. This means that employees no longer have to submit complicated expense reports. And businesses no longer have to offer \"best-guess\" stipends. Plus, employees get to use their chosen device and keep their personal rate plan. The AT&T Work Platform includes these options: AT&T Work Data NEW! AT&T Work Data Rate Plans - lets businesses buy an additional data plan for an employee's personal device. Specific business app usage bills directly to the company. AT&T Work Data Bolt-on Plans - lets businesses buy an additional data allowance for an employee to use on their personal device. AT&T Work Voice AT&T Work Voice – lets businesses buy an additional telephone number for an employee's personal device. This means work calls and messages bill separately from personal calls. AT&T customers can benefit from an end-to-end solution when they purchase AT&T Work Platform with a new or existing MobileIron, AirWatch by VMware or OpenPeak Enterprise Mobile Management (EMM) solution. More EMM providers will be coming in the near future. \"Businesses have unique needs when deploying mobile solutions to employees. The addition of data rate plans on the AT&T Work Platform extends our traditional rate plans to help meet the rising demand for BYOD,\" said Abhi Ingle , senior vice president, AT&T Big Data and Advanced Solutions. \"We're proud to be the first carrier to offer this type of innovative solution for our business customers.\" \"Our employees are excited to have a solution that lets them to carry a single device for both work and personal use,\" said Patrick Welch , President & Chief Operating Officer at bigtincan. \"Plus, we now have better visibility to manage our monthly mobility expenses.\" For more information about AT&T Work Platform please visit [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTkzZDNjdVlYUjBMbU52YlM5M2IzSnJJMTlpYkdGdWExd2lJSEpsYkQxY0ltNXZabTlzYkc5M1hDSWdkR0Z5WjJWMFBWd2lYMkpzWVc1clhDSStkM2QzTG1GMGRDNWpiMjB2ZDI5eWF6d3ZZVDQ9fA==]]. 1 AT&T data plans can be added when users have AT&T-subscribed devices. 2 Gartner, \"Bring Your Own Device: The Results and the Future.\" ( May 2014 ) *AT&T products and services are provided or offered by subsidiaries and affiliates of AT&T Inc. under the AT&T brand and not by AT&T Inc.
