Made using a patent-pending process, CellMa Cell Pellet Slides have a highly consistent density and homogeneity across the entire cell pellet block that ensures you get accurate results time after time. Cells are harvested by a proprietary trypsin-free method preserving cell surface antigens and inflicting minimal physical damage that could lead to a loss of biomarkers. The slides produce accurate and reproducible results for immunohistochemistry (IHC) providing confidence in antibody performance during IHC analysis. Using the cell pellet slides both morphological and biological molecules, including protein and nucleic acid targets, are well preserved offering a reference standard for tissue quality during in situ hybridisation (ISH) analysis. The slides are a renewable source of positive and negative controls, derived from 50 tumour cell lines, suitable for assay development and routine analysis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T16:07:32.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
