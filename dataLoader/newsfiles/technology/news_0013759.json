Amazon made no formal announcement about the phone, but it has been out of stock, with no indication it will be available again.\n\"The phone is the one object that everyone needs,\" he said. \"Everything else is less of a necessity and more of an amenity.\"\nStill, Greengart added that he liked the new tablets.\n\"They have a low price point and could get people to be more likely to use Amazon services,\" he said.\nTim Bajarin at the consulting firm Creative Strategies said in a blog post that \"these three models can drive a lot of sales of tablets for Amazon and, if the $50 model has strong demand, it could even drive the overall market for tablets up by as much as 10 to 15 percent from where it is today.\"\nBob O'Donnell at the research firm Technalysis was more cautious.\nHe said the new tablets \"are fine, but they are not going to change the world.\"\nGlobal tablet sales are sputtering because many markets are saturated and low prices may not spark a turnaround, O'Donnell told Agence France Presse.\n\"There have been low-cost tablets from other players for a couple of years and it hasn't dramatically changed the arc of the tablet market,\" he said.\n- 'Every unit is advertising' -\nRoger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said the product push is part of the longtime strategy by Bezos of building a customer base.\n\"He just wants to get the tablet in your hands,\" Kay said.\n\"Every unit is a bit of advertising, another way to enhance the brand, it can help in a number of ways.\"\nBut Kay said Amazon has yet to prove it can leverage its customer base to deliver the kind of profit that Apple has.\n\"They get a lot of points for being innovative,\" he said, but noted that \"the strategy only works if they can turn all that revenue into some kind of profit, and they haven't done it consistently.\"\nAmazon meanwhile cut the price of its upgraded Fire tablet for kids to $100. The device links to age-appropriate websites and YouTube videos.\nAmazon unveiled an upgraded Fire TV media box for $100 and a new Fire TV Stick with voice remote for $50.\nThe devices, which compete with products from Apple as well as Roku and Google, allow users to stream in high-definition 4K from Amazon, as well as other online services such as Netflix, HBO and Showtime.\nA Fire TV gaming edition media system with a controller is being launched for $140, along with a separate new game controller for Fire TV devices at $50.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:37:46.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
