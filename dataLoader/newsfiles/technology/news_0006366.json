Tablets and clamshell devices will fall from 226 million units shipped in 2014 to 199 million in 2015. \nIt said that a tentative recovery looked likely to begin through 2016 and 2017, however. \n“Until the end of 2015, currency devaluation and subsequent price increases will continue to restrain the replacement of ultramobiles, premium and notebooks by businesses in particular,” said Atwal. Worldwide device shipments by type, 2014-2017 (millions of units) \n“In 2016, we expect currency impacts will negate and while Windows 10 products on the Intel Skylake platform will increase in volumes throughout the year, Windows 10 adoption among businesses will ramp sharply in 2017, where we expect the PC market to return to a 4% growth.” \nThe contraction in tablet shipments, meanwhile, will be driven by users of tablets with screen sizes of between seven and eight inches, who are increasingly not replacing their devices. \nAdditionally, a user survey conducted earlier in 2015 showed that 44% of tablet owners were planning to swap out their tablet for a different sort of device. This figure was even higher among laptop users, 54% of whom think it is now time for something completely different . CW+ Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.
