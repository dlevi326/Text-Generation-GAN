Stock option plans have been done a million times before there,” Mr Bassat said.\n“We probably don’t quite yet have the same sort of maturity in terms of some of these structures and the knowledge of the investors, the entrepreneurs and the advisers ... really the whole ecosystem.\n“We’re moving in the right direction but capital raising is slower and clunkier here than some other markets. That’s one of the things for us to work on.”\nMr Bassat, who works with venture capital investment fund Square Peg Capital where he mentors management teams, said he was working with Sydney-based venture capital firm Airtree and other funds to put in place standard documents for Australian start-ups, in a bid to make the fund raising process as easy as possible.\n“Your job as an entrepreneur is not to raise capital,” he said. “Look, it’s a necessary evil, I’ve been there done that, and you’ve got to do it, but you want to be focusing your efforts on running a business, solving a problem and building a team.”\nMr Bassat, who remains a significant shareholder in Seek, also criticised Australian start-ups who he said list publicly too early, when compared to the young companies in the US who take their time with IPOs.\n“You need to take time to develop your systems, your processes, your ability to forecast revenue, the capability of the management team, the breadth of customer base, the strong technology foundations and your ability to scale over a period of time,” he said. “We listed seven years in and that was probably about right.\n“Facebook took their time and they’re a good example. For Australian start-ups ... I’d say all things being equal, stay private.”\nThis article was first published in The Australian.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:03:47.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
