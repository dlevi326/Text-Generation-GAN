This initiative further strengthens a long-standing partnership between the two firms. \nFor the many traders who still rely on paper-based proof of delivery and collection, upgrading to an EPOD system can have significant business benefits. Electronic manifests and signatures at point of delivery can greatly reduce invoice disputes and stock loss, and help to manage branch transfers and collections. Pushing delivery schedules to drivers on handheld devices not only increases efficiency, but also gives them access to any information they or the customer may need, increasing satisfaction or even enabling them to up-sell. \nWith live information on deliveries, managers have real-time visibility of delivery status; they can re-route or re-allocate on the fly. They can also review the day's deliveries against metrics such as 'on time in full', and use the management information to improve ongoing performance. \nIan Bendelow, CEO at KCS says: \"Cognito iQ's EPOD capabilities are a great complement to K8, which is designed to help customers source effectively, stock efficiently, sell profitably and service competitively. We have worked very hard together to ensure that the integration is seamless, and we know that our joint customers in the distributive trades will be excited about the enhanced product.\" \nCognito CEO, Laurent Othacéhé adds: \"Our relationship has always been strong, and we share a culture of innovation and development expertise. This new offer reinforces our partnership and adds an important dimension to KCS's ERP system, giving users access to vital delivery and collection information.\" \nAs well as the integration of Cognito iQ, the latest version of K8 has more than 180 enhancements in several key areas. Notable changes include browser client functionality, an improved hire management application, superior graph and charting capabilities, additional facilities to handle returns and tools to streamline user management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:37:51.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
