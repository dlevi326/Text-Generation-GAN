The cuts represent about 1.6% of its workforce. Whole Foods Market said in a regulatory filing on Monday that many of the reductions will come through attrition. It anticipates workers whose jobs are cut will find other jobs from the almost 2,000 open positions across the company or from new jobs thatâ€™ll be created by more than 100 new stores in development. Whole Foods said it has added more than 9,000 jobs in the past year and created nearly 35,000 jobs over the last five years. Whole Foods was recently hurt by bad publicity when New York City officials found it was overcharging customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:42:33.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
