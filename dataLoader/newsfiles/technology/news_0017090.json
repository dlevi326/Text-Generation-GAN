Highlights, available currently for League of Legends and coming soon to CS:GO and DOTA 2, uses live game data to automatically identify and \"pin\" key moments (kills, deaths, assists and more) while the gameplay is being recorded, making them instantly viewable and shareable from an interactive timeline after a match. For all other games, users can create \"pins\" via hotkey. The Stitch feature then enables users to choose any number of \"pinned\" moments and automatically combine them into a single highlight reel. \"It's been our mission from day one to provide simple yet powerful tools for gamers to capture and show off their best moves,\" said Dennis Fong , founder and CEO of Plays.tv parent company Raptr. \"The introduction of Highlights eliminates the need to dig through hour-long videos to find the parts worth sharing, and Stitch allows gamers to show off those awesome moments as personal highlight reels.\"\n\"With the length of the average League game stretching over 30 minutes, it's always been a pain to track down the breakout plays,\" said SÃ˜ren \"Bjergsen\" Bjerg of Team SoloMid. \"I love the fact that Plays.tv lets me find and share all the best stuff without even having to think about it.\"\nPlays.TV recently surpassed 1.5 million MAU following its beta launch in late March and has recently attracted top players from leading pro teams such as Team SoloMid, Team Liquid, Team Dignitas and others. This large and growing audience is diverse both geographically and in terms of game tastes; videos from more than 1,600 different games have been posted by registered users from more than 200 countries worldwide.\nTraditionally, gamers required multiple applications to do both video capturing and editing, as well as considerable time and effort to find share-worthy moments. With Plays.tv's unique Highlights feature, key moments in League of Legends (kills, deaths, assists, tower/nexus takedowns, and major monster kills) are automatically identified as the gameplay is recording. Relevant hashtags and summoner names are included to provide context and enable discovery. (Similar support for CS:GO and DOTA 2 coming soon.) For other games, users hit a hotkey to identify key moments as they occur. After each game session, those key moments are signified by pins on a timeline, and users then have the option of sharing an individual highlight or selecting multiple pins to create a personal highlight reel using the new Stitch feature. \nAbout Plays.tv\nPlays.tv is a video-sharing platform for gamers designed to let any gamer save, share and relive their favorite in-game moments with friends and the billions of gaming fans worldwide.
