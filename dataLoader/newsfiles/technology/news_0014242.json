Post navigation 2 thoughts on “Uploading Your Mind” Leland says: September 13, 2015 at 1:37 PM \nPhilosophical debates continue to be waged about whether mind uploading would actually transfer your consciousness or just make a copy of you, which might be nice for your friends and family members, but you’d still be dead. \nSPOILER Alert, but in Chappie they did the whole mind upload, and I just didn’t understand why it had to be a transfer and not a copy. \nChappie was originally just a file, so why could the file not be replicated? The soul part wasn’t even known for certain, and really was handled poorly in my opinion (and many others). I can understand discrepancies between a copy of the mind ten minutes ago and now, as there are likely changes in knowledge in just that ten minutes, but isn’t that what most people really want? We want our mind as it may exist today, not after senility or other degradations occur.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T01:53:22.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
