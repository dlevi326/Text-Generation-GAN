So it's no surprise that they accumulate fingerprints, hair, dust particles and even pathogens. Just wiping them down with a cloth is not the best way to go about it. Karan Bajaj & Hitesh Raj Bhagat show you some of the best ways to keep your devices clean and germ-free. Screen wipes Most homes today have multiple screens: televisions, laptop screens, phones, tablets and computers. These screens tend to attract dust and smudges every few days. This can affect the viewing experience and the dust can act as an abrasive if you clean roughly. The recommended way to keep your screens clean is by using a screen wipe. You can get a box of good quality screen wipes for Rs 500 (200 wipes per box). Screen wipes have an especially-formulated solution that quickly dries without leaving any residue on the screen. Keep in mind that you can use these wipes to clean screens as long as they are damp. Screen cleaning kit Apart from dust particles, the other issue with touchscreen devices today is that they attract smudges and fingerprints. Using any piece of cloth or tissue is not advisable because it can create micro scratches on the screen surface. Instead, use a microfiber cloth. A good investment would be to get a screen-cleaning kit (Rs 150 onwards), which includes a microfiber cloth and a screen cleaning liquid (it's safe for all types of screens, including touchscreens and TVs). Be sure to follow the directions given on the pack. Air-blowers There are multiple components inside a computer cabinet. Even though cabinets are closed from all sides, they tend to accumulate dust quickly. The dirt can settle on the CPU, GPU, hard drives and motherboard, often leading to poor air circulation and overheating. You can get an air-blower for Rs 300-800 to quickly remove dust from inside the cabinet. Make sure you unplug the power from the computer cabinet and take it outside before using the airblower. It's a good idea to cover eyes, nose and mouth for protection. Move the air blower from one side to the other. Since it pushes out air at high speeds, do not take it too close to the motherboard. Apart from cabinets, you can even use the airblower to clean set top boxes, keyboards, amplifiers, gaming consoles, multimedia projectors and speaker grilles. Camera blower The image sensor is the heart of a DSLR and responsible for the quality of photos you get. However, even a few dust particles on the image sensor can show up as spots on the final image. Since most DSLR users tend to switch between multiple lenses, the image sensor is exposed to dust particles. Some DSLRs do come with a built-in sensor cleaning system but it is not always effective. The handheld air-blower is ideal for DSLR sensors and mirrors. To clean the image sensor, hold the DSLR up side down (sensor facing down) and blow air on to the sensor from the air blower nozzle. This makes the dust particles fall out of the camera body so there is no risk of them settling back on the sensor or other components. Take care to ensure that the air blower nozzle should not touch the image sensor. Lenspen A Lenspen (Rs 300) is a handy tool that every camera owner should have to keep their camera lenses clean. It can be used with DSLRs, compact cameras and even smartphones. It has a retractable soft brush on one side that can be used to remove any dust particle from the lens or the body of the lens. On the other side is a carbon cleaning compound in a concave shape that removes dust and can even clean smaller nooks. Apart from camera lenses, you can also use the Lenspen to clean the mirror and sensor of a DSLR or glass elements on telescopes and microscopes. Make sure that you start cleaning from the center and move out in circular motion for effective cleaning. CyberClean CyberClean is a non-toxic and biodegradable cleaning compound that is made from a patented Swiss formula. Not only is the compound effective in cleaning electronic items, it also kills 99.9% of harmful germs. The jelly-like material can be used to clean hard-to-reach corners too, making it useful for cleaning remote controls, speaker grills, keyboards and phone keypads. Since all the dust and debris sticks to the CyberClean compound your hands stay clean. Once the material is saturated with dirt, it changes colour and the efficacy is reduced. The only option at this stage is to discard it and buy again. It's also priced steeply ­ Rs 300 per packet. Compressed-air cans If you don't want to deal with the hassle of a powered air blower, a compressed-air can is the next best solution. Each can comes with a long nozzle and looks a lot like a can of spray paint. All you have to do is point the nozzle in the right direction and use short bursts of air to clean out any dustdebris. You can buy a can of air of about Rs 300.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T09:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T10:02:23.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
