Soon thousands had joined his group and images poured in from across the country. \n\"It's as if people had been waiting for it,\" he says. \n\"I'd like the authorities to get their act together, to do their work. I just want to be able to walk on the pavement.\" \nAnother Tunisian, Raafet Limam, was also thinking of how Tunisians could communicate with the authorities about such issues when he created Plan125, a mobile app with a Facebook page that has some 40,000 members. \nWith it, users can post photos of their frustrations like street lights shining during the day or beaches overrun with empty plastic bottles. \nThe app then aims to provide local officials with a username and password so that they can keep track of problems in their region, fix them and publicise their efforts. \n\"With just a few clicks, you can see what problems exist in what region,\" Limam says. \n\"New technologies have made it all easier. Instead of writing up a complaint and then trying to find out who to hand it to, and in what street,\" a photo does it, he explains. \n- Making a difference - \nOf course, officials will need to welcome the idea. \nAmong those that Plan125 has contacted, several have shown enthusiasm at the initiative, he says. Others have been more cautious, even resistant to using new technologies. \nBut Limam says he is confident the app will catch on. \nCivil society initiatives such as his have already made a small difference. \nTo the great joy of online activists, the Tunis municipality recently announced it had seized the tables and chairs of 12 establishments that had illegally occupied the pavement after \"working with the #Get_off_the_pavement campaign\". \nMaher Zaher, deputy head of the La Marsa municipality near Tunis, says that local councils -- replaced after the revolution by \"special delegations\" until local elections are held -- don't have the means they did before. \nThe municipal police, for example, are now linked to the interior ministry so more difficult to mobilise. \nTunisia is still undergoing a difficult transition after the overthrow of longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011 in a revolution that marked the beginning of the Arab Spring uprisings. \nMost of all, Zaher says that he hopes Tunisians will become more aware of their actions. \n\"If everyone who goes swimming starts to throw rubbish... there simply isn't a cleaning company to pick it up.\" .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T08:20:33.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
