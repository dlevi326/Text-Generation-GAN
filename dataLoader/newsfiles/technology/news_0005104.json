The company will also be sponsoring monthly drawings to give people with newer valves a chance to participate. This contest is part of a celebration of the 50th anniversary of Moog’s operations in Europe.\n“Moog’s servo valves have a legendary reputation for reliability, and it’s not uncommon to find our valves in service for 25 years or more in tough environments like steel production, gas turbines and industrial machinery,” said Gary Parks, croup VP and general manager – industrial services at Moog.\nIn 1951 William C. Moog, Jr., developed the first commercially viable servo valve. Servo valves transform a digital or analog signal into a hydraulic output such as flow or pressure.\nThe contest is simple and open to anyone who can find a Moog servo valve in operation on a machine. Using a smartphone, entrants should take a photo of the valve including the serial number on the nameplate. Moog will use this information to check the date of the valve. The photo can be uploaded here (http://oldestvalve.moogglobalsupport.com/).\nThe grand prize is an Amazon Voucher for US$500; Moog will award additional Amazon vouchers for the second prize and third prize. Even if a contestant’s valve is not the oldest operational valve or if they have multiple valves, participants can still qualify to win five US$50 Amazon Vouchers that Moog will draw each month.", "external_links": ["http://oldestvalve.moogglobalsupport.com/)."], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T11:42:09.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
