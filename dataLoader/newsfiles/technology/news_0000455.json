(VCM.TO), a designer and manufacturer of technology in the broadband equipment market, today reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2015. Yesterday, Vecima's Board of Directors also announced an increase in the Company's quarterly cash dividend to $0.055 per share, from $0.045 previously. The dividend will be payable on October 30, 2015 to shareholders of record as at October 9, 2015. \"We closed the 2015 fiscal year and fourth quarter with record adjusted EBITDA and gross margin, a cash balance of $59.7 million, and financial results that met or exceeded our guidance on all metrics,\" said Sumit Kumar, Vecima Networks' President and CEO . \"Our results reflect robust sales of our Terrace QAM and Terrace family products and continued tight operating performance across the business. We also benefitted from favourable market conditions including increased all-digital conversion activity by cable operators and a stronger U.S. dollar that enhanced our excellent performance.\" FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Canadian dollars in millions except percentages, employees, and per share data) Q4FY15 Earnings per share (based on weighted average number shares outstanding) $0.17 Adjusted earnings per share1 (based on weighted average number shares outstanding) $0.20 489 507 1 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings Per Share do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other issuers. See \"Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings Per Share\" below. \"I'm pleased to report that our new product momentum continued to build in the fourth quarter with the TC600E enjoying rapid market acceptance and our new TransQAM platform nearing completion of field testing. Both of these products provide support for state-of-the-art MPEG-4 HD video, which delivers a 30-to-50% savings in network capacity to support operators' video offerings.\" \"In other parts of our business, YourLink was awarded $4.6 million in Industry Canada funding during the fourth quarter. That funding will be matched by Vecima and used to undertake a significant upgrade and expansion of our Saskatchewan network infrastructure over the next two years. This will increase our addressable market by over 40,000 households, bringing the availability of high-speed Internet, at 5Mbps or more, to many rural residents for the first time.\" \"Vecima is firing on all cylinders, particularly in the Converged Wired Solutions space where we are a leading supplier to cable MSO customers moving to all-digital networks. We believe the next major evolution for our customers will be towards gigabit class broadband speeds and an IP-based video ecosystem. Several of North America's leading cable MSOs have already announced their intention to transition to faster, more flexible network solutions like DOCSIS 3.1. Moving into fiscal 2016, we remain focused on providing the solutions that enable our customers to leverage innovative technologies and compete more effectively,\" said Mr. Kumar . \"Based on our favourable performance and positive outlook, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.055 per share. We are delighted to be rewarding our investors for their ongoing confidence in Vecima and look forward to continuing to increase shareholder value in fiscal 2016.\" MULTIPLE SYSTEM OPERATOR (MSO) PRODUCTS Terrace QAM Sales of Terrace QAM increased 85% to $9.7 million in Q4 2015, from $5.2 million in the same period in fiscal 2014. On a sequential quarterly basis, sales of Terrace QAM were similar to the very strong $9.6 million level achieved in Q3 2015. The robust third and fourth quarter performance was driven by continued strong demand from Vecima's lead customer. Deployment volumes of Terrace QAM are expected to remain strong in fiscal 2016, supported in part by the addition of the new TransQAM version. Terrace QAM is designed for the hospitality industry, providing an elegant platform over which cable operators can deliver a leading high-definition service offering. Terrace Family Fourth quarter sales of Terrace family products were $6.7 million, compared to $7.9 million in Q4 2014 and $7.5 million in Q3 2015. Fluctuations in quarterly sales reflect the different stages of network conversion activity by various MSO customers. Terrace family products remain the leading choice of MSOs undertaking all-digital network conversions. The attractiveness of the solution has been further enhanced by the recent introduction of the MPEG-4 capable TC600E. As previously announced, two additional Tier 1 MSOs have selected the Terrace family for network wide all-digital conversions and are expected to carry out significant deployments of the TC600E throughout fiscal year 2016. CABLE HEADEND Digital Video Access Platform Vecima reported DVAP sales of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter, up from nil in Q3 2015. As anticipated, DVAP sales were minimal in both the third and fourth quarters following a large volume of deliveries in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Vecima is delivering this product to the lead customer under a USD$19 million take-or-pay contract. BROADBAND WIRELESS Sales in the Broadband Wireless segment increased 104% to $0.9 million in Q4 2015, from $0.4 million in the same quarter in fiscal 2014. On a sequential quarterly basis, sales increased 55% compared to Q3 2015. The increases largely reflect last-time purchases prior to the discontinuation of certain software-defined radio products. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Vecima continued with the restructuring of operations related to its software-defined radio products in response to continued weakness in defense spending. OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2016 Vecima will continue to execute on its growth strategy which focuses on delivering highly desirable products as well as accessing new markets and new customers. For fiscal 2016, management expects: sales to be in the range of $100 to $108 million; gross margin to be in the range of 52% to 57%; and, adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $28 to $33 million.
