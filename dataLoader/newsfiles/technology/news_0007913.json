Chiron Health is now part of the athenahealth Marketplace offerings. Together, the companies will work to link athenahealth’s growing network of more than 67,000 health care providers with the capabilities of Chiron Health so they can more efficiently deliver remote follow-up care through HIPAA-compliant video conferencing.\n“The healthcare industry has been talking about the promise of telemedicine for years,” said Andrew O’Hara, Chiron Health’s Founder and CEO. “This partnership now allows thousands of athenahealth clients to seamlessly integrate video visits into their existing clinical workflow. We believe this is a major step forward in outpatient telemedicine that will enable physician practices across the country to provide more convenient access to patients.”\nChiron Health is helping both physicians and mid-level providers connect with patients from home or work by using their existing devices. “From routine follow-ups like reviewing labs or adjusting medications, to minor urgent care issues, video visits are an ideal way to provide high-quality care to patients without the hassle of an office visit,” noted O’Hara. “For these lower acuity visits that don’t require a physical exam, practices are seeing significant productivity and patient satisfaction gains by offering telemedicine.”\nAn important companion to Chiron Health’s video visit technology, and a natural extension of athenahealth’s cloud-based billing services, the company has also introduced the Chiron Rules Engine®, an industry-first telemedicine insurance rules database that verifies the eligibility of every patient to ensure telemedicine reimbursement.\n“One of the biggest barriers to the adoption of telemedicine over the last decade has been complicated regulation and reimbursement,” said O’Hara. “That’s why we’ve spent the last two years building the industry’s most robust telemedicine rules engine, and why we’re proud to offer the Chiron Reimbursement Guarantee® full reimbursement for video visits from private payers, or we’ll reimburse the claim ourselves.\"\nChiron Health’s telemedicine offering is now available in the athenahealth Marketplace, allowing athenahealth practices to easily activate HIPAA-compliant video visits in athenaNet.\nTo learn more about athenahealth’s MDP program and partnership opportunities please visit http://www.athenahealth.com/disruption .\nAbout Chiron Health, Inc.\nChiron Health is the only platform designed to get physician practices fully reimbursed for secure video visits.
