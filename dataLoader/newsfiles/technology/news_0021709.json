Even today, 160 years later, late blight is a $5bn problem for the global potato industry.\" \nAccording to Baker, the modifications were made by silencing existing genes or adding genes from other types of potatoes. The late blight resistance comes from an Argentinean variety. \nThe first generation of this variety also featured less bruising and reduction of acrylamide, a chemical produced at high temperatures that some studies revealed can cause cancer. \"Late blight is a $5bn problem for the global potato industry.\" \nIn March, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed the food and feed safety consultation of the first generation of Innate potatoes and concluded that it is safe and nutritious as conventional potatoes. \nSimplot said the company used modern biotechnology techniques to accelerate the traditional breeding process and provide new traits by triggering the potato's own RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. \nThe company is currently working on the third generation of Innate potatoes. Baker said the new variety will be able to resist a type of virus that can make potatoes unmarketable. \nImage: Simplot's Innate potato features late blight resistance, low-acrylamide potential, reduced black spot bruising, and lowered reducing sugars.
