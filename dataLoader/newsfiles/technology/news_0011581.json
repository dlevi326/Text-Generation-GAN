Today, the Indian-American billionaire remains equally optimistic. Khosla, 60, who co-founded Sun Microsystems and is now an active venture capitalist, was in Bengaluru last week for the launch of a consumer mobile wallet and spoke exclusively with TOI. Excerpts: \n\nYou were very optimistic about India's startup ecosystem two years ago. Do you think it has since further matured? \n\nI believe so. I find everybody is so open to new ideas. I see the psychological change in the whole country, which is really important. There was a time, even five years ago, when you talked about new products and new startups, and it mattered to just 1 per cent of the population. But this has changed now. There's a lot of good product innovation. For the first time, I'm beginning to see product innovation for the Indian market. That's particularly encouraging for me. \n\nWhat do you see as the main elements driving these changes? \n\nIt is the new generation of entrepreneurs, their optimism and attitude that is driving these changes. Till recently, what a politician was doing was always on the front page and not Flipkart. That has changed. An exciting startup is just as interesting as a cricket match. \n\nDo you worry about startups being overvalued? \n\nIn a startup ecosystem, there will be companies that are overvalued and companies that are undervalued. I always say that in startups, more money is made than lost and more people lose than win. Of course, there will be a lot of false starts, too much hype, but that is something that always happens. \n\nAre you looking at any specific areas for investment in India? \n\nI'm focused on a very narrow part of what matters to the country. I'm focused on technology-based enablement of innovation. I do not care about traditional healthcare, but technology-based healthcare services really excite me. It is personally hard for me (to make direct investments) because of the distance. That is why there is Khosla Labs. Khosla Impact, which is our impact fund, has done a lot of investments in India and Africa, including Babajob.com (the informal and entry-level employment website). \n\nWhich other sectors in India do you think lend themselves to significant disruption? \n\nFinancial services is very exciting. A lot of innovation has been enabled by the infrastructure that Aadhaar has put in place. We have not done much in education but I think it will be an interesting area as technology can make a big difference. \n\nIn the US, clean tech has been a focus for you. How does it look in India? \n\nWe have not done as much clean tech in India, though I am seeing renewed interest because of the new solar target of 20 GW that has been set. We have started seeing Indian groups approach us and start talking to us about our India presence. \n\nEvery city is facing a huge garbage crisis. Do you see new solutions emerge there? \n\nThat is an interesting problem and I haven't seen a lot of solutions. One of the reasons is, when the customer is the municipality, people tend not to want to do it, as there is a lot of politics. Municipalities buy through politics and not through the best product. If you are a municipality, it is all contacts, relationships, politics. \n\nTell us about some other newer areas that fascinate you. \n\nWe are doing a lot in terms of applying technology to food and agriculture in the US. We have invested in a company named Hampton Creek that makes the vegetarian equivalent of eggs. You can use it in traditional egg-based preparations like cakes, and you will not be able to make out the difference. We have also invested in a company called Impossible Foods, which makes a red meat-like product with no animals involved. I know it sounds radical but most people who tasted it cannot tell me the difference. This is five times more land efficient and more environment friendly.\n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:35:41.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
