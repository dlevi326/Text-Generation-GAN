Midamar is expected to forfeit $600 000 under a plea agreement.\nDespite the guilty plea, the plea deal allows Midamar to ask an appeals court to dismiss the charges based on arguments that they were regulatory, not criminal, violations. A judge rejected that claim.\nMidamar says it has \"taken full responsibility for wrongful conduct\" that occurred between 2007 and 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T19:03:06.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
