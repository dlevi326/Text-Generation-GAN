This latest release continues on Technomedia’s product innovation across their entire suite as well as the introduction of a new Core HR Hub module.\nTechnomedia’s new Core HR Hub module builds upon an already powerful set of Talent Profile Management features and allows companies to orchestrate both complex inbound and outbound data interfaces, data transformations and validations on all people data. As with other modules, Core HR Hub is fully integrated providing an end-to-end solution that is based on meaningful real time HR data and transactions, user centric technologies, social collaboration, and employee engagement.\nThe ability to maintain and leverage complex people data has never been more important. Many of Technomedia’s customers have disparate systems that control new hire and employee related data for direct employees and those attached to their extended enterprise. This data collection and centralization only expands for larger companies with global operations and those who have a stronger reliance on the extended enterprise, or companies of any size who may be dealing with mergers and acquisitions. These organizations need innovative ways to transform their data dependencies and seamlessly and effortlessly manage a comprehensive set of employee data points.\n“Once again Technomedia has delivered a solid set of new features and enhancements designed to streamline HR processes and engage users across our entire Talent Suite,” said Dwaine Maltais, executive vice president for Technomedia. “Additionally, the introduction of our new Core HR Hub module gives companies a powerful set of tools to centrally manage all people data and the other systems that interface with it.”\nIn addition to the new Core HR Hub announcement, the latest August release continues to innovate in all of the other pillars of the suite with over 75 new product enhancements. A few highlights include:\n• Talent Acquisition and Candidate Engagement – Delivering new and enhanced features for best practice sourcing, candidate engagement and career site interactions including SEO friendly upgrades. Improved offer management and admin panel with customizable templates and configurable applicant routing workflows.\n• Performance Management – A more unified interface with added assessment types and competency rating sections for performance reviews along with increased connectivity to training needs and development plans.\n• Succession Planning – Improvements to Critical Jobs management, position management, downloadable formats for People Review matrixes, and enhanced org chart views giving HR and Managers a powerful tool to visualize succession plans and scenarios.\n• Compensation Management – Configurable tracking dashboard and enhanced multi-currency support including exchange rates synchronization across the platform as well as several improvements for budget allocation during salary review periods.\n• Learning and Development – Redesigned catalog search capabilities, enhanced user experience for training visibility and tracking, and added features for registration and reservation management.\n• User Experience – A host of improvements have been made to the user interface across the entire Suite but most notably is a redesigned internal Communities Ecosystem to keep employees engaged with peers through deeper social collaboration tools and sharing.\n• Reporting and Analytics – Our TMBI platform continues to be optimized with each new release to support complex reporting across both standard and Big Data repositories. In addition, a new administrative function to manage exchange areas has been added enabling Administrators to define source targets for data imports and exports.\n• Administrative Management – Via our Configuration Center, we have added new functionality for employee dashboard management and our Smart Assistant feature, improved learning features for training activities and tracking, additional controls for customizable templates and new candidate offer management panels.\nABOUT TECHNOMEDIA\nSince 1996, Technomedia’s cloud-based talent management solutions and services have enabled global organizations to cultivate high-performing workforces.
