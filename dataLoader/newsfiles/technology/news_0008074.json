It also lowers system costs by increasing string length, and reducing installation time and complexity with fewer BOS components. The Smart Module components work together to communicate wirelessly through the gateway, allowing users to monitor system performance accurately in real time, while meeting the new NEC 690.12 Rapid Shutdown Safety standards. The modules are double glass, frameless, aesthetically great looking, easy to install with innovative racking and mounting solutions, and feature Sunpreme's 21.5% efficient Cells enabling 310W 60-cell and 370W 72-cell solar panels and a low thermal coefficient of -0.28%/C. \n\"JDS has a history of being the first in the smart module space. With Sunpreme's new Bi-facial Smart Module, we'll be the first to install high-efficiency, smart modules to both our residential and commercial customers,\" said Jon Silvester, CEO at JDS Power. \"Sunpreme has demonstrated strong technical collaboration & professional customer support. By partnering with Sunpreme we are able to offer a truly technically advanced, proven product reliability and a high performance module,\" added Silvester. \n\"We are proud to partner with JDS Power, a leading Distributed Generation provider, in launching an integrated Tigo optimizer capability to our high performance bi-facial double glass modules. These panels utilize our bi-facial HCT cells made using an innovative a-Si:H ultra thin-film structure for junction formation,\" said Ashok Sinha, Chairman and CEO of Sunpreme. \"We are gratified to see, in close partnership with our early customers, a rapid commercialization of advanced module designs for world-class systems level energy output at very competitive costs,\" added Sinha. \n\"Sunpreme's Smart Modules are an industry game-changer offering our clients the high performance Bi-facial GxB-310 Modules and integrated Tigo TS4-L optimizer with impedance matching technology and distributed MPPT -- to maximize energy performance and shading tolerance at the system level,\" said Surinder S. Bedi, Executive Vice President for Market Development, Systems Design, and Global Quality & Reliability at Sunpreme. \"The Bi-facial technology - allows the module to absorb light from both sides, increasing energy yield (kWh per kWp) up to 20%. Our carefully designed GxB-310 SM with advanced optimization solution further accelerates kWh yield by 10% and peak string level AC/DC ratio of 0.95 plus. A low thermal coefficient of -0.28%/C is further plus to performance, and longer strings by up to 30% result in fewer BOS components. Sunpreme has historically offered the most reliable modules with innovative mounting solutions -- that were tested and certified to withstand the most challenging environmental solutions ranging from extreme hot to extreme cold, increased snow load and wind resistance, and coupled with one of the best power warranties in the industry. With these competitive advantages, Bi-facial Smart Module offers a complete and compelling value proposition -- to maximize project financial returns and its lifetime yield,\" added Bedi. \n\"Pre-launch customer momentum has been positive, and we are shipping pre-booked orders to strategic customers. We look forward to supporting JDS Power and the solar industry with innovative products and elegant solutions, such as O&M simplification, rapid safety shut down to meet electrical code requirements,\" added Bedi. \nAbout JDS Power, Inc.
