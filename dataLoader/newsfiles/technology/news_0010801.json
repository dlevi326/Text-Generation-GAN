It depends on the challenge.” \nThe robots are built using Lego Mindstorms kits, which combine the brick-building system with computer programming, hardware and engineering. \nSafiya Arif, 14, a Pakistani pupil at Al Nahda National School for Girls, said the challenge of building small robots was helping her to get closer to her goal of becoming a biomedical engineer. “I think robots are going to be our future in our daily lives,” said Safiya. “I think we should learn how to deal with them as quickly as possible, so attending this competition might help me to achieve this goal.\n“I’m planning on studying medicine where they already use robots for doing surgery, so this will help me.”\nAdila Saadat, robotics coordinator at American Community School of Abu Dhabi, said pupils gained real-world skills through these competitions.\n“It teaches them to solve problems, it teaches them perseverance, it teaches them how to look at a problem and then break it down to its essentials, and then it teaches them real-life skills,” said Mrs Saadat.\nAmerican Community School’s senior high school team took first place in the competition. “It’s an honour to be able to represent the UAE in Qatar,” said Daniel Bekai, 17, an American Grade 12 pupil at the school.\nFatima’s team came second in the elementary school category.\n“I’m very happy,” said Fatima. “Actually, not surprised because we worked very well. We wanted first, but second is good too.”\n\nrpennington@thenational.ae", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T14:14:09.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
