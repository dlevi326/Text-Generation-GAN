They have also been used in commercial products (such as cameras for thermography) as well as in military and civil satellites. \nMost IR Photodetectors are cooled and require cryogenic devices to achieve operating temperature. \nIR Photodetectors manufacturers have been facing new Challenges in the last years: Continuing decline of military spending in many countries due to budget constraints (especially in US and Europe). Market entry of uncooled thermal detectors such as microbolometers, which are competitive for low/medium performance applications in LWIR. Unfulfilled needs for night vision equipment in terms of Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP). \nThese challenges have caused manufacturers of IR Photodetectors and systems as well as their R&D partners to intensify efforts: To improve products performance while reducing cost and improving SWaP, To provide advanced and added functionalities such as multiband, multicolor, active imaging, integrated optics To adapt their business models to reach new IR imaging applications and explore new markets. \nPhotodetectors are still the preferred components for IR military systems due to limitations of thermal detectors in terms of sensitivity, frame rate and wavelengths. Infrared Photodetectors manufacturers also managed to respond to the endless need for greater mission capabilities in the area of Night Vision. \nInfrared Photodetectors are reaching new Opportunities in Defense but also in commercial and industrial markets (see figure below). The IR imaging Photodetectors market is expected to grow from around $700M in 2013 to more than $900M in 2020. \nAlong with market forecasts, this report details current and future trends in IR imaging Photodetectors and Systems. \nObjectives of the report: Understand the current IR imaging Photodetectors market dominated by the major application i.e. Defense night vision systems Provide market shares of main IR Photodetectors manufacturers Determine the next main opportunities of IR imaging Photodetectors Provide market forecast until 2020 for each application Describe future trends and challenges of IR Photodetectors technologies Understand the Value chains and Identify IR imaging Photodetectors & systems manufacturers worldwide as well as R&D players \nKey Features of the report: Segmentation of the market of IR imaging Photodetectors Market forecast by applications until 2020 Market shares of main IR imaging Photodetectors manufacturers Technology trends and future challenges Value chain from IR imaging components to systems \nCompanies Mentioned - Partial List", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T07:07:53.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
