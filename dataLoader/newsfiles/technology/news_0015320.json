This fusion will allow huge quantities of data from devices such as industrial appliances, weather sensors and wearable monitoring devices to be gathered, analyzed and acted upon. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20090416/IBMLOGO \nIBM also announced the first in a series of IBM Cloud-based, industry-specific IoT services with IoT for Electronics. The service will enable electronics manufacturers to gather data from individual sensors that can be combined with other data for real-time analysis. \nThe IBM IoT Foundation is a platform upon which a family of fully managed, cloud-hosted offerings on the SoftLayer Infrastructure is built. IoT Foundation makes it simple to derive value from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It includes: -- Analytics tools capable of dealing with large quantities of fast-moving data, -- Access to IBM Bluemix, IBM's Platform-as-a-Service, that is capable of handling the immense flow of data and provide anytime access for decision makers; and -- Security systems capable of helping organizations protect IoT data as rigorously as they do their own confidential financial, IP and strategy information. \n\"Deploying IoT technology has to be easy, secure and scalable for it to feel like a natural extension of a company's business,\" said Krisztian Flautner, General Manager, IoT Business, ARM. \"By collaborating with IBM, we will deliver the first unified chip-to-cloud, enterprise-class IoT platform. This will empower companies of any size with a productivity tool that can readily transform how they operate, and the services they can offer.\" \nThe integration between IBM and ARM will allow products powered by ARM mbed-enabled chips to automatically register with the IBM IoT Foundation, and connect with IBM analytics services. This unifies the ARM mbed IoT Device Platform and the IBM IoT Foundation at the point where information gathered from deployed sensors in any connected device is delivered to the cloud for analysis. The IoT connection also enables delivery of actionable events to control equipment or provide users with alerts or other information. For example, the triggering of an alarm message on a washing machine to ask the owner to confirm a breakdown engineer appointment if a fault is detected. \nThis integration can help clients improve engagement, accelerate innovation and enhance operations through connected devices and analysis of the data. Custom hardware built around ARM's flexible and efficient chip technology and IBM's leading IoT services for predictive maintenance, better asset performance, operational risk management and managed continuous engineering, can help provide organizations with enterprise-grade tools designed to help them build value from their IoT devices. Original design manufacturers and OEMs - such as Ionics - are already seeing value in the IBM and ARM integration as it assimilates the IBM IoT Foundation at the chip architecture level. \n\"We're excited to work with IBM because we believe that an effective IoT solution should be built from the ground up - from chipset through services - and is by far the best choice to have a complete end-to-end solution,\" said Earl Qua, Vice President of Ionics. \"Working with IBM we have tapped into our respective company's expertise to create a platform that is built and customized for the unique nature in which companies are utilizing IoT.\" \nElectronics manufacturers are already adopting IBM's cloud services to connect everything from dishwashers to Smart TVs to pro audio equipment: \n\"By using IBM IoT services, we are able to real-time manage and control Smart TV content in over 30 countries. This provides us the opportunity to continuously balance costs with increased customer experience. Lastly, we have eliminated the need to set up hardware within traditional IT infrastructure - allowing a drastic reduction in provisioning time.\" - Marc Harmsen - Global Marketing Lead and Product Manager EMEA Philips Television at TP Vision. \n\"At Gibson Innovations, design and quality lead the way. IBM's service capabilities - leveraging cloud, IoT and analytics - allow us to provide unique user experiences for connected devices. Additionally, the advanced analytics enables the development of new applications and services as well as device management and monitoring in a security-rich infrastructure. This is extremely valuable in maintaining and increasing loyalty among our customers,\" said Henry Chiarelli, Executive Vice President of Gibson Brands. \n\"Since 2008, IBM has helped thousands of customers embrace the Internet of Things -- to help cities become smarter, hospitals to transform patient care and financial institutions to improve risk management,\" said Pat Toole, General Manager, Internet of Things, IBM. \"The IoT is now at an inflection point and it needs the big data expertise of IBM and little data expertise of ARM to ensure it reaches its global potential.\" \nFor more information on IBM IoT Foundation or IBM IoT for Electronics, please visit www.IBM.com/IoT . \nFor more information about IBM, please visit www.IBM.com \nFor more information about ARM, please visit www.ARM.com \nContact(s) Information", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T08:28:40.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
