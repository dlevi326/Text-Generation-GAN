It turned out that some of my colleagues here had independently had the same idea. Stay tuned for what we’re doing on that issue. \nMore broadly, I want to see more from the giants of technology – Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft and Apple. Of course, all of those companies contribute to and promote charities, but that’s not enough.

Anne Isabella Ritchie , William Makepeace Thackeray’s daughter, penned a story called ‘Mrs Dymond’ , which offers this wise advice: \n…if you give a man a fish he is hungry again in an hour; if you teach him to catch a fish you do him a good turn. \nBut I am not suggesting that those of us who live in the relative warmth and safety of Western democracies condescend to people simply trying to survive in the fractured states we have failed to save. It’s just that sending them the odd ‘fish’ – temporary aid and support – is not enough. \nWe need to change the conversation and the way we act as a human family. \nThat’s where these giant tech companies come in. They are home to some of the brightest and best. They are capable of bringing together huge resources, both financial and intellectual, in the pursuit of ever more incredible hardware and software. You're not powerless.

In an ideal world, all of the tech titans would take that idea and apply it to developing ideas and potential solutions for the massive problems that the world is grappling with. \nReducing poverty doesn’t, on the surface, seem like something that would help the bottom line, but look at Facebook’s Internet.org efforts . \nWhile it obviously helps to connect more people to the resources of the online world, it has a happy side effect for Mark Zuckerberg’s ambitions too – more eyeballs for ads, whole new markets to sell to.

Check them out and help them where you can. \nFor my part, I am working on a plan for a series of hack days across Europe, with the intention of bringing together non-profits, developers, journalists and other interested parties to work on ideas that can marry technology with the humanitarian instinct. \nIt’s a small thing but hopefully it can nudge the needle even a little in the right direction. \nIf you like the idea and can help in some way, email me – mic@thenextweb.com. And in the meantime, donate to Save The Children . \nFeature image credit: Hedinn Halldorsson/Save the Children a.k.a.
