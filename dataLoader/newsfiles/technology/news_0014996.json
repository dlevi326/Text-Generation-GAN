If you buy 5 of its new tablets, Amazon will throw in one for free — all for $US249.95.\n4K TV-quality gaming is to be delivered by the Fire TV Gaming Edition which Amazon says will offer more games than other streaming media players.\nBut whether the TV Gaming Edition finds a home in Australia is to be seen. It says the new console is 75 per cent more powerful than its inaugural Fire TV console last year, with best-in-class Wi-Fi.\nIt’s announcement comes exactly one week after Apple debuted its upgraded Apple TV which gives third party developers a way to offer games and media content through a new app store.\nIn the US Fire TV lets users watch Netflix, Amazon Video, HBO NOW, Hulu, and WatchESPN. Amazon says more than 3,000 channels, apps, and games would be available — more than with Apple TV, Roku, or Chromecast.\nUsers can add up to 128 GB of additional storage via a microSD card to take advantage of that selection. Again, Australian availability of any of these services and content is unknown.\nIn the spirit of Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana speech engines, it says Alexa, the brainchild behind Echo, will be available on TV Gaming Edition, and capable of handling queries about music, weather, traffic and general information.

Amazon says it is more durable than the latest generation iPad Air, and with 2 times more processing power than Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite.\nIt includes access to the Amazon Underground app store which it says offers more than $US10,000 in paid apps, games, and even free in-app purchases,\nIts operating system, Fire OS 5 “Bellini” has an updated user interface, new features and platform enhancements, and there is access to Amazon’s content ecosystem of more than 38 million movies, TV shows, songs, books, apps, and games.\nThe Fire tablet has front and rear cameras, up to 128 Gigabytes of expandable storage, and a battery that Amazon says offers up to 7 hours of reading, browsing the web, listening to music, and watching video.\nThe Seattle firm also announced an up-market Fire HD tablet which has a thin and light design, an HD display with more than 1 million pixels, a fast quad-core processor, stereo speakers with Dolby Audio, front and rear facing cameras, and expandable memory via microSD.\nAn 8-inch version costs $US149.99 and one with a 10.1-inch display goes for $US229.99.\nAmazon announced a Fire Kids Edition tablet for $US99.99.", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/18/1227532/558738-87645ac6-5d81-11e5-896e-4e71406d3561.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-18T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:23:07.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
