The rally, which expects 100,000 attendees, is the first of its kind and aims to spark nationwide conversations about the stigma associated with addiction and recovery. \"Addiction truly affects every one of us. Our commitment to a connected recovery community is what drives us to develop cloud-based technology,\" says Soberlink CEO Brad Keays, \"and participating in powerful events like Unite to Face Addiction gives us the opportunity to honor that commitment.\" Unite to Face Addiction is part of a growing national discussion about the national effects of the current addiction crisis. Addiction is classified as a chronic disease but it isn't treated as one. The potential in the healthcare market for recovery services is staggering. Secretary of State and Presidential Candidate Hilary Clinton recently proposed an in-depth initiative as part of the same growing national discussion. # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:47:58.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
