Let’s find out who is the more deserving . - Advertisement - \nFYI, the Zuk Z1 has already gotten 2 million pre-orders even though it is only expected to be released later in October 2015. You can’t be serious? 2 million pre-orders? That must be some sort of record. What makes the Zuk Z1 so irresistible? \nAs for the Blade D6, the pull factor seems to be its metal body which gives it the premium look and feel. That factor alone differentiates itself from the rest of the crowd. But more surprisingly, in the case of the Blade D6 (also known as Blade V6), it will be launched first in Europe as well as in other parts of the world – rather than in its native China. It is kind of surprising but bold indeed. \nNow let’s move on to the nitty gritty stuffs. The Zuk Z1 is having a body measurement of 155.7 x 77.3 x 8.9 mm (6.13 x 3.04 x 0.35 in) and weighing in at 175 g (6.17 oz), you can consider it as slim but not lightweight. There will also be a fingerprint sensor which can be used to unlock the screen as well as to authorize payment using your mobile device. This feature is normally found in flagship devices or much more expensive smartphones, so you can safely say that the Zuk Z1 belongs in that category. \nMeanwhile on the Blade D6, it is incredibly thin at 6.95mm and weighs just a tad 120 g which really makes it slim and light. The aluminum body makes for even better styling and weight reduction. This whole package makes the Blade D6 looks simply amazing. \nAs for the screens, Zuk Z1 has a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~401 ppi pixel density. As it attempts to position itself in the high-end category, it is still relevant to have this resolution. Because as we know, there are only a handful of devices that made the jump to Quad HD or 2K resolution. Some have complained how it drains battery so fast and heats up so easily. Perhaps next year we could see better cooling and greener tech to overcome this issue. \nThe Blade D6 instead is sporting only a 5-inch High Definition IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 720 x 1280 pixels or ~294 ppi pixel density, which is quite the norm these days. The IPS technology does help in terms of allowing you to share the screen with a friend or two and still look good. \nIt is a no-brainer that the Zuk Z1 wins over the Blade D6 by a huge margin. Bigger screen and higher resolution makes for an amazing combination. \nNow let’s check out what is powering up each devices shall we? Under the hood of the Zuk Z1 would be the Qualcomm MSM8974AC Snapdragon 801 chipset, Quad-core 2.5 GHz Krait 400 processor, Adreno 330 graphics and 3GB RAM. It is a bit surprising that it didn’t go the Octa-core way but that is like the best Quad-core processor already. The graphics combined with 3GB memory will ensure that you can run almost everything out there with ease. \nIn terms of raw processing power, the Blade D6 is equipped with the Mediatek MT6735 chipset paired with a Quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, Mali-T720MP2 and 2GB RAM. The combination makes for a medium level kind of performance where it probably won’t disappoint you as you run all of your favorite apps and games. \nBetter chipset, faster processor, additional 1GB memory really makes the Zuk Z1 pulling away from the competition this time around. - Advertisement - \nAs for the camera department, there’s the 13MP-8MP setup found on the Zuk Z1 which would really serve you well. Even though we should only wait for it to be released before making any comments, but to have that high of a combination goes to say that Lenovo really give it a go here. Still remember about the 2 million pre-orders? \nMeanwhile on the Blade D6, it has the 13MP-5MP camera combination which makes for a really decent point-and-shoot camera. The primary camera is blessed with 4128 x 3096 pixels, autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection and panorama which is quite the standard that you would expect. \nEven though we should wait for a proper camera shoot-out, but judging from the specs alone; the Zuk Z1 seems to be better especially for taking selfie shots. \nStorage-wise, you should be getting enough on the Zuk Z1 with its built-in 64GB of internal storage. The only issue is that you can’t further expand it since it does not have a microSD slot. Perhaps you should be doing some spring cleaning and taking out the trash every 3-4 months, which is a good practice by the way. This could result in a snappier and more responsive device, just like new. \nOn the Blade D6, you will find that it has 16GB of internal storage which you can further expand it with the available microSD slot. But do take note that if you do that, you will then have to sacrifice your 2 nd sim. \nIn terms of software, the Zuk Z1 will be powered by Android Lollipop 5.1 with Cyanogen Mod 12.1 at the helm. Not sure how it will work, but if it were similar to how OnePlus One and Yu Yureka is bundling their smartphone with the OS; then you should be in for a treat. No excess baggage which means no unnecessary pre-installed apps and games. It should be as light as possible and no intrusive background process as well. Yes, we do encounter some very high-end devices but its performance was somewhat hampered when it comes with lots of bloatware which would then give a performance hit. \nVersus the Blade D6, it really is interesting to note that the Blade D6 comes with MiFavor 3.2 which is based on Android Lollipop 5.0. The customized version of the OS has its own benefits as it provides a clean and responsive interface. \nAt the end of the day, it could be down to preference as both should be doing a good job. \nAs far as battery is concerned, the Zuk Z1 will be powered by a non-removable Li-Po 4100 mAh battery. There should be no problem powering it up for a good full day. It could even stretch to 2-3 days if you are the more casual user type. Remember that it won’t have lots of unnecessary apps constantly running on the background due to the nature of its OS, which in turn would save some battery life as well. \nThe Blade D6 is further letdown by its meager Li-Ion 2200 mAh battery as compared to the Zuk Z1. For its specs, it might even struggle to last you for a full day if you are a heavy user. Best if you can invest slightly more to get yourself a power bank. \nFinally, you should know that both of them have dual sim capability and 4G LTE functionality as well. This would certainly add more value to it. - Advertisement - \nI think by now you should have seen how great the Lenovo Zuk Z1 is and why it garnered 2 million pre-orders even though it is still 2 months to go before it gets released. Surely you won’t regret joining in the crowd to own one. \nAs compared to the ZTE Blade D6 which comes with stylish metal body but everything else just feels average. If you are in the market for a great-looking smartphone, then this could be just the one for you. Just don’t expect it to perform wonders, then you should be fine. \nThe Lenovo Zuk Z1 is expected to be released first in China sometime in October 2015 and is currently available for pre-orders at $279 USD. It would be available in White and Dark Gray. There have also been some rumors of an international version, perhaps higher specs and higher pricing? \nThe ZTE Blade D6 is available for approximately $279 USD or close to the equivalent in your market and is available in Pink, Gold, Gray and Silver.
