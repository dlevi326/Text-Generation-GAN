Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Ky Chow When you're a Chinese company such as Huawei trying to make a dent in a crowded smartphone and wearables market, a new or supercharged feature can make a splash. Unfortunately, this approach can also be dismissed as gimmickry.\nWith the approaching October launches of its watch, G8 smartphone and M2 tablet, Huawei has revamped at least one common feature which will have its famous competitors playing catch up.\nThe Huawei Watch\nThe Chinese company's first Android smartwatch will be available from October 15 in Australia, and so far it looks good. Appearance is the key here, since while its feature set is standard Android wear - no speakerphone or camera - its smooth design looks more like a normal watch than almost any other smart watch. Sure, at 11.3 millimetres it joins the Apple Watch at the thicker end, but it still won't attract too many double takes.\nThe Huawei Watch looks more like a 'normal' watch than any other wearable. Supplied You get a choice of four different stainless steel case colours and strap combinations, and such sturdy materials help explain why it's not one of the cheaper smart watches in Australia, ranging between $549 to $749.\nG8 smartphone\nThe fingerprint scanner discretely indented on the back of Huawei's new G8 smartphone sets a new standard. It not only works quickly, but unlike Apple or Samsung's latest, you don't need to push a power button before scanning. If you pull your phone out of your pocket or bag with your finger placed correctly, using it is as fast as a phone without a security lock.\nYou can customise the scanner to also check and clear notifications, answer calls and snap photos by tapping or swiping. Huawei is keen to trumpet the G8's camera, which sports an optical image stabiliser that promises less blurry pictures than the iPhone 6 Plus. In our hands-on, its photos seem pretty decent compared to an iPhone 6. But kissing goodbye to a power button or security code? That's a game changer. While there's no official announcement of an Australian price or carriers, the G8's â‚¬399 price in Europe suggests a price of around $650.\nHuawei's new MediaPad M2 delivers a great screen, a solid body and dual speakers at a mid-market price. Supplied MediaPad M2 8.0 tablet\nHuawei's entry in the 8 inch tablet race is all metal, giving it a sleekness that, along with its 4G capability, belies what's likely to be a \"mid-market\" (say, $400-$600) price tag when it launches late October. The M2's other main attraction over, the slightly lighter and thinner but almost certainly more expensive iPad Mini 4, are dual Harmon/Kadon speakers. We're not sure how compelling this will be to anyone who doesn't spend a lot of time watching YouTube in their bedroom. If only it had the G8's fingerprint scanner.\nKy Chow travelled to San Francisco as a guest of Huawei\nThe Huawei G8 smartphone's fingerprint scanner is a far more useful feature than some of the gimmicks offered by fiercely competing smartphone manufacturers.
