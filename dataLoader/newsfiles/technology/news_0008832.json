The social media company is working with financial services firm Square Inc to help White House hopefuls collect campaign cash.\nAt least a dozen candidates will begin using the fundraising service right away, said Jenna Golden, Twitter's director of political ad sales.\n\"We think about donating to a campaign as an old-fashioned, traditional process, a cumbersome process,\" Ms Golden said.\nRepublican Scott Walker was among the first to adopt the new feature\n\"This was an incredible opportunity for us to simplify and streamline.\"\nTwitter has already become the go-to tool for candidates looking to aggressively spread their campaign message, as well as link to web-based online donation forms.\nBut the new @SquareCash feature allows users to give to their candidate of choice quickly and from any device.\nWith 2016 campaign costs expected to surpass the $2bn spent in 2012, candidates will likely welcome any new conduit for cash.\nDemocratic candidate Bernie Sanders and Republicans Scott Walker and Rick Santorum were among the first to use the new feature on Tuesday.\nMr Walker's campaign wrote on Twitter: \"Just launched our @SquareCash account. Show Scott Walker some support going into the second debate by donating $2.\"\nAnyone looking to donate is required to submit their identifying details under the guidelines of the Federal Election Commission.\nUsers can then choose to \"share\" the news of their donation to their Twitter followers.\nCandidates also can pay Twitter to promote their fundraising-linked tweets, the company said.\nMs Golden said the feature is also available to local and state-level candidates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:17:46.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
