Priceline.com is collaborating with 15 influencers in all, sending them to 15 hotels in 15 cities throughout September and October to share partner hotels. \nWhat’s more, if followers guess which hotel the Instagram photo was taken at, they could win $300 to use toward staying in their own #RoomWithAView. \nAs of this writing, the hashtag #RoomWithAView has racked up more than 282,000 posts. \nIn addition to Cuoco-Sweeting, priceline.com is partnering with Brooke Dombroski , Leo Chan , Sazan Hendrix , Tessa Barton , Jillian Harris , Marissa Meade , Roderick Hunt , Mary Seng , Kat Tanita , Bryan Dale , Max Wastler and Jenny Bernheim . \nWith the campaign, priceline.com “aims to leverage its hotel partners and influencer friends while tapping into travelers’ fondness for aspirational travel photography and drive to get the best deal,” according to the online travel agency. \nThe campaign’s overall goal is to show that Instagram-worthy hotel views are attainable when booking through priceline.com at deep discounts. \nBelow are some of TravelPulse’s favorite Instagram photos from the participating influencers.
