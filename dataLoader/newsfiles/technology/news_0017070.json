(Photo: Wink)\n4 CONNECT 20 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE SAN FRANCISCO - Perhaps Quirky was too quirky.\nThe invention-sourcing website filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Tuesday after six years trying to make a go of spinning amateur creations into cash. But Quirky's Internet of Things-focused offshoot, Wink, will be sold, and currently has a $15 million bid from Flextronics, a San Jose, Calif-based supply chain company.\nLittle surprise Wink has suitors, given the coming onslaught of IoT products over the coming years, a quintupling to 25 billion devices by 2020, according to Gartner. Leveraging the Wink HUB controller, homeowners can manipulate products ranging from lights to garage doors to cameras.\nQuirky's filing comes after founder and CEO Ben Kaufman took leave of his company this summer in the wake of multiple rounds of layoffs as well as a problematic security update for Wink HUB. New York-based Quirky had raised nearly $200 million since its founding in 2009, but was down to around $12 million back in mid-July. An attempt to raise another round of funding was not successful.\nAmong Quirky's more popular product launches was a pivoting power strip. Competitors in the amateur-invention space include Edison Nation, which focuses on those creating new products for the consumer and medical space.\nA statement on the Quirky website paid particular attention to the company's still thriving Wink platform. It noted that the filing \"does not impact the Wink experience for our users nor how Wink operates day-to-day. Our engineers and designers will continue to enhance our platform to provide new, meaningful ways for you to interact with your smart home. The Wink HUB and Wink Relay will continue to be available at The Home Depot and Amazon. ... Wink will continue to be Wink.\"\nAlthough Quirky has an offer for Wink, it hopes to attract competing offers and close a sale in the next 60 days.\nFollow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava @marcodellacava\n4 CONNECT 20 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1KtjqUQ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1KtjqUQ", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KtjqUQ&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635785252080554381-Quirk.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b1242a0bbac3b588cc15f91c31dff81e080418a4/c=108-0-1538-1075&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635785252080554381-Quirk.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KtjqUQ&text=Quirky%20files%20for%20Chapter%2011%2C%20sells%20Wink&via=usatoday", "http://twitter.com/marcodellacava", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aaa527894a8a41c93d8ce192d1488018c3d414d7/r=500x326/local/-/media/2015/09/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635785252080554381-Quirk.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-22T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T08:14:40.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
