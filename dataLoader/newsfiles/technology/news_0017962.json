Your network is a goldmine and is the cornerstone to your business development! \nMost companies, especially small businesses, drop the ball when it comes to relationship management (don’t try to hide back there, retailers; it’s just as important for you as it is to service companies). In the worst case, they have no customer relationship management software, and in the typical case, they have a poor CRM or a badly implemented one. \nI implemented Contactually when I was interim COO, and along with some sales training, we increased sales 25 percent. It ain’t rocket science — and, yes, after 10 years in the missile defense industry, I know rocket science. \nImplement a CRM and make it your home page, especially if you’re the CEO. \nWhat are your thoughts?
