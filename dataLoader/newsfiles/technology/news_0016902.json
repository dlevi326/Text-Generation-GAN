SunPower Logo. <- stripped tags -><- stripped tags -><- stripped tags -> LA TOUR-DE-SALVAGNY, France , Sept. 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- SunPower announced today that it supplied high efficiency SunPower ® solar panels for the 12-megawatt Roc du Doun solar power plant dedicated on Friday in Gros-Chastang, Correze, France . The plant is owned by La Compagnie du Vent, a subsidiary of ENGIE. La Compagnie du Vent hosted the dedication event, which was attended by French President Francois Hollande. SunPower supplied a total of 41 megawatts of its solar panels to La Compagnie du Vent for the construction of four solar power plants under the French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy national tender program. All four solar plants are located in France and are now operational. The high efficiency SunPower solar panels are manufactured at SunPower's facility in Toulouse, France . \"La Compagnie du Vent has been a valued SunPower partner since 2012, and we are pleased to assist them in delivering 41 megawatts of emission-free solar power for homes and businesses in France ,\" said SunPower Executive Vice President Jorg Heinemann . \"SunPower has more than 1,500 megawatts of solar plants operating or under contract around the world today. With high-performance SunPower technology, power plant developers may reliably maximize power production for 25 years or more.\" The Roc du Doun solar power plant is expected to generate approximately 16,800,000 kilowatt-hours of energy each year, which may serve the electricity demand of an estimated 7,000 persons in the region, according to La Compagnie du Vent. The first of the four recent La Compagnie du Vent projects for which SunPower supplied panels was the 12-megawatt Langele solar power plant, which is located in France's Aquitaine Region and was dedicated in late 2014. The other projects included a 12-megawatt project in the Auvergne region and a 5-megawatt project in the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region. In 2012, SunPower also worked with La Compagnie du Vent to deliver the 4-megawatt Porette de Nerone solar plant in Aghione, Corsica.
