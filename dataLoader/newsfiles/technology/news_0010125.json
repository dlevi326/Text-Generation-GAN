Let’s look at Huawei G8 and ZTE Blade D6 which are both metal and have that premium look and feel attached to them. - Advertisement - \nWe all feel the need to be different from others. The need to have that exclusive feeling but at the same time, it should be bold enough to have the firepower to perform our needs. If you have got the money to spend, then why not spend it on the right device? \nWhen you first look at the G8, you can feal that instant attraction that is very hard to resist. Although at the moment, we don’t have any details on its exact measurement and weight as it is expected to be released only in the coming 1-2 months. Should it come with a thin and lightweight body, then it is a welcomed bonus. \nZTE are among the leading Chinese manufacturers which have garnered international attention over the years. Even then, the Blade D6 (also known as Blade V6) seems to be launched first in Europe as well as in other parts of the world – rather than in its native China. It is a bold move indeed. Weighing in at just 120g and at 6.95mm thin, it is very slim and lightweight for its size. It even gets better due to the fact that it employs the aluminum alloy body for style and weight reduction. The end result is that the Blade D6 simple looks amazing. \nJudging by the look, it seems that the Blade D6 looks much better. It has the body and size to boot as well; therefore it gets the nod in this case. \nIn terms of screen, the G8 will be sporting a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~401 ppi pixel density which makes for some really interesting viewing on the screen. You would certainly enjoy the time spent browsing the internet and watching your favorite videos on it. \nWhereas on the Blade D6, it is only s porting a 5-inch High Definition IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 720 x 1280 pixels or ~294 ppi pixel density, which is a lot less than what the G8 has to offer. In fact you can call it as average these days. The IPS technology does help in terms of allowing you to share the screen with a friend or two and still look good. \nPutting them side-by-side, definitely the G8 is so much better due to its bigger screen and higher pixel count. Or p erhaps a jump to the Quad HD would be good for the G8? But it would have cost more and the battery draining issue that comes with it. \nNow we’ve come to the hardware side of things, and the G8 is quite impressive actually. It has a Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 chipset, an Octa-core processor with Quad-core 1.7 GHz Cortex-A53 & quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53 and Adreno 405 graphics. There are 2 variants available, one with 2GB RAM + 16GB storage and 3GB RAM + 32GB storage. \nMeanwhile for the Blade D6, it is equipped with the Mediatek MT6735 chipset paired with a Quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, Mali-T720MP2 and 2GB RAM. \nThis is where the G8 again shows its strength as it is using a slightly better chipset and doubles the number of cores as well. Whatever it is, both are good enough to go when it comes to performance and it probably won’t disappoint you as you run all of your favorite apps and games. - Advertisement - \nNow let’s take a look at how they will fare on the camera. The G8 comes with a 13 Megapixel primary shooter and 5 Megapixel secondary shooter; which you can count on it to deliver good pictures at the end of day. The 13MP camera even has dual-LED flash which should make your pictures look great even under low-light conditions. \nIt is exactly the same as what is found in the Blade D6 which also has a 13MP-5MP camera combination which makes for a really decent point-and-shoot camera. The primary camera is blessed with 4128 x 3096 pixels, autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection and panorama which is quite the standard that you would expect from a mid-range smartphone. \nIt will be hard to choose a winner, we will need a camera shoot-out to be able to decide which smartphone provides a better camera package. \nAs mentioned just now, there are actually 2 variants available for the G8’s storage. Both 16BG and 32GB model can be further expanded with a microSD slot which can accommodate up to an additional 64Gb of space. \nAs compared to the Blade D6 which has, 16GB of internal storage, that you can further expand it with the available microSD slot. But do take note that if you do that, you will then have to sacrifice your 2 nd sim. \nIn terms of the operating system, the G8 will be boasting the latest Android Lollipop 5.1 right out of the box that is certainly a great compliment to its strong hardware that it possesses. \nMeanwhile for the Blade D6, it comes with MiFavor 3.2 which is based on Android Lollipop 5.0. The customized version of the OS has its benefits as it provides a clean and responsive interface. \nIt depends on whether you prefer the plain Android or a customized version of it. \nBattery-wise, the G8 is packed with a 3000 mAh battery that should have no problems powering up the device for at least a day. The same can’t be said confidently on the Blade D6, as it is only powered by a Li-Ion 2200 mAh battery which might struggle to last you for a full day if you are a heavy user. Best if you can invest slightly more to get yourself a power bank. \nFinally, both the G8 and Blade D6 does have 4G LTE and dual sim capability which further adds value to their offerings. - Advertisement - \nHuawei G8 looks great on the outside and have great performance on the inside. If you can come up with the right amount of money to own it, then you shouldn’t regret it at all. It falls just below the flagship level and should perform really well for you. \nWith a metal body, it automatically gives ZTE Blade D6 a boost in terms of its look and feel. Filled with decent hardware, it might not be the latest in terms of performance but it ticks the entire boxes well. Perhaps it could have a slightly bigger battery size, but other than that; it is a pretty solid smartphone. \nAs a summary, I strongly believe that the G8 does justify its higher price tag when compared against the Blade D6. \nThe Huawei G8 is expected to be available in the coming weeks and China will be its first recipient. It will be available for $329 USD for the 2GB RAM/16GB storage variant and $389 USD for the 3GB RAM/32GB storage variant. It comes in black, white and gold. \nThe ZTE Blade D6 is available for approximately $279 USD, or close to the equivalent in your market and is available in Pink, Gold, Gray and Silver.
