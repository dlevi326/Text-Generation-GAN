Soon, you can report their misconduct at the flick of a button. Traffic police have joined hands with a group of developers to create an app which they hope will be a one-stop solution for commuters' woes. The app, expected to be rolled out in a month, will allow citizens to register complaints against drivers who refuse to ply or charge excess fare. They can even calculate the amount in case they feel the meter is tampered with. The most ambitious part of the project is the digital meter. Once passengers board the autorickshaw, they will have to key in details of the driver and the vehicle. Via GPS, the app will start tracking the journey and alert the passenger if the driver is taking a longer route. \"The digital meter will display the approximate fare based on the distance covered. If one finds any deviation, he/she can lodge a complaint by pushing a button,\" said MA Saleem, additional commissioner of police, traffic. Police have taken the app route after the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) and the SMS system failed to take off as expected. Although many commuters have been using social media to report cases, few have utilized the official platforms. Through the app, one can also file other kinds of complaints. Since it is GPS-based, traffic cops can easily reach the user's spot and book cases. Officers said despite the surge in app-based cab services, there is a demand for autorickshaws in the city. Complaints regarding drivers are increasing on a daily basis. \"If errant autorickshaw drivers can be reined in, we believe more people will opt for autorickshaws,\" Saleem added.
