(TSX: VXS), a pioneer and leader in media processing solutions, reported its second quarter results for the period ending July 31, 2015 today.

While I'm disappointed in the company's recent financial performance, we are undergoing an important refocusing effort that includes the appointment of a CEO, which we anticipate announcing shortly. Our focus remains returning to profitability through the monetization and commercialization of ViXS' leading technology and products,\" stated Peter Currie, ViXS' Board Chair. \nQ2 FY2016 Results Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 totalled $6.0 million, sequentially lower than $10.0 million recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This decrease was primarily due to quarterly fluctuations and timing of MoCA based products that had higher shipments in Q1, though partially offset by increased sales of our XCode5 and legacy XCode4 products. Revenues decreased by $3.0 million from the same quarter last year, mainly due to lower XCode 6400 sales as first generation Ultra HD TV companion designs came to an end plus lower sales of legacy products and partially offset by higher MoCA sales. \nGross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 34.3%, a decrease from the previous quarter's level of 47.1% and a 9.0% point decrease from the second quarter of fiscal 2015. This decrease in margin from the first quarter was primarily due to lower discrete MoCA pricing that took full effect in the quarter, along with additional testing of XCode products and higher amortization costs. \nTotal operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 decreased by $2.1 million to $4.6 million. Research & Development (R&D) spending decreased to $2.7 million compared to $4.1 million in the previous quarter, due primarily to a $0.9 positive non-cash adjustment to the repayable government assistance provision. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter decreased by $0.7 million compared to previous quarter due to a reduction in stock compensation expense and lower professional services and overhead. \nIFRS comprehensive loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was $(3.0) million, or a loss of $(0.06) per share basic and diluted. This is compared to a loss of $(1.8) million in the previous quarter, but despite the lower revenue levels was still a $0.8 million improvement from the $(3.8) million loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. \nNon-IFRS net loss for the current quarter (as defined in the Non-IFRS Financial Measures section) totalled $(3.6) million, compared to a $(2.2) million loss in the previous quarter and a $0.2 million improvement from the $(3.8) million loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. The Non-IFRS loss for the fiscal year to date 2016 was $(5.9) million compared to $(8.7) million in the same period last year. This continued year-over-year improvement in non-IFRS net loss from operations is a result of cost efficiencies and controls we continue to implement in our operations and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. \nAs at July 31, 2015, the Company's cash and cash equivalents was $6.6 million including $2.5 million in outstanding bank debt. This decrease in cash was primarily due to lower than expected revenue levels in the quarter, certain working capital cash outlays in support of our continued operations and product development. In addition, the company incurred a one-time payment to a customer to settle an unresolved contract payment rather than litigate.

These non-IFRS measures are disclosed as a supplement to financial results prepared in accordance with IFRS in order to provide a further understanding of ViXS' results of operations from management's perspective. In particular, ViXS uses non-IFRS measures to provide investors with supplemental measures of its operating performance and highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be readily apparent solely from IFRS measures. ViXS management uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, prepare annual operating budgets and assess ViXS' ability to meet its future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. ViXS believes that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. \nNon-IFRS net income (loss) is defined as total comprehensive income (loss) before share-based transaction expense, exchange difference related to translating foreign operations, unrealized currency gains/losses and non-recurring or one-time items such as: share offering costs, listing fees, convertible preferred share revaluation adjustment, fair value adjustment on warrant liability and provision for repayable government assistance. Non-IFRS net income (loss) does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and is not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Non-IFRS net income (loss) from operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comprehensive income (loss) prepared in accordance with IFRS. \nViXS has provided a comparison of comprehensive income (loss) to non-IFRS net loss in the following table: Six Month Period Three Month Period Ended Ended July 31, April 30, July 31, July 31, July 31, 2015 2015 2014 2015 2014 Comprehensive loss for the period ($3,013) ($1,771) ($3,775) ($4,784) ($8,888) R&D adjustments Stock-based compensation expense (130) 163 106 33 451 Provision for repayment of government assistance (854) (294) (854) (405) Selling, general and administrative Stock based compensation expense 55 (214) 460 (159) 659 Other Income/Expense adjustments Unrealized currency loss (gain) 290 (419) (264) (129) (559) Other adjustments Exchange differences on translating foreign operations 13 5 (12) 18 18 Non-IFRS net loss ($3,639) ($2,236) ($3,779) ($5,875) ($8,724)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:34:25.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
