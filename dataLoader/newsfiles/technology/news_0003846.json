Weight loss is a difficult and personal journey that before and after photos can never truly detail. The real journey is in the ups and downs, steps forward, and stumbles backward. \nTo shed light on the real stories behind weight loss, Lose It! , the popular app-based weight loss program, has created the #MyDayMyWay social media campaign for anyone to share their weight loss challenges and triumphs, allowing participants to learn from and motivate one another. To participate, simply share your stories, photos, app screen shots, and videos tagged with #MyDayMyWay on Twitter or Instagram through December 17. Entrants will be eligible for multiple prizes, including a $500 cash prize. \nThe #MyDayMyWay campaign recognizes that there is no right way to lose weight and that weight loss is not a straight line between the before and after photo. Rather, MyDayMyWay provides a non-judgmental forum to share the challenges, triggers, and positive habits that lead to successful weight loss, along with helpful tips and tricks to break through the barriers we all face. \nSee for yourself; watch 15 remarkable people share how they overcame weight loss obstacles and are now able to maintain healthy lifestyles through good habits learned along the way. \n“MyDayMyWay instantly jumped out to me as an inspiring program to share with my followers,” said Sarah Dussault, author, fitness YouTuber, and founder of Sarah Fit . “As I prepare to become a new mom, my daily health and fitness routines have changed to accommodate my changing body. I’m participating in MyDayMyWay to share the ups and downs of my own weight loss journey, and to show other new moms that there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to living a happy and healthy lifestyle.” \nEstablished in 2008, Lose It! has helped more than 25 million members shed more than 40 million pounds by delivering the most comprehensive, personal app-based weight loss program. Lose It! is focused around a non-restrictive diet and the proven principles of calorie tracking and community support for healthy, sustainable weight loss. \n\"We think the weight loss industry is doing people a disservice by promoting ‘get slim quick’ advertisements that trick people into thinking that weight loss is easy,” says Charles Teague, Lose It! CEO. \"At Lose It!, we acknowledge how bumpy the weight loss road can be, and aim to support people every step of the way. By sharing real stories from real people, MyDayMyWay is our way of not just celebrating the end of the journey, but all the bumps in between.” \n*A.B. Geier, M.B. Schwartz, and K.D.
