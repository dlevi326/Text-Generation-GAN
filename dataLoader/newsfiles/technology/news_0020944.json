Built to survive in the most challenging environments, the XG3-ER offers powerful long-range barcode scanning and is one of only a few devices available with Intermec’s industry-leading EX25 near/far imager. \nDesigned for manufacturing, transportation and logistics, and warehouse applications, the new XG3-ER incorporates breakthrough auto-focus technology that results in barcode reading range that is 30 percent greater than competitive scanners. With unparalleled flexibility to read virtually any kind of 1D and 2D barcode, omni-directionally, from 6 inches out to more than 50 feet, the XG3-ER provides accurate, motion-tolerant scanning when lighting conditions are dim or the barcodes are damaged, obscured or placed on high shelving. \n“The extended-range XG3-ER combines all the winning features found in Janam’s recently introduced XG3 gun-shaped mobile computer with the industry’s only auto-focusing imaging technology that can read near and far field,” said Harry B Lerner, CEO of Janam. “As organizations focus on enhancing supply chain efficiencies and lowering costs, the XG3-ER delivers the latest technological advancements needed to help businesses of any size enhance the efficiency of their supply chain and ultimately lower operational expenditures.” \nDesigned to excel in the most challenging environments, the XG3 is Janam’s next-generation, gun-shaped rugged mobile computer. Eliminating the weight and bulk associated with many competitive devices, it is the lightest industrial-grade device in its class. \nWith its sleek design and superior performance, the XG3-ER can survive multiple six-foot drops to concrete on all sides across a full spectrum of temperatures and is sealed to IP65 standards for use in wet and dirty environments. It also delivers industry-leading battery life with a standard 5200mAh hot-swappable Li-ion battery ensuring uninterrupted operation throughout the workday. \nXG3-ER Features: Lightest industrial-grade mobile computer in its class – under 22 ounces Microsoft Windows Embedded Handheld 6.5 operating system Powerful ARM Cortex-A8 processor @1GHz High-performance, long-range barcode scanning with EX25 near/far 2D imager Brilliant 3.5-inch VGA TFT display with hardened glass Multiple 6’/1.8m drops to concrete across operating temperature range Sealed to IP65 standards", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T17:03:06.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
