The plant's operations were halted in 1989 due to an earthquake, and resumed again in 1995. \nRussia is exploring the possibilities of participation in construction of the new power unit of the Armenian nuclear power plant (NPP), according to the documents on the working visit of President Serzh Sargsyan to Russia. \n\"Along with assisting in ensuring the safe operation of the Armenian nuclear power plant, the Russian side is studying the possibility of participation in the construction of new power unit,\" the document said. \nIn March 2014, the government of Armenia decided to extend the service life of the second power unit due to the delays in the construction of a new unit. Russia's nuclear energy corporation Rosatom together with the Armenian experts agreed to work on the project to extend the power unit's service life until 2026. \nRussia and Armenia signed a deal in 2014 to cooperate on the issue of extending the service life of the second reactor. \nThe Armenian Nuclear Power Plant was put into operation in 1980. The plant's operations were halted in 1989 due to an earthquake, and resumed again in 1995. \nThe European Union has been calling on Armenia to suspend the NPP's operations for several years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T12:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:12:57.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
