Martin, MD, Managing Partner of North Shore Eye Care. “ALS is truly a brutal and unforgiving disease as we’ve recently witnessed here at North Shore Eye Care when one of our doctors was recently diagnosed with ALS,” said Dr. Martin. “Two years ago, Dr. Frank Verdone was running in multiple half marathons, enjoying skiing with his family and leading an active lifestyle. At our recent optometric symposium, Dr. John Mauro, Dr. Drew Bainnson and myself had to help Dr. Verdone onto the stage for his lecture,” said Dr. Martin. “Today, he walks with a cane and even the most simple activity causes him great discomfort. It just goes to show you how quickly our lives can be changed by diseases like ALS.”\nThe staff and doctors of North Shore Eye Care and their optometric co-managing partners anticipate a great turnout for the Fall ALS Walk on Saturday. “It’s a great opportunity for us to get together outside of our work environment to enjoy time with our families, friends and coworkers with helping raise awareness and funds for the fight against ALS,” said Dr. Martin.\nALS - also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease - is a progressive disorder of part of the nervous system that controls voluntary movement. ALS typically causes the muscles in the body to become progressively weaker, resulting in eventual paralysis and death. “In the last 75 years, there has been very little progress in a cure or even a treatment for this fatal disease,” said Dr. Martin.\nDr. Martin indicated that the majority of the doctors and staff of North Shore Eye Care are going to participate in this Saturday’s Fall ALS walk and he hopes many of Long Island's optometric physicians do so, as well. “We are committed to helping raise awareness of ALS and look forward to having a fun and successful walk this Saturday,” he said. “We have also reached out to our referring optometrists and even some of our patients, so we expect a large turnout in Eisenhower Park this weekend.”\nNorth Shore Eye Care is Long Island’s most established full-service comprehensive eye care provider. This year they are celebrating 52 years of eye care excellence since Dr. Sidney Martin founded the practice in 1962.
