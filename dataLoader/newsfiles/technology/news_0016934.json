Fred Katayama   \nBeware the iOS 9 upgrade. Many Apple customers taking to social media, complaining their mobile devices crashed after they tried uploading the latest operating system. They grumbled about two things. One: getting the error message, \"Software Update Failed,\" with the upgrade failing after several minutes. Tech analysts think overloaded servers were the likely culprit because too many people probably tried to download the software at the same time. Two: locking up when users with older iPhones and iPads came to the \"swipe to upgrade\" page. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Apple shares shedding some of their 3 percent gain this year in early trading. Last year's iOS 8 also had bugs ... that would drop cellular service and make the fingerprint reading Touch ID inoperable, locking up the phones. Publisher Charlie Brown of the tech site CyberShack said, \"The risk to Apple in terms of having dissatisfied customers is that as their customer base grows, so will the number of those dissatisfied customers.\" His advice: wait a few days before downloading upgrades so manufacturers can solve any glitches. An Apple tomorrow keeps the tech doctor away.  //reut.rs/1MgZEfL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T21:23:07.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
