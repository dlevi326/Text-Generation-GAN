These data are used to optimise the extraction conditions applied to any given feedstock. \nLarsen said: \"During processing, both locally and at other sites across the globe, we switch to an 'abbreviated' form of GPC/SEC called flow injection polymer analysis (FIPA). \n\"This is not as informative as 'standard' GPC/SEC but measurements are much faster, making it very useful for extraction control. \n\"FIPA provides averaged values of MW and IV in around ten minutes, so we can quickly check that the extraction is proceeding as it should.\" \nFIPA can be implemented on a Viscotek system simply by changing to a different separation column. \nIt provides averaged rather than distributed values for the sample because the column performs a simpler separation of the bulk polymer from any impurities or low molecular weight material. This means that measurement is relatively quick. \nUsing the FIPA and 'standard' GPC/SEC in tandem is a beneficial strategy for optimising the cost-efficiency of the technique within the manufacturing environment.
