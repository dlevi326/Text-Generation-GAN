PC Magazine believes providers who use OpenVPN , the industry standard for securing your online network is \" a lot better than the common (and older) PPTP .\" \n\"We are the author of OpenVPN core software used by millions of consumers and businesses around the world. It's true that the PPTP protocol has serious known vulnerabilities and this is one reason why OpenVPN software has become the de facto standard in terms of flexibility, security, privacy and access,\" says Francis Dinha, CEO of OpenVPN Technologies Inc. \nThe California based software company wants consumers and businesses in search of a trusted VPN to come directly to the source. The authors of OpenVPN developed Private Tunnel , a VPN service being recognized by more and more small businesses and even large enterprises as a tool for securing Internet access. \n\"With all the hacking, tracking, privacy and security breaches in the news, consumers and business need to be careful when they select a reliable VPN service provider. What some may not realize is that our Private Tunnel VPN service is powered by our core OpenVPN software and is the only VPN fully supported and backed by our team at OpenVPN and used by large enterprises for mission critical applications,\" says Dinha. \nPrivate Tunnel urges consumers to pick a service that meets their needs and is fully supported. Be wary of free services that merely provide proxies that may connect you to a resource but don't provide encryption of your data or other protections. Read the terms of service carefully and stay away from free services that can inject advertisements into your browser to actually infect your device with malware and ad tracking. These are some basic tips to get you started in the right direction. \n\"When enterprises such as Google, Tesla, Samsung, HP, IBM, and renowned Universities around the world are using our core OpenVPN software, this sends a strong message of trust to the consumer. PC Mag addresses the issue of finding the right VPN service. To take this a step further, anyone looking for a VPN service should make sure they are dealing with a credible company that not only services consumers, but the large business enterprises as well. When you are able to deliver reliability and confidence to major enterprises, this is a win for any consumer,\" says Dinha.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:04:58.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
