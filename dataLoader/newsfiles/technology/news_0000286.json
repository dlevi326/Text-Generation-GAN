Although the prototype does not retain one hundred percent of the compounds gradually they accumulate and partially clean the air. \nParra Suarez relates that the idea came from the eighties in order to remove lead from the atmosphere and purify the air. The project also helps meet the requirements demanded by the general law of environmental protection , for which businesses must reduce the emission of pollutants. \nThe innovation is protected by patent registration before the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI) and soon will have the granting of the corresponding property title. \nThe researcher reports that the design can also be used to clean up some of the pollution from vehicles and large businesses, and already has a prototype that will be placed in the kitchen of the Institute for Renewable Energy . \nThe intention is to commercialize the prototype at an affordable price.
