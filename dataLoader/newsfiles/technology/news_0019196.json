QA Wizard Pro is used by software engineers and testers to automate the process of testing Microsoft Windows, Java-based, and web browser-based applications. The new pricing effectively removes cost as a barrier to using commercial-grade functional test automation as part of a quality assurance strategy.\n“In today’s agile development environments, test automation is vitally important for maintaining the high pace of software releases,” said Rick Riccetti, Seapine Software’s president and CEO. “The high cost of test automation tools keeps them out of reach for many teams, which can affect both quality and the number of features a team can produce in a given timeframe. Today, we’re changing the calculus.”\nBeginning today, Seapine will license QA Wizard Pro and its add-on components for an annual fee per user—and at a much lower entry price point. During the subscription period, customers will receive all new versions of the software and have access to Seapine’s highly-regarded technical support team. Current QA Wizard Pro customers will see no change with their existing perpetual licenses, but can now add additional licenses at a lower cost per year. Seapine has also reduced pricing for load testing virtual users and is also offering them as a subscription.\nFor more details about QA Wizard Pro, including pricing, visit: http://www.seapine.com/qa-wizard-pro/overview .\nAbout Seapine Software\nSeapine Software, Inc. is a privately held technology company whose application lifecycle management (ALM) solutions help companies manage the process of developing high quality complex products—often in regulated industries.
