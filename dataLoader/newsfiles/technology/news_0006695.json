The change also will unite results from its Office and Office 365 for commercial and consumer customers.\nIn a news release Monday, Microsoft said the new operating segments include \"Productivity and Business Processes,\" which will include Office products as well as Dynamics and Dynamics CRM Online.\nAn \"Intelligent Cloud\" segment will include public, private and hybrid server products and services, such as Windows Server, Azure and Enterprise Services.\nThe third operating segment, called \"More Personal Computing,\" will include results from licensing of the Windows operating system, devices such as mobile phones and Surface tablets, game products including Xbox consoles, and its Bing search business.\nPreviously, the company's cloud businesses were included in Microsoft's commercial segment, which also included Office and Windows business software as well as server products and services. Microsoft's former devices and consumer segment included Office consumer subscribers, Surface tablets and Xbox game consoles and related software.\nDuring July, Microsoft reported a loss of $3.2 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, a departure for a company that typically generates reliable profit. The loss resulted from $8.4 billion in previously announced charges and layoffs in the company's struggling mobile-phone operation, which Microsoft acquired from Nokia Corp.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com\n 28, 2015 17:55 ET (21:55 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T13:35:22.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
