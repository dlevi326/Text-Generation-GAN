For the first time in wearables, the Fitness SDK allows developers using any platform and OS the ability to automatically track movements, exercises and gestures. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150903005898/en/ \nFocusMotion provides developers a database of more than 50 exercises, including bodyweight, dumbbell, barbell and machine movements that will continue to grow over time. Developers can engage with FocusMotion and ask for new movements to be added. The SDK also includes Robo, a powerful machine learning tool, that allows users to record their own movements and have the movement recognized and counted in a matter of seconds. \n“FocusMotion’s core expertise is understanding movements, exercise and gestures, but we know that there’s more to human movement than our current catalog – a gym-goer, a yogi, a golfer, a factory worker,” said Cavan Canavan, co-founder and CEO of FocusMotion. “These users need specially designed solutions, so we wanted to give developers direct access to incredibly powerful signal processing and machine learning tools to help them craft great experiences.” \nThe algorithm has already been vetted with partnered brands, including Samsung , Microsoft, Pebble and Fitocracy, but this is the first time it is available for general use. Fitocracy leveraged these tools to create Fito+Pebble powered by FocusMotion , the first-ever iOS app that allows Pebble smartwatch users to automatically track their exercises and workouts. \nThe FocusMotion SDK works on Android and iOS and is free for up to 10,000 users. It is open on any platform that provides direct access to the raw accelerometer data, such as Android Wear devices, Pebble watches, the Microsoft Band, and others, including the Apple Watch, which will be available later in 2015. \nCanavan added: “There is so much more to human movement than steps and sleep. This is only the beginning of what’s possible. We’re looking forward to seeing what developers create.” \nThe SDK is available at: http://www.focusmotion.io/ . \nAbout FocusMotion \nFounded in 2013, FocusMotion is a Los Angeles-based company using innovative, proprietary technology to track a broad range of human movement. FocusMotion is building the world’s largest database of motion recognition and is leading the way in wearable technology. Its technology uniquely maps human movement via wearables, moving beyond monitoring to understanding what specific exercises, movements, or gestures a user is doing, how many repetitions are completed, and how well those movements are performed. Its SDK is deployable across devices and operating systems, opening up new opportunities for developers and users. \nFor more information, please visit: http://www.focusmotion.io and follow us on Twitter @focus_motion .
