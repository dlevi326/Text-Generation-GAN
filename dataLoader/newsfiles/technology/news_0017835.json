In China the purchasing managers’ indexes are released. And in the US, arguably the most important monthly indicator – the employment or non-farm payrolls data – is issued.\nIn Australia, the week kicks off on Tuesday when ANZ and Roy Morgan releases the weekly consumer confidence rating.\nLast week the weekly consumer confidence reading rose by 8.7 per cent last week – the biggest weekly gain in the 7-year history of the survey. Whether the initial positivity is sustained will depend on the future performance and direction of the new administration.\nBut increased confidence is certainly a positive for the Australian economy, hopefully translating into increased spending, investment and employment.\nOn Wednesday the Australian Bureau of Statistics release data on building approvals while the Reserve Bank releases the Financial Aggregates publication, a report that includes private sector credit or loans outstanding together with money supply indicators.\nThe building approvals data is arguably more important than the private sector credit data, serving as a leading indicator for home and commercial building. The problem is that the data is ‘lumpy’ with approvals down 5.2 per cent over April, up 2 per cent in May, down 5.2 per cent in June, and again up 4.2 per cent in July\nHousing continues to be the main lending driver but the gains in business borrowings over the past couple of months have also been encouraging. Business conditions are healthy and it seems to be translating to a lift in business borrowings, with annual growth at 4.8 per cent. Credit probably lifted 0.5 per cent in August or around 6.2 per cent over the year, which would mark the strongest growth in 6½ years.\nOn Thursday the Performance of Manufacturing index is issued alongside the CoreLogic RP Data Home Value index for September. The falling Australian dollar should help boost manufacturing activity in coming months (at least for domestic fabrication rather than for the export market). But the home price data is likely to garner the most interest.\nBased on daily observations, home prices probably rose by a sedate 0.3-0.4 per cent in September. Sydney property prices may have actually dipped by around 0.3 per cent - a much needed reprieve after the 7.2 per cent gain in the prior three months.\nAlso on Thursday, the ABS releases data on job vacancies. If vacancies rose in the past three months, it will be a further sign that the job market is gradually strengthening.\nOn Friday , retail trade data is released. Sales figures have been more mixed in recent months, having fallen by 0.1 per cent in July after a 0.6 per cent increase in June. Annual spending growth is holding at 4.2 per cent – slightly below the decade average of 4.4 per cent.\nDisappointingly, last month non-food spending fell by 0.1 per cent, the first fall in seven months. The hope would be that the more upbeat confidence readings, warm weather and early mid-season sales should have encouraged some early lift in Spring-related spending.\nOverseas: US jobs data back in the spotlight\nIn the US, the week kicks off on Monday with the release of personal income and spending figures together with the pending home sales index and Dallas Federal Reserve business index. Economists tip a 0.3 per cent lift in spending, funded by a 0.4 per cent lift in income. Pending home sales are expected to lift by 0.4 per cent following the 0.5 per cent lift in July.\nOn Tuesday , the Case Shiller home price index is released in the US together with consumer confidence. Home prices were likely flat in July while consumer confidence is tipped to have eased from 101.5 to 97.0.\nOn Wednesday the ADP national employment index is released together with the Chicago purchasing managers’ survey and the weekly report on mortgage transactions – purchases and refinancing. Economists tip an 185,000 lift in private jobs – a precursor to Friday’s official job report.\nOn Thursday the ISM manufacturing survey is issued alongside auto sales, construction spending and the weekly data on claims for unemployment insurance.\nOn Friday in the US the spotlight shines brightly on the September job report. Economists tip a 200,000 lift in jobs, up from 173,000 in August, while the jobless rate is seen unchanged at 5.1 per cent. This is a potential market-mover in every way. A strong job report would raise the prospect of US rate hikes, boost the US dollar further, and, in turn, put downward pressure on commodity prices.\nAlso on Friday factory orders for August are released alongside the regional New York ISM survey.\nIn China, the official purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing is released on Thursday alongside the services variant. The Caixin purchasing managers’ index is also slated for release on the same day.\nSharemarkets, interest rates, commodities & currencies\nEach month, there is much speculation about the cash rate, and therefore the implication for variable interest rates. But this ignores the fact that many businesses are more focussed on the swap market and thus longer-term fixed rate loans. And the yield curve shows that rates are arguably the lowest businesses have ever seen\nLonger-term bond yields are a useful guide on economic conditions, especially inflation. Clearly a main concern for an investor looking to squirrel money away for a long period is the potential for value to be eroded by inflation.\nOn February 3, 10-year bond yields hit a generational low of 2.27 per cent, before lifting to highs near 3.15 per cent on June 11 and yields are now around 2.66 per cent. Similarly 3-year bond yields are holding at 1.90 per cent, not far off their recent lows of 1.73 on August 24. But whichever way you cut it, financial markets believe low inflation is here to stay.\nFor the record, financial market pricing suggests that there is a 22 per cent chance that the Reserve Bank will cut rates in October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T10:33:08.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
