(AP) â€” More than 1,000 years before Starbucks, caffeine was an international market mover, with ancient civilizations trading holly and cacao-based chocolate beverages between what is now modern-day Mexico, the Southwest, and the South, according to a new study.\nLed by University of New Mexico anthropology professor Patricia Crown , the study says the trade lasted for around 700 years, likely driven by a pre-Hispanic caffeine addiction.\nPrevious studies found traces of cacao-based chocolate beverages in parts of the Southwest but this new study confirms their popularity and adds the holly drink that before the study was not known to be consumed in the Southwest, Crown said.\nHolly, which was used to make a caffeinated tea, was grown in what is now the South.\nResearchers found caffeine on shards from jars, bowls, and pitchers located at archaeological sites throughout present-day New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado, where neither holly nor cacao grows.\n\"The fact we have found traces of caffeine that are 1,000 years old is exciting,\" Crown said. \"As new technology develops, we can discover things about the past like this using objects we already have in museums.\"\nCrown said the caffeine likely was used in rituals and political events. Scientists believe the drinks were largely consumed by the elite or a noble class because the plant for the drinks had to go through an intricate trade route.\n\"For people who had a diet consisting of corn, bean and squash, the drinks provided a kick,\" Crown said.\nIt's unclear if people in the Southwest traveled down to Mexico or if the plants were obtained through village-to-village trade routes.\nThe study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .\n___\nFollow Russell Contreras on Twitter at http://twitter.com/russcontreras.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://twitter.com/russcontreras.", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-10T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:57:14.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
