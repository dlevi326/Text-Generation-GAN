Today, however, long-distance calling barely exists. Not technically, and not culturally.\nArea codes, now linked to cellphones, routinely represent geographic regions in which a person no longer lives. And telephone calls themselves are increasingly conducted via Internet connections— if at all —with voices transmitted over data networks, rather than along telephone lines.\nThese days, long-distance calling comes up as one of those little emblems of the way things were —surreal as looking back at a $730 CD player in 1982, or a $1,500 camcorder in 1990. Wait long enough, and the price you pay for various technological marvels will fall. So it follows that Internet connections and mobile data plans will be far cheaper in the future, just the way long-distance prices evaporated.
