Kruse will report to CGD President Bill Toti, effective immediately. In her new role as CTO, Kruse will be responsible for accelerating and enhancing CGD’s strategic research and development (R&D) portfolio. She will also pursue emerging technologies to drive innovation for both the overall business and the core CGD business areas.\nKruse joined Cubic in March 2014 as vice president of innovation when the company acquired Intific, Inc., an Austin, Texas-based company focused on software and game-based solutions. In this role, Kruse led the business development efforts within CGD as well as the strategic engagement of new clients for Cubic. Kruse first joined Intific in January 2010 as the executive director of the neuroscience division, in which she managed the release of Intific’s premier commercial product, the NeuroBridge software platform.\n“Amy not only has significant experience in developing novel neuroscience-based programs and technologies for the Department of Defense, but also understands the need for being at the forefront of integrated training efforts for military worldwide. She played a key role in transitioning Intific to the Cubic family,” said Bill Toti, president of Cubic Global Defense. “As we make decisions to ensure our competitive edge in R&D, Amy will have a better platform to champion innovation as CTO.”\n“I’m thrilled to take on and develop the role of CTO for Cubic Global Defense and I’m passionate about innovation and pursing emerging technologies to develop what’s next for an already outstanding portfolio of CGD systems and services,” said Amy Kruse, vice president and CTO of Cubic Global Defense. “I look forward to leveraging my experience with game-changing R&D to create growth opportunities for the entire CGD business.”\nPreviously, Kruse served as a government civilian program manager in the Defense Sciences Office at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) from 2005 to 2010, where she managed various programs including efforts in Augmented Cognition, Neurotechnology for Intelligence Analysts, Accelerated Learning, and Cognitive Technology Threat Warning Systems among others. Before DARPA, Kruse served as a technology and program management consultant at Strategic Analysis Inc., in which she provided hands-on technical assistance to nascent neuroscience programs at DARPA, the Office of Naval Research, and the Naval Research labs.\nKruse serves on various defense panels and studies, including those for the National Academies and Defense Science Board.
