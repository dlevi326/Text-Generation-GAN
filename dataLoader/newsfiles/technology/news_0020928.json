It takes lot of effort and countless sleepless nights to organize a smooth event. Hence, it's quite obvious for event planners to take all the initiatives to turn the events into success. An event mobile app, whether it's an iOS event app or an Android mobile app, is considered to be one of the most effective tools to turn events into success. The benefits of a conference mobile app are quite obvious, but in order to reap those benefits, you need to ensure that all your attendees are aware of the app's existence. You can do the same by promoting the app, and when it comes to promote app for events, the different social media channels play an important role. How to use social media?You have undoubtedly devoted a lot of time and effort to create the best app possible and now you must let your attendees know about its existence. You may have thought of sending emails to your target audience, explaining the basic features of the app and how will they benefit using the app. However, this might not be enough to create awareness about the app among your target audience. If you are not sure what to do in order to promote your event mobile app, here are some ideas to consider - Use #Hashtag properly - Precisely, a hashtag is a phrase or word which is prefixed by the # symbol. When you use it in a social media post, it turns that word into a searchable key term that helps bring up all the conversations around that particular hashtag. You can add that hashtag to all the event related posts. This will ensure that your attendees get to see the post when they follow the online conversations related to your event. Remember that hashtags should always be short, yet informative. You should keep it simple and concise so that attendees can comfortably use the tag in their tweets. A hashtag that includes the name of your event will also help in brand association. Start planning well in advance - One of the key aspects of a successful social media promotion is advanced planning. If you want the posts to resonate with your target audience, you have to put in some thought and efforts in those. Before you start building out a plan, make sure you ask yourself questions like what content your audience should see, how often and when you need to push out the messages and which social network will be most apt for your business. Keep the profile and preferences of your target audience in mind while finding the answers to these questions. Apart from doing this you should also use pictures and videos in order to promote the event apps. This may prove to be all the more effective if a large percentage of your audience is active on Instagram or YouTube. Following these steps you will be able to promote a mobile event app using the different social media platforms.
