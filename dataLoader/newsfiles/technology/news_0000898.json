Trifacta customer, PepsiCo, will present on wrangling diverse Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) data to improve the bottom line. Additionally, co-founder, Joe Hellerstein, will present on the need for an open, vendor-neutral metadata solution in the Hadoop ecosystem, while co-founder Jeffrey Heer and co-presenter Jock Mackinlay of Tableau, will discuss the differences of designing data visualizations for different aspects of the analysis process. \nTrifacta also announced that it will be distributing copies of the preview edition of the forthcoming book, \"Data Wrangling: Techniques and Concepts for Agile Analytics,\" by Trifacta's director of data science and solutions engineering, Tye Rattenbury, at booth #737 on the show floor. The book focuses on the fast-growing practice of data wrangling as a critical aspect of the agile analytics processes seen in the diverse array of data-driven organizations. Stop by booth #737 on September 30 between 3:30pm - 4:30pm ET to have your copy signed by co-authors and Trifacta co-founders, Joe Hellerstein, Jeffrey Heer and Sean Kandel. \nTrifacta's speaking sessions at Strata: \nSpeaker: Joe Hellerstein, Trifacta and UC Berkeley Location: 1 E18 / 1 E19 Date: Wednesday, September 30 Time: 11:20am ET \nIn this session, Joe Hellerstein, CSO and co-founder of Trifacta and professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley, will discuss the need for metadata-on-use services in the big data context and the benefits from \"going meta\" in an open way. Hellerstein will explain use cases in big science and enterprise deployments and the common design challenges and opportunities with systems supporting metadata-on-use. \nSpeakers: Doug Stradley, Trifacta; Matthew Derda, PepsiCo Location: 1 E6 / 1 E7 Date: Wednesday, September 30 Time: 4:35pm ET \nPepsiCo CPFR analyst, Matt Derda and Trifacta director of customer success, Doug Stradley, will explore how data wrangling empowers CPG companies to analyze disparate data sources to ultimately improve a company's bottom line. Between suppliers, production facilities, logistics partners and retailers, info is shared in a wide variety of data volumes and formats, making it difficult for CPG organizations to analyze, compare and share data between network members. \nSpeakers: Jeffrey Heer, Trifacta and University of Washington; Jock Mackinlay, Tableau Location: 3D 03 / 10 Date: Thursday, October 1 Time: 11:20am ET \nIn this talk, Jeffrey Heer, CXO and co-founder of Trifacta, and Jock Mackinlay, VP of research and design at Tableau, will walk through the process of designing data visualizations across varying stages of the analysis process. The advancement of data visualization has led to a proliferation of new technologies that enable a wide set of users to effectively analyze and consume data to improve operations and decision making. Heer and Mackinlay will incorporate examples from their experience in research, academia and industry. \nConference Location", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T16:53:51.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
