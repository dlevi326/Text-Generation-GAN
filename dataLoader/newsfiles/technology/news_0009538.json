However, RoadToVr suggests that the upcoming Galaxy S7 could provide some surprises. \n“The latest specification leak for Samsung’s forthcoming Galaxy S7 mobile phone, suggests the device may house a depth-sensing camera, which could be used to provide a form of Gear VR positional tracking.” \nRoadToVr notes that although the current Gear VR is a groundbreaking device, it lacks positional tracking, which is absolutely vital for immersion. Without it, nausea occurs. The Gear VR for the Galaxy S7 could take care of all of that — that is, if it will actually exist. \nAccording to NDTV and other sources, it’s possible that the upcoming Samsung Galaxy O smartphone will be made for use with the first commercial Gear VR. There are also rumors that the new Gear VR will come with its own screen and won’t rely on a smartphone. The first commercial version of the Gear VR is expected to be announced at the end of September. \nEven if a virtual reality device isn’t produced for the Galaxy S7, it still looks like it could be one amazing device. Digital Spy revealed some of the Galaxy S7’s alleged specs . \n“Further Samsung Galaxy S7 rumors point at a pair of handset options – iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus-style. Alongside a 5.1-inch base S7, an oversized 5.7-inch model has been tipped to make an appearance from day one.” \nDigital Spy goes on to note that Samsung will reportedly split the phone’s processing power across two CPU options, Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon 820 chip and an own-brand Exynos M1 offering. Other sites point out that the Galaxy S7 will have 4GB of RAM, which is a lot compared to the 2GB of RAM on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. \nSamsung made a complete overhaul with the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge models. The Galaxy S6 Edge has been especially well-received by critics. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Samsung’s latest Galaxy S6 models have revived the company’s market share. The International Business Times notes that Samsung is kind of desperate since they are offering mobile customers a 30-day trial period with one of their new Galaxy devices. \nThe iPhone 6s and 6s Plus have not been entirely embraced by consumers based on specs alone. Some feel that Apple is behind the times with their latest devices. Because of this, it would be a perfect time for Samsung to show the smartphone industry what they can do with the Galaxy S7. \n[Photo by Jonathan Leibson / Getty Images Entertainment]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T21:40:37.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
