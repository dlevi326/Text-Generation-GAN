For mobile devices, users either just tilt the phone itself or swipe their finger across the screen to adjust the angle.\nVice, Discovery and GoPro have also signed on for the first version. In the case of the “Star Wars” trailer, users can look behind a moving aircraft or see what is happening on the side by dragging their computer mouse over the video on a desktop.\nCheck out how “Star Wars” looks:\nThe new video offer is so far only available for Google Inc.’s Android phones. It is not yet compatible with Apple's operating system iOS, but will be within a few months, Facebook said.\nFacebook is attempting to get its users hooked on virtual reality – technology the company has bet big on. “Over time, we’ve seen that people enjoy more immersive content in their News Feeds”, Maher Saba, engineering director for video at Facebook, wrote in a blog post on Wednesday .\nFacebook moved into virtual reality last year with its $US2 billion acquisition of Oculus VR. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously called virtual reality the next “computing platform” after mobile devices. The virtual reality in newsfeed video is separate from a virtual reality video app that Facebook is also developing .\nThe 360-degree-videos will eventually be available for private users, and as a new advertising feature for companies.\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": ["http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/09/introducing-360-video-on-facebook/", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-looks-to-bring-virtual-reality-to-mobile-devices-1442178190", "http://blogs.wsj.com/sandbox.php?blog_id=100&post_id=43579&sandbox_id=1"], "published": "2015-09-24T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T04:27:12.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
