Based in the South East of England, Digital Pathways have an impressive reputation for delivering world-class data security and compliance management services across multiple market sectors in Europe. Their partnership with the world’s leading provider of enabling security technologies focused entirely around the mobile state, is evidence of their commitment to the absolute security of any sensitive information communicated to and from a mobile device.\nThe five year partnership is strategically focused on delivering Omlis’ unique mobile encryption architecture across key market sectors in the UK, providing convenient, elegant, immensely secure and trusted mobile commerce or data experiences throughout the UK m-commerce ecosystem. Digital Pathways committed to a partnership with Omlis based on the increasing demand for enhanced endpoint focused security solutions. As pioneers of the Correctness by Construction (CbyC) methodology for securing the mobile channel, Omlis and Digital Pathways are now able to offer clients completely secure encryption technologies developed from the ground up, specifically for the mobile space.\nSays Colin Tankard, Managing Director of Digital Pathways, “This is an immensely exciting opportunity for both Digital Pathways and Omlis. Securing data is one of the most important issues of our time and, as the m-commerce market increases exponentially the need for absolute security of data will become a differentiator for the consumer and therefore the performance and success of companies.\n“Together, I believe we can offer m-commerce clients the security solution they need to ensure the trust and loyalty of their customer base.”\nThe UK enjoys a smartphone penetration of 68% and currently boasts the most mature m-commerce market in Europe with a fifth of all online spend in 2014 conducted through the mobile channel, supporting the mobile centricity of this partnership announcement.\nThe increase in consumer digital and mobile engagement as well as the availability of multiple channels through which secure business data can be accessed has further exposed end point security weaknesses in many organizations. As consumer search and spend via the mobile channel continues to rise, Omlis believe that the mobile device will become a highly targeted area for criminal attacks. In 2014 the UK recorded the second highest banking Trojan attacks in the world with 117 data breaches. A recent 2015 data breaches report identified the need for endpoint focused solutions to significantly improve weak and vulnerable security areas.\nOmlis brings to market a high integrity and massively scalable encryption technology that dramatically reduces the exposure of data to breaches and fraudulent attacks. We are excited to partner with Digital Pathways who over the past 20 years, have established their reputation as a world class provider of data protection services,” said John Stuart, Chief Commercial Officer at Omlis\n“This strategic partnership presents an immense opportunity for both companies to deliver a compelling mobile commerce experience secured by the powerful encryption technology that Omlis brings to market.\nOmlis, founded by British entrepreneur Markus Milsted has experienced immense growth in the past 12 months and shows no signs of slowing down. Digital Pathways join an exclusively world class Omlis partner network that include immensely reputable organizations such as IBM, Stratus Technologies and Stratus Technologies Mexico to name only a few. Through this partnership, Omlis and Digital pathways will bring to market a compelling proposition that offers totally unique, convenient and completely secure security technologies for mobile channel services in the UK.\nContact:\nHelmut Okike\nSenior Marketing Executive,\nOmlis,\nThird Floor,\nTyne House,\nNewcastle Upon Tyne,\nNE1 3JD,\n+44 (0) 845 838 1308\nOr\nJoy Moon\nPress Consultant\nDigital Pathways\n+44 (0) 7964 287078", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T08:16:23.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
