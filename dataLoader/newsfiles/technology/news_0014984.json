It became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ajinomoto in 2000, and was re-named ASE in 2006. \"We are delighted to be able to preserve the Gravelines site and secure a future for all employees.\" \nThe site manufactures AminoSweet aspartame, a sweetening ingredient made from the building blocks of protein. It is said to be 200 times sweeter than sugar, and is low on calories. \nThe transaction will be finalised on 1 October, and after the acquisition, ASE will be renamed as HYET Sweet. \nAmid fears of retrenchment at the Gravelines site, HYET has assured that all the employees will be part of the new entity. \nHYET Group CEO Ad Timmermans said: \"We are delighted to be able to preserve the Gravelines site and secure a future for all employees. The purchase of ASE will take our company to an exciting new phase. \n\"HYET Sweet is one of the leading suppliers of sweeteners in Europe, and sells in over 35 countries. With the extensive market experience of HYET Sweet and the expertise in manufacturing of the Gravelines site, we are confident we will strengthen our position in the global sweeteners market.\" \nHeadquartered in Breda, Netherlands, HYET Holdings specialises in the supply of sweeteners such as Aspartame, Sucralose, Acesulfame-K, and Stevia in over 35 countries.
