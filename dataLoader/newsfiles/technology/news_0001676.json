Source: News Corp\nAs the darling of the Australian start-up scene, Atlassian, gears up for an IPO, the company’s director of security, Craig Davies, says that keeping its operations safe and secure has required a flexible approach.\nFor Mr Davies, who is responsible for overseeing and co-ordinating the protection of the company’s 1100 employees in eight locations around the world and its 50,000 customers, the biggest task facing Atlassian’s security team is the variety and scale of the attacks.\nThat has forced the business-software tools builder to move its defences into a more flexible and proactive stance focused upon detecting anomalies in the company’s network.\n“In the past year we’ve made a decision to move very much into an intelligence-based position, so we’ve formed a specific team for security intelligence,” Mr Davies told The Australian. “That’s because the world is evolving so quickly that traditional designs either don’t work any more or they inhibit your ability to collaborate with others.”\nHowever, that approach requires some compromises with older platforms. “It is a tough juggle,” he said.\n“We have some aspects that are very traditional architecture and then we have some other things we do that when I talk to other people in the industry you see the look of sheer terror in their faces. We’re always thinking, ‘we do this, but this is how we’re monitoring for that’.\n“In the case of security intelligence we have different ways of approaching the same problems, we’re looking for network anomalies using services like Splunk. We’re looking for variations where we’re using the sources of intelligence from other places to see if we’re being affected by those.”\nMr Davies sees Google’s Beyond Corp initiative as a pointer for the future of enterprise security, where the increased use of mobile devices and cloud services means enforcing a network perimeter becomes irrelevant.\n“I’m a great believer in the Google Beyond philosophy,” Mr Davies said. “I think we could evolve into that from a technical point of view but like most things the tools are behind so it comes down to our ability to gather the data and analyse it very quickly and then do something with that data.”\nUltimately, Mr Davies sees security as a human problem. “There are great technologies out there but ultimately it comes down to a person having to make a decision.”\nAtlassian’s strong internal culture gives the company an advantage in dealing with security issues, according to Mr Davies. “We have a culture around wanting to do the right thing by the customer and our own values so people are going to call this out and ask ‘is that right?’,” he said.\nOther companies need to understand the risks to effectively manage security, Mr Davies believes.\n“What I suggest for many companies to do, there are so many things you can hear that will give you great fear and you will worry about it too much,” he said. “What we did was we broke it all down and developed a very comprehensive threat model so we do our best to really understand where we think the problems are.”", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/28/1227547/958124-d4182078-6597-11e5-a028-21ee00f9abb4.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-29T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:35:00.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
