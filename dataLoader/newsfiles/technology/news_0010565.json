ESnet's 100G SDN testbed provides a platform to work with close collaborators to test innovative network architectures, develop new paradigms of application-network interaction and create software tools and processes needed to operationally manage this new technology. \nESnet is Department of Energy's (DOE) wide-area network facility providing connectivity to DOE National Labs and operates a 100G backbone networks linking these 40 DOE sites around the U.S. and research centers in Europe, as well as peering with more than 140 other research and education networks. \n\"ESnet is dedicated to providing high-performance networking capabilities for national labs, universities, and other industries, and as part of our mission we are exploring SDN,\" said Inder Monga, CTO of ESnet. \"As innovative SDN deployments occur and evolve in our environment it's important to provide new capabilities like Corsa's metering and QoS to ensure large data transfers occur quickly and without disruption.\" \nIt is important to understand at-scale network performance before deploying the next-generation ESnet, especially the interactions of big science 'elephant' flows with general purpose 'mice' flows, and its orchestration using SDN technologies. ESnet's testbed allows users to test with copies of production traffic while keeping the configuration and setup controlled. With the new QoS features, ESnet's testbed can offer a controlled environment with the added benefit of delivering congestion-free large data transfer capabilities that can be scaled and manipulated as needed by the end-user. \n\"ESnet is a leading network focused on scientific research to transform networking. It is exciting to play a role in improving SDN network architectures globally,\" said Bruce Gregory, CEO of Corsa. \"Delivering the SDN data plane hardware that provides researchers with access to better-managed bandwidth across their network demonstrates our commitment to the progress of performance SDN.\" \nAbout ESnet's Testbed ESnet's 100G SDN testbed provides network researchers with a realistic environment for testing 100G application/middleware experiments. Through a rapidly reconfigurable high-performance network research environment, researchers can accelerate the development and deployment of 100G networking through prototyping, testing, and validation of advanced networking concepts. \nAdditionally, Corsa will be discussing the path of 100G SDN and presenting several use cases at the upcoming Internet2 Tech Exchange on October 6-7 in Cleveland, OH. If attending this year's event don't miss our session on \"Performance SDN.\" Below are details on the session: \n\"Performance SDN\" Tuesday, October 6, 2015, at 3:00 pm ET Room: Cleveland Convention Center, Grand Ballroom A Speaker: Yatish Kumar, Corsa Technology \nSession Abstract: Advanced SDN networks architectures have, at their core, a need for flexible and responsive forwarding behavior. Whether at 100G, 40G, or 10G, different applications need to tweak standard forwarding behaviors for different purposes. In this session, attendees will learn how networks can be incrementally built out using pure play OpenFlow SDN hardware that co-exists with existing architectures, protocols and equipment. \nDesigned for network architects, researchers, operators and others involved in next generation networks, Corsa will outline specific attributes of OpenFlow data planes that are needed, especially at internet scale and delve into real use cases and 100G SDN WAN connectivity. \nAbout Corsa Technology Corsa Technology is a networking hardware company focused on performance Software Defined Networking (SDN). Corsa develops programmable, flexible, Internet-scale data planes that respond in real-time to network orchestration, directing and managing traffic for SDN and NFV deployments from the 100G SDN WAN edge to networks needing full subscriber awareness.
