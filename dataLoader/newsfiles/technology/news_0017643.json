According to new research from engineers at the University of California at Riverside, however, future gadgets might.\nIn a paper published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports on Tuesday, researchers from the university's Bourns College of Engineering describe how they created a new type of high-carbon lithium ion battery component using heat-treated nanoribbons from the skins of portabello mushrooms.\nThey did that in an attempt to replace synthetic graphite as the current industry standard for anodes, or positive terminals. Synthetic graphite has a high manufacturing cost because it requires significant chemical preparation and activation, researcher Mihri Ozkan told UCR Today . Moreover, the preparation process uses a series of acids and bases that are harmful to the environment, so researchers are searching for alternatives that are inexpensive, easy to produce and environmentally friendly.\nCould portabello mushrooms make lithium ion batteries better? Beau Lark/Corbis\nPortabello mushrooms are an ideal candidate to replace synthetic graphite for a multitude of reasons, the researchers say. The mushrooms become just the right kind of porous when heated to about 1,100 degrees Celsius (2,012 degrees Fahrenheit), giving them much more space for liquid and air to pass through. This heat-treatment creates more room for the storage and transfer of energy and, theoretically, better batteries.\nRelated Links Sweet!

So instead of a battery that degrades with each cycle and requires more frequent recharges, mushroom batteries might actually get better with age.\nMushroom lithium ion batteries aren't going to replace traditional batteries anytime soon, as the researchers say the technology needs more optimization before such biological anodes can replace the standard synthetic graphite ones. But the paper shows that batteries made out of organic biological materials that are cheap, environmentally friendly and easy to produce are feasible.\nYou can learn more about the team's research by reading the article in full on the journal Nature Scientific Reports' online site here .
