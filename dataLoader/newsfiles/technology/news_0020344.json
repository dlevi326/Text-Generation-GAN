But its shares have risen 18 percent so far in 2015 as it has recovered. Last month, it raised its full-year profit guidance after a strong third quarter.\n\"It is not a big surprise, as he (Robertson) has been a little disengaged from the business recently,\" independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said. \"Beighton has been well groomed as his successor.\"\nBubb noted, however, that investors would wonder about possible share sales, given Robertson's 8.4 percent stake in the group, worth about 210 million pounds ($321 million)\nRobertson declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\nSUCCESS STORY\nBeighton, 47, joined ASOS in 2009 as chief financial officer, stepping up to the COO role last October. He was widely regarded by analysts as the heir apparent.\n\"We do not anticipate any sudden change in strategic direction,\" said analysts at Liberum, retaining their \"hold\" stance.\n\"ASOS clearly has momentum in most of its key regions. We remain wary of the high rating but the market appears willing to accept this as long as the sales growth ... continues,\" they said.\nUntil last year, when it issued three profit warnings due to currency swings and higher investment needs, ASOS had been the big success story of the British retail scene.\nRobertson and Quentin Griffiths founded the-then As Seen On Screen in 2000 and floated the firm on Londonâ€™s Alternative Investment Market at 20 pence in 2001.\nThe shares hit a high of 71.95 pounds in February 2014, giving it a market capitalization of 6 billion pounds before the first of the profit warnings.\nASOS is now valued at 2.54 billion pounds or more than two-and-a-half times the value of high street stalwart Debenhams.\n(Editing by Kate Holton and Jane Merriman )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:51:55.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
