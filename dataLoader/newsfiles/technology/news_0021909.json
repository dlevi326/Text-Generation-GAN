The letter e at the end is slightly tilted, a trait carried over from the old logo. There’s also a new set of dynamic dots in the four basic colors, which move during transitions or interactive actions.\nThe new brand identity “aims to make Google more accessible and useful to our users,” the company said in a blog post explaining the logo.\n“As you’ll see, we’ve taken the Google logo and branding, which were originally built for a single desktop browser page, and updated them for a world of seamless computing across an endless number of devices and different kinds of inputs (such as tap, type and talk),” the company said.\nThe new logo comes three weeks after the company’s surprise move to create a holding company called Alphabet to pool its many subsidiaries and separate the core web advertising business from newer ventures like driverless cars.\nWith a file from Bloomberg News\n Topics: Technology Google Inc.
