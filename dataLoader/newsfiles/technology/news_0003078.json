Waste management is also cheaper over there,\" says Odd Terje Dovik, the head of the Returkraft incineration centre in the southern Norwegian town of Kristiansand. \n\"The Norwegian centres that could have burned this waste have to in turn import from Britain,\" he adds. \n- 'Wasted waste' - \nThe transportation of the waste has an environmental cost, although the Swedes defend their practice. \n\"There have been a lot of calculations and research on this. And they found out that the transportation itself is almost negligible,\" insists Wiqvist. \n\"It's very little compared to the savings you make when you take waste away from a country -- where it would otherwise have been landfilled -- and you use it as a fuel because when you use it as a fuel, you replace other fuels like coal or natural gas,\" he adds. \nThree tonnes of waste provide the energy equivalent of one tonne of petrol or two tonnes of coal, according to Sweden's waste management association. \nWhile landfill methane emissions -- one of the worst greenhouse gases -- pose a real threat to the climate, Norway insists that the argument does not hold water since it, contrary to Britain for example, banned landfills in 2009. \n\"It has become so advantageous to burn waste in Sweden that the incentive to sort and recycle in Norway is eroding, so much so that the statistics are going in the wrong direction,\" lamented Dovik. \nAccording to official figures, the recycling rate of Norwegian household waste (reuse, composting and biogas production) dropped last year to 37 percent from 44 percent six years earlier. \n\"The environment stands to gain a lot if the Swedish incineration centres went to pick up their waste in Eastern Europe, where the only alternative is landfills, rather than in Norway,\" Dovik says. \nDespite a European Union directive aimed at limiting the volumes of waste sent to landfills by 2025, more than 100 million tonnes are still being dumped every year. \n\"A lot of waste is being wasted in Europe,\" notes Helge Ziolkowski of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:41:21.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
