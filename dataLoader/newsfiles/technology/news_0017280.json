But one thing is for certain: the company is reaching out to entertainment executives for confidential talks. \nAn executive familiar with the outreach to Hollywood told CNNMoney that Apple is assessing whether it should start to bankroll original TV shows and movies. At the same time, it could become a deep-pocketed new buyer of content from Hollywood studios. \nThe source cautioned that it is \"very early days.\" \nApple could just be looking to expand what it's already doing with Apple Music, perhaps by financing music documentaries or concert films. \nBut the Hollywood meetings come at a time of intense competition for audience attention and subscription dollars. \nHastings said Wednesday that Netflix ( NFLX , Tech30 ) is focused on producing \"great shows, and we're executing.\" He cited the example of \"Narcos,\" a new program that explores the history of cocaine. \nNetflix shares have more than doubled this year. But the stock sank more than 2% Monday, after the company announced it had decided to let its distribution deal with Epix expire , which includes popular movies from the studios Lionsgate, MGM and Paramount. A few hours after Netflix's statement, rival streaming video service Hulu said it had inked a deal with Epix. \nNetflix is launching in Japan this week, and Hastings said he is working on plans to be in every country in Asia by next year -- including China and India. \n-- Brian Stelter and Hope King contributed reporting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:27:54.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
