Danielle Pace, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science, is first author on the paper and spearheaded the development of the software that analyzes the MRI scans. Mehdi Moghari, a physicist at Boston Children's Hospital, developed new procedures that increase the precision of MRI scans tenfold, and Andrew Powell, a cardiologist at the hospital, leads the project's clinical work.\nThe work was funded by both Boston Children's Hospital and by Harvard Catalyst, a consortium aimed at rapidly moving scientific innovation into the clinic.\nMRI data consist of a series of cross sections of a three-dimensional object. Like a black-and-white photograph, each cross section has regions of dark and light, and the boundaries between those regions may indicate the edges of anatomical structures. Then again, they may not.\nDetermining the boundaries between distinct objects in an image is one of the central problems in computer vision, known as \"image segmentation.\" But general-purpose image-segmentation algorithms aren't reliable enough to produce the very precise models that surgical planning requires.\nHUMAN FACTORS\nTypically, the way to make an image-segmentation algorithm more precise is to augment it with a generic model of the object. Human hearts, for instance, have chambers and blood vessels that are usually in roughly the same places relative to each other. That anatomical consistency could give a segmentation algorithm a way to weed out improbable conclusions about object boundaries.\nThe problem with that approach is that many of the cardiac patients at Boston Children's Hospital require surgery precisely because the anatomy of their hearts is irregular. Inferences from a generic model could obscure the very features that matter most to the surgeon.\nIn the past, researchers have produced printable models of the heart by manually indicating boundaries in MRI scans. But with the 200 or so cross sections in one of Moghari's high-precision scans, that process can take eight to 10 hours.\n\"They want to bring the kids in for scanning and spend probably a day or two doing planning of how exactly they're going to operate,\" Golland says.\nPace and Golland's solution was to ask a human expert to identify boundaries in a few of the cross sections and allow algorithms to take over from there. Their strongest results came when they asked the expert to segment only a small patch —one-ninth of the total area — of each cross section.\nIn that case, segmenting just 14 patches and letting the algorithm infer the rest yielded 90 percent agreement with expert segmentation of the entire collection of 200 cross sections. Human segmentation of just three patches yielded 80 per cent agreement.\nPROGNOSIS\nCurrently, the algorithm examines patches of unsegmented cross sections and looks for similar features in the nearest segmented cross sections. But Golland believes that its performance might be improved if it also examined patches that ran obliquely across several cross sections. This and other variations on the algorithm are the subject of ongoing research.\nThe clinical study in the fall will involve MRIs from 10 patients who have already received treatment at Boston Children's Hospital. Each of seven surgeons will be given data on all 10 patients — some, probably, more than once. That data will include the raw MRI scans and, on a randomised basis, either a physical model or a computerized 3-D model, based, again at random, on either human segmentations or algorithmic segmentations.\nUsing that data, the surgeons will draw up surgical plans, which will be compared with documentation of the interventions that were performed on each of the patients. The hope is that the study will shed light on whether 3-D-printed physical models can actually improve surgical outcomes.\nLarry Hardesty | MIT News Office", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T22:39:39.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
