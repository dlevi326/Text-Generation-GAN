Have you checked out Plastics Technology ’s upcoming Extrusion 2015 Conference ? If not, do it now (a two-page advertisement on p. 32-33 of this issue will give you the skinny). It’s going to be held Nov. 2-3 in Charlotte, N.C., at the Omni Charlotte Hotel in the downtown section of the city. \nThis two-day event is packed with presentations from more than 60 technical experts, covering a wide range of subject areas. The morning sessions on each day will include presentations on general extrusion topics. During each afternoon there will be three concurrent breakout sessions that hone in on your particular process: film/sheet; pipe/profile/tubing; and compounding. \nIf you extrude sheet or film, these two afternoon sessions will give you the opportunity to learn more about best practices in winding, drying, purging, product changeovers, and troubleshooting nettlesome issues such as gels and black specs, as well as new developments in no-dry systems for PET, and much more. \nIf you extrude pipe, profile or tubing, these two afternoon sessions are an opportunity to learn more about best practices in quick changeovers, drying, downstream systems for sizing, pulling and cutting, and even “direct” extrusion technology that combines compounding with pipe processing. \nAnd if you’re involved in compounding you’ll have access to presentations on running filled compounds, conveying dusty materials like TiO2, new developments in pelletizing, breakthroughs in single-screw compounding, plus troubleshooting tips on venting, dust removal, and a range of other topics. \nBut don’t sleep in, because there is plenty on the agenda each morning for you, too: screw-design basics, troubleshooting conveying systems, new developments in filtration and melt-pump technologies, how to make more efficient use of reclaim, new approaches to foaming, and more. \nIn addition to the technical program, there will be ample opportunity for you to mingle with the more than 40 companies that will be exhibiting at this event. \nClick here to download a copy of the entire program. See a list of all of the companies that are exhibiting here . Learn about pricing details here , and register here . \nIn terms of accommodations, once again it’s best to act quickly. The Omni is the show hotel, but has sold out. As a result, we have negotiated a similar discounted rate with the Aloft Charlotte , which is nearby. \nWe at Plastics Technology believe the Extrusion 2015 Conference is the event of the year for extrusion processors of all kinds. Don’t miss it.
