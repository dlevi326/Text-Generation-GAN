He also noted in his post that Groupon’s returns aren’t doing so well in a number of countries, and that Groupon will be exiting Greece, Turkey, Morocco, Panama, The Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay. Groupon will still be operation in over 30 countries.\nThe daily-deal revolution that Groupon started seems to be winding down. Groupon began in 2008 in Chicago, and it is one of the original Internet “unicorns” —a startup that has received a valuation of $1 billion or more. The company grew an online-coupon juggernaut extremely quickly: By 2010, the company reported $500 million in revenue . That same year, Groupon brushed off a $6 billion buyout offer from Google and in 2011 it was valued at nearly $13 billion .", "external_links": ["http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0830/entrepreneurs-groupon-facebook-twitter-next-web-phenom.html", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/groupon-to-cut-nearly-10-of-workforce-1442927510", "https://www.groupon.com/blog/cities/one-playbook-the-next-chapter-at-groupon", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/04/us-groupon-idUSTRE7A352020111104", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303640104577440580610986086", "http://fortune.com/2015/01/26/lets-stop-laughing-at-groupon/"], "published": "2015-09-22T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T21:27:11.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
