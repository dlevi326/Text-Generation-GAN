It can also be used to thwart users from unlocking iPhones or iPads according to researchers. \n'In addition to stealing Apple accounts to buy apps KeyRaider also has built-in functionality to hold iOS devices for ransom' Palo Alto Networks said. \n'It's important to remember that KeyRaider only impacts jail-broken iOS devices.' \nIn comment provided to AFP Apple stressed that it makes a priority of security and that the App Store is curated to make sure software developers stick to guidelines set by the company. \n'iOS is designed to be reliable and secure from the moment you turn on your device' an Apple official said. \n'This issue only impacts those who not only have jail-broken devices but have also downloaded malware from untrusted sources.' \nApple added that it is helping those affected by KeyRaider to reset iCloud accounts with new passwords.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:11:32.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
