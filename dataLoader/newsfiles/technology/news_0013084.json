And if we know that these individuals are more likely to develop severe flu, that information is actionable and relevant,” he explained.\nAggressive therapy But the utility of these findings aren’t restricted to vaccination and drug development. They may also have an immediate impact in emergency healthcare settings.\nProfessor Kellam explained in an outbreak situation, “when you have lots of people sitting in the waiting room coughing and spluttering and testing positive for the flu, how do you predict which one you need to worry about more than others?”\nThis variant predicts that you are at greater risk of requiring steroids and are more likely to need ventilation quicker.\nGetty No more excuses for man flu\nTherefore rapid genetic testing gives clinicians information, which will enable them to start more aggressive therapy for affected individuals.\nHe said, “It would be interesting to see how clinicians would use that information if they knew before the deterioration of the patient.”\nIt is clear that the benefits of this research could transform the way we fight viruses.\nAnd Professor Kellam has set a precedent for how you might find other target genes in the future.\nThe IFITM3 gene is just the beginning. He said, “there are bound to be more genes out there”.\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-09-08T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:04:20.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
