PAR AGNES V. and KUNG-FU MASTER to open in select cities including LA & NYC September 22, 2015 -- DMN Newswire--2015-9-22--Director Agnes Varda's newly-restored 1988 films JANE B. PAR AGNES V. and KUNG-FU MASTER, both starring iconic singer/actress, Jane Birkin will open at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas in New York City on 10/16 and at the Laemmle Royal theatre in Los Angeles on 11/3 for exclusive 1-week runs. For more information on additional select cities and screen dates, please visit: http://www.cineliciouspics.com/films/The two films are often-overlooked gems in the career of Varda, director of French New Wave classics including CLEO FROM 5 TO 7 and later masterpieces such as VAGABOND and THE GLEANERS & I. Varda was recently awarded an Honorary Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, only the fourth filmmaker (alongside Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood and Bernard Bertolucci) to receive this honor. She personally supervised the new 2k restorations of both JANE B. PAR AGNES V. and KUNG-FU MASTER.British-born actress / singer / fashion icon Jane Birkin first emerged in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 classic BLOWUP, and later collaborated with her partner, French musician / composter Serge Gainsbourg, on a number of now-legendary recordings including the then-scandalous \"Je t'aime ? moi non plus\" in 1969. She went on to star in films by acclaimed directors including Jacques Doillon and Jacques Rivette, and in 2001 was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by her native country for her achievements. Actress Charlotte Gainsbourg (Lars von Trier's NYMPHOMANIAC, ANTICHRIST and MELANCHOLIA) is among her children. Birkin also inspired the famed fashion accessory the Hermes Birkin bag in the mid-1980s. Go to https://vimeo.com/135902729 to watch the brand new trailer, and to find screening dates and locations for JANE B. PAR AGNES V.The new trailer and screening information for KUNG-FU MASTER are available at https://vimeo.com/135903347Never before released in the US, JANE B. PAR AGNES V. paints an expressionistic portrait of its subject, Birkin. \"It's like an imaginary bio-pic,\" says director Agnes Varda. As Varda implies, JANE B. PAR AGNES V. abandons the traditional bio-pic format, favoring instead a freewheeling mix of gorgeous and unexpected fantasy sequences. In each, Jane inhabits a new character, playing a cat & mouse game with Varda as they explore the role of the Muse and the Artist, all the while showcasing the multifaceted nature of Birkin's talent. Varda's signature mix of aesthetic innovation and generosity of emotion results in a surreal and captivating essay on Art, Fame, Love, Children and Staircases. Dennis Bartok, EVP of Cinelicious Pics comments, \"I've known and admired Agnes Varda for a number of years as a filmmaker and a friend ? and I've always been a bit surprised that among her major films, JANE B. PAR AGNES V. and KUNG-FU MASTER are still relatively unknown and overlooked by U.S. audiences. JANE B. is an incredibly bold, innovative and almost unclassifiable blend of documentary and imaginative portraiture capturing the legendary Jane Birkin ? while KUNG-FU MASTER is classic late period French New Wave storytelling, on par with the best of Louis Malle and Francois Truffaut. Paul Korver and I were both thrilled when we found out that not only were the rights available to both films ? but that Agnes herself had recently restored both from the original film and sound elements in France.\"Paul Korver, President of Cinelicious Pics also adds, \"I have to admit my interest in these films is somewhat more base, and stems directly from the spell Birkin cast on me in one of my favorite films of all time? Antonioni's BLOW-UP, in which David Hemmings sealed his 1966 win for ?Luckiest Man On The Planet'. In short, Jane is hawt! ...and for the sake of men everywhere I declare that all of her movies should be restored and re-appreciated at high resolution? we're just proud to be doing our part. Warner Bros? if you're reading this and you're still sitting on the unrestored, original camera negative of BLOW UP I'm calling you out. Send it over for the 4K Cinelicious treatment. You know where to find us and we're buying. And Jane? if you're reading this you know where to find me and I'm buying.\"KUNG-FU MASTER (LE PETIT AMOUR) is a lovely, bittersweet companion to JANE B. PAR AGNES V. The 1988 film has nothing to do with martial arts ? the film's title comes from an arcade video game played obsessively in the film by a teenaged boy, Julien. Birkin delivers one of her finest performances as a lonely 40-year old woman who finds herself shattering taboos by falling in love with the 14-year old Julien ? but is it romance, or a desperate attempt to turn back time in the face of middle age? KUNG-FU MASTER is truly a family affair: Varda's son with the late director Jacques Demy, Mathieu Demy, plays Julien ? and Birkin appears here with her two real-life daughters: Charlotte Gainsbourg (from Lars von Trier's MELANCHOLIA) and Lou Doillon, her child with well-known filmmaker Jacques Doillon. Briefly released in the late 1980s in the U.S. and long unavailable here, KUNG-FU MASTER has been beautifully restored from the original 35mm camera negative.
