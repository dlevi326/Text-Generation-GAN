For full details and registration visit: www.openmpcon.org \nA major challenge for supercomputing today is to demonstrate how advances in HPC technology translate to accelerated progress in key application domains. In order to effectively address the extreme concurrency present in modern supercomputing hardware, one of the most efficient algorithmic approaches has been to adopt OpenMP to facilitate efficient multi-threading approaches. This keynote will describe the deployment of OpenMP-enabled scalable scientific software for extreme scale applications – with focus on Fusion Energy Science as an illustrative application domain. \nComputational advances in magnetic fusion energy research have produced particle-in-cell simulations of turbulent kinetic dynamics for which computer run-time and problem size scale very well with the number of processors on massively parallel many-core supercomputers. For example, the GTC-Princeton code has demonstrated the effective usage of the full power of current leadership class computational platforms worldwide at the petascale to produce efficient nonlinear simulations that have advanced progress in understanding the complex nature of plasma turbulence and confinement in fusion systems. Results have provided great encouragement for being able to include increasingly realistic dynamics in extreme-scale computing campaigns with the goal of enabling predictive simulations characterized by unprecedented physics realism needed to help accelerate progress in delivering clean energy. \nAbout OpenMP ARB The OpenMP ARB has as mission to standardize directive-based multi-language high-level parallelism that is performant, productive and portable. Jointly defined by a group of major computer hardware and software vendors and major parallel computing user facilities, the OpenMP API is a portable, scalable model that gives parallel programmers a simple and flexible interface for developing parallel applications for platforms ranging from embedded systems and accelerator devices to multicore systems and shared-memory systems. The OpenMP ARB owns the OpenMP brand, oversees the OpenMP specification and produces and approves new versions of the specification.
