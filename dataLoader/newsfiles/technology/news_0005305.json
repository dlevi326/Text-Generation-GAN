The conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, two flashpoints in US-Russian ties, could be on the agenda. It has been nearly a year since they last met.\nIn his speech, Putin was expected to emphasise Russia's efforts to resolve the Syrian civil war and combat the Islamic State extremist group, contrasting it with the US-led military campaign in Iraq and Syria.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:06:24.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
