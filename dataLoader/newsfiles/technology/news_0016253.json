Previously it has teamed up with Motorola, now owned by another China manufacturer, Lenovo, and other Asian manufacturers.\nNexus is the brand name Google gives to devices which use unaltered versions of its operating system. Google enters agreements with major manufacturers who create special editions of smartphones in line with Google’s specifications.\nThe US search giant has announced the next version of its Android operating system, Android 6.0, will be named again after a sweet. While K was for KitKat, and L was for Lollipop, the upcoming version of Android, version 6, is M for Marshmallow.\nMarshmallow is not expected to be a huge departure from Lollipop but is expected to give users more control over permissions they grant individual apps to their personal data. Marshmallow also provides better native OS support for fingerprint scanning, a user authentication feature pioneered by Apple but made available on Android already through software developed by Android phone manufacturers such as Samsung.\nHuawei has not released any detail of the 6P ahead of the event, although there are many leaks as to its specifications. Leaks suggest it will have a 5.7-inch high resolution display, the same size as displays for Samsung’s Galaxy S6 edge+ and Note 5 phablet devices. It is also Google’s immediate reply to Apple’s phablet-sized phone, iPhone 6s Plus.\nThe 6P is rumoured to offer more than 500 pixels per inch display resolution, an 8-core Qualcomm processor, a big 13 megapixel back-facing camera, and up to 128 Gigabytes of internal storage.\nThe leaks suggest the 6P will have a large 3450 milliampere hour battery, and a USB Type-C port. It’s a new form of USB port that offers fast data transfer rates as well as fast charging. It was featured early this year when Apple released its new 12-inch MacBook.\nBoth new Nexus phones are designed to run Android 6.0 Marshmallow.\nChris Griffith travelled to San Francisco courtesy of Huawei.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:18:35.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
