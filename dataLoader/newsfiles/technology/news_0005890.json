Bloomberg by Lex Column iPhone users are giving Peace a chance. On Thursday Apple for the first time allowed tools to block adverts on websites viewed on its mobile browser. Peace shot to the top of the paid applications in Apple's App Store. It was so popular that its developer had moral qualms and pulled it Friday, but rivals such as Purify and Crystal are still highly popular downloads.\nPeace's icon looks like a mushroom cloud, which is appropriate: it is part of a war on publishers, which rely on advertising, and Google, which supplies it. The early success does not prove that the new ad blockers will be a long-lasting phenomenon: Apple does not reveal exact app download numbers and the new apps work only on iPhones with the newest operating system.\nBut ad blocking more broadly is gaining momentum. A report last month from PageFair (an anti-ad blocking service) and Adobe found a 41 per cent increase in the tools' use in 12 months to 198m users, representing about 6 per cent of internet use.\nThe best placed to defend themselves are companies such as Facebook and Twitter, which can deliver ads from their own servers via their own apps. Ad blockers have not yet found a way to interfere with these. The second best are those with content so good that they can force viewers to turn off any ad-blocking software.\nThe only way to beat the blockers, though, is to kill demand. Avoiding intrusive ads and slow page load times should be the priority. Conveniently, Apple and Facebook have started partnerships with publishers under which articles load instantly and have millions of potential viewers - inside the Apple or Facebook ecosystems, of course. This does not help Google. Barclays estimates that 2-3 per cent of its revenues could be at risk from Apple's opening the door to Peace and its ilk, but that assumes the mobile web does not wither altogether. Google enjoys supremacy of the web, but it is a shrinking and war-torn kingdom.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T10:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:04:59.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
