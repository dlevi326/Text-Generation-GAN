UK based CellPoint Mobile wants to bring this all together in a more user friendly fashion for road warriors with the rollout of its Travel Bank mWallet. It has developed an airline branded mobile payment solution which it says brings all tasks involved in air travel under one easy to manage interface. It also allows airlines to market their own mobile payment services without the high development costs. \"Today's airlines recognize the importance of facilitating and aiding passenger's journeys in the mobile environment, but carriers are often challenged by costs, time and data integration hurdles of rolling out an airline-branded mobile wallet, as well as the added costs of attracting and acquiring customers into their online universe,\" said CellPoint CEO Kristian Gjerding, The Travel Bank mWallet supports integration with Apple Pay, Google Pay and MasterPass, and a full suite of airline services can be availed within the app including loyalty programs, boarding passes, tickets and expense reporting. Gjerding says it also offers airlines numerous ways to increase revenue. \"They can manage tender and non-tender records, enjoy higher conversion on both ticket sales and ancillary products/services and boost revenues by leveraging additional cross-selling opportunities that emerge when passengers stay within an airline's branded universe for purchases and payments,\" Gjerding said. Latest data shows 97% of air travelers carry a laptop, smartphone or tablet during trips.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T02:05:39.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
