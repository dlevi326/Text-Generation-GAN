New federal food safety rules issued after deadly outbreaks 1 / 1 Back to Gallery gallery_thumbs_close|article-gallery-6496920|article-gallery-6496920|0 gallery_overlay_close|article-gallery-6496920|article-gallery-6496920|0 WASHINGTON — Food manufacturers must be more vigilant about keeping their operations clean under government safety rules released Thursday in the wake of deadly food-borne illness outbreaks linked to ice cream, caramel apples, cantaloupes and peanuts.\nThe rules, once promoted as an Obama administration priority, ran into long delays and came out under a court-ordered deadline after advocacy groups had sued. Even then, the Food and Drug Administration allowed the Aug. 30 deadline to pass without releasing the rules to the public.\nThe rules will require food manufacturers to submit safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Once the rules go into effect this year, companies will have to prepare detailed plans that lay out how they handle the food, process it, clean their facilities and keep food at the right temperatures, among other safety measures.\nThe idea is to put more focus on prevention in a system that for decades has been primarily reactive to outbreaks after they sicken or even kill people. Most farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, and the law would aim to ensure that all do.\nMichael Taylor , the FDA’s deputy commissioner for foods, said the rules will “create a level playing field.” He added: “The food safety problems we face have one thing in common — they are largely preventable.”\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 48 million people — 1 in 6 people in the United States — get sick annually from food-borne diseases. An estimated 3,000 people die.\nFDA investigators have often found dirty equipment in food processing facilities after deadly outbreaks. Agency reports issued after the outbreaks linked to ice cream, caramel apple and peanuts, among others, detailed processing facilities that were badly designed for cleaning or not maintained in sanitary conditions.\nIn the Blue Bell ice cream outbreak this year, FDA inspectors found many violations at a plant, including dirty equipment, inadequate food storage, food held at improper temperatures and employees not washing hands appropriately.\nA 2011 listeria outbreak linked to Colorado cantaloupe killed 30 people. The FDA said old, hard to clean equipment and improper cooling were partly to blame.\nThe outbreak of salmonella linked to a Georgia peanut company in 2009 killed nine and sickened more than 700 people in 43 states. An executive was recently convicted of selling salmonella-tainted food and could face life in prison.\nThe food manufacturing rule is one of seven that the FDA is issuing to improve food safety.\nThe most controversial regulations, due in October, would set standards for farmers growing produce. The rules would require precautions against contamination, making sure workers’ hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. The FDA has worked with the agricultural sector to set reasonable standards, but some in the industry and in Congress say the standards will be burdensome.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/63/8608995/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/63/8608995/3/920x920.jpg", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-11T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T11:35:10.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
