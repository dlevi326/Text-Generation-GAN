Someone’s beaten them to the punch, and by one week, nogal. \nThat someone is Huawei and the device it has used to steal Apple’s thunder is the Mate S, unveiled to the world in Berlin this past Wednesday. \nThere were rumours the Chinese company would do this but I must confess I was sceptical. After all, Apple had achieved a genuine first by incorporating force touch into its smartwatch. \nCould Huawei really be the first to put it into a smartphone without making it seem like a rushed afterthought? I had doubts. \nBoy was I wrong. From the moment Richard Yu, chief of Huawei’s Consumer Business Group, stepped on to the stage to reveal the Mate S with “#incredibletouch” emblazoned on the giant screen behind him, it was clear that touch was going to be at the front, centre and back of the Mate S. \n“Touch is a natural action we take to understand our world,” Yu told global tech journalists who’d come to the German capital for the IFA technology expo. \n“The Huawei Mate S redefines how we incorporate touch technology into our smartphones, breaking through the conventional way of touch screen control and ushering in new era of human-machine interaction.” \nStirring stuff and the Huawei faithful responded with cheers. But talk, as they say, is cheap. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, or in this case, the touching, and I was fortunate enough to worm my way through the scrum of hacks to get my mitts on a Mate for a few precious minutes. \nFirst, a bit about its looks. After all, foodies do say you taste first with your eyes. If that’s true, then the Mate S is a veritable visual banquet. Sporting a 5.5-inch, high definition Amoled screen made of super tough, fourth generation Gorilla Glass and subtly curved to meet the diamond chamfered aluminium body, it’s a truly gorgeous eyeful. \nI was expecting it to be a real handful too, familiar as I was with its predecessor – the groundbreaking but, let’s face it, slab-like Mate 7. I was pleasantly surprised to find the Mate S feels a lot more comfortable and secure in the hand than the 7, thanks in large part to the curved back. \nAnd speaking of the back, that’s a good place to start talking about the Mate S’s touch prowess. That’s where the fingerprint unlocking sensor is placed, a much more sensible spot in my opinion than on the front. \nApart from doing a faultless job of unlocking the device, you can use this sensor to snap a selfie, scroll through your image gallery as well as perform several other navigational gymnastics. \nFlip the phone over to the front and the touchy-feely stuff gets even better. Force touch allows users to press harder on the screen to unlock a lot more features than a mere tap allows. Although it’s called force touch, you really don’t need to use much pressure, as Yu demonstrated by weighing an orange with the Mate S. \nWhen scrolling through your photo gallery, pressing harder on a thumbnail enlarges it. When you’ve got an image open, pressing harder on a spot zooms you into that area of the picture. \nThat’s just a few of the force touch tricks up the Mate S’s sleeve but sadly I’ve run out of space – and that’s before I’ve even got to the impressive 13MP rear camera and 8MP selfie snapper, never mind the much improved battery and processor. \nFortunately, I’ll be getting a test unit soon, so watch this space for a full review. \nSouth Africa will be among the first markets to receive the Mate S so look out for it in stores sometime this month. Prices will be announced nearer its time of arrival, a wise move given the rand’s alarming free fall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:39:08.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
