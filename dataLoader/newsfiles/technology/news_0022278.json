(NASDAQ:MDGS) (TASE:MDGS), a medical device company developing minimally invasive endosurgical tools and a leader in direct visualization technology, today announced that the American Medical Association (AMA) has recently published a new Category I Current Procedural Terminology (CPT®) code, 43210, following its recommendation earlier this year to create a new CPT code for Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, flexible, transoral; with esophagogastric fundoplasty, partial or complete, includes duodenoscopy when performed. Medigus believes this new CPT code will allow for reimbursement for procedures performed with its MUSE™ system, an incisionless treatment option for GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), and will therefore allow physicians and facilities to report to payers procedures performed with the MUSE system. The new code 43210 will take effect January 1 st , 2016. The final reimbursement value to physicians and facilities for procedures under the new code is scheduled to be announced in November. \n\"We thank the AMA for their decision to create this new CPT code to communicate the true clinical value of endoscopic fundoplication procedures for the treatment of persistent GERD, a condition that impacts millions of Americans,\" said Chris Rowland, Chief Executive Officer of Medigus. \"We also recognize the AGA, ACG, ASGE, ASGS and SAGES for their continued leadership advocating for the appropriate coding for the Medigus Ultrasonic Surgical Endostapler system, and helping drive adoption across the medical community.\" \nThe Medigus Ultrasonic Surgical Endostapler, or MUSE system is an incisionless new technology for the treatment of GERD. MUSE is a comprehensive platform that allows a single physician or surgeon to perform fundoplication (stapling of the upper part of the stomach, or fundus, to the lower esophageal sphincter), a procedure that intends to deliver long-term relief from GERD by addressing its most common cause (a dysfunctional lower esophageal sphincter). \nAbout Current Procedural Terminology (CPT®) \nDecided upon by the CPT Editorial Panel, CPT codes are nationally recognized codes that the healthcare community uses to report all treatment options being administered to patients. The purpose of CPT is to provide a uniform language that accurately describes medical, surgical, and diagnostic services, and thereby serves as an effective means for reliable nationwide communication among physicians and other healthcare providers, patients, and third parties. Proposals for new CPT codes undergo rigorous review by numerous specialty societies and others, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), who ultimately make recommendations on reimbursement value. CPT® is registered trademark of the American Medical Association.

The single operator system performs anterior partial fundoplication with standard surgical staples in a less invasive way, compared to other surgical procedures. Its intuitive endosurgical platform consists of a single use flexible surgical endostapler, equipped with a proprietary miniature camera, an ultrasonic sight and a range finder. The endostapler, which resembles an endoscope, is designed to be operated by a single user, includes a handle with controls, an 80cm flexible shaft, a 5cm rigid section holding a cartridge with 5 standard 4.8mm titanium surgical staples, a ratchet controlled one-way articulating section, and a distal tip. The MUSE system is FDA cleared and CE marked, and has also obtained the necessary licenses to market the product in Canada and Israel. \nAbout Medigus \nMedigus is a medical device company specializing in developing minimally invasive endosurgical tools and highly innovative imaging solutions. Medigus is a pioneer developer of a unique proprietary endoscopic device, the MUSE™ system, to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), one of the most common chronic diseases in the western world.
