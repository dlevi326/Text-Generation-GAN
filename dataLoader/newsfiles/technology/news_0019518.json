Edwin Cadena of the Senckenberg Naturmuseum in Germany and James Parham of California State University Fullerton unveiled a new species of a nearly 2 meter-long marine turtle in the latest issue of PaleoBios named Desmatochelys padillai from the Lower Cretaceous (120 million years old) of Colombia that sheds light on the mysterious origins of marine turtles and their confusing relationships to living sea turtles.[caption id=\"attachment_701\" align=\"\" width=\"1500\"] Reconstruction of Desmatocheyls padillai by Jorge Blanco.[/caption]Until the discovery of Desmatochelys padillai by local amateur paleontologist Mary Luz Parra and her brothers Juan and Freddy Parra near Boyac√°, Colombia, the previous oldest fossil sea turtle record holder was Santanacheyls gaffneyi from Brazil. Now, this new species can be used to date the radiation of sea turtles and perhaps help figure out their origins, as it has recently been proposed extinct marine turtles are not closely related to living species like loggerheads and leatherbacks.Fossils of sea turtles are quite rare and also difficult to identify in the fossil record, as the primary marine adaptations of modern sea turtles like enlarged salt glands do not get preserved in the fossil record. Luckily, enough diagnostic morphological evidence from the skulls and front paddles of specimens of D. padillai have been preserved to firmly identify it as a member of a group of marine turtles.[caption id=\"attachment_702\" align=\"\" width=\"1500\"] Desmatocheyls padillai in comparison to an average human (Image Credit: PaleoBios/Edwin Cadena)[/caption] D. padillai was large, about as long as a 6 foot tall human, but this does not make it anywhere close to the largest sea turtle ever. The largest sea turtle that ever lived was Archelon from the Cretaceous of South Dakota, growing to the monstrous size of more than 4 meters long and almost 5 meters wide. The largest living sea turtle is the leatherback, which is roughly the same size as D. padillai would have been. Even at 6 feet long, D. padillai was still a potential meal, as one specimen has a shell with two deep bite marks in it, probably caused by a pliosaur.", "external_links": ["http://escholarship.org/uc/item/147611bv"], "published": "2015-09-09T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T15:17:07.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
