The moves followed improvements on China's main stock market yesterday.\nCMC Markets chief analyst Ric Spooner said the buyers have been firmly in charge over the past 24 hours in a continuation of recent stock market volatility.\n\"More likely the surge in world share markets over the past 24 hours reflects the fact that many see relative value in current prices. This creates a situation where those who have been waiting on the sidelines are quick to follow once buying starts,\" he said.\nBanking stocks, which had been heavily sold off over recent weeks, were back in vogue today, and were leading the market higher.\nMeanwhile, IG market strategist Chris Weston said mining stocks were set to benefit today from strongly positive moves in oil, copper and iron ore futures.\n\"But the price action in the energy space will get a key look in again today,\" he said.\n\"The fact that Oil Search closed at $7.90, and therefore a 3.3 per cent premium to the implied offer from Woodside Petroleum, suggests the market is expecting a fresh bid to emerge at some stage.\"\nLocally, in economic news on Wednesday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed home loan approvals during July missed forecasts, increasing 0.3 per cent during the month.\nMeanwhile, Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of consumer sentiment showed economic pessimists far outweighed optimists.\nOn Tuesday, the Australian sharemarket was driven higher by energy stocks as Woodsideâ€™s takeover bid for Oil Search sparked enthusiasm among investors which more than offset the effect of oil price declines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T05:35:53.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
