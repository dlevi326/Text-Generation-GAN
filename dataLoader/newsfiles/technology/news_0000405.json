According to a news release from UC San Diego, the SDSC Cloud \"provides a highly scalable solution with flexible access methods and enhanced durability, while providing exceptional performance using high-speed 10 gigabit (Gb) connectivity at a fraction of the costs of other service providers.\" \nIn addition to the increasing number of researchers using the SDSC Cloud, the National Data Service (NDS), the National Science Foundation's Big Data Innovation Hub and other data science projects will also use the service. To support these projects, the SDSC has enhanced its service and support. \nNew features of the SDSC Cloud include: A new computing facility to the storage environment, so researchers can access computing resources on-demand without the need to acquire their own hardware; The OpenStack suite of open-source cloud products, including the identity management, software-defined networking and orchestration components to enable unified identity management, integration capabilities with third-party and external authentication services, APIs compatible with other computing platforms and the ability to transfer computing images to and from other cloud-based platforms; OpenStack Sahara for instantiating Hadoop and Spark clusters; A cloud dashboard environment, so researchers can view their storage and computing from a single interface; and An expanded cloud consulting and integration team to help researchers on-board, integrate and use cloud resources. \nFurther information about the SDSC Cloud can be found on the San Diego Supercomputer Center's site .
