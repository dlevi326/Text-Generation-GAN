An affiliate of Los Angeles-based Downtown Properties last week sold Cupertino Gateway, at 10100-10200 N. Tantau Ave., to an affiliate of Prudential Real Estate Advisors. The price for the three-building, 217,294-square-foot asset was $165 million, or $760 per square foot, public records show. Get A.M. business scoops.

A spokesman provided a statement that read, \"The high barrier to entry location in one of the strongest submarkets in the Silicon Valley, combined with the substantial recent renovations and the high-quality tenant, made Cupertino Gateway an ideal investment to generate long-term, stable returns for our investors.\" I wasn't able to confirm a cap rate for the transaction. A source tells me that Prudential bought the property for PRISA I, its open-end fund focused on \"core\" real estate assets, or the best properties. The sale was arranged by the San Jose office of Eastdil Secured. Downtown Properties didn't return a phone call left this week. Downtown Properties is a U.S. affiliate of Hong Kong-based Gaw Capital Partners, which has been active in Hawaii, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. In June, Gaw Capital went into contract on Seattle's Columbia Center, my colleague Marc Stiles reported . The Cupertino Gateway sale certainly illustrates the strong prices investors are willing to pay for assets that are leased long term to high-credit companies. Despite recent volatility, Apple remains a goliath on the corporate stage with a market cap of $617.5 billion as of Sept. 2. Apple continues to spread out as it awaits completion of the 2.8-million-square-foot Apple Campus 2, and it's possible that some of its footprint could retract back into the Spaceship when the campus opens. But Cupertino Gateway's proximity to the the Apple mother ship could give it a warm glow in the eyes of Apple's real estate executives. It's also located next to other Apple-leased buildings, including Peery-Arrillaga's big blue oval at Wolfe Road and I-280 . And of course, down the street from Gateway is Main Street Cupertino, an under-construction mixed-use village where Apple leased two large buildings earlier this year . Cupertino Gateway is technically in both the cities of Cupertino and Santa Clara. \nGet Silicon Valley  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:12:32.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
