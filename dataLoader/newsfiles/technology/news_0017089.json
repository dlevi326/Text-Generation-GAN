A little window pops up saying my database is out of date.\nThe little window comes from Malwarebytes.org. When I try to download the free anti-virus application from Malwarebytes.org, my McAfee program says the Malwarebytes download is very risky.\nI don’t know what to do. Do I download the Malwarebytes? Do I trust that the McAfee has an anti-virus application (although Windows says it doesn’t)? Do I buy an anti-virus program?\nMost Read Stories State Supreme Court: Charter schools are unconstitutional Seahawks' 53-man roster projection: The Final One Seahawks agree to deal with veteran RB Fred Jackson, waive Robert Turbin Seahawks preseason awards: MVPs, surprises, disappointments, toughest roster calls Seahawks Cutdown Day live thread: Seahawks set initial 53-man roster\n— Karen Clay, Seattle\nA: First of all, it’s important to know that anti-virus programs and anti-malware programs aren’t the same thing. Some anti-virus solutions include anti-malware protection, but anti-malware programs, including Malwarebytes’ Antimalware, do not provide anti-virus protection.\nIt’s also important to know that anti-virus and anti-malware programs often trip each other up, identifying each other as potential threats.\nWhat’s not usual is for Windows to fail to detect an anti-virus program if one is installed. I’d recommend uninstalling the McAfee program and then reinstalling it or another anti-virus program. And, yes, Malwarebyte’s Antimalware should work fine alongside your anti-virus program.\nBefore buying anti-virus software, however, check with your Internet service provider. Many ISPs offer free downloads of anti-virus software.\nQ: I was stupid and temporarily misplaced my usual skepticism. I let an incompetent tech outfit “fix” the problems in my desktop Windows 7 Dell PC. They left me with numerous intermittent annoying problems: put the computer in sleep mode and it shuts down; I shut it down, but it doesn’t shut down. Some websites come up in reduced screen; desktop icons are moved to a different location; print function randomly switches to fax.\nI’m told that I can solve the problems by formatting the hard drive, but I have no idea how to do that. My question is: Will these problems go away if I upgrade to Windows 10?\n— Warren Jackson\nA: Possibly, but there’s only one way to tell for sure, and that’s by trying it. Since I recommend upgrading to Windows 10 — after checking to see that your computer, as well as the applications and devices you use with it, are compatible — you’d have little to lose. You can check Microsoft’s Compatibility Center at www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home?Language=en-US .\nIf you still have the problems, then you can consider doing a full installation, reformatting in the process.\nReformatting the drive while doing a fresh installation of Windows from a disc is simple. When the setup program asks if you want to perform a repair, upgrade or fresh installation, it will offer you the chance to reformat after you select the fresh installation option.\nQ: I recently upgraded to Microsoft 10. While I had Windows 7 installed, I enjoyed playing a Hearts card game. I can’t find it now. Is there any way to get it back?\n— Bob Lalande, Tacoma\nA: Microsoft stopped installing that game with Windows 8 (and it also stopped including Solitaire and Minesweeper).\nThe good news, however, is that you can download the games free at the Microsoft Store. For Hearts, go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/hearts-deluxe/9wzdncrfj3wl.\nQuestions for Patrick Marshall may be sent by email to pmarshall@seattletimes.com or pgmarshall@pgmarshall.net , or by mail at Q&A/Technology, The Seattle Times, P.O.
