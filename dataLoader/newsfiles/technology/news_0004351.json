These communications services are reshaping businesses and opening lucrative new multi-million dollar revenue streams for operators worldwide. Similarly, enterprises are aggressively engaging their own customers in new ways through mobile and digital services. Almost every smartphone user today has mobile banking, travel and other \"enterprise-class\" apps on their phone. While these apps are designed around the service they offer, very few seamlessly integrate multi-channel communications to enhance the customer experience. With leadership across messaging and voicemail services, Xura helps operators and enterprises across the globe address the ever-changing market and meet a full spectrum of communications needs both efficiently and profitably. With three business lines --Digital Communications, Monetization and Enterprise -- Xura's portfolio includes its flagship IP messaging solutions, as well as: Cloud Advanced-VAS (SMS, MMS, Visual Voicemail, Messaging Gateways) IP Messaging and RCS (Rich Communication Suite) services Multi-device Mobile Monetization Services Security Solutions, such as Spam & Fraud Prevention and Control Multi-Content Store and Data Analytics Secure Enterprise Application-to-person (A2P) Messaging Two-factor Authentication (2FA) Richer, Real-time Communication Solutions, through rapidly emerging standards such as WebRTC New Ovum Report Underscores Xura ' s Market Vision Underscoring Xura's market vision, industry analyst firm Ovum today issued a new report that evaluates the changing face of consumer communications and the opportunities this presents for operators and enterprises. The research finds that there is an imperative for both the telco and enterprise to evolve their communications platforms. Commenting on the evolution of communications platform providers, Pamela Clark-Dickson , Principal Analyst in Ovum's Consumer Services Practice, said, \"What has emerged is a new breed of vendor: the digital communications service provider which, while competing on some level with a new set of rival companies, is probably most in tune with its telco and enterprise customers across the gamut of digital communications services.\" The report advises that special emphasis is given by the telco and enterprise to: Moving from silos to multi-purpose modular platforms Transitioning their platforms to support IP-based communications Acquiring or developing technologies such as RCS and WebRTC Introducing new delivery models such as network functions virtualization (NFV) and cloud Targeting new markets such as enterprise messaging; and revising their business models For more details on Xura or to receive the Ovum's report, The Digital Communications Service Provider: Delivering Communications without Limits, please contact, corporate.marketing@xura.com About Xura Xura offers a portfolio of digital services solutions that enable global communications across a variety of mobile devices and platforms.
