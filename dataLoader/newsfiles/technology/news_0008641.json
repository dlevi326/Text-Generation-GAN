However, the town's future remains uncertain at best.\nMany young people have found new jobs and started lives in cities far away from the crippled reactors, since leaving more than four years ago.\nNaraha restaurateur Satoru Yamauchi, a father of four who relocated to Tokyo after the meltdown, has expressed his profound attachment to his home but said he cannot see himself restarting his business there.\n\"There is nothing good about going back,\" he told AFP in a recent tearful interview.\nBut authorities say Naraha is now safe after years of decontamination work, in which crews removed topsoil, washed exposed road surfaces and wiped down buildings.\nGovernment data has also shown contamination levels are relatively lower in Naraha, which effectively resides upwind from the site of the nuclear disaster.\nThe end of the evacuation order is \"based on citizens' real voices and plans to accelerate reconstruction,\" mayor Matsumoto said in a statement released in July, adding a \"prolonged evacuee life is not desirable\".", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T00:27:51.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
