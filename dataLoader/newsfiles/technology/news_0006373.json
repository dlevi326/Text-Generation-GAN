The current package for Greece, the third in a row, will cover Greece’s financing needs until 2018. Are private investors willing to lend to Greece against an interest rate that the country can afford to pay over longer periods of time? If so, the country can manage its own financial needs.\nHowever, if there is substantial risk of Greece not meeting these obligations, then lenders will not be willing to extend these loans.\nThis column provides an assessment of the probability that Greece will obtain market access in 2018. Usually, debt sustainability analyses explore a couple of alternative scenarios to a central pathway (e.g. Consiglio and Zenios 2015, IMF 2015, De Grauwe 2015). It is not clear how much weight should be attributed to these alternatives and thus how relevant they are to investors. To calculate the relevance of the alternatives, a measure of the probability of alternative scenarios is necessary.\nI use the historic distribution of primary surplus, risk premiums, and economic growth in the EU to do so and add it to the central pathway in a simulation. The simulation yields a reasonable distribution for future debt ratios and financing needs.\nIf a substantial part of the distribution of debt ratios and financing needs is at high levels, default risk emerges and losses for investors become credible. Theoretically, this is because debt is unsustainable when the distribution is unbound in the long run.\nMore practically, when the state of public finances remains critical in a substantial part of the distribution, economic setbacks can lead to unfavourable interest rate dynamics and potentially trigger default.\nSimulating the Greek debt level and financing needs\nI explore debt sustainability by simulating the Greek debt level and financing needs for 20 years from 2018 onwards. The starting point of the simulation is the situation in 2018 as foreseen in the current package between Greece and the authorities concerned (hereafter, ‘the programme’).\nFrom 2018, the simulation follows the programme apart from three issues. It works with more cautious assumptions for the long term:\nLower expected revenues from privatisation (€500 million per year, as per the IMF (2015: 4) up to and including 2038, instead of €43m in 30 years); A lower primary budget surplus from 2025 onwards (1.75 per cent of GDP, the mean of the various averages over the past 20 years of the EU member states of 0 per cent of GDP and the surplus target of 3.5 per cent of GDP in the programme, see Figure 1 below); and Slightly lower long-term growth (1.5 per cent per year, as per the IMF, instead of 1.75 per cent). With these assumptions, the central pathway is slightly more pessimistic than that of the IMF due to a lower primary surplus, and a lot more optimistic than that of De Grauwe (2015).\nFigure 1 . Long-run primary surplus of the programme substantially more positive than historic data in the EU\nSource: Ameco database\nIn this simulation, I account for uncertainty around the central pathway by imputing the variance of the primary budget surplus, the risk premium on debt vis-à-vis Germany and economic growth. The imputed variance is from macroeconomic time series of EU members over the past 20 years. Figure 2 shows the simulation results.\nFigure 2 . Greek debt decreases along central pathway, but the risk of an increase is substantial\nNote : The dotted lines show the developments of debt and financing burden, under the surplus target of the programme (light blue) and the average historical surplus of the EU (dark blue).\nAlthough the average level of debt decreases and the financing burden stabilises, it is unlikely that Greece will be ready to enter the market in 2018.\nThe risk of a debt crisis with losses for private parties remains substantial when both the debt ratio and financing burden can remain high. Along the central pathway of the simulation, the debt ratio decreases (the orange line in the left-hand figure) from 2018 onwards, and over time will be lower than 120 per cent of GDP (the supporting line). The financing burden along the central pathway (orange line in the right-hand figure) is limited during the first decade, after which it stabilises at around 15 per cent of GDP (the supporting line).\nThe supporting lines have been set at a debt level of 120 per cent of GDP and a financing burden of 15 per cent because these levels serve as anchors in the programmes for Greece. Above these levels, market access becomes difficult. The white and light orange planes indicate probability around the central path, based on historical data on the distribution of primary surplus, risk premium and economic growth.\nUnder these assumptions, there is a 34 per cent probability that the debt level will be higher than 120 per cent after 20 years (in 2038) and a 48 per cent probability that the financing burden will be higher than 15 per cent of GDP between 2028 and 2038.\nThis autumn, the institutions will resume their talks with Greece about debt relief, with the main objective of ensuring that Greece will become financially self-supporting. This would require that the risk of a substantial debt increase under unfavourable circumstances is limited. The surplus on the long run is of crucial importance. Figure 3 below emphasises the related sensitivity of the debt level and financing burden.\nThe figure on the left shows the average financing burden and debt level by 2038, and the figure on the right shows the chances of the financing burden being higher than 15 per cent of GDP and the debt level being higher than 120 per cent. Both chances look better under the programme’s assumptions, and worse under the historical average EU surplus.\nFigure 3 . Average debt level and financing burden (left) and the chance of the debt level being >120% of GDP and the financing burden being >15% by 2038 according to the simulation (right)\nNotes: The background colour indicates the long-term financeability of the Greek debt and runs from blue (safe) via white to red (high risk). For the averages, a limit of 15 per cent of GDP was used for the financing burden and 120 per cent for the debt level.\nThe critical probability of exceedance of these limits was set at 28 per cent. At an average loss from restructuring above this limit, this equals a risk premium that could still be financed by Greec e.\nOptions for lowering the Greek debt burden to European countries\nThere are four often-mentioned options for lowering the current Greek debt burden to European institutions, shown in Figure 4 below. The first is a haircut of 30% on the financial claims on Greece. This substantially lowers the average debt level, the financing burden and the risk of both ending up higher, as shown in Figure 3.\nThe second alternative to reduce the interest rates payable by Greece to the creditor’s cost price. This has the largest impact in the first few years of such loans, when the amount lent is the highest. This also has a positive impact on financeability of the Greek debt, but less so than that of a haircut. The third alternative is to extend the maturity dates of the loans with 40 years.\nThe impact on the debt level materialises later than under interest rate reduction, but over time the results are comparable. The impact on the financing burden is more favourable than under interest rate reduction, and there is less risk of it ending up with substantially higher levels. The fourth alternative is to allow postponement of interest rate payments. This in particular reduces the financing burden in the short to medium run.\nFinally, as an alternative to debt relief, a fifth option exists that does not involve losses to public lenders: the European institutions could provide guarantees on new Greek debt to private lenders. This reduces the risk of the debt level and financing burden becoming higher.\nFigure 4 . Average debt level and financing burden (left) and the chance of the debt level being >120% of GDP and the financing burden being >15% by 2038 according to the simulation (right)\nConcluding remarks\nFrom this analysis, two lessons can be drawn.\nFirst, in the political arena, a haircut may be very different from interest rate reductions and maturity extensions, but from the perspective of investors, they are just alternative ways to achieve comparable debt relief.\nAll options free up fiscal space that can be used to service new debt or to reduce the debt level and all options reduce the risk of ending up with substantially higher debt ratios and financing burdens.\nSecond, with respect to fiscal sustainability, debt relief can be regarded as an alternative for higher surpluses in the long term (Mody 2015).\nTo achieve the same results in terms of financeability in the central pathway simulation as under the programme’s assumptions, a number of measures have to be combined, or a haircut substantially larger than 30 per cent of the debt to European partners must be engaged in.\nIt is with these two insights that policymakers have to confront the question of debt relief. Two questions have to be answered there: How much debt relief is necessary, and what kind of debt relief? The amount of debt relief is a function of the primary surplus that Greece can credibly commit to over the coming decades. Some relief is likely to be necessary.\nEichengreen and Panizza (2014) argue that Greece cannot credibly commit to a 3.5 per cent primary surplus. The second question is the timing and form of debt relief. As argued by Blanchard (2015), there is a balance between keeping the incentive to reform and permanently solving the debt issue.\nPostponing debt relief keeps the pressure to reform high, but does not create room for growth and investments that private investors would like to see, while fast debt relief creates such room, but also reduces the pressure on the need to reform – with possible negative effects for the budgetary policy in the long term.\nThis article was first published in VoxEU .
