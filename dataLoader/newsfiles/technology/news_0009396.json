The news website TechRadar pegged the outage at 22 minutes, and others gave varying estimates. \n\nFacebook had no immediate comment on the outage. \n\nAs with previous such incidents, this one sparked a series of panicked - and mock-panicked - remarks on rival network Twitter. The #facebookdown theme became a global trending item on the messaging platform. \n\n#facebookdown Facebook is down! Users are roaming the streets shoving photos in peopleâ€™s faces and screaming \"DO YOU LIKE THIS?
