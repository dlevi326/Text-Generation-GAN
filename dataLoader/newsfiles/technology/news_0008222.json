Amazon doesn't disclose how many people belong to the Prime program but there are an estimated 35 million to 40 million members.\nAfter six months, Prime members will receive a discounted subscription rate of $3.99 a month. The regular rate is $9.99 a month.\n\"Offering free access to new subscribers through Prime allows us to connect with millions of members nationwide who may not have tried The Post in the past,\" said Steve Hills , president of The Washington Post.\nSeattle-based Amazon has been expanding the services and perks it offers members of its Prime program, grocery delivery, one- and two-hour delivery in some cities, beefed up video streaming and the creation of a Bluetooth speaker called the Echo that syncs with Prime music.\nIts shares rose $4.90 to $527.27 in afternoon trading.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-16T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:47:59.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
