The process will begin with an exclusive project announcement from Digitas Health on the Colaborator.com network. \nThe trial will commence on September 1 st and run through October 1 st . During that period, Digitas Health will post an open offer to all Colaborator.com subscribers to submit a proposal to design and shoot an internal promotional video during an upcoming yearly conference in Silicon Valley. Digitas Health will review the proposals, interview potential candidates and select one team for the shoot by October 1 st . Based on the outcome of the trial run, Digitas Health may begin to utilize Colaborator for its clients. \nThis unique and innovative partnership and trial of the software is based on current industry trends showing that while brands’ budgets for content have held steady, their need for content has increased exponentially. \nMoving forward, any brand will be able to utilize Colaborator.com to fulfill its content marketing needs and any content creator will be able to browse and submit proposals for any current offer. \n“On Colaborator, filmmakers are never asked to go out of pocket to create someone else’s content; instead, they submit proposals and are paid if they’re hired to do a job. Using this method we’ve achieved 90% cost savings, so we know it works,” said Colaborator President Kevin Allen Jackson. \n“We are partnering with Colaborator to explore new ways of creating high quality video content for our clients at scale,” added Brendan Gallagher, Digitas Health EVP of Experience Strategy & Innovation. “The rise of video as a medium has been meteoric. As an agency dedicated to helping brands lead the transformation of healthcare, great content is the currency of storytelling. By working with Colaborator, we hope to pilot new models for generating affordable brand video content for our clients.” View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150831006204/en/ Copyright © Business Wire 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:41:29.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
