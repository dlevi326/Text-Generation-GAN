I encourage you to view this as the starting point, though. Strive to be better in all areas regardless of whether you are below, at or above average. After all, average is where the best of the worst meets the worst of the best. \nBreak Away From the Herd \nWhether it is technology, processes or new service lines, we, as a profession, have the tendency to follow the herd. Large firms look at peers and do what they do. Small firms tend to look at other small firms.I challenge you to look beyond the firms of similar size for additional ideas on how to support your firm’s continued improvement and growth. We’ve found that small firms can learn a great deal from those that are larger and vice versa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T13:16:02.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
