The European Commission said it would assess the complaint, noting it worked closely with national competition authorities like the one in Germany on antitrust matters.\nThe German association said its complaint meant it was now formally a party to ongoing European antitrust proceedings against Amazon.\nIn June, the European Commission opened an investigation into Amazon's e-book business, examining whether clauses in its contracts prevent publishers from offering more favourable deals to competitors.\nEbooks are a fast-growing industry and Amazon, which popularised the product, is Europe's biggest player.\nThe company could be fined up to 10 percent of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching EU rules.\nThe investigation is one of two against Amazon. It is also in the European Commission's crosshairs for deals with Luxembourg which allow it to pay extremely low taxes.\n(Reporting by Emma Thomasson, additional reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels, editing by Louise Heavens)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-09-22T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:10:16.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
