And they will have to do it without De Villiers, who was ruled out of the tournament with a fractured jaw.\nDe Villiers showed glimpses of a return to form after an injury-plagued season. His absence leaves a dearth of experienced centres in the squad, which is particularly problematic from a defensive standpoint. Matfield also has a hamstring strain and might miss the Scotland Test. At least in Lood de Jager, there is more than adequate cover in the short term.\n\"This has done a lot for our self-confidence because the loss to Japan really hurt and it still hurts,\" flyhalf Handré Pollard said. Pollard played inside centre for the final 15 minutes with both Jesse Kriel and Damian de Allende injured.\n\"We are going to take the pain of that defeat against Japan to the next game and all the way through the entire World Cup. We have to work harder and keep improving because one win is not enough.\n\"As a whole squad, we know we are not where we want to be and we will have to keep improving.\n\"Playing in Newcastle will be like an away game because it’s so close to Scotland. But we saw against Samoa, if we stick to our South African style of play, we perform well.\"\nNo8 Duane Vermeulen, who came through the full 80 minutes against Samoa after three months out of the game following neck surgery, was not carried away with the result against Samoa.\n\"This is just our first step forward at this World Cup and something we can build from here,\" Vermeulen said. \"But we have to put it behind us and focus on Scotland. We have improved, but we still have a lot of work to do. We won’t be celebrating too long.\n\"Against Japan, we showed some weak points and we worked hard on that and defensively, we did a lot better. Now we have to keep improving,\" the No 8 said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:23:21.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
