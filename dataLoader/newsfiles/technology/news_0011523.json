The users can chat with Chrome or Opera users because Hello is WebRTC powered, but it is not clear if instant messaging is also supported on those browsers.\nThe latest version of the browser also allows the users to set a profile on the desktop browser.\nFor the Android version, the users can now use different search engine at once from the search panel and swipe to close tabs. It also has improved bookmark detection so that the users can avoid duplicates. Firefox for Android has now fixed the support for playing MP3 files.\nIn addition, both Android and the desktop version have numerous bug fixes.\nFirefox 41 is available for download now and all existing users should be able to upgrade to it automatically. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:43:25.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
