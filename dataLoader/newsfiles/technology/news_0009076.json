They worked at KPMG - one of the 'Big 4', in New York City. However, even dreams have an expiry date.\n\nAll three of them were looking out to do something they 'really' loved, and to do it on their own. In 2011, Chaitanya, who had married Lakshmi by then, left his role as a director at KPMG and returned to Bengaluru.\n\nIn 2013, all three started SmartOn, an online platform which provided professional courses. \"We realized people were looking for job-oriented courses rather than professional ones. But it was too ahead of its time,\" says Chaitanya.\n\nSmartOn ran only for 18 months. What would have discouraged many, gave Chaitanya greater courage. \"Failure really makes you mature and teaches you to not get bogged down. We started evaluating what we could do. We wanted to solve something which had a pain point for the customers.\"\n\nThey soon started connecting some dots. In the US, they had takeaway from Starbucks coffee. It was difficult here. \"In Bengaluru we had a full time guy who used to bring coffee for us around 4-5 times every day and we realized that office coffee across the board sucks.\" \n\nThey ran a Facebook campaign that said: \"We know office coffee sucks. If we deliver a better one to yours, will you take a sip?\" It was a success. They received around 5,000 affirmatives, and they started DropKaffe in April 2015. They were later joined by Amar Yashlaha who had previously invested in SmartOn. \n\nThey received around 600 orders in the first month and they did all the deliveries themselves. Their Korman gala office was part-kitchen and part-office. During the initial days, Chaitanya recalls that it was difficult to attract talent and make them come on-board for a company which was not even funded. \"We found that once you convince yourselves to commit, it was easier to convince the others.\" His father too was sceptical. \"He said, first you quit your job, shut down your first company, and now you are selling coffee? But when he accompanied me to my work, he was convinced.\" \n\nDropkaffe team of 50 brews the coffee and changes he menu every day, providing varieties of hot and cold coffee. The hot coffee is brought to a customer's of ice in a flask and poured in front of the customers. They also tie up with third-party delivery startups, like Road Runnr, when the demand gets high. \n\n\"Customers want instant gratification, and want to try something new every day. We are building a brand that customers can trust.\" With plans to soon launch in Chennai and Hyderabad, DropKaffe wants to own the South markets before venturing into the North. \n\nThey recently raised $300,000 from angel investors in India, Singapore, and US.\"VC funding keeps you honest.\" Looking back at their decision to leave New York city life behind, Chaitanya says: \"I can't justify it rationally. We were making sick loads of money and we left all that. I think in the end, it all depends on the satisfaction that you are getting from what you do.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:19:47.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
