You can then start typing messages and hit enter to send them to everyone else participating in the conversation. \nBinary XPCOM components are not supported anymore except as part of the application \nIf you are using a Firefox add-on that relies on binary XPCOPM components, you will notice that it won't work anymore once you update the web browser to version 41. \nAccording to Mozilla's Benjamin Smedberg , the move was necessary as these represented \"signigicant compatibility and stability risks to Firefox users\". \nMemory overhead of AdBlock Plus has been greatly reduced \nIf you have AdBlock Plus installed in Firefox you may have noticed that it may cause spikes in memory usage under certain conditions. \nThe main issue was that AdBlock Plus injected its stylesheet (of blocked resources) into every iFrame loaded on a page. While that did not matter on sites that used none or only a few, it resulted in huge memory spikes on sites that used many. \nFirefox memory usage jumped more than a Gigabyte in extreme cases on sites that make excessive use of iFrames. \nWe have talked about this before and suggest you check out the initial post on the matter for details. \nThe fix, which we have reviewed here , improves memory usage by enabling the sharing of CSS data. AdBlock Plus users should notice memory improvements across the board thanks to the changes that Mozilla made. \nWebRTC now requires perfect forward secrecy \nPerfect Forward Secrecy limits the damage that can be done with compromised keys. \nThis means that the compromise of one [session] cannot lead to the compromise of others, and also that there is not a single secret value which can lead to the compromise of multiple [sessions] \nHead over to Mozilla Hacks for additional information on the implementation. \nImproved image decoding with performance up to twice as fast on some devices especially while scrolling \nThe release notes don't link to a bug listing on Bugzilla or mention details. It is unclear if this is related to support for Async Pan Zoom in Firefox or something else. \nWe have reviewed the APZ integration previously and found it to improve scrolling and zooming in Firefox significantly. \nOther changes Ability to set a profile picture for your Firefox Account SVG images can be used as favicons. [ Bug 366324 ] WARP was disabled on Windows 7 after memory bug on YouTube, Deezer and probably other sites was reported on Bugzilla. [ Bug 1188831 ] Smoother and more reliable CSS animations via asynchronous animations [ Bug 706179 ] The media.autoplay.enabled preference now also apply to untrusted HTMLMediaElement.play() invocations too, that is calls from non-users activated scripts. [ Bug 659285 ] Developer Changes You can now take screenshots of selected nodes using Firefox's built-in Web Developer Tools. This is done by right-clicking on the node in the developer area (which you open with F12). The Web Developer Tools rules view has additional copy operations added to it. A right-click on image declarations in the developer tools allows you to copy the image as a data url. Implemented Cache API for querying named caches that are accessible Window, Worker, and ServiceWorker The command \"security csp\" has been added to the Developer Toolbar. It displays information related to Content Security Policy of the current domain (Open with Shift-F2). The Firefox Developer Toolbar is might useful for non-Developer related actions as well . CSS Font Loading API enabled by default, see W3.org for additional details.
