In particular, economic issues loom large,\" the center said. \nThe poll was released as President Barack Obama prepares to receive Chinese President Xi Jinping for his first state visit to the United States later this month. The date has not yet been announced. \nThe number of Americans who view the debt, jobs and deficit challenges as either \"somewhat serious\" or \"very serious\" is extremely high, the research center said. \nTo wit: 89 percent for the American debt held by China -- Pew put this figure at $1.27 trillion -- 89 percent again for the loss of US jobs to China, and 86 percent for the American trade deficit with China. \nStill, the numbers expressing \"very serious\" concern are down by as many as 11 points from the last such Pew poll held three years ago. \nIn the new one, 86 percent of those asked said cyberattacks from China are a somewhat or very serious concern. \nThe telephone survey was conducted in April and early May -- before it emerged in June that millions of US federal workers were hit by cyberattacks that have been widely blamed on China. \nOn other non-economic issues, such as China's human rights record, its impact on the global environment and its growing military might, the somewhat or very serious camps also combine to 85, 85 and 82 percent, the poll found. \nThe last of eight issues about which people were questioned was tension between China and Taiwan. The breakdown: 21 percent see it as a serious problem, and 45 as somewhat. \nChina considers Taiwan to be part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary. \nAs America gears up for its presidential election next year, Republican supporters fret more over China than Democrats, the Pew survey found. \nFor instance, 77 percent of Republicans say the mountain of US debt held by Beijing is a very serious problem, compared to 60 percent of Democrats. \nOn six of the eight issues in the poll, Republicans are a lot more worried than Democrats. \nOne exception is human rights, where there is no significant difference between the two parties. And China's impact on the environment triggers more jitters among Democrats, Pew said. \nThe survey was conducted from April 13 to May 3 among 1,003 Americans. The margin of error was 3.6 percentage points. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T16:09:53.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
