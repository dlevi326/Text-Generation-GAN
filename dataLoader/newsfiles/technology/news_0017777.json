(NYSE: DLB) today announced the availability of Dolby Vision™ enabled system-on-a-chip (SoC) technologies for digital TVs from Realtek Semiconductor Corp. Realtek has also committed to delivering Dolby Vision enabled SoCs for set-top-box solutions in the near future. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150903005805/en/ \nDolby Vision augments the fidelity of Ultra HD and HD video signals for over-the-top (OTT) online streaming, video on demand (VOD), broadcast, Ultra HD Blu-ray™, and gaming applications. Today’s state-of-the-art cameras already capture more visual information than current TVs can display, but with Dolby Vision, creative teams can finally have confidence that their content will be reproduced faithfully on Dolby Vision capable televisions. \nThe Dolby Vision VS10 universal high-dynamic-range (HDR) playback solution supports both dual-layer and single-layer Dolby Vision streams and other HDR profiles based on the SMPTE ST 2084 standard. This enables displays to take full advantage of a combination of peak brightness, local contrast, and wider color gamut; the end result is a dramatically enhanced viewing experience in the living room. \n“We are thrilled to further strengthen Realtek’s 4K Ultra HD offerings and competiveness by integrating Dolby Vision VS10 technology into our latest SoC solutions,” said Yee-Wei Huang, Vice President and Spokesman, Realtek. “With Dolby Vision, we enable our customers to elevate the consumer home entertainment experience by delivering a new level of brightness, realism, and incredible color to TV screens.” \n“Realtek is one of the first IC companies to deliver Dolby Vision enabled SoCs to device OEMS, and we look forward to expanding the Dolby Vision footprint in multiple geographies as a result of this collaboration,” said Giles Baker, Senior Vice President, Broadcast Business Group, Dolby Laboratories. “Dolby is committed to transforming the living room experience with Dolby Vision, and partners such as Realtek enable us to achieve that goal.” \nAbout Dolby Vision \nDolby Vision is a transformative technology for imaging that delivers a dramatic visual experience—astonishing brightness, incomparable contrast, and captivating color—that brings entertainment to life via OTT online streaming, broadcast, and gaming applications. \nEven though most content is captured and rendered using technology that produces the colors and brightness of real life, much of that richness is lost by the time it gets to your living room. That’s because current color-grading standards are based on the limitations of current television technologies and require that the content be altered to match their display performance—dramatically reducing the range of colors, brightness, and contrast. \nDolby Vision changes that, giving creative teams the freedom to use the full gamut of colors, peak highlights, brightness, and contrast, with the confidence that those will be reproduced faithfully on televisions that feature Dolby Vision technology. \nAs a universal HDR playback solution, Dolby Vision VS10 offers unique value by combining the ability to play back Dolby Vision content as well as other HDR formats based on the SMPTE ST 2084 standard through one integrated playback solution. This enables a high-quality HDR experience on products ranging from entry level to high end by leveraging the capabilities of the respective hardware as much as possible. \nAbout Dolby Laboratories \nDolby Laboratories (NYSE: DLB) creates audio, video, and voice technologies that transform entertainment and communications in mobile devices, at the cinema, at home, and at work.
