As one of Tumblr’s and Zillow’s first hires focused on growing revenue, he was a part of both companies’ successful exits.\n“I enjoy and have been really lucky to be a part of companies that strive to bring transparency to different markets,” said Scott. “Zillow provided transparency to real estate, which empowered consumers to make better decisions around homes. Tumblr provided transparency to the new market of content ‘creators,’ which gave artists the ability to make money for their work. FiscalNote is bringing greater transparency to government information, which empowers businesses to work effectively and more efficiently.”\nScott will lead the company’s business development initiatives including identifying strategic, long-term partnerships, continuing to scale the company’s sales infrastructure, and building closer relationships with customers and partners.\n“My role will be to guide our business development team in how we service the market, which is a massive opportunity,” said Scott. “This includes attracting and developing the best talent, obsessing about our customers and making sure we constantly innovate to stay in front of our customers’ needs.”\nThe company’s first product, Prophecy, tracks, monitors and forecasts the outcome of state and federal legislation with more than 94 percent accuracy. The product’s Legislator Analytics capabilities provide extensive insights regarding the effectiveness of individual legislators as well as likelihood of support on individual pieces of legislation.\nFiscalNote recently released its second product, Sonar, which searches, tracks and analyzes regulatory activity, while providing sentiment analysis across comments from stakeholders. The company aims to better connect organizations with government data, providing data-driven analysis to help policy and legal professionals gain valuable, actionable insights.\n“We are hearing amazing stories from customers about finding funding for their nonprofits, proactively working with officials on topics that affect their business and also how they are advancing best practices with innovation using our platform,” said Scott. “I joined FiscalNote for the opportunity to work with a group of very talented individuals who are attacking a very large problem. The market opportunity ahead for FiscalNote is immense.”\n“We are thrilled to have Justin join our team, given his extensive experience helping young technology companies significantly drive revenue growth,” said Tim Hwang, CEO and co-founder of FiscalNote. “As we continue to grow, Justin will be an integral part of our leadership team, creating an elite sales force that will help us better serve our customers, prospects and the entire legal market.”\nThe company announced $10 million of Series B funding, led by Renren, in February 2015, just two months after securing $7 million in Series A funding.\nAbout FiscalNote\nFiscalNote provides a real-time legal analytics platform that is revolutionizing the way policy and legal professionals work.
