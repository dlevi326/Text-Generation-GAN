The all-inclusive, turnkey, full service program provides a complete odor management solution at a low cost. As an alternative to a capital investment, the Monthly Fee Odor Control Service Program allows municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants to contract Ecosorb® Odor Control systems manufactured by OMI Industries. These systems are environmentally friendly and eliminate odors without the use of harsh masking agents.\n“Municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants sometimes generate unpleasant odors in varying degrees throughout the treatment process or collection system,” said Brian McLaughlin, Director of Industrial Sales and Marketing, OMI Industries. “This new program will allow the plants to more cost-effectively implement a comprehensive system that can safely and effectively fight any odor challenge.”\nThe contract terms range from 2-3 years, with great cost incentives on options to renew enrollment. The overall monthly cost is determined by equipment choice and estimated product consumption. After installation, the customized monthly service program will cover the costs of equipment, product consumption, shipping, maintenance and repairs and service.\nIn addition, at WEFTEC 2015, Dr. Laura Haupert, Director of Research and Development for OMI Industries; and Ron Mulford, Equipment Division Manager for OMI Industries, will provide a presentation on the vapor phase technology and how this works to control odors in the OMI booth, #2402 on September 28th at 2pm CT and September 29th at 10am CT.\nThe vapor phase systems were designed by OMI as a simple, effective and economical delivery system specifically developed to disperse Ecosorb water based odor-eliminating neutralizers. The unit produces sub-micron droplets of Ecosorb products, which is accomplished by a centrifugal pressure blower that intakes atmospheric air.\nOMI Industries is exhibiting its full-line of eco-friendly odor management solutions at WEFTEC 2015 in booth #2402.\nAbout OMI Industries\nOMI Industries, a worldwide leader in providing natural odor abatement solutions, is a privately-held corporation headquartered in Long Grove, Ill.
