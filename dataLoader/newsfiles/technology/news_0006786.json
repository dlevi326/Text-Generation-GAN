It doesn’t make software or hardware but its technology is involved in almost everything we do on the internet.\nIf you have ever used a search engine, social media or Apple’s Siri you are benefiting from the work Appen does.\nChief executive Mark Brayan says Appen is in the business of creating the intelligence framework that educates the algorithms for machine learning.\n“We provide that data that helps machines learn,” he said.\n“We may not create software or hardware but we are at the cutting edge because our customers, the largest technology companies in the world, need our data to stay ahead of their competitors.”\nThere’s a lot of human input that underpins machine learning and systems that use natural language functions need to be trained. Siri recognises words because it’s told what the words are, a search engine only identifies combinations of words because it’s told what it needs to look for.\n“They learn over time but it starts with humans, who provide the guidance,” Mr Brayan said.\nAppen’s team of linguists and analysts provide a lot of this guidance and helping machines learning has so far been a fruitful endeavour for Appen, which listed at the start of the year. The company recently posted a 28 per cent jump in net profit after tax to $2.68 million for the first half, with revenue up 33 per cent at $35.8m. It has also upgraded its full-year guidance for 2014-15, with annual revenue expected to come in between $68m and $76m.\nWith almost all of the revenue flowing through in US dollars, Appen’s confidence isn’t entirely misplaced and Mr Brayan said the evolving nature of the web meant its niche skill set was always in demand. “The web is constantly changing and what was current three months ago is no longer relevant and needs to be updated. What that means is that we have a constant feed of work,” he said.\nWith the likes of Siri, Cortana and now Facebook’s M ushering in the age where voice interface becomes more prominent, Mr Brayan said the importance of natural language in communication was going to be magnified.\nAnother important feature, according to Mr Brayan, is that the composition of the content on the web is likely to undergo a shift.\n“More than half of the content on the internet is in English, but only 29 per cent of users are English speakers, so the users are more representative of the global distribution of language,” he said.\n“Sooner or later there’s going to be more content in other languages to support that user base and that’s great for a company like ours.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:56:07.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
