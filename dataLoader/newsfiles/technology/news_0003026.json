We design and produce self-propelled marking machines and trucks. \nWe also offer related equipment such as thermoplastic preheaters, trailer solutions, jet driers, and erasers for removing lines. Line marking machines and truck solutions for road projects \nWhen it comes to line marking contractors, machinery performance and operator skills are essential for the efficient management of road marking projects. \nFrom extreme weather variations to difficult roads and short deadlines, contractors are facing challenges that call for robust and versatile machines. \nThe right equipment makes the marking of roads straightforward and helps operators get the most from available working hours. Therefore, reliable and well-designed road-marking machines are key to a smooth job. Customisable line marking machines for cold paint, hot thermoplastic, or two-component cold plastic application \nBased on decades of experience within the line marking industry, we have developed different modules to suit individual requirements. Each model offers a variety of operator-friendly features to meet varying capacity and application needs. \nAll machines are equipped with a slidable drive and operator section that allows for work to be done on both left and right sides. In addition, all Borum machines can be customised to work with cold paint, hot thermoplastic, or two-component cold plastic. Straightforward city / urban marking of roads \nThe design of the Borum City is compact and allows it to maneuver smoothly in city centres. Borum City machines also include hand-guided models, designed for assignments such as parking bays and zebra crossings. High-capacity road marking machines for highways \nThe Borum Master 3000 is designed with flat highway marking in mind. However, this model is also a good solution for major road-making jobs in urban and less hilly areas. Compared with the Borum City, this machine has a higher capacity and features the possibility of higher application speeds. Line marking machines for motorways and large-scale works \nThe Borum Motorway machine is designed for dealing with large-scale and major line marking projects, for motorways, highways, or major work in urban areas. \nThe larger material capacity means fewer stops for refilling. The double-speed wheel motor allows a driving angle of 30%, making it an excellent choice for hilly areas. Robust trucks with large paint tanks and fast application speeds \nBorum truck solutions are ideal for countries or regions with great distances. Having a robust design, these machines can be equipped with a variety of features, such as tanks containing up to 3,000l of paint, and with application speeds of up to 30km/h. \nIn addition, the trucks can be designed to work with both cold paint and thermoplastic, or to mark both sides at the same time. Safe transportation of marking machines using heavy-duty trailers \nBorum trailers are tough, built on a chassis of heavy-duty, welded steel, which enables safe transportation of the Borum road marking machine, even on poorly maintained roads. Trailers featuring thermoplastic preheaters for hardwork \nWe also offer a small size Borum machine trailer with a thermoplastic preheater for handwork. Drying of roads for marking in wet conditions \nThe Zirocco jet dryer works on a micro gas turbine and has an output of 100mÂ² of airflow per minute. \nThe Zirocco jet dryer is extremely effective for safely drying roads, removing black ice from tunnels and bridges, and can also be used for removing chewing gum from public spaces. Line marking control systems \nA good line marker has to execute a precise application, while keeping control of all marking processes. \nThis is why we have equipped all Borum machines with the LineMaster computer. This computer gives the operator control of road marking tasks, such as pre-marking, line programming, line application, and reporting. \nHaving a high-resolution 8in interactive screen, parameter adjustments can be easily done during marking. Furthermore, this makes data easy to read on the screen in either bright sunlight or in the dark. \nWith the LineMaster Computer you can control up to six paint or spray guns, six bead guns, and equipment with up to 24 shutters from one unit. It is possible to store up to 99 different line types, and to arrange these in up to 30 different marking programmes. Improved retro reflectivity and road safety of thermoplastic road markings \nProfiled markings have been present in Europe for more than ten years. They are slowly becoming the norm in various locations due to advantages such as improved visibility at night and during wet conditions. \nBorum has developed unique application equipment for such profiled markings, the Borum Extruder. \nThe Borum Extruder features: Effective hot-oil heating of all significant parts of the extruder to make the line look good on the road Continuous circulation of the thermoplastic material ensuring homogeneous viscosity A built-in pressure regulating system ensures that line width and thickness do not change Contact Details", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T20:58:56.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
