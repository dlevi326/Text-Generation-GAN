This news follows the Port of Rotterdam’s recent plans to implement an online port connector at its port in a bid to attract more potential international clients into its port community. \nRotterdam Port Authority will now carry out a feasibility study for the new port together with Pelindo I. A project organisation will be created for this purpose that will include a number of the Port Authority’s employees locally and based in Rotterdam.\nDepending on the outcome of this feasibility study, the Port Authority will assess whether it will enter into a joint venture with Pelindo I for the further realisation of the port.\nAllard Castelein, CEO of the Port of Rotterdam Authority, said: ‘We want to share our knowledge in the construction, development and management of Kuala Tanjung. We are confident that the Port Authority and Pelindo I will form a strong team that will serve the country and provide for a better future.’\nMr Castelein will take part in a Rotterdam delegation that will travel through Indonesia under the leadership of Ahmed Aboutaleb. The Mayor of Rotterdam was present during the signing and indicated that he hoped that the new port will create many new jobs in Sumatra, saying: “This is a good opportunity to develop new activities and to attract investors.”\nKuala Tanjung is a newly-to-be developed port near the city of Medan located in the Strait of Malacca, one of the most important shipping routes in the world.\nJoko Widodo (‘Jokowi’), who became Indonesia’s president in 2014, has made strengthening the maritime sector a spearhead of his policy in order to promote economic growth (6-7% per year).\n\n(Source: Port of Rotterdam)\nFor all the latst on the Port of Rotterdam, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:11:32.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
