In addition to the short-term “Prepaid SIM for Japan” offered by NTT Com, the machine will sell related items such as smartphones, mobile routers and accessories. \nA multilingual touch panel will provide guidance in English and Chinese. Payment via credit card will eliminate the need for arriving customers to prepare Japanese yen cash. After purchasing a card, the user can register required personal information by simply scanning their passport to immediately begin surfing the internet or checking emails. \nNTT Com is already operating SIM card vending machines at Narita International Airport and Kansai International Airport for the convenience of foreign visitors entering Japan through these major international gateways. Chubu International Airport is expected to receive some four million foreign visitors annually by 2019. \nNTT Com, Japan’s largest mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), intends to add additional sites for SIM card sales, including at major electronics stores and travel agencies as well as other airports. The company will also expand its lineup of related mobile data communications products in response to customer feedback.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T12:22:50.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
