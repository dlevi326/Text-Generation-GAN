Infinion’s UC features include a powerful software-based media server, instant messaging, presence, automated attendant, and point-to-point video.\n(PRWEB) September 22, 2015\nREDCOM® Laboratories, Inc. announced today the release of Infinion, a Unified Communications (UC) platform combining flexible call and message routing capability with an integrated media server.\nInfinion’s UC features include a powerful software-based media server, instant messaging (chat), presence, automated attendant, and point-to-point video. The media server can support transcoding/transrating, announcements, voicemail, music on hold, and is a key part of Infinion’s powerful voice conferencing engine. Secure communication (encryption) is delivered via Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Real-time Transfer Protocol (SRTP). Infinion is hardware-agnostic and will run on any standard server. It can be installed as a virtual machine (VM) on a hypervisor such as VMware® vSphere, or directly onto the server in a “bare metal” deployment.\n“We thought it fitting to announce Infinion at Modern Day Marine, since the military tactical communications market wants to stack functions, not boxes,” said Dinah Weisberg, Executive Vice President at REDCOM. “Infinion can run on a single processor core with 1GB of RAM and a 20GB hard drive, so the user can load other VMs such as virtual routers or a video conference bridge onto the same computer. Technology that reduces the size, weight, and power consumption of field-deployed communications systems is critically important to the modern warfighter, and Infinion exemplifies this technology.”\nInfinion has undergone and passed testing with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) for compliance with Unified Communications Requirements (UCR) 2013 Errata 1, under the category Local Session Controller (LSC). This process ensures compliance with established standards for DoD-based Tactical deployments.\nInfinion natively supports connectivity to SIP lineside devices and SIP trunks—no extra software or hardware required, and no licensing penalty for using non-proprietary (standards-based) devices. Any SIP-compliant phone will work with Infinion, which gives providers a wide choice of make and model when deciding on equipment.\nInfinion supports centralized, distributed, private and public cloud, and hybrid deployment models. This flexibility gives service providers, such as ILECs and MSPs, the ability to offer their customers a wide choice of VoIP solutions. Infinion’s web-based management architecture facilitates the setup and maintenance of these solutions, whether they are managing a hosted IP-PBX or an on-premises enterprise VoIP telephony system.\nWhereas the complexity of many UC software vendors’ licensing models is known to be a major source of frustration, Infinion’s model is refreshingly simple. “Reducing the time and cost of license management for our customers was a program objective we kept at the top of the list,” offered Kevin Moriarty, Director, Marketing at REDCOM. “We’re happy with how simple we kept it, and I’m confident our customers will feel the same.”\nInfinion will be generally available on October 30, 2015.
