A sentencing date hasn't been set. \nProsecutors say he headed a scheme to purposely evade strict export controls for cutting-edge microelectronics commonly used in missile guidance systems, detonation triggers and radar systems. The 49-year-old Fishenko, among 11 people charged in the case, \"lined his pockets at the expense of our national security,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Kelly Currie said in a statement. \nDefense attorney Richard Levitt did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. \nFishenko was arrested in October 2012 amid a modernization campaign by Russian military officials hungry for the restricted American-made components, investigators say. \nDuring the probe, prosecutors say, investigators learned that Fishenko's company had shipped about $50 million worth of microelectronics and other technologies to Russia between 2002 and 2012. They also uncovered a letter that was sent by a lab for Russia's Federal Security Service that said it obtained the microchips from Fishenko's company, prosecutors say. \nFour others have pleaded guilty to charges in the case; the remaining six have pleaded not guilty and three of them are expected to go on trial in September, authorities say.
