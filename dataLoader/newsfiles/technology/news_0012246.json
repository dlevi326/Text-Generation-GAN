The new product is a combination of Helicon Books EPUB3 Reading App and the online reader and relevant for online book stores, retailers and publishers who sell digital books online.\nHelicon Books will present EPUB Cloud Reading System during Frankfurt Book Fair to be held on Oct 14-18, 2015 . Visit us at Hall 6.2 C12.\nDigital book stores can now send eBooks directly to customers with no limitation of customer's operating system. Customers can use any device whether it's their PC, Android or iOS device or any web enabled device and enjoy an unlimited reading experience. Publishers and Book store owners however, can also get high level ebook protection in low prices for ebooks that were sent to the app.\nAn important advantage of the reading system includes a marketing tool for sending push notifications to users to enhance ebook sales and the contact between the store and its audience (currently available for Android only). It is also possible to define a group of users and send those ebooks automatically in cases of special events, discounts or free books. Whenever a reader wants to buy ebook as a gift, the ebook can be personalized with personal dedication.\nAnother major advantage of the reading system is that it supports bookmark synchronization. For example, this enables readers to start reading on their tablet and continue where they left of, using another device i.e. their smartphone.\nThe way the reading system works is very simple: The store sends the book to the cloud server by means of API or simple mail message. The cloud server sends the book directly to user's application. This method provides ease of use and strong copy protection at an affordable price.\nOri Idan , Helicon Books CEO says: \"Our technology which is aimed mostly to digital book stores owners and publishers tries to expend digital books reading and sales, which make our systems unique and sophisticated.\"\n\"Helicon Books systems are never of the shelf products but provide a customizable solution for customer needs. Customer with specific requirements will always enjoy the benefit of our experience with answers to elements that they never thought of\", added Idan.\nAbout Helicon Books\nHelicon Books is a technology company for the digital books industry. Helicon Books works with publishers, retailers and book stores owners.\nAmong our products: Digital book store, EPUB3 reading application, online reader, social DRM and high end ebook production.\nFor additional information visit us at: http://www.heliconbooks.com/\nContact:\nOri Idan\n+972-9-7747588\ninfo@heliconbooks.com\nSOURCE Helicon Books", "external_links": ["http://www.heliconbooks.com/", "http://www.heliconbooks.com/?id=_id&lang=en", "http://www.heliconbooks.com/?id=products&num=1", "http://www.heliconbooks.com/?id=products&num=6"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:31:29.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
