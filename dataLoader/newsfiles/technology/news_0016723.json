Next generation vehicles and aircrafts will depend on PCMs to absorb heat and regulate the temperature of high-power electronics operating in a discontinuous pulsed fashion. \nDr. Patrick Shamberger, assistant professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University, has found an analytical solution to heat transfer in PCMs used in thermal energy storage and has identified the relative role of thermo-physical properties of different materials in his article, \"Cooling Capacity of Figure of Merit for Phase Change Materials,\" which was recently published in the Journal of Heat Transfer . \nShamberger is a leading researcher in the area of high-energy storage density PCMS and high thermal conductivity thermal energy storage composites. \n\"It's challenging to make a direct comparison between the relative cooling power of two different materials,\" said Shamberger. \"It's difficult to isolate the effects of materials properties and the effects of component geometry and boundary conditions. Here we defined a relatively simple problem and used it to investigate the relative role of different material parameters on the rate of heat absorption.\" \nMaterials scientists and engineers have been working towards developing different thermal energy storage materials with high-energy storage density. Designing materials for high-power electronics is a challenge, as heat needs to be absorbed quickly. \nThe results of Shamberger's research will be helpful in designing the next generation of high-cooling power thermal storage materials , especially for electronics thermal management applications. 3 hours ago 0 More from Chemistry Related Stories Paraffin encapsulated in beach sand material as a new way to store heat from the sun March 13, 2013 \nThe search for sustainable new materials to store heat captured from the sun for release during the night has led scientists to a high-tech combination of paraffin wax and sand.
