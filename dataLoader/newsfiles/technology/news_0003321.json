This includes €3bn in the 2016 budget and as much to help federal states whose resources are being squeezed.\nGabriel said Germany would be able to finance the costs given its stable fiscal position and its strong economy, which the government expects to grow 1.8% this and next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T21:19:54.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
