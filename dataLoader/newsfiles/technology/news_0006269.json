The survey, commissioned by Glance in August 2015 , found a fair amount of respondents whose company had stagnant (65%) or decreased (40%) budgets in the past 3 years, had still increased or upgraded a customer-focused technology during the same period of time. Not surprisingly, the majority of IT decision makers who have increased or upgraded a customer-focused technology also have increased their overall budget. One in five respondents indicated that requests for customer-centric technology originated from all employee levels at their companies, signifying that the technology is a critical factor in helping employees appropriately complete their jobs.\n\"Being a customer-centric organization is no longer a brand differentiator, but an expectation from consumers. Every day more consumers place increasing value on brands who help, and IT decision makers are recognizing and reacting to this trend,\" said Tom Martin , CEO of Glance Networks.\nA concern among IT decision makers is whether the newly invested technology will be fully utilized by employees. The percentages of companies that provide mandatory training programs provided by either an internal IT team or a vendor are fairly low at 68 percent and 44 percent respectively.\n\"Implementing technology without the proper training will create a significant gap in employee awareness of the technologies and how to properly use them,\" says Martin. \"Providing the right training empowers your team to be more efficient and connected to your customers.\"\nTechnology has long been recognized as a significant force that accelerates company growth, and 74% reporting an increased IT budget is proof of that trend. Moving into the fourth quarter is a great time to evaluate your upcoming technology needs and consider employee feedback.
