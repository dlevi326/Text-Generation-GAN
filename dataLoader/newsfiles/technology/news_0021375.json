The organization is one of the first financial institutions and the only credit union at launch to add the service to its mobile offerings. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20080117/DC11807LOGO-b \nNearly one million Navy Federal members are active Android users, and approximately 90 percent of those users will have the mobile payment option, which begins rolling out today. \n\"We have a large member population that generates 70 million debit card transactions per month and we saw more than $1.2 billion in credit card sales in August alone,\" said Meghan Gound, Navy Federal assistant vice president, digital communications. \"Android Pay makes sense for our members because we know they adopt mobile technology and are using their debit and credit cards to make transactions.\" \nAndroid Pay adds an alternate mobile payment option to give members a simple, secure choice when paying for things with their mobile phones. Android Pay is also a seamless way to pay in-stores on NFC-enabled devices running KitKat 4.4 version or higher. The service is free for Navy Federal debit cardholders and credit card holders. \n\"Offering digital services, like Android Pay, adds to our mobile payment options for our global membership made up of active duty military and their families who are more on-the-move than the average user. It's another convenience we're happy to be able to provide,\" Gound said. \nAbout Navy Federal Credit Union: Navy Federal Credit Union is the world's largest credit union with more than $69 billion in assets, 5.8 million members, 272 branches, and a workforce of over 12,000 employees worldwide. The credit union serves all Department of Defense and Coast Guard active duty, civilian, and contractor personnel and their families.
