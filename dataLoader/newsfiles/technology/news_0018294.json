We feel you. Here's something to keep you entertained (for a while, at least). Do a Google Search for \"fun facts\" or \"I'm feeling curious\". You see that? \nGoogle has introdced a nifty little trick, almost an Easter Egg, that shows up random bits of trivia when you enter those search terms. Why are pencils painted yellow, for instance? (check out the screenshot above if you're, you know, curious). What was the first country to give women the right to vote? (turns out it's New Zealand). And is Saturn's mass larger than Neptune's? (Yes). \nYou can see how addictive this can get very quickly especially since there's a big, blue Ask Another Question button that you can keep pressing for an endless supply of awesome trivia. \nGoogle pulls all this information from other websites with a link to each, so no, it won't take responsiblity for the accuracy of any of this information. But hey, it's still a fun way to kill some time. Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:48:46.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
