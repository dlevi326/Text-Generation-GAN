We are excited to bring this ultra-fast network to the residents of Fresnaye and Bakoven. Many of the residents here are well-travelled people who have experienced first-hand the benefits of high performance networks.” \nFor more tech news follow @IOLScitech on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T18:58:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
