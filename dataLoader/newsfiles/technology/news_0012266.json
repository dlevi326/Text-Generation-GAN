Picture: DOCMEDIA PICS Related articles Cosas to defend pupils accused of cheating Department working on making history compulsory at school Teachers to write pupilsâ€™ exam THE annual national assessments will be written in December, not in February as was earlier announced, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said on Friday.\nMs Motshekga broke the news at her office in Pretoria on Friday.\n\"In our engagement with unions last week, it was agreed that we would postpone the assessments for a period of 90 days ... (but) CEM (the Council of Education Ministers) felt very strongly that it would be in the interest of learners and the administration if (the exams were) written this year,\" said Ms Motshekga.\nThe assessments were meant to start last week, but were postponed because the South African Democratic Teachers Union, the Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysersunie and the National Professional Teachers Organisation of SA threatened to boycott the exams.\nMs Motshekga said that a task team was being put together to look into the administrative and frequency issues around the assessments, which the unions had complained about.\nThe department introduced the exams in 2010, and they are meant to test pupils' numeracy and literacy capabilities.\nCompetency tests for principals had also been on the CEM's agenda, and ministers agreed that, from January 2016, all provinces will test headmasters' capabilities before making an appointment.\nMs Motshekga also announced that indigenous African languages would be implemented incrementally from 2016.\nShe also spoke on the contentious Mandarin debate.\n\"We're going to move from rice to noodles, is that where the fear comes from?\" she asked.\nShe added that she was taken aback by public reaction to the idea of introducing Mandarin in South African schools, especially since French, German and Portuguese were already being taught.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:23:40.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
