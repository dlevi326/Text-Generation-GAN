Are these to be appointed new MEC’s not only to buy face before the elections, as their contribution taken the time left, would be miniscule in really making any tangible difference, so their appointments in all likely-hood is more political ‘survival mode’ than really making a change to the disastrous situations in these departments at the moment,.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:04:09.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
