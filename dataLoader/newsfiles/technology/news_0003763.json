A number of ports are currently in the process of building up infrastructure in preparation for the new generation of Panamax ships.\nThe Port of New York and New Jersey appear to be spending the most on infrastructure developments, committing US$6 billion to deepening its channel and modernising its container terminals.\nCarlos A. Gimenez, Mayor of Miami-Dade County, said: “The completion of the Deep Dredge and the Intermodal On-dock Rail project are a major milestone not only for Miami-Dade County and PortMiami, but for all of Florida because the entire Sunshine State will benefit from increased trade opportunities once the expanded Panama Canal opens in 2016.\n“I thank Governor Rick Scott, our state legislators, county commissioners and all who advocated for these critical projects. The completion of both projects ensures that PortMiami will remain competitive in the global marketplace.”\nJuan M. Kuryla, CEO and Director of Port Miami, said: “A new big ship era is here and PortMiami is ready. I am proud to say that PortMiami is now able to berth Post-Panamax ships; and we are able to expedite the movement of goods throughout Florida, the continental U.S., and the world, fast and efficiently.\nKuryla concluded: “We are grateful to the vision of our State and local leaders for making this critical infrastructure project a reality. The completion of PortMiami’s Deep Dredge and Intermodal On-dock Rail projects cannot be overstated, PortMiami is now positioned as the most reliable, convenient and efficient global hub on the North American East Coast ready to service the world’s leading ocean carriers.”\nFor all the latest on the Port of Miami, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:08:47.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
