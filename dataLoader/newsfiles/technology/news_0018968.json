(Head to the Vice link if you need to see.) It began when the user posted a photo of his toe with a minor scab and offered people a chance to comment.\nOne responded \"chop off the toe,\" and in the arcane rules of 4chan, this response happened to come up lucky in the equivalent of a dice roll.\nUnder this \"Dubs Get\" scenario, the original poster is supposed to honor the requestâ€” something that often doesn't happen, notes Pearl.
