Her likeness was scanned in 3D and was printed using a resin 3D printer. They did collaborate with the Society Management, AY Collective and Fauxgraph 3D technology to make it happen. The process took one year to finish. But the wardrobe was completed in four weeks.\nThe doll's clothing was tailored based exactly on the Fall/Winter 2015 collection from renowned designers like Marc Jacobs, Miu Miu, Saint-Laurent and Prada.\nThe 20-inch doll was styled and photographed based on the actual shoot. Andrew Yang from AY Collective told Mashable , \"Daniel (his teammate from AY Collective) and I worked in the spirit of a true editorial shoot and sewed many of the looks directly onto Lindsey during the shoot, in between hair, makeup and posing.\" Yang pointed out their goal is to make the appearance recognizable.\nHair stylist Thanos Samaras assembled the wigs. While the painting and the airbrush makeup were done by artist Ralph Siciliano. He said doing the makeup is fun but at the same time, challenging. Once it is placed, you can't erase it.\nThe limited edition doll combines fashion and 3D printing technology. The team selected Wixson because of her distinct features.\nWixson is a 21-year-old supermodel from Kansas. She had signed contracts with Alexander McQueen, John Galliano and Chanel. She goes to Milan, London, New York and Paris for fashion shows. The supermodel's full page in W Magazine was her first major break, cited on Fashion 365.\nAlthough she's been bullied before for her gap teeth, she is now considered as one of the biggest sensation in the modeling industry. Her noticeable look was the reason why Santiago and Mauricio picked her.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.springboardplatform.com/storage/js/ingage/apingage.min.js", "https://translate.google.com.ph/translate?hl=en&sl=ro&u=http://www.fashion365.ro/lindsey-wixson/&prev=search", "http://mgid.com/advertisers/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=add", "http://www.3ders.org/articles/20150919-custom-made-lindsey-wixson-doll-is-world-first-3d-printed-supermodel.html", "http://mgid.com/", "http://mashable.com/2015/09/18/3d-printed-supermodel-doll/"], "published": "2015-09-21T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T11:05:56.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
