A smoothie shop’s business was down more than 50 percent. \nEven as hundreds of thousands of people thronged the Benjamin Franklin Parkway on Sunday for Mass with Pope Francis, his weekend visit to Philadelphia apparently failed to deliver the economic boon predicted by organizers. \nSome businesses closed early, downtown hotel rooms went unfilled and normally bustling city streets were deserted over the weekend as residents either stayed home or left town, and pilgrims kept their wallets in their pockets. \nAt Midtown III restaurant, co-owner Vivian Tafuri rented a refrigerated truck, filled it with $7,500 worth of food and spent another $1,000 on a parking space. \n“It’s all wasted,” Tafuri fumed Sunday. “All the time our mayor was saying a million and a half people, and nothing. Wasted.” \nLiz Furey, a bartender at the restaurant, said the pope’s visit chased away the regulars. \n“The people who are visiting are having a good time at the parkway. But as far as the local businesses were concerned, what we were promised didn’t happen at all,” Furey said. \nThe World Meeting of Families, the Vatican-sponsored conference that drew Francis to Philadelphia, had estimated 1.5 million people would show up for the pope’s weekend visit, with 10,000 staying overnight and business sales of $390 million. \nMeryl Levitz, president and chief executive of Visit Philadelphia, the main tourism marketing agency, acknowledged Sunday that many shops and restaurants were hurting for business. But that’s because the pilgrims went to Philadelphia to “be in the aura of the pope,” not to spend a lot of money, she said. \n“To look at a grassroots spiritual event in terms of immediate economic benefit is asking too much of it,” she said. \nCity officials who for months had issued dire warnings about long walks and security lines to reach Pope Francis’ events recalibrated their message last month amid fears they were scaring people away, launching an “I’ll be There” campaign as well as the OpenInPhl hashtag for city businesses. \nBut their efforts came too little, too late for some merchants. \nWith sales down more than 50 percent, Robek’s, a juice and smoothie shop, decided to close early Sunday. \nManager Dave Deener blamed the intense security, including concrete barriers and a vehicle checkpoint near the entrance. National Guard troops and a police officer sat on folding chairs nearby. \n“It’s awful. Everybody got scared off because of the security detail,” he said. \n“I have no problem with the pope being here,” Deener added. “It’s great for the city. It’s not great for business.” \nPhilly Cupcake went all out for Pope Francis’ visit, making papal and Jesus cupcakes and plastering the windows with his picture. One window even had a big sign showing the pontiff holding a cupcake as if it were a communion wafer. \n“A lot of people take pictures with it, but they don’t come in,” said store associate Silvia Pulido. \nThe impact of the pope’s visit on business was especially apparent Saturday night. \nCenter City hotel rooms went unfilled, and tables could be had at some of the city’s trendiest restaurants. On normally bustling South Street, bars, restaurants, sneaker stores and smoke shops — usually filled on weekends with city residents, suburban gawkers and tourists — were empty.
