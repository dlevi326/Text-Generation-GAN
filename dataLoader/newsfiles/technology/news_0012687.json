PTI previously reported on DP World’s pledge to ensure that India sees an economic boom from its operations within the country. \nNitin Gadkari, Shipping, Road Transport and Highways Minister for India, said: \"The country's major ports will add Rs.1,000 crore (US$151 million) to their net profit in the next two years and 100 million tonne of capacity.”\nGadkari added that more power has been passed on to port authorities, and it has provided more capital for dredging, setting up of coastal berths and passenger jetties.\nThe 12 major ports performance could also be reflected in its drive to become greener and more efficient. Gadkari added: \"The major ports will generate 200 megawatt of green power which includes 150 mega watts (MW) solar powers and 50 MW wind energy.\"\nRajive Kumar, Shipping Secretary for India, said that, as part of the government’s modernisation program, the aim for major and minor ports is to boost capacity from 1,400 tonnes to 2,000 tonnes by 2018.\nFor all the latest on India's ports, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T19:05:03.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
