This year, the program was expanded to include teachers from the Garland and Lancaster independent school districts (ISDs) along with those from the Dallas , Mesquite , Plano and Richardson ISDs. The awards program, now in its ninth year, honors local secondary math and science teachers who consistently demonstrate quality instruction and build student achievement in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) subjects. Each honoree receives $10,000 , of which $5,000 is directly awarded to the teacher. The other $5,000 is to be used at his or her discretion for professional development or instructional technology. The grants are awarded through the independent foundations that support each district. To date, the TI Foundation has invested more than $1 million in the STEM Awards to recognize and help retain 122 excellent teachers in North Texas school districts. \"These teachers are true STEM champions, and we are pleased to have the opportunity to honor them,\" said Ann Pomykal , TI Foundation director of major education gifts. \"The work they do is essential to preparing future innovators, discoverers and explorers.\" \"A key strategy to improving student achievement in math and science is teacher effectiveness. That is why we focus our support on this area, with a special emphasis on reaching girls and minorities who are underrepresented in STEM careers,\" she said. \"As STEM-related jobs become a larger pillar of the U.S. economy, we rely on teachers like those we are honoring today to make STEM subjects interesting and accessible to all students.\" Principals nominate teachers for the STEM awards based on criteria, such as demonstrating and documenting teaching effectiveness, establishing classroom innovation, participating in education activities outside the classroom, and encouraging curiosity and increasing interest in STEM subjects among students. Teams within each district review the applications and make classroom observations. After a detailed selection process, the winners were announced. The 2015 TI Foundation STEM Award recipients are: Dallas ISD Robert Allison , Bryan Adams High School , teaches pre-calculus and calculus for 10 th , 11 th and 12 th grades. Mr. Allison offers a rigorous curriculum that encourages students to push themselves to a level they may not realize they can reach. Maya Brown , Samuell High School , teaches aquatic science to 12 th graders. Ms. Brown draws real world correlations between what they are learning and how it connects to their world. Dee Coyle , Lang Middle School , teaches touch system data entry for 7 th and 8 th grades. Ms. Coyle integrates math and science into her computer keyboarding classes. Felicia Cummings , Zan Holmes Middle School , teaches 6 th grade science. Ms. Cummings encourages students to be curious and inquire about the world around them. She uses her students' data to plan lessons that challenge their thinking and problem-solving skills. Joseph Ibarra , Irma Rangel All Girls High School, teaches statistics, calculus and algebra II for 9 th through 12 th grades. Mr. Ibarra hopes that all his students will use math to invent something that will transform humanity in a positive way forever. He is focused on preparing his students for success in rigorous college coursework. Travis Smith , Trinidad Garza Early College , teaches pre-calculus and calculus for grades 11 and 12. Mr. Smith believes that even the most dejected \"I HATE MATH\" student can be successful if the math is made accessible and if the teacher is enthusiastic. Brandi Stennis , J.F. Kimball High School , teaches biotechnical engineering to 10 th and 11 th graders. Ms. Stennis works to tie what they are learning to something in their lives. Garland ISD Creighton Bryan taught engineering and robotics at South Garland High School. His competition teams have qualified for the national level eight consecutive years and have also placed in the top 10 nationally in several categories. Erik Bushland , Sachse High School , teaches Career Technology Education. His passion for helping students become technology leaders inspires Mr. Bushland to consistently implement innovative programs in his classroom to engage his students. Gye Kraemer , Hudson Middle School , teaches science and robotics. Mr. Kraemer started a program to make obscure STEM concepts a hands-on reality. His afterschool robotics club quickly blossomed, leading to the creation of a highly sought after robotics class. Lancaster ISD Nicholas Keith , George Washington Carver 6 th grade STEM Learning Center, taught integrated STEM classes. In the coming year, he will be a blended learning STEM specialist for K-12, working with teachers and students. Mr. Keith was named \"teacher of the year\" at the campus and district levels for both elementary and secondary schools. Mesquite ISD Patricia Oliver , West Mesquite High School, teaches chemistry and AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) for 10 th and 11 th grades. Ms. Oliver meets the varying needs of her students by differentiating her lessons, infusing technology and relating difficult concepts to everyday situations that students can understand. She encourages students to be free thinkers. Kristi Hernandez , Agnew Middle School , teaches 8 th grade science and Gifted & Talented. Ms. Hernandez builds relationships with her students by incorporating technology and hands-on activities into her daily lessons. Plano ISD David Carroll , Plano West Senior High School, teaches AP physics for 11 th grade. A former Plano ISD student, he returned to the district in 1990 as a teacher and seems to work magic in his classroom. He administers two physics websites, authored instructional materials and developed a Physics Olympics competition. Nona Gill , Shepton High School , teaches geometry, \"Introduction to Engineering Design\" and \"Principles of Engineering\" to the 9 th and 10 th grades. When you walk into Ms. Gill's classroom you might encounter students racing robots or creating surgical arms. Ms. Gill is passionate about encouraging students to pursue STEM related careers, making an effort to reach students who are underrepresented in these fields. Eric McDaniels , Frankford Middle School , teaches 6 th grade math. Mr. McDaniels' students learn to be fearless in their attempts to understand mathematical concepts. He encourages constant reflection and celebrates not only among students who get the right answer but also with students who discover where they missed a step in problem solving. Richardson ISD Carrie Galvin , L.V. Berkner High School , teaches honors anatomy & physiology and biology. The 'ah-ha moment' is Ms. Galvin's favorite moment in teaching – that's when she knows her job has been done. Ms. Galvin was an early adopter of using technology for student learning. Mark Mester , Richardson High School , teaches automotive technology to grades 9 through 12. Whether a student advances to state in an automotive contest or lands a job in the automotive industry, student success is what motivates Mr. Mester. He implements the latest technology and incorporates problem solving skills to teach his students how to use their skills in the workforce. The Innovations in STEM Teaching Awards are one of many initiatives of the TI Foundation, which has led and supported innovative education programs for decades. Education is the Foundation's primary philanthropic focus, with grants specifically enhancing STEM education and supporting effective teaching. Innovation and technology changes have led to demand for STEM competencies beyond traditional STEM occupations – skills necessary for innovation are scattered across a wider swath of the economy. \"These teachers are undoubtedly equipping students with the skills they need to take advantage of these opportunities,\" Pomykal said.
