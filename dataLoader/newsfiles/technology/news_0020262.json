High Commission for Refugees , or Save The Children.\nFinance\nGE may send\njobs overseas\nGeneral Electric Co. said Tuesday that it may move about 500 jobs overseas because Congress did not renew a government program that allows foreign companies to borrow money to buy U.S. products.\nAuthorization for the U.S. Export-Import Bank was not approved by Congress, forcing it to stop lending July 1. Foreign companies use the agency to buy expensive U.S. products when bank loans are not available.\nAs a result, GE says, 100 jobs from a Houston plant that makes gas turbines will move to Hungary and China in 2016 because those countries have lending options in place.\nAnother 400 jobs could be created in France instead of factories in South Carolina, Maine and New York if the company wins projects it is bidding on. The export-credit agency in France has agreed to provide financing.\nGroceries\nTarget teams\nwith Instacart\nTarget is testing the online grocery delivery waters.\nThe chain has teamed up with Instacart, the online grocery delivery service, to let shoppers in the Minneapolis area order fruits and other perishables, as well as household, pet and baby products, and have them delivered to their homes in as little as an hour.\nThe service began Tuesday. Target says it is exploring plans to expand to other markets.\nTarget’s moves come as Amazon and Walmart are expanding their grocery delivery services.\nEconomy\nRetail sales\nup in August\nAmericans stepped up their spending on cars, restaurant meals, groceries and clothing in August, suggesting that consumers will help sustain U.S. economic growth despite a broader global slowdown.\nThe Commerce Department said Tuesday that retail sales rose 0.2 percent last month, after advancing 0.7 percent in July. Sales have increased 2.2 percent over the past 12 months.\n“There was more spending on ‘wants’ last month” such as eating out, sporting goods and electronics, said Jennifer Lee , a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets . “These are areas that suggest consumers are ready and willing to splurge a little on items outside of the basic necessities.”\nRetail sales have been fed this year by solid and steady job gains. The economy has become increasingly reliant on consumer spending to maintain growth as Europe and China have struggled to expand at a faster pace.\nCarmakers are on pace to top vehicle sales of 17 million for the first time since 2001. Auto retailers reported a 0.7 percent increase in August.\nPurchases at restaurants and bars increased 0.7 percent in August and have soared 8.2 percent this year. And dining establishments have added more than 372,000 workers over the past year to satiate the new businesses.\nSales also improved last month at grocers, clothiers, sporting goods stores, electronics outlets and online retailers.\nSpending at gasoline stations slid 1.8 percent in August.\nDelivery\nUPS to hire\nup to 95,000\nUPS said Tuesday it will hire 90,000 to 95,000 employees — about the same as last year — to help handle shipping and deliveries over the holiday season.\nThe company will hire package handlers, drivers and driver-helpers to work full time and part time at locations around the U.S. The seasonal jobs will last from November to January. UPS says seasonal jobs can become permanent jobs in some cases.\nApplications must be submitted online.\nUnited Parcel Service hired between 90,000 and 95,000 people for the 2014 holiday season. The year before, it initially hired 55,000 people and was caught off guard by an increase in last-minute online shipping. It wound up hiring another 30,000, but some last-minute orders were not delivered until after Christmas.\nCrime\nGuilty plea in\nhacking scheme\nA Russian man has pleaded guilty in New Jersey to a role in a computer hacking scheme that authorities say involved stealing and selling 160 million credit and debit card numbers.\nVladimir Drinkman entered his plea Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Camden and admitted taking part in the scheme from 2005 to 2012. He faces up to 35 years in federal prison and then deportation.\nU.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in 2013 that the case is the largest hacking scheme ever prosecuted in the U.S.\nThree others are charged. Two remain at large.\nDrinkman’s sentencing is set for Jan. 15.\nChronicle News Services", "external_links": ["http://google.com/refugeerelief.", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-16T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:47:23.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
