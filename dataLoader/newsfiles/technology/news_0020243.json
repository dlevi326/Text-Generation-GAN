It is so sad we live in a country seemingly saturated with bigots - and more sad that they tend to comment the loudest. Many of the comments I came across were laced in hate speech - and the loudest of all that hate, racism of course. So, it is a pleasure to see the section removed as it has poisoned my News24 experience (so much so that I removed the news24 app because like a masochist, I was more drawn to the smut of its commentary than the content of its news).\nThat said, news24 can be guilty of sensationalist news that has directly contributed to the intolerance found within its commentary. In a recent article about the hijacking of a 94.7 manager, your title for it ran along these lines: manager survives robbery. Although you go on to say that the manager was physically unarmed, the essence embedded in the word 'survives' suggests something far more serious about the story (and perhaps something about the agenda of your sub editor). The very same article was reported in other publications as merely: presenter robbed (go and have a look). Yes, perhaps my logic is reaching, but certainly it can be argued that there is a sensationalism to your articles that plays into the hands of your (now banned) commentators.\nYour journalism of late surrounding the domestic economic crisis has done little to shed light on the significant global forces that impact on the Rand. Instead, you have mashed all of that into intangible economic jargon - but suggested way more clearly (and relentlessly) that the ANC is the biggest destroyer of its own currency.\nNow, I am certainly not a fan of Zuma either (nor his party), but your reporting on this issue has deliberately not given enough attention to the significant global forces in this matter: you would rather spread panic by ripping into the ANC than properly report and EXPLAIN the other factors that are also contributing to our economic problems. Your pieces, in these instances, are just opinions dressed as journalism and aggravate the type of distasteful commentary that lead you to discard it.\nCertainly, it is an absolute relief to see your commentary section gone. But, with sensationalism diminishing your work, where will all the good commentary go - the commentary that tries to reign in what is sometimes an obvious agenda?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T11:20:37.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
