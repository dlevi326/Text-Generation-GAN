Selling and general expenses increased $823,000 , to $2.5 million from $1.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, primarily due to the additional operating expenses attributable to the acquisitions of Comnet and Rel-Tech and related amortization of intangible assets and acquisition costs.

Johnny Walker , CEO/President said, \"Our revenue increase was the result of our recent acquisitions of Comnet Telecom and Rel-Tech Electronics, which were both profitable and met our sales expectations for the quarter. However, the continuing slowdown in the wireless infrastructure market affected sales and profitability at the RF Connector and Cable Assembly division, which decrease affected our overall sales and profitability. While we are tightly controlling expenses and working to improve the profitability of all of our divisions, our primary focus is on pursuing opportunities for sales growth at each of our business segments.\" Nine Months Results For the first nine months of fiscal 2015, net sales increased 39%, or $6.7 million , to $23.9 million compared to $17.2 million in the same period last fiscal year.
