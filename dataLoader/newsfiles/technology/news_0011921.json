We require immediate bold, radical solutions to address this issue,\" Foster said. \nThe pilot project is slated to begin next year, with three \"drone-port\" buildings due for completion by 2020, enabling the drones to cover almost half of Rwanda's countryside. \nWhile Rwanda's government has yet to comment on the proposals, people have welcomed the plan. \n\"The introduction of drones can add to the many solutions we have available to tackle infrastructure challenges in Rwanda,\" Junior Sabena Mutabazi wrote in a the pro-government New Times newspaper. \nRwanda, small, tightly controlled and where there is only modern infrastructure in key hubs, offers the chance to test case cargo drones before possible expansion into wilder, less developed countries on the continent. \n\"The Droneport project is about doing 'more with less', capitalising on the recent advancements in drone technology -- something that is usually associated with war and hostilities -- to make an immediate life-saving impact in Africa,\" Foster said. \nThose developing the project point out that in many parts of Africa, too remote to establish telephone landlines, mobile technology leapfrogged that step, with mobiles now common across the continent even in the remotest of places. \n- 'Flying robots to move goods inevitable' - \nDrones, it is argued, could do the same where a lack of roads has made access tough. \n\"Cargo drone routes have utility wherever there is a lack of roads,\" the project proposal said. \n\"Just as mobile phones dispensed with landlines, cargo drones can transcend geographical barriers such as mountains, lakes, and unnavigable rivers without the need for large-scale physical infrastructure.\" \nJonathan Ledgard, from Swiss-based Afrotech -- an initiative aiming to \"help pioneer advanced technologies in Africa at massive scale\" -- knows the challenges, having worked as a journalist in trouble spots across the continent for the past decade. \nLedgard is convinced cargo drones will be the future, but is also determined the technology will benefit those who need it most. \n\"It is inevitable on a crowded planet, with limited resources, that we will make more intensive use of our sky using flying robots to move goods faster, cheaper, and more accurately than ever before,\" Ledgard said. \n\"But it is not inevitable that these craft or their landing sites will be engineered to be tough and cheap enough to serve poorer communities who can make most use of them,\" he said. \n\"Droneport is an attempt to make that happen, and to improve health and economic outcomes in Africa ? and beyond.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T11:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:01:18.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
