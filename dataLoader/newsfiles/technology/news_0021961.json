With the new version of FirstSpirit, companies will be well on their way to achieving digital transformation with less time and less overall effort.\n“The goal of the Corporate Content Cloud initiative is to help organizations use content more effectively and improve the customer experience across all touchpoints,” said Oliver Jaeger, vice president of global marketing and communications for e-Spirit. “FirstSpirit with its integrative approach is already ideally suited to this type of application, and with the latest release we are adding a number enhancements that among other things will make life easier for developers and content editors resulting in faster time-to-market.”\nOne of the key aspects of any digital transformation effort is integration across marketing, business and e-commerce applications. As a best-of-breed CMS, FirstSpirit is already well-equipped to help companies link these applications together to improve the customer experience. With the latest release, e-Spirit is now offering a series of completed reference implementations and other enhancements for existing integrations with leading e-commerce platforms including Demandware, IBM WebSphere Commerce, and hybris. Integrations with top portals such as Liferay and JBoss have also been similarly enhanced.\nFor organizations that must manage large amounts of content, templates provide a powerful means for ensuring consistent presentation across multiple channels. FirstSpirit 5.2 features a number of enhancements to help agencies, designers and in-house teams create re-usable templates in significantly less time, for faster time-to-market and lower costs. The enhancements include a new template creation wizard and tools for rapidly importing and re-using HTML code blocks.\nA common technique for optimizing content is A/B testing. The latest release of FirstSpirit offers enhanced support for this methodology by allowing different content variants to be produced directly within the FirstSpirit editing environment. Once the preferred layout and content approach has been identified, it can now be immediately published. This contrasts with other CMS systems that require far more complex steps to both create the content variants and then to publish them. The ultimate result of easier A/B testing is higher conversion rates and better performing content.\nFor large corporations, digital transformation spans the globe. FirstSpirit 5.2 offers enhancements designed to speed the process of adapting content for use on multiple language websites. From within the FirstSpirit environment, editors can now use online translation services for quick comparisons between the source and target languages to help speed the translation process. New media management services allow editors to manage multi-language assets more easily, helping to promote content re-use throughout an organization.\nAn important factor in any digital transformation effort is driving content out to mobile devices. But this can be easily undermined if the content is hard to read or unattractive. FirstSpirit leads the way with mobile support, offering full support for responsive design and integrated preview. FirstSpirit 5.2 takes this a step further with an integrated preview for more than 700 operating systems and browser combinations. This ensures a consistent experience regardless of the device the customer is using.\nFor more information on e-Spirit’s Corporate Content Cloud initiative and how FirstSpirit 5.2 accelerates digital transformation, go to: http://www.e-Spirit.com/firstspirit\nAbout e-Spirit\ne-Spirit is a leader in enabling companies to unlock the value of digital content and transform the way they communicate with customers and employees.
