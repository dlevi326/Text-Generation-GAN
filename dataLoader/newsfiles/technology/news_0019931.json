The software, according to the Kickstarter campaign, communicates with an EEG headset that reads brainwave patterns from the user and translates the signals into commands that control the movement of the robot.\nThynkWare Innovation, founded by Duane Cash, provides the interface layer between your brain and your devices. With ThynkWare Innovation technology, anyone can use their thoughts to control their smartphones, tablets, home, office, TV, robots, and even clothing. ThynkWare Innovation creates a new way of computing, enabling us to \"thynk,\" to interact with devices, social networks, and other people. Some have suggested that the ThynkWare Innovation interface is the next step in computing following the invention of the mouse and personal computer.\nThynkBot is the corporation's first mind-enabled robot offering to the Kickstarter platform. ThynkBot enables people to control a Bluetooth robot with their thoughts to move forward, backward and turning in new directions. The ThynkBot software reads the user's EEG brainwave patterns and translates the signals into commands that the robot can understand.\nMore info: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thynkware/thynkbot-a-mind-controlled-robot-software-for-ever?ref=discovery", "external_links": ["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thynkware/thynkbot-a-mind-controlled-robot-software-for-ever?ref=discovery"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:07:49.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
