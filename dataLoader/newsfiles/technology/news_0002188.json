Lufthansa already offers internet access on its long-haul fleet of aircraft.\nLufthansa has been working with Inmarsat and Deutsche Telekom on the service and it should start becoming available on short-haul aircraft in early summer 2016.\nThe airline said the service would allow passengers to watch streaming programmes, as well as sending and receiving text messages through the use of passengers’ own phone contract data allowance.\nCarsten Spohr, chairman of Lufthansa’s executive board, said: “Having equipped all planes in the Lufthansa intercontinental fleet with our successful Flynet system, we are now continuing our success story by providing internet onboard our short and medium-haul flights.\n“We are therefore the first airline in Europe able to offer its guests an internet surfing experience boasting the same quality and speed as they are used to at home.”\nLufthansa has yet to announce how passengers will be charged for onboard internet access.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T01:07:43.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
