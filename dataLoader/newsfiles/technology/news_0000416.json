[Credit: Ian Sutton][/caption]Gravitational waves are the last major prediction to be fulfilled from Einstein's general theory of relativity. They are waves in the structure of space and time, created by black holes in orbit around each other, supernova explosions, and other extreme phenomena. We know gravitational waves exist, but for a number of reasons they're hard to detect — though it's a safe bet we're within 5 years of finally seeing them.But there's a wrinkle: one expected type of gravitational wave is missing from our detectors. These waves, from pairs of black holes millions of times more massive than the Sun, should be a steady background of gravitational rumbling. However, a long period of observation failed to hear that rumble, which is leaving astronomers frustrated over why that might be.Let me repeat the point: we know gravitational waves exist. Astronomers have studied pairs of pulsars and white dwarfs (the remnants of high- and low-mass stars, respectively) as they orbit each other. Over the years, these pairs are getting closer together and moving faster, which means they're losing energy. These changes are exactly what is predicted by general relativity, if the energy is being carried away by gravitational waves.However, we haven't detected gravitational waves directly yet, largely because gravity is the weakest force in the Universe by far. A wave carrying a huge amount of energy would still barely nudge a detector on Earth. Then the detectors themselves need to be roughly the same size as the astronomical systems making waves, which means even a small gravitational wave observatory has to be miles across.Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) get big by using objects in space as gravitational wave detectors. Pulsars are the rapidly-rotating remains of stars more massive than the Sun, which send strong beams of light out like a fast lighthouse. Some pulsars spin around more than 20 times each second, and their flashes reach us so regularly that they serve as very precise clocks.When a gravitational wave passes between us and these ultra-fast pulsars, it creates peaks and valleys for the pulsars' light to travel across. That creates slight delays in the timing, which can be measured using telescopes on Earth . That's what PTAs are: radio telescopes that monitor groups of fast-spinning pulsars and watching for variations in the arrival of pulses. There are three PTAs in operation: the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) in Australia, NANOGrav in the United States and Canada, and the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) in um... Europe .Since pulsars are separated from each other and from Earth by many light-years, PTAs are sensitive to very low-frequency, long wavelength gravitational waves. A typical source of that kind of wave is a pair of supermassive black holes, the kind that sit at the centers of galaxies. The idea is that as galaxies merge over the history of the Universe, their black holes merge too, creating the black holes weighing in at several billion times the mass of the Sun.However, those mergers don't happen instantly. For many years after a galaxy merger, the black holes from each of their cores should settle into mutual orbit, slowly growing closer to each other while producing gravitational waves of the right wavelength for PTAs to detect.Astronomers with the PPTA in Australia analyzed the results of eleven years of observation, using 24 pulsars. (The Parkes telescope is an important astronomical observatory, but it also played a significant part in the Apollo 11 Moon mission .) They found no clear signs of gravitational waves within the sensitivity of their equipment.Again, this doesn't mean there are no gravitational waves; it doesn't even mean there are no pairs of supermassive black holes (since we see a few of 'em out there). PTAs like the PPTA are sensitive to the collective rumblings of many supermassive black hole pairs, so the lack of detection means there are fewer of those pairs out there than predicted.That leaves us with several possible explanations . Maybe black hole mergers happen more quickly than expected due to the effects of gas at the centers of galaxies, which means they don't stick around long enough to produce a measurable signal for PTAs. Or perhaps there are fewer supermassive black holes in the first place, either because not every galaxy has one or because we don't fully understand the relationship between the size of the galaxy and the mass of its central black hole.So, we don't know why there isn't a signal yet, but with other pulsar timing arrays at work and continued surveys of galaxies at ever-larger distances, we should be able to figure out which scenario is the most likely. In the meantime, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (aLIGO) is up and running. Within the next five years at a conservative estimate, we should have direct detections of gravitational waves — not from supermassive black holes, but from colliding pulsars. Science doesn't always work the way we planned, but one thing we've learned: we can solve most puzzles given enough time and effort.", "external_links": ["http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/ppta/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0205873", "http://www.epta.eu.org/", "https://theconversation.com/where-are-the-missing-gravitational-waves-47940", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/610/1/012017", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aab1910", "http://nanograv.org/"], "published": "2015-09-30T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T15:42:47.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
