This user safe, cost effective and time saving solution ensures professional cuts every time. The hardened steel body has four molded slots to position asymmetric, mini and standard DIN Rail and maintain proper dimensional specifications. Equipped with a powerful lever action and integrated one meter ruler with attached end stop, you are always set to cut DIN Rail to the length you need. When making the cut, the handle is pulled down and released back to its starting position. The lever action of the handle reduces user fatigue during repeated use. Additionally it is portable and storable, thus freeing up valuable work space on your production floor. Using the ASI EZ DIN Rail Cutter is the preferred method of achieving a professional finish compared to the unsafe hacksaw/file method which requires a cut followed by file to remove burrs and sharp edges. The ASI EZ DIN Rail Cutter provides years of maintenance free operation. ASI also offers one meter and two meter length DIN Rail and DIN Rail mounted products including competitive equivalent, multi-level, multi-wire and special function terminal blocks. ASI products are designed to save time, money and space.
