The annual list compiled by Inc. magazine provides an exclusive look at the top 35% of fastest-growing companies in America.\nAt #1805 on the list, Surefire Social has posted three-year growth of 220% and added more than 280 customers and 86 employees. This monumental growth rate comes only five years after the company was founded in 2009.\nAs an Inc. 5000 honoree, Surefire Social shares a pedigree with Intuit, Zappos, Under Armour, Microsoft, Jamba Juice, Timberland, Clif Bar, Pandora, Patagonia, Oracle and other notable alumni. The 2015 list added such powerhouses as Fitbit, Smashburger, Bowlmor AMF, Planet Fitness, Giftcards.com, Radio Flyer, Box and Mindbody.\nIn the past year, Surefire Social launched SurePulse , an interactive digital platform that empowers the local business to manage all its digital marketing activity in one place, and to make informed decisions through insights into the best channels for lead generation.

Our team is working hard on innovating new technology for hyper local marketing that will keep us on a high growth path” said Chris Marentis, Founder and CEO of Surefire Social. “We are constantly looking for ways to make our customers successful. We are proud of our record of having one of the lowest customer churn rates in the industry.”\nSurefire Social began as Marentis’s idea that small businesses, especially in the home services industry, were not adapting to digital marketing quickly. He set out on a mission to educate small businesses in the real meaning of “being social.” In his book, Surefire Social, Marentis first advocated the use of local digital marketing to grow a business through content and customer engagement.\nAbout Surefire Social\nSurefire Social provides custom SaaS marketing technologies and services to both small businesses and multi-location national brands and their networks of franchisees, dealers and contractors.
