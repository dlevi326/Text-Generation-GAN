Or was it early 2001?\nWhichever year is more appropriate, the market’s plunge, subsequent increase in volatility and widespread price weakness among Nasdaq leaders strongly suggest we’re close to the end of a multi-year boom in tech investing.\nA look at another long-term trend also argues that tech-stock prices are now roaming the border between boom and bust levels.\nThe report last week from Yardeni Research shows that amid the stock-price plunge and sharp snap-back of last week, one thing is still true:\nTech shares remain expensive relative to Wall Street’s expectations for the earnings growth of the companies behind them.\nAs of Aug. 20, the information technology sector of the S&P 500 Index was trading at 15.7 times the forward-looking, per-share estimates of the companies that comprise it.\nUSA TODAY\nStocks tumble at the open on Fed uncertainty, China fears\nThe so-called price-to-earnings ratio of tech stocks has been drifting sideways near the 16 level for all of 2015.\nIt hasn’t been that high for a sustained period of time since the second half of 2009.\nWhile not a perfect predictor of market direction, the ratio shows where investors’ appetites are on the spectrum from fearful bearishness to greedy bullishness.\nIts current level shows one of two things are about to happen:\nEither tech companies are going to trounce Wall Street’s earnings expectations for the remainder of this year and justify their rich valuations.\nOr, the overall appetite for risk is about to drop, taking tech-stock valuations with them.\nGiven that five of the six largest public stock offerings of the current tech investment boom all dropped below their IPO price sooner or later, including offerings from Alibaba BABA , Twitter TWTR , Facebook FB , Groupon GRPN and Zynga ZNGA , it’s easy to understand why the fear of risk is up.\nZynga CEO Mark Pincus at the company's San Francisco headquarters on June 26, 2012. Effective Wednesday, April 8, 2015, Pincus is back as CEO of Zynga, the online game company he founded and two years ago turned over to Don Mattrick, the former head of Microsoft's Xbox division.
