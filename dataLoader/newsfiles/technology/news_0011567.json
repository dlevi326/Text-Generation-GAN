With the integration, Resolve processes the incident from Splunk solutions to execute full, closed-loop automation and immediately resolve the incident. The automation can also trigger Resolve's human-guided automation and process guidance to prescriptively lead agents to resolve the issues more quickly and effectively. \nThe value this integration delivers to customers includes: -- The ability to apply focused resources on valid incidents instead of false ones increasing productivity -- Reduced swivel-chairing by combining information from multiple disparate systems and tests into a centralized incident resolution dashboard and diagnostic console -- Reduced incident escalations with easy to follow troubleshooting actions and decision trees \n\"Big data and analytics provided by Splunk Enterprise can bring insights into new problems and incidents often not found by traditional event and fault management systems. Resolve's incident resolution platform, working together with Splunk Enterprise, uniquely enables businesses to efficiently address these new problems by effectively diagnosing, troubleshooting, and resolving them,\" said Robert Young, research director, ITSM and Client Virtualization software, IDC. \n\"We are thrilled to enable Splunk Enterprise customers with automation, process guidance and procedures to accelerate the resolution of their incidents, thereby saving time and money,\" said Martin Savitt, chief executive officer, Resolve Systems. \n\"Resolve is an exciting new integration for users of Splunk Enterprise because it combines incident detection with automation and process guidance to accelerate the resolution of IT incidents,\" said Rick Fitz, senior vice president of IT markets Splunk. \nAbout Splunk Inc. \nSplunk Inc.
