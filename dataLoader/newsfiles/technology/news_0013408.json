The current polarised debate and scaremongering over the China-Australia free trade agreement is a case in point.\nSo the event held in August by the Australia-China Relations Institute to honour Malcolm Fraser’s role in developing Australia’s ties with China was timely, and not just because it shed new light on the late prime minister’s contribution to Australia’s foreign relations. Fraser’s stewardship of a young relationship with a China in flux is an example of foreign policy for the long term. His approach holds lessons for how Australia deals with an economically transformed China now.\n‘Our geographic position is Asian and this makes us Asians’, contended Fraser in 1959. Speaking on the radio to his Western District constituents, the young backbencher argued that Australia should look at the region ‘from the point of view of an Asian’, because ‘our fate is bound up with events in this part of the world’.\nFraser’s early prescience on Asia would find expression in his diplomacy as prime minister, including his engagement of a China roiled by the death of Mao Zedong, the predations of the Gang of Four and the beginnings of economic reform under Deng Xiaoping.\nFraser’s government, from 1975 to 1983, coincided with a period of extraordinary upheaval in China, even by the standards of Chinese history. A decade of Cultural Revolution had sown economic and social turmoil. In January 1976, Premier Zhou Enlai – widely credited as a moderating influence on Mao – died.\nThe future modernising leader Deng Xiaoping was purged from the Communist Party for the third time. Mao himself died in September 1976, leaving a power struggle from which Deng emerged as paramount leader.\nRoderick MacFarquhar captured the China of the 1970s with his recollection of a visit to the People’s Daily newsroom, where an official explained that ‘the People’s Daily was a morning paper and sometimes an evening paper, a reflection of the need in those uncertain times to respond to sudden developments’.\nDiplomatic relations with China had been established by Gough Whitlam in 1972, but there was no guarantee that China would develop an economy capable of becoming Australia’s largest trading partner. Fraser acknowledged a lack of purchase during his first trip to China.\nDrawing a contrast with Australia’s successful trading relationship with Japan, he noted that ‘there was [no] such tangible stepping stone we could work from in the development of our relations’ with China. Deepening ties would require thinking through a broader strategic framework.\nIn his June 1976 ‘state of the world’ speech to Parliament, Fraser set out a foreign policy grounded in the ‘enlightened realism’ championed by adviser Owen Harries. Fraser called for a ‘realistic assessment of the state of the world … free of self-delusion’. Turning to China, the new prime minister acknowledged that ‘in many respects China remains a great unknown in international affairs … China’s attitude and view of the world are often far removed from our own’. Nevertheless, ‘constructive relations do not depend on agreement on all aspects of relations but on the development of those areas where there are common interests’.\nFraser found a space of common interest created by the Sino-Soviet split, which saw the two Communist giants become Cold War rivals. Australia and China shared an interest in balancing Soviet power in East Asia with ‘the power of other major states or by appropriate regional arrangements’. Specifically, Fraser argued that Australia could ‘expect Chinese support for our own views on the need for an effective American presence in the Pacific and Indian oceans’.\nAt the ACRI event, the University of Sydney’s Associate Professor James Curran argued that, prior to Fraser’s government, fear of China had been \"Araldite that bound the conservative world-view together\". Fraser rejected this in favour of pragmatic dealings in which \"national interest trumped ideology\".\nAs an example, Professor John Fitzgerald from the Swinburne University of Technology credited Fraser with securing a public commitment from Chinese leader Hua Guofeng that China would no longer conduct party-to-party relations in the region at the expense of state-to-state ties (a particularly sensitive point in Cold War-era Southeast Asia).\nA paper by ACRI’s Hannah Bretherton summarises the increased Australia-China cooperation during the Fraser Government. This included the establishment of the Australia-China Council , a doubling of trade, the exchange of defence attachés and agreements on science and technology and cultural cooperation. Australia also became China's first development aid donor.\nIn short, Fraser’s China policy was marked by neither red-baiting nor rosy-tinted enthusiasm. A ‘flexible, alert and undogmatic’ approach, responsive to major changes in leadership and policy in Beijing, helped to position Australia as an economic partner in China’s post-1978 ‘reform and opening’ growth story.\nCrucially, in building on rather than reversing Whitlam’s boldness and foresight in opening diplomatic ties (an act Fraser had criticised from opposition), Fraser entrenched China policy as essentially bipartisan. As Fraser would recall of his first trip to China: ‘I thought it important particularly to make it plain to China that, on a change of government, our policy to them would not be altered. It was not a matter that should become subject to party politics’.\nIn his motion of condolence for Fraser, Tony Abbott called on Liberals ‘to be more magnanimous in his death than we were in his life, and to acknowledge this giant who is surely one of us’. When it comes to Fraser’s unsentimental, realist leadership on China, it is not just Liberals who should acknowledge an approach that has served Australia well.\nStephen Minas , a Research Fellow at King’s College London, previously worked in the offices of the Victorian premier and members of the Australian Parliament.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiSV1GmXvo4", "http://en.people.cn/", "http://dfat.gov.au/people-to-people/foundations-councils-institutes/australia-china-council/pages/australia-china-council.aspx", "http://www.australiachinarelations.org/content/prime-ministers-series-fraser-and-china", "http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2015-03-23/death-right-honourable-john-malcolm-fraser-ac-ch-condolence-motion"], "published": "2015-09-11T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:42:26.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
