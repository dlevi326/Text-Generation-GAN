The sturdy domed shape enclosure fits equally well for wall mount, desktop, or floor-top placement. A changeable AC cable with ISO10651-2:2004 locking brings compatibility with any type of outlet, while a changeable DC cable brings connector adaptability to any load. IP21 protection class enables use in critical medical environments. With a leakage current of <100 ÂµA, and full compliance with all requirements for medical type BF applications, output voltages of 12, 15 or 24 Vdc, and an input range of 100 to 240 Vac, these power supplies are ideal for a large number of medical applications worldwide. \nUsing a one step conversion topology, where power factor correction, isolation and regulation are combined in one conversion step, keeps the component count stays below 120. This contributes to an efficiency of 93%, zero load power of <0.3 W, and a MTBF of >400,000 h. The supplies also provide intelligent over-temperature protection, regulating output power and over temperature. The power supplies meet electrical safety IEC60601-1 Edition 3, EMC EN55011 class B, class II isolation, and IEC60601-1-11 for home care applications. They also meet environmental CEC Level 5, RoHS, REACH and WEEE.
