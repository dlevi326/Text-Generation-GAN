We see him providing tech advice to fellow ministers, asking George Clooney to play him in the “inevitable biopic” and arranging a boys’ weekend with Prince Harry. \nThe prescient first photo, shared six months ago, shows Tony Abbott writing a text with the caption, “Can we chat?” and the new PM replying: “Don’t have this number.” \nIt’s the parody account that’s made for our tech-savvy leader, “Because Tony Abbott doesn’t have opposable thumbs.” A photo posted by Malcolm Turnbull (@textsfrommalcolm) on Sep 14, 2015 at 4:49am PDT A photo posted by Malcolm Turnbull (@textsfrommalcolm) on Mar 12, 2015 at 8:37pm PDT A photo posted by Malcolm Turnbull (@textsfrommalcolm) on Sep 14, 2015 at 6:15pm PDT A photo posted by Malcolm Turnbull (@textsfrommalcolm) on Mar 9, 2015 at 7:42pm PDT A photo posted by Malcolm Turnbull (@textsfrommalcolm) on Mar 7, 2015 at 10:40pm PST A photo posted by Malcolm Turnbull (@textsfrommalcolm) on Aug 3, 2015 at 2:16pm PDT A photo posted by Malcolm Turnbull (@textsfrommalcolm) on Mar 7, 2015 at 11:16pm PST A photo posted by Malcolm Turnbull (@textsfrommalcolm) on Mar 8, 2015 at 3:37am PDT A photo posted by Malcolm Turnbull (@textsfrommalcolm) on Mar 8, 2015 at 3:35am PDT A photo posted by Malcolm Turnbull (@textsfrommalcolm) on Mar 8, 2015 at 3:47am PDT A photo posted by Malcolm Turnbull (@textsfrommalcolm) on Jul 24, 2015 at 11:42pm PDT A photo posted by Malcolm Turnbull (@textsfrommalcolm) on Mar 24, 2015 at 3:11pm PDT A photo posted by Malcolm Turnbull (@textsfrommalcolm) on Sep 15, 2015 at 2:58am PDT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T07:56:26.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
