It's difficult to tell at this point.\"\nNetflix, through a public relations representative present at the festival, declined a request to comment to Reuters on the company's reasons for launching the films in Venice.\nBut the directors for the two Netflix films here said they saw great potential in getting their work to larger audiences through Netflix.\nThe company reported in July that it had added 2.4 million customers in international markets in the quarter, taking its total to more than 65 million users worldwide.\n\"Of course I want everyone to see it on the big screen in a dark room with people they don't know and watch it from beginning to end, uninterrupted by anything in their home or anything else,\" director Fukunaga said in an interview.\n\"But, ultimately, thousands of people are going to be watching it in a different way.\n\"And what you want in the end is more eyes on the story and the people who have gone to the cinema will hopefully still go to the cinema and the people who maybe never would have gone to the cinema will now have it right in front of them on Netflix.\"\nEvgeny Afineevsky, director of the Ukrainian documentary \"Winter on Fire\", also said that Netflix would allow his film to reach a much larger audience.\n\"As a filmmaker in one moment I am able to share my story with millions and millions of people,\" he told Reuters.
