A YouTube video explains the training program in detail.\nMSPs typically offer anti-virus software and firewalls as part of an IT services package. But when they try to convince clients that they need greater protection to ward off ever increasing cyberattacks they’re often met with resistance. SMBs incorrectly believe they’re too small for cyber criminals to target.\nNow MSPs can offer clients the Breach Secure Now! security training subscription under their own label and make it available through a secure MSP branded portal. They can bundle the training with the anti-virus protection, firewalls and security patch management services they already provide.\n“MSPs have long struggled to talk to their clients about security,” said Art Gross, CEO of Breach Secure Now! “Now they can say, ‘I’m an MSP who worries about security and I’m worried about your security so I’m giving you this training for free.’\n“Every MSP sells anti-virus software. But when 95 percent of data breaches are caused by human error, software alone isn’t enough protection. We are now providing employee security training at an affordable price that every one of their clients can use.”\nThe Unlimited Clients Security Training Subscription, which starts at less than $50 a month for MSPs, provides clients with invaluable lessons in recognizing and avoiding sophisticated hacking scams that even their most tech savvy employees can succumb to.\nEmployees who complete the 90-minute training course become more proficient in identifying phishing scams, protecting proprietary data stored on mobile devices and much more.\nThrough the training portal, clients will also discover the other services offered by Breach Secure Now!, including security risk assessments, PII (personal identifiable information) scanning, security policies and procedures, breach response services and $100,000 of cyber protection though an AIG insurance program. Clients who notice these services in the portal become better informed and therefore more receptive to discussing additional security solutions with their MSPs.\n“Our training program is the MSP’s Trojan Horse,” Gross said. “Once inside the portal clients will naturally explore the other security services we offer. This paves the way for MSPs to have meaningful conversations about security and thereby sell additional services.”\nThe Unlimited Clients Security Training Subscription also has an attractive referral program. An MSP receives a $100 credit toward his own subscription for each colleague they refer who subsequently purchases the training subscription. The colleague, in turn, receives a five percent discount on their subscription. There is no limit to the number of colleagues an MSP can refer.\nFor more information on the Unlimited Clients Security Training Subscription visit http://www.breachsecurenow.com/training/ .\nBreach Secure Now!\nBreach Secure Now! is a full service security platform that includes security risk assessments, policies and procedures, employee security training, and scanning tools to identify system vulnerabilities.

The BreachSecureNow! solution is sold as a white label service that MSPs can offer under their own brand.\nBreach Secure Now! offers an attractive partner program and lets MSPs set the pricing under their own label.
