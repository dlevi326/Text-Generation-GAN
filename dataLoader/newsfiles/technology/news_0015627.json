At NASA, Martin said, there are 80 auditors in the IG’s office, but only five of them have IT expertise. \n“They are very difficult to retain,” he said of IT-proficient auditors. “We tend to poach from each other in the IG community.” \nThe lack of expertise hinders thorough reviews. “I think every agency has no doubt dozens of IT audits or reviews that should be done” but aren’t due to a lack of tech-savvy auditors, Martin added. \nWhat auditors should know \nMartin has criticized the checklist nature of Federal Information Security Management Act reports in the past, noting that FISMA “doesn’t get down onto the ground” to deeply assess security. \n“You don’t want to have a bus driver be the flight examiner for a Boeing 747 pilot just because he can follow a checklist,” said Montana Williams, senior manager of ISACA’s Cybersecurity Practices. “If you’re not a cybersecurity professional, how can you audit cybersecurity?” \nAmong the skills regulators and auditors should have is “detailed knowledge of the operating systems and the technology in operation” at the agencies or institutions they’re monitoring, said Gregory Wilshusen, GAO’s director of information security issues. \n“They have to understand security policies and procedures and how they are implemented, and they have to understand technical security controls to be able to judge, ‘Are they implemented and operating as intended?’” he added. \nThose skills can be difficult to pick up on the fly, which is why some experts advocate looking for people who have an IT background. \n“I’ve found the best IT auditors are former IT grunts,” notes Mack, an IT auditor and author of the ITauditSecurity blog. The blog keeps a running tally of the skills IT auditors should have, from basic typing to understanding permissions and knowing how networks, applications and databases interact. \nHowever, Williams and Martin both said that even IT-proficient auditors need continuous training to stay sharp. Williams plugged the Cybersecurity Nexus training program he runs at ISACA. Martin said IGs need to find specialized training for their auditors because the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency’s training program does not offer the necessary cybersecurity courses. \nMartin added that tech can be a boon, not just a burden, for regulators and auditors, and he cited the analytics work done by the National Science Foundation’s IG as an example. \nIn the meantime, experts advise making the most of the resources you have. \n“We matrix our teams,” said Martin, explaining that one IT pro can support a bigger team of reviewers to make audits more effective.
