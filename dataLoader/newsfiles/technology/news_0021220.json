He added that they would have to get out their Tasers if they wanted him out, repeating it and threatening to throw his drink at officers in order to provoke a fight. \nThe report stated that officers asked Roman to kneel and put his hands over his head. Instead, he swore and threw his Coca-Cola can at them — hitting an officer on the arm. Roman took an aggressive stance before being hit by a Taser. \nHe was charged with battery on a law enforcement officers, resisting officers, theft, and trespassing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T09:31:05.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
