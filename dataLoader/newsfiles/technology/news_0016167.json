Cook didn't reveal a time frame for the change, hinting only that it's \"something we're looking at.\" \nApple declined further comment. \nBut Apple customers can expect their built-in apps to work differently with the iOS 9 update, available on September 16. \n\"[W]e're delivering a completely redesigned Notes app, support for transit in Maps, an all-new News app and new capabilities in Apple Pay,\" the company said in a press release last week. \nPublic transportation options will now show up in Apple Maps, allowing users to get directions via car, train, subway, bus or a combination. The Notes app will allow free-form sketches, be able to snap photos and create checklists. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
