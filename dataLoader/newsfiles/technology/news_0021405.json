The day may be approaching for the Canadian royalty and streaming company as the commodity rout boosts demand for alternative funding.\n“There are so many opportunities out there, we might have to dip into our credit lines,” Chief Executive Officer David Harquail said in an interview last week from his Toronto offices. “The ideal is you lever yourself up at the very bottom of the bear market and hopefully, if you’ve called it right, then you really benefit as the market turns around.”\nStreaming companies like Franco-Nevada, Silver Wheaton Corp. and Royal Gold Inc. give miners upfront payments in exchange for the right to buy metals at a discount in the future. Franco-Nevada also does royalty agreements, tying portions of production to land titles.\nPlunging metal prices, with copper down 26 percent and gold 11 percent in the past year, combined with surging credit costs and volatile stock markets, have made streaming attractive even for majors such as Barrick Gold Corp. and Freeport-McMoRan Inc., giving the business more credibility.\n“It’s something that’s gone from being seen as kind of hokey, to where now every major company and their CFO has to consider it among their financing options,” Harquail said.\nThe company’s shares have risen 18 percent to C$56.29 over the past two years, compared with a 30 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Materials Sector Index.\nUnused Credit Harquail, 58, prides himself on keeping things lean. Overseeing a company valued at C$8.8 billion, he eschews personal assistants, books his own travel and sends his executives to do business armed with subway tokens. “We call those the Franco limos,” he said.\nWith no debt, about $610 million in cash, plus $110 million in marketable equities and an unused line of credit worth about $1 billion, the company has plenty of scope for more deals.\n“Without going back to the equity markets, right now, we’ve got one and a half billion to play with,” Harquail said.\nIn the past three years, mining and metals companies have raised $63 billion in global equity markets, down from $98 billion in the previous three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Although bond sales by the industry are higher this year than last, they are well off the recent 2012 peak of about $120 billion. Yields are near the highest in five years.\nBest Mines Both trends have served Franco-Nevada well and two types of deals have become more common in recent years, Harquail said. Medium-sized producers are turning to royalty and streaming companies for help buying assets from larger miners. Lundin Mining Corp.’s purchase of Freeport McMoRan’s Candelaria copper mine, which Franco-Nevada helped finance in exchange for a gold and silver stream, is a case in point, he said.\nAlso, the largest producers are now willing to sell streams on their most prized assets, Harquail said. “We’re getting the opportunity to bid on some of the best mines in the world.”\nA recent example would be Barrick’s sale of a gold and silver stream on its Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic. Franco-Nevada’s competitor Royal Gold Inc. won that deal.\nAsked whether the competition for such bigger assets is becoming more intense, Harquail was sanguine.\n“Last year we did pretty well all the deals in the business,” he said. “I’m perfectly comfortable if I get one third of the deals. If Silver Wheaton takes a third, and Royal Gold takes a third, there’s more than enough that we can finance ourselves.”\nBidding Tightens The commodities slump isn’t leaving streaming and royalty companies unscathed. When mining projects get delayed Franco-Nevada’s future revenue is also pushed back. Negotiations with First Quantum Minerals Ltd. to finalize a streaming agreement on its Cobre Panama project continue to drag on, though Harquail expects the deal to be done this year.\nIn the meantime, he’ll continue to do small deals -- in order to bag the “one-in-twenty” contract that will “make a future CEO of Franco-Nevada look very good” -- and choose its big targets carefully.\nMore Time The company probably has fallen short of its prediction in January to do more than a billion dollars of deals in 2015, Harquail said. Franco-Nevada has bid on deals worth more than that but lost a number of transactions, he said.\nAmong the failed bids were three $100 million-plus oil and gas royalty deals. In hindsight, missing out might have been a blessing given the price slump, he said. The company is still committed to expanding its energy portfolio and reducing its precious metals exposure to 80 percent from 90 percent.\n“Give us more time and patience, I think then we can get a more rational pricing environment for these assets,” he said.\nFor Related News and Information:\nTop Stories:TOP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T13:49:40.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
