(NYSE: NEWR) announced today that Blinds.com, the world's largest online window covering store, has chosen the New Relic Software Analytics Cloud to get a comprehensive view of their customers' experience and the performance of their e-commerce platform. With New Relic, Blinds.com's development team has been able to get ahead of issues before their customers notice and report them to customer service. \nFounded more than 19 years ago, Blinds.com is the number one online seller of blinds, shutters and shades, which they attribute to making it exciting and easy to buy configurable window coverings online and via mobile devices. With their current e-commerce platform supported by an on-premise and hybrid cloud infrastructure, Blinds.com began looking towards the future and shift to a new e-commerce platform to be hosted entirely on Amazon Web Services. Their development team began looking for a single, integrated monitoring solution to consolidate the variety of existing tools they were using. Blinds.com chose New Relic to give them a comprehensive view of their application performance and customer experience, including: Ease of cloud-based monitoring. With very little to install and no infrastructure requirement to support it, New Relic APM and New Relic Browser were easy for Blinds.com's small development team to get up and running, allowing them to understand their applications' health now and in the future with their new e-commerce platform. Integration with critical tools. New Relic's open APIs enabled the Blinds.com team to easily integrate with PagerDuty, which has allowed them to keep ahead of any issues -- in particular after hours -- and quickly isolate them before they impact customers. Support for agile/DevOps culture. Blinds.com has embraced a startup culture, with the development team allowing groups to self organize with agile and DevOps principles fully integrated throughout the team. New Relic is used throughout the process from developers writing code to load testing, so they can ensure all operational issues are addressed. \nBlinds.com has also extended its use of the New Relic Software Analytics Cloud by using New Relic Insights to help them identify performance issues that weren't captured elsewhere. When the company updated their shopping cart customer experience, they used New Relic Insights to better identify bottlenecks and understand how customers were affected by the intricacies of the new cart. \nSupporting Quotes \"New Relic offers our development team a profound advantage in its ease of use, and their cloud delivery model didn't require us to rent or buy infrastructure to support it,\" said Tom Cabanski, Director of Software Development, Blinds.com. \"We now have a 360-degree view of our operations and insight to deliver the best shopping experience for our customers.\" \n\"New Relic aims to deliver both the monitoring tools -- and the confidence -- to help customers like Blinds.com migrate to Amazon Web Services, and maximize their investment in the cloud,\" said Erica Schultz, EVP, Global Enterprise Sales at New Relic. \"E-commerce leaders like Blinds.com want to understand their customers' experience, and also anticipate issues before they affect sales.\" \nResources Find out how New Relic can help your company's cloud journey and supports DevOps . \nAbout New Relic Software Analytics Cloud The New Relic Software Analytics Cloud is a market-leading multi-tenant SaaS software analytics solution built for modern architectures.
