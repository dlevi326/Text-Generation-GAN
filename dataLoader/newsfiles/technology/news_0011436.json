The subject of the article was Josh Levs , a former CNN reporter who wanted more time off when his third child was born prematurely. At the time, CNN (owned by Time Warner Cable) offered two weeks of paid time off to dads and 12 weeks to moms. Earlier this year, Time Warner Cable changed that policy and equalized the amount of parenting leave available to men and women. This shift recognizes that gender discrimination affects both genders. An employer cannot provide different benefits without a really, really good reason. Discrimination The EEOC successfully intervened in a transgender discrimination case . The plaintiff was terminated after he was required to explain why his driver’s license identified him as female. The EEOC also sued North Memorial Medical Center in Minneapolis, which withdrew a job offer when a Seventh Day Adventist candidate requested an accommodation based on her religion. Microsoft now faces a potential class action lawsuit alleging that the tech giant’s employee ranking system leads to gender discrimination. \nTechnology Facebook is expanding its workplace social network to hundreds of companies. Target will offer its 335,000 employees a Fitbit in an effort to improve employee wellness. HR Grapevine asked if the use of big data should also be the subject of ethics review boards. \nWage and Hour Uber appealed the ruling that gave the driver lawsuit class action status . Petco settled a minimum wage and overtime lawsuit for $8 million. The action was brought by groomers who had been paid under a piece-rate system. A home rental company will pay $400,000 to complete an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor, which found the firm failed to pay overtime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T23:38:59.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
