Rohit Chadda, who recently quit as Foodpanda India managing director, could not be immediately reached for a comment. \nFoodpanda had raised $100 million in funding led by global financial services giant Goldman Sachs in May. That round took the total funding raised by Foodpanda to $310 million. \nQuoting several current and ex-employees, the news report exposed multiple flaws in culture and processes at Foodpanda. It alleged that the platform has been taking orders for fake and non-functioning restaurants. Between March and August, the company is said to have removed nearly 400 fake restaurants from the platform. \nSeveral top management executives have turned a blind eye to these issues given the company’s focus on increasing transactions and hiking valuation, the report said. \nWhile Foodpanda claims to have 12,000 restaurants on it network, the news report claimed otherwise. “So it is an open secret that out of these 12,000 restaurants, there are not more than 2,000 which actually generate most of the business,” the report said, quoting an unnamed company official. \nFoodpanda is said to have awarded its ad campaign contract of about Rs 3 crore to a company named Crazy Boyz Entertainment Pvt which apparently belonged to Chadda, his brother and another person. \nChadd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T02:06:44.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
