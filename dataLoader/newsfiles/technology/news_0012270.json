Two more people were confirmed dead on Wednesday in the massive wildfires raging through northern California, with authorities expressing hope that rain and cooler temperatures will allow firefighters to gain the upper hand.\nThe two victims, one of whom was identified as a 67-year-old man, were discovered at their homes in the Sierra Nevada Foothills after failing to heed a mandatory evacuation order, deputy Calaveras County coroner Keith Rosa told AFP. \nAuthorities said a search was under way for more possible victims from the two fires -- the so-called Valley and Butte fires -- that have raged through the region, destroying more than 800 homes and displacing 23,000 people. \nThe body of an elderly disabled woman was discovered earlier this week in the ruins of her home in Lake County. \nRainfall on Wednesday was expected to offer a reprieve for thousands of firefighters battling the flames. \n\"With cooler weather and rain in the forecast, that should aid firefighters on the fire line today,\" Cal Fire field battalion chief Mike Smith told AFP. \n\"We are trying to make as much progress today as we can because a different weather pattern is supposed to move in tomorrow. \n\"Heat is expected to return, along with wind, and that could change the situation.\" \nLynnette Round, a spokeswoman with CalFire, said some people were being allowed back into their homes to retrieve medication, check on their belongings or their livestock but an evacuation order was still in force. \nThe Valley fire, described as one of the most destructive to hit the drought-stricken western United Sates, has charred more than 70,000 acres (28,000 hectares) -- an area almost three times the size of Paris -- destroyed 585 homes and displaced 13,000 people, fire officials said. \nThe fire by Wednesday afternoon was 30 percent contained while the Butte Fire, which burned nearly 72,000 acres, was 47 percent contained. \nBut despite the welcome rainfall, rescuers are bracing for more wildfires as temperatures are expected to rise again at the weekend. \nThe fires have been fueled by a long-running drought and high winds, spreading at an astonishing speed that has even surprised seasoned firefighters. \nSimilar fires have been raging across several states in the west of the country, including Washington and Oregon, stretching resources. \nPresident Barack Obama expressed concern about the fires on Wednesday in a phone call to California Governor Jerry Brown. \nThe White House said Obama \"expressed his gratitude for the brave firefighters, local authorities, and emergency managers who have worked tirelessly to combat these devastating fires and evacuate people out of harm's way.\" \nOfficials say the wildfires in several states, which have mobilized 30,000 firefighters from across the country, could be the costliest on record with more than $1.23 billion spent so far. \nMark Ghilarducci, the California emergency services chief, said assessment teams were being sent out into the worst affected areas in order to have the state qualify for federal disaster funds. \n\"We have all these people sitting in evacuation shelters,\" he said, adding that hundreds had been left homeless by the fires. \nFor two days straight, with barely time for sleep, Ron Earls and his team of firefighters battled a monster blaze this week that spread out of control in a small California town. \n\"We were out here for almost 50 hours,\" Earls told AFP, standing amid still-smoldering ruins of homes consumed by the flames in Middletown, in Lake County. \n\"The adrenaline kicks in and you are not that tired,\" added Earls, soot streaking his face and coating his flame-resistant yellow jumpsuit. \nA member of his crew hefted a large axe as they doused hot spots and hacked away charred beams at risk of falling. \nThe so-called Valley Fire, one of the worst wildfires in California history, destroyed more than 500 homes and displaced thousands after it erupted on Saturday, stunning even seasoned firefighters as it spread at lightning speed, whipped by high winds. \nSimilar wildfires have waged a relentless campaign in the drought-stricken western United States this year, mobilizing some 30,000 firefighters, National Guard units and rescuers from across the country. \nBeyond the millions of acres consumed by the flames that have killed three residents in California, firefighters in the region have paid a steep price with several killed in the line of duty. \n- Relentless infernos - \nThe grueling battle with the wildfires have also left firefighters physically weary, emotionally drained, and hoping for an early start to a soggy rainy season. \n\"We have had multiple major fires this year with very few breaks in between,\" CalFire incident commander Barry Biermann told AFP. \n\"Our firefighters are getting tired. Fatigue is always a factor.\" \nBefore getting the call for help in battling the Valley Fire, Earls spent 41 days fighting a different wildfire. That blaze was in steep canyons that had filled with smoke, making breathing difficult. \n\"We had three days off and we were already itching to get back out there,\" Earls, who is based near Los Angeles, said with a nod to other members of his team. \n\"People really do love this job.\" \nTeams typically work 21-day stints, on fire lines for 24 hours straight followed by a day off. Fires can be in regions so remote that firefighters grab what sleep they can at base camps instead of trying to make it to the comfort of a hotel bed. \n\"Working in these environments and moving from fire to fire is exhausting,\" CalFire battalion chief Mike Smith told AFP. \n- Always on guard - \nFour firefighters from a helicopter crew were hospitalized this week after the flames turned on them. \n\"You always try to keep a heads-up. You keep a lookout,\" Earls said. \n\"Unfortunately, things happen and people are caught off guard.\" \nWhile firefighters can't train for sleep deprivation, they train to handle punishing heat and the rigors of days spent on scorching, smoky, rugged terrain. \n\"We train like the army,\" Fernando Herrera of CalFire told AFP. \nFirefighters also face the emotional stress of knowing their own families must fend for themselves, and of comforting people who have lost their pets, or livestock. \nAt least eight firefighters have lost their own homes to the flames. \n\"I don't think that it will hit some of these individuals until this is over and they sit down and think about what they just went through,\" Biermann said. \nCalFire battalion chief Paul Duncan was at a fire in the town of Cobb about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from his home when his own house burned to the ground. \n\"I would have gone to Cobb even if I'd known the outcome at my own home,\" Duncan said. \n\"Of course, I would have loaded up my truck with more things and gotten my family out of there sooner.\" \nFirefighters are hoping cooler temperatures and rain expected on Wednesday will deliver a knock-out blow to the Valley Fire before the weather shifts back to hot, dry and windy conditions during the weekend. \n\"We are not out of the woods yet,\" chief Smith said. \n\"We are still in a very dangerous situation.\" .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T16:17:43.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
