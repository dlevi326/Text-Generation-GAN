That's also the name of Apple's pressure-based touchscreen technology, which is featured on the Apple Watch and will reportedly be included on the new iPhone.\nThe Android-based smartphone was unveiled today at IFA in Berlin. It features a 5.5-inch AMOLED display, with a full metal shell and curved back, but most notable are its user interaction components. The Mate S includes an upgraded fingerprint scanner and \"Knuckle Sense\" technology, first introduced in the P8, which lets users switch between apps using their knuckles.
