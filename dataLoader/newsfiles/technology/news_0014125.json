Located in Provo, Utah, about 43 miles south of Salt Lake City, PCSD is one of 41 public school districts in the state and serves approximately 14,200 students. The district operates traditional high schools, middle schools and elementary schools, as well as an alternative high school and a web-based school that serves all grade levels. PCSD is recognized as one of the 5 largest school districts in the greater Salt Lake City area and has built a reputation as being one of the best in Utah. With classrooms, labs and offices occupying space in 23 buildings, securing all facilities and grade levels continues to be a main priority and a significant challenge for PCSD. The school received a federal grant for improving their security measures, however it came with tight time constraints. The funding had to be used within the year, which left limited time for the school to complete the security upgrade. Over 120 doors needed to be secured within a seventy-five day window; the deadline was to have everything installed and operational when the students and staff returned to school in September. On average the project consisted of securing 4 doors per day until the job was completed which is a key benefit of the ISONAS solution; a simpler and easier product leads to a faster installation timeline. “With the ISONAS access control solution only a PowerNet ™ Reader-Controller and a standard category cable is required, allowing for a simpler and easier install. This simple install process allowed PCSD to ensure that all doors were secured within the tight time constraints. We are happy to help the Provo school district open the door to the new school year with confidence,” states Rob Mossman, CEO at ISONAS.\nWorking closely with the administrators and network engineers at PCSD allowed ISONAS to recommend the right solution for each building. ISONAS’s network-based PowerNet™ IP Reader-Controller offers a patented technology that easily integrates with Windows-based software to deliver more simplicity, greater value, and total flexibility. ISONAS offers the industry’s first panel-free IP reader controller which delivers pure IP technology to the door because the only equipment needed is a PowerNet™ Reader Controller and a standard category 5 cable to each door. In addition, to the PowerNet™ IP readers, PCSD is using the ISONAS DBCrystal Matrix software from a centralized location to manage all 23 buildings. This provides administrators the ability to “lock down” the buildings from their access control system.\n“We chose ISONAS because we didn't want to have to run proprietary cables everywhere and manage 23 separate locations. With the ISONAS Pure IP access control solution, it's all centrally managed from one location and we were able to use our existing network infrastructure. We already had PoE (Power over Ethernet) switches and the cabling ready, which made it a smart decision for us to go with ISONAS,” states Jonathan Smith, Network Engineer at Provo City School District. PCSD made the right choice with ISONAS to help keep complications to a minimum and implement a seamless access control system that integrated with their current infrastructure.\nAbout ISONAS Inc.\nISONAS Inc. is leading the security industry by changing the game in access control technology.
