Picture: GCIS Related articles Mantashe deals the cards ANC is playing UNTIL some columnists actually corroborate their claims with evidence, their views may be interpreted as political slander against some politicians.\nAnthony Butler commits political slander ( Mantashe deals cards ANC is playing , September 25) by labelling African Union Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as a conservative politician and African National Congress treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize as a \"patronage politician\".\nHe produces no shred of evidence, nor does he define what make politicians conservative or patronage-driven so that readers can judge their behaviour.\nThis is inexcusable and the defence often raised by columnists that column space is restrictive is no licence to discredit politicians without proof. To persist with such shoddy and shady analysis, columnists such as Prof Butler gradually lose the status of being objective pundits and become biased promoters of politicians they favour. Would it be slanderous for anyone to argue that Prof Butler’s negative analysis of Dr Dlamini-Zuma and Dr Mkhize are intended to promote Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa about whom Prof Butler has written a book and therefore has a direct self-interest in his political future? It looks like Prof Butler is part of \"the incipient revolt\" against leaders who may emerge to contest Mr Ramaphosa in 2017.\nProf Butler’s analysis of ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe is equally problematic and unconvincing, as he does not explain why Mr Mantashe would be keen \"to ensure that KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo cannot constitute coherent voting blocs at the ANC’s elective conference in 2017\". What is undemocratic about coherent voting blocs? Is Mr Mantashe a divisive figure who stands to benefit from disunity in certain provinces? If Prof Butler’s answer is yes, he cunningly tarnishes the reputation of Mr Mantashe. Why and for whose benefit?\nNdaba Mzelemu\nBhobhoyi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:36:56.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
