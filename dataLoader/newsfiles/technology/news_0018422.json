Get the Biz Briefing newsletter!\nGreenberg also disputed Venditto's claim on Tuesday that if the town terminated its agreements with Singh without cause, it would owe nothing at Tobay Beach and up to $2 million at the golf course.\n\"It's contrary to all the recent and current agreements,\" Greenberg said. The payments to Singh would be based on the amount of capital improvements he made at the facilities, which town officials said last year amounted to $11.7 million.\nGreenberg said Singh's companies are current in their payments to the town and that he expects they will continue their long-term concession agreements.\nAt the meeting, Hicksville resident Paul Molinari, 66, said he was \"very disturbed [by news reports] that town employees in their official capacity have been accused of accepting travel paid by a contractor . . . and negotiating agreements more favorable to the contractor than to the town . . . In town government, the buck stops with you, Mr. Supervisor, and the town board.\"\nNassau Complete coverage Venditto defended the town's limited responses on Singh, saying \"outside agencies\" are looking into the matter, which could involve \"very significant litigation.\"\nHe added, \"There's a way you need to do things, and sometimes being quiet and doing it the professional and the right way to protect your residents is much more difficult than standing up and pounding your chest,\" Venditto said. He also said residents should \"allow for the possibility that the town might have been victimized,\" but he did not elaborate.\nHe referred to a deputy town attorney as a \"bad apple\" whose actions should not affect residents' view of their board. Deputy Town Attorney Frederick Mei figures prominently in documents obtained by Newsday that show he was involved in negotiations over the town's backstops for Singh and took a trip paid for by the businessman.\nA call to Mei on Tuesday was not returned.\nOyster Bay Democrats have seized on the Singh issue, last week calling for the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether the town violated disclosure laws over the financial backstops.\nRobert Freier, an executive recruiter from Woodbury and Democratic candidate for town board, tried to ask the board Tuesday how they had voted on them, but Town Attorney Leonard Genova advised board members not to answer due to potential litigation.\nThe town board on Tuesday retroactively hired the firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP beginning on May 1 to represent it in the Singh matters but did not disclose what it was being paid.\nThe latest LI business news in your inbox daily.
