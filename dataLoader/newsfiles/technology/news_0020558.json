They also sold his personal details, which eventually went to rogue companies.\nRae’s son Chris told the Daily Mail his father had lost £35,000 to scams.\nThe information commissioner, Christopher Graham, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that his office would be investigating the claims.\n“If there’s any connection between the good work that charities do and the scam merchants, that’s very concerning and we’ve got to get to the bottom of how this information was passed on,” he said. “If the law has been broken, we will take action.”\nRae is believed to have completed a lifestyle survey in 1994 in which he neglected to tick a box saying his details should not be passed on. From there, his data passed to various charities and other companies, ending up on lists circulated by known scammers, the Daily Mail investigation found.\n“Whether or not Samuel Rae ticked the box in 1994 and is still being plagued with unwanted mail and unwanted approaches is beside the point,” Graham said. “The Data Protection Act is very clear: the very first principle is that your data is only processed fairly and lawfully. What’s described in the papers this morning doesn’t look like that.”\nRae’s failure to tick the box was not an excuse, he said. “It isn’t consent and it doesn’t give you the right to trade in people’s personal information years after the event.”\nBut Graham advised against tarring the entire sector with the same brush.\n“There’s a danger here of blackening a whole sector. Charities seem to be becoming the new dirty word, and that clearly isn’t fair.”\nThe PDSA, which “provides free veterinary services for the pets of needy owners”, was alleged to have sold Rae’s details 10 times but said it was not in breach of data protection rules.\nThe widower’s son said he was concerned about the number of times charities had contacted his father even when he asked them to stop, naming the RSPCA as one which persisted with his father for five years. The charity has apologised.\nThe government commissioned a review into charity fundraising after Britain’s longest-serving poppy seller, 92-year-old Olive Cooke, killed herself . She was receiving up to 267 letters a month and repeat phone calls from charities asking for money. The inquest into her death made no mention of that as a contributing factor to her death, finding she had depression, insomnia and breast cancer.", "external_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3217506/New-shame-charities-Widower-s-details-passed-200-times-leading-lose-35-000-getting-731-demands-cash.html", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34111788"], "published": "2015-09-01T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T13:47:07.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
