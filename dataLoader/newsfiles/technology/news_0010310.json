I truly admire the beauty of its untouched sands.”\nThe image was seen by the technology giant after Ms Fortes posted it on Instagram with the hashtag #shotoniphone6.\nShe said she was delighted to have her work chosen.\n“I was already the fan of their campaign. It is simple but the engagement from people is massive,” she said.\n“I mostly use my iPhone 6 for the photos that I post on Instagram so I hashtag them a lot. They were interested in two of my photos and finally chose Rub Al Khali.”\nThe image has been displayed on billboards in 70 cities in 25 countries, including the UAE, as well as in magazine adverts.\nMs Fortes has exhibited her photos in various shows in Sharjah and Dubai.\nWhile she draws inspiration from many sources, she said Liwa was still her favourite spot.\n“Liwa as the second-largest sand desert in the world. Most of its dunes are untouched. There is no doubt that Liwa and its golden crystal-like sands caught the attention of Apple and included it in their award winning campaign.”\nIn March, a black-and-white camera-phone photo of a bridge in Dubai’s International Financial Centre, taken by Dubai resident Hattan Ahmed, was chosen for the campaign. The shot by the 27-year-old, a graphic designer and photographer, appeared on billboards in Los Angeles, New York and Tokyo.\nakhaishgi@thenational.ae", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T06:14:46.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
