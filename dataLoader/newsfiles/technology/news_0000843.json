Of course, this is still no guarantee that the user will choose to watch the entire video. But the option is likely to make advertisers happy. \nFacebook, which started showing mobile ads in 2012, views video as the next frontier in advertising. The company says the new buying option will be available for every type of ad, including text, photo and video. \nFacebook also formed a partnership with analytics company Moat to measure the effectiveness of video ads, including how many people watch them and for how long. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T05:22:37.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
