However the product's introduction has been delayed by a legal dispute between Amgen and Novartis.\nNovartis hasn't announced a price for Zarxio. In Europe, where biosimilars have been available for several years, they typically cost 15% to 30% less than the original brands.\nThe dispute began when Amgen filed a lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco last year, accusing Novartis of failing to disclose certain information about its copycat product to Amgen, which the U.S. firm said was required under the new criteria for FDA approval of biosimilars. Amgen also alleged Zarxio would infringe upon a patent for Neupogen. Novartis denies the allegations.\nWrite to Neil MacLucas at neil.maclucas@wsj.com\nSeptember 03, 2015 03:45 ET (07:45 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T17:04:43.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
