Built on the same platform used for BMW’s 2 Series Active Tourer, the car is 36mm shorter, 21mm wider and 53mm higher than its predecessor, giving it a more prominent stance that is emphasised by bolder visual styling. The roof is longer and the bonnet shorter, due to the change from a longitudinally to a transversely mounted engine. This and a wheelbase extended by 90mm frees up more interior space and in the rear seats this can be increased by titling and sliding the seats.\nThe bootspace is 505 litres, which is 85 more than on the Mk1 model, and with the rear seats folded – achievable electrically by a button in the boot – this jumps to 1,550 litres.\nThere will be a five-strong engine choice from launch, a 2.0-litre petrol engine in 189 and 228bhp varieties and a new 2-litre diesel offered with 148, 187 or 228bhp. The entry-level X1 sDrive 18d will be supplied fitted with a six-speed manual gearbox, all the other models using an eight-speed auto. The new X1 will be offered in both front and all-wheel-drive versions – the previosu model being rear or AWD.\nBuyers will not have to wait long after the show to try the new X1 – it will go on sale on 24 th October, at prices ranging from £26,780 to £36,060.\nPhoto: Newspress\n ", "external_links": ["http://uno3s41zr1g29mjw2f9dkf1b.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1509_BMW_X1_.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-16T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:27:16.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
