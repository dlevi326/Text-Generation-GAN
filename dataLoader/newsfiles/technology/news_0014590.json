(PRWEB) September 21, 2015\nCubic Global Defense (CGD), a business of Cubic Corporation ( NYSE: CUB ), today announced it was awarded new contract orders worth nearly $20 million for its Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System Individual Weapon Systems (I-MILES IWS) from the U.S. Army’s Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI). I-MILES IWS is integral to the quality of home-station training as it offers improvements to realism during training.\nI-MILES IWS uses laser emitters that attach to military weapons and on-body sensors to replicate combat and records data for later review. The user-friendly system features small, lightweight components for individual soldiers. It requires less time to attach Small Arms Transmitters (SAT) and align a weapon than previous versions, and maintains alignment during an entire exercise.\n“No one really knows what the future of war fighting will look like, therefore there’s a need to have a balanced and full range of capabilities to better prepare our soldiers for any condition and environment,” said Bill Toti, president of Cubic Global Defense. “With our adaptive training equipment, soldiers can make better use of training time by spending less on setup and calibration, and more on tactics to ensure that they are receiving the most realistic experience before being placed in an actual war environment.”\nCubic’s I-MILES IWS keeps pace with advancements in technology as they are flexible, upgradeable and interoperable. It is also the U.S. Army’s latest generation tactical engagement simulation system in use today.\n# # #\nAbout Cubic Corporation\nCubic Corporation designs, integrates and operates systems, products and services focused in the transportation, defense training and secure communications markets.
