When her mother confiscated her mobile phone, she discovered that her daughter had a girlfriend.\nThe petition said the parents first indulged in verbal and physical violence to \"fix\" her. When that did not work, they brought her to India on the pretext of visiting her ailing grandmother on July 24, to return on August 5.\nOnce here, the parents took away her passport and Green Card and told her that she would stay in India and \"learn to be a proper girl\", the plea said.\nThe petition said that in July, the girl, who was studying neurobiology at the University of California, was \"forcibly\" enrolled at Dayalbagh Educational Institute in Agra and told to \"keep her mouth shut\" about her gender preference and sexual orientation.\nLeft with no option, she approached for help from the National Centre for Lesbian Rights in the US which put her in touch with LGBT activists in India.\nOn September 10, she left the institute in Agra and came to Delhi with the help of activists of an NGO that works for the rights of transgender persons.\nThe petitioner, who along with her parents had migrated to California when she was three years old, alleged that her parents were trying to coerce her into getting married to a man of their choice.\nIt also stated that they had registered a false FIR for kidnapping against the activists who helped her reach Delhi.\nShe alleged that on September 21, UP Police personnel raided the residences of two activists in south Delhi without any search warrants to find her, and also detained an activist for over six hours at Kalkaji police station in south Delhi.\nThe plea has also sought the release of her travel documents and \"safe passage\" to the US. She also sought protection for the activists who have helped her.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T06:27:47.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
