PTI previously reported that Japan was edging out China as the stronger competitor for building the 18-metre-deep port, which is set to begin construction in 2016. \nMustafa Kamal, Planning Minister of the Bangladeshi government, said: \"Matarbari is designed in such a way that it will be comprehensive, with power plants, an LNG terminal and a port. Matarbari is sufficient, we may have to give up the other port project.”\nMustafa Kamal added that the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) had offered 80% financing on good terms, which includes the port complex in Matarbari, as well as four coal-fired power plants.\nThe project is of global importance due to its connection with China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative, with the port providing a key gateway for growing trade in and out of Bangladesh. Bangladesh is currently one of the world’s biggest exporters of garments.\nJapan recently begun trade talks with Turkmenistan for the investment and development of the Port of Turkmenbashi. \nThe Turkmenistan project is anticipated to be completed in 2016.\nFor all the latest on Bangladesh, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T18:46:20.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
