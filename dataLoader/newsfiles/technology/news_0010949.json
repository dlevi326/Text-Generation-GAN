Texas Christian University Horned Frogs [caption id=\"attachment_675\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] (Left: Julius Csotonyi; Right:Ethan Miller/Getty Images )[/caption]TCU's mascot, the horned frog, isn't actually a frog at all, but a colloquial name given to horned lizards of the genus Phrynosoma . Living Phrynosoma are a good choice for a scary mascot as they are actually quite frightening little lizards--they have the ability to spurt blood from their eyes when threatened. Horned lizards are a member of the iguana group, making them a relative of the recently described Gueragama , an 80 million year old lizard from South America. This lizard co-existed with flying reptiles like pterosaurs and mighty dinosaurs. University of Alabama's Big Al [caption id=\"attachment_678\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] (Top: Wikimedia Commons by Ninjatacoshell, CC-BY 3.0; Bottom: Lance King/Getty Images)[/caption]Also known as the \"Crimson Tide\", Bama's Big Al the elephant is the animal embodiment of their mascot. In the past though, not all elephants were big--looking at the fossil record of their relatives there was a significant amount of dwarfing when they lived on islands such as Malta and Crete. Palaeoloxodon falconeri is an extinct pygmy elephant from the island of Sicily that only grew to be about 3 feet in height. Today, small elephants still exist in Borneo , but at 10 feet tall, would have looked enormous next to P. falconeri . University of Maryland \"Terps\" [caption id=\"attachment_679\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] Left:Mitchell Layton/Getty Images; Right: Ghedoghedo[/caption]The Maryland \"Terps\" or terrapins have had the unofficial rally cry of \"Fear the Turtle\" for over a decade now. Their mascot does resemble a rather fearsome fossil turtle called Meiolania . At over 8 feet long, Meiolania survived from the Oligocene (23 million years ago) until about 3000 years ago in Australia and surrounding islands until it was likely hunted to extinction by humans. Despite its scary forehead horns and armored tail, Meiolania was a gentle plant eater. Georgia Institute of Technology Yellow Jackets [caption id=\"attachment_680\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] (Left: Michael Chang/Getty Images; Right: Science/AAAS)[/caption]One of the few insect mascots, Georgia Tech's mascot, Buzz, represents yellow jackets and stinging insects that have been around on this planet for at least 100 million years. This fossil bee was found in a Myanmar amber mine in 2006. Melittosphex burmensis shares many features with wasps, confirming bees did in fact evolve from wasps. University of Connecticut Huskies [caption id=\"attachment_681\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] Top:Brian Ciancio/ZUMA/Newscom; Bottom: Mauricio Anton[/caption]While a husky is large and fluffy, the earliest fossil dogs were quite small and sleek, like a mongoose. Hesperocyon was one of the earliest fossil dogs and is at least 37 million years old. It was not extremely powerful like modern dogs, as body mass estimates indicate it was probably only about 4 pounds. As a recent study showed though , as climate changed in the western US, dogs adapted their limb shape and hunting style to become much more reliant on long and short distance sprinting. The larger dog depicted above is Sunkahetanka , a 30 million year old hyper-carnivorous dog that had teeth designed to crush bones. Oregon State University Beavers [caption id=\"attachment_682\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] (Left: William Mancebo/Getty Images; Right: Charles R. Knight)[/caption]Beavers have been inhabiting Oregon for at least 28 million years according to recent findings. University of Oregon scientists discovered a new species of small , ancient beaver in Oregon just this year, the first beaver fossil ever discovered in the state. Other giant beavers were roaming America during the Pleistocene--species from the genus Castoroides could grow up to over 7 feet long. Although from the shape of their incisors, it appears Castoroides did not make dams. University of Florida Gators [caption id=\"attachment_683\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] (Left: Jorge Gonzales; Right:Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)[/caption]Crocodylomorphs are the earliest relatives of modern day crocodiles and alligators. Earlier this year, s cientists from North Carolina announced the discovery of Carnufex carolinensis , or the \"butcher of Carolina\". This 9 foot tall crocodile likely walked on two legs and terrorized the Triassic ecosystem over 230 million years ago. Stanford University's \"Stanford Tree\" [caption id=\"attachment_684\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] (Left: Jon Sullivan; Right:Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images)[/caption]While their official mascot is the cardinal, the Stanford Tree , a member of the marching band, has become one of the most popular \"mascots\" in the nation. Over in Arizona though, petrified trees are another popular attraction. Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona is home to some of the most beautiful and colorful petrified trees in the world. These trees were likely knocked down in Triassic river beds then buried by volcanic ash, giving them their amazing colors.[gallery2012]", "external_links": ["http://phys.org/news/2015-06-fossils-previously-unknown-beaver-species.html", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Tree", "http://phys.org/news/2015-03-crocodile-ancestor-predator-dinosaurs-roamed.html", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrified_Forest_National_Park", "http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/borneo-pygmy-elephant"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T22:44:01.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
