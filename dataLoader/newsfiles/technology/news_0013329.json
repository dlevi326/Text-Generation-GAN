InvoTech is recognized globally for implementing systems and solutions that save companies time, labor and money.\nInvoTech selected for Wind Creek Hospitality properties based on performance\n“Wind Creek Hospitality installed InvoTech’s UHF-RFID Uniform Management System at its Wind Creek Wetumpka Hotel & Casino in 2013. The system proved to be a good fit for our operation,” said Rick Shuford, human resources director for Wind Creek Hospitality’s northern Alabama properties. “We selected InvoTech to be in all our properties because it reduces labor and loss expenses by automating our entire uniform management process from dirty garment drop off to clean uniform pick-up. InvoTech works perfectly with our White Conveyors uniform delivery system.”\nThe InvoTech UHF-RFID Uniform System will track and provide automated reports on uniforms for approximately 700 team members. Wind Creek Hospitality properties use a White Conveyors U-Pick-It System that automatically delivers the correct clean uniform items to staff. InvoTech communicates with the delivery system to simplify and automate each property’s operation by tracking when staff members retrieve their uniform with their employee ID card. The efficient process means the casinos’ uniform accounting is accurate without the added expense of manual processes and recordkeeping.\n“Wind Creek Hospitality recognized that having the same efficient uniform system and processes at each of its properties makes it easy for team members to move between locations without additional training,” said Oswald Lares, director of sales and marketing for InvoTech Systems. “Property team members each have a RFID employee ID card that InvoTech’s system reads to track uniform delivery, laundry processes, and the number of cleaning cycles so managers can accurately budget for replacement costs.”\nSelf-reliance and responsible governance are the main goals of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians. Revenue created from Tribal Gaming allows the Tribe to provide crucial services such as education, child and elder care, cultural preservation, health care, police and fire protection, and housing.\nInvoTech’s international clients include Four Seasons Macau; Venetian Macau Resort; MGM Grand Macau; Hyatt Shanghai, China; Burswood Entertainment Complex, Australia; Sheraton Seoul, Korea; Resorts World Sentosa Singapore; and Palace Resorts, Mexico.
