The company is selling off its stake in Asian e-commerce giant Alibaba. AP by Marco della Cava Yahoo will spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba without waiting to hear whether the Internal Revenue Service will allow the transaction to be tax-free.\nThe internet company's Monday filing noted that it would sell its 15 per cent stake in Alibaba, valued at $US23 billion, by the end of the year. The news sent Yahoo stock up 3 per cent to $US28.51 in after hours trading, after it closed down 5 per cent on the day.\nYahoo had asked for a so-called \"private letter ruling\" from the IRS a few weeks ago, confirming the tax-free status of the sale. The IRS declined to provide such a ruling.\nA tax-free deal, which will be spun off into a separate company along with its existing small business unit, would stand to return considerably more to shareholders.\nYahoo acknowledged that it was still awaiting \"a legal opinion with respect to the tax-free treatment of the transaction under U.S. federal tax laws and regulations,\" in its filing on Monday, but it didn't specify how it would react should the IRS not grant the spinoff tax-free status.\nThe US federal tax collection agency along with the treasury department have acknowledged they are debating new rules for precisely this type of transaction, which may well be what is creating a sense of optimism at Yahoo that a decision may yet go its way.\nUSA Today\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:21:40.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
