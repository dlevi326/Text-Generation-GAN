Earlier this year, Applied Data secured a $50 million line of credit from Chicago’s Victory Park Capital to fund loans.\nGopinathan, co-founder of Global Analytics, the San Diego parent company of Lending Stream in the United Kingdom, believes there’s void in the middle of the lending market for customers who are rejected for bank loans because they have a credit blemish or a thin credit history.\n”For people in this category, the options are do without the money or drop way down into payday lending land, with much higher interest rates and smaller loan amounts,” he said. \nSo his company uses alternative data to augment the credit bureau data.\n“These days there is more and more alternative data available,” Gopinathan said.\nFor example, a loan applicant lists employment as delivering pizza, which wouldn’t look promising to a lender.\nBy pulling data from the applicant’s Facebook and LinkedIn accounts, however, Applied Data might discover that the applicant is a fourth year engineering student who recently interned at major companies. \n“If you look at the bigger picture with all this additional data, we will get a more informed view of the customer, which enables us to potentially offer larger loan amounts, lower (interest rates) and longer terms,” said Gopinathan.\nApplied Data, which has raised $10 million in equity financing, joins DealStruck, LoanHero and Global Analytics in San Diego’s growing financial technology landscape. DealStruck offers online small business loans, while LoanHero offers a platform that makes it easier for shoppers to get in-store credit quickly.\nSo far, Applied Data’s consumer brand, Personify Financial, is available in two states – Missouri and Georgia. The company expects to gain regulatory approval in 48 states early next year through a partnership with a bank.\nGlobal Analytics has originated more than $300 million in loans over the past decade in England. He left the company just over a year ago to launch Applied Data.\nHe was also on the team of engineers that developed FICO’s Falcon fraud detection software in the 1990s. It uses pattern recognition algorithms to help credit card companies and banks flag bogus transactions. \nWith Applied Data, Gopinathan applied similar techniques to software that accesses credit risk. Applied Data does not compete with Global Analytics because it operates in the U.S. and targets a different customer base, said Gopinathan.\n“There is a clear market need for unsecured finance that few players in the industry are structured to provide,” said Bob Conrads, co-founder of Colchis Capital Management, in a statement. “We believe Krishna and the management team at ADF, with over 20 years of experience in predictive analytics and data science, have a formula that will allow the company to become a leader in the field.”\nMike Freeman   More from Mike Freeman Everyone Counts pulls in $20 million Applied Data taps social media to predict credit worthiness ViaSat looks to offer in-flight Wi-Fi to Boeing customers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T08:50:39.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
