For almost 20 years, Family Reach has tackled the often overlooked financial devastation of cancer, offering a lifeline to parents who can no longer afford to pay their everyday bills as they care for a sick child. The app, available now on iOS and soon on Google Play, allows the public to have an immediate impact on a family that is struggling financially by helping to pay their rent, utilities, car payments, grocery bill, and more. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150915/266912 \nOn top of the emotional devastation they face when a child is diagnosed with cancer, many families quickly find themselves in financial trouble as they struggle to pay not only medical expenses but simple, everyday bills. The problem is exacerbated if a parent has to quit or work fewer hours to focus on their child's care. A recent study from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center showed that cancer patients are 2.5x more likely to go bankrupt. In addition, financial issues related to transportation can create a barrier to care for many families, often preventing them from adhering to their child's treatment plan. \nWith Family Reach Give, anyone can securely find, follow, share and support a family in need. Family Reach Give features family profiles, with photos and stories as well as a list of available bills to help pay. Users can choose to pay an entire bill, or donate another amount to help with the payments overall. Working with its 30+ hospital partners across the country, Family Reach ensures that every family is carefully vetted and certified, and that 100 percent of every donation is sent directly to the vendors to quickly pay a family's bills. Unlike other public crowdfunding platforms related to personal health issues, recipients will not incur any fees for being featured or pay taxes as a result of the donations. \n\"Every day, many families fighting cancer are faced with the choice of putting dinner on the table or paying for their child's cancer treatment. That's an impossible choice that no one should have to make,\" said Carla Tardif, Executive Director of Family Reach Foundation. \"Family Reach has dedicated itself to working with hospitals who identify families in need to make sure no one has to worry about how to pay for heat or groceries. With the Give app, everyone can join us in our mission to help these families in need.\" \nAs an added incentive, users in Family Reach Give earn \"Karma points\" for every donation they make, with each dollar translating to one Karma point. Karma levels are Good (0-249 points), Great (250-499), and Awesome (500+). Once users reach Great Karma, their donation is matched dollar for dollar by one of Family Reach's corporate sponsors; for Awesome Karma, sponsors kick in a 150% match. Additional Karma points can be earned through activity in the app, such as inviting friends, sharing family stories, and more. Current sponsors include Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Discovery Networks, and My Pillow Pets. \nThe Family Reach Give app was conceived and developed, as a pro-bono engagement by Eveo , a full-service health and wellness agency, rooted in innovation and technology. \n\"The Give App is the best expression of what technology can do for good. Now anyone can directly help another family just via an app,\" said Olivier Zitoun, founder of Eveo. \"It's not crowdfunding, it's crowdcaring!\" \nEveo worked alongside Family Reach to create an easier way for donations to get to families in need, while sharing their stories and experiences. Download the Family Reach Give app from the App Store today, or visit Family Reach Foundation at www.familyreach.org for more information. \nAbout Family Reach Foundation: \nFamily Reach Foundation is a financial lifeline to families fighting cancer.
