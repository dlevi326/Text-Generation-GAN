The online map is based on findings that the scientists published last month in the journal PLoS One. The study is based on hourly air quality measurements from 1,500 sites across China and Hong Kong over a four month period last year. During that period (April to August 2014), 92 percent of China's population experienced more than 120 hours of \"unhealthy air,\" based on US standards, while 38 percent were exposed to average concentrations that were unhealthy. Authors Robert Rohde and Richard Muller, of the research organization Berkeley Earth, calculated that outdoor air pollution...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T15:03:27.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
