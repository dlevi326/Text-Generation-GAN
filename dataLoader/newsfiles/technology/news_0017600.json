Ideally, a fifth member of this team would focus on training lawyers and staff to be more security-conscious. \nPonemon estimates about 10 percent of law firms of this size actually do have a cybersecurity program staffed in this manner, which can cost millions of dollars annually. \nLaw firms that don’t have the resources for this level of oversight may still be able to improve cybersecurity without spending a lot of money, Charles Carmakal of FireEye tells the legal publication. \nMany use the same administrative password for all systems, which is not recommended, he said. And lawyers eager to bring in business need to be more cautious about opening email attachments, which may be the bearer of malware.
