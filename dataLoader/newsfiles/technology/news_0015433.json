The technology helps doctors treat patients with brain tumors, but the new toy is a little more up to date. \nDr. Steve Johnson and the oncology team at Archbold have treated more than 900 tumors since they received the previous version of the technology, known as the C4, in 2003. Thanks to the new upgrade, the Gamma Knife Perfection will now help them fight those battles even more efficiently. \nDr. Johnson is the Director of Radiology Oncology. He said the $3 million machine can treat tumors anywhere from the neck up, with a half a millimeter accuracy. \n\"It doesn’t get better when it comes to treatment. This is the ultimate in brain tumor treatment,\" Johnson said. \nDoctors at the hospital told Eyewitness News, in such a rural area, a machine like this isn't seen often, but it's very necessary. \n\"If you don’t have one in a rural setting, our folks are not going to travel to Atlanta. Some will, but some will just say no I’m not going and would take an inferior treatment,\" Johnson said. \nDr. Gerald Neil Kadis, is a neurosurgeon at Archbold. He explained that with advancements like these, they can treat patients anywhere from 20 minutes to a few hours, and then send them home like a regular visit. \n\"You can treat patients in a single setting. They come in they have the treatment, and they go home and have breakfast,\" said Kadis. \nArchbold is one of only 275 hospitals with this equipment worldwide. The Gamma Knife is not up and running just yet, but doctors expect to begin treating patients as early as next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T07:13:39.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
