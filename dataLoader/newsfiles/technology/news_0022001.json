SDL said the result was unsurprising, given that CXM originated in customer service and that “only recently [have] companies … begun evolving the way they manage an experience, particularly as customers move … into the digital, self-service sphere.” It concluded: “The survey results indicate that not only are CXM perceptions different from company to company, but there is also a lack of understanding on how to implement a holistic CXM strategy. As a result, the continued priority tends to be placed on CXM services that have already been implemented or are related to existing processes, rather than expanding to focus on customer experiences along the entire customer journey… “As a movement, CXM is gaining ground, but to have game-changing impact, companies need to evolve their definition of CXM, and modify associated business goals, KPIs and communication channels to strategically focus on the holistic, interconnected customer journey.” As to a precise definition of CXM, suggestions offered by survey respondents included: “CXM means designing, implementing and facilitating the environment in which your customers interact with you,” and “customer experience (CX) is the sum of all experiences a customer has with a supplier of goods and services, over the duration of their relationship with that supplier: from awareness, discovery, attraction, interaction, purchase and use through to cultivation and advocacy.” However, what emerged from the study was that, while CX might be “the sum of all experiences a customer has with a supplier of goods and services,” CXM means balancing the focus given to each of these experiences. “The top three CXM services area priorities for decision makers – email marketing, customer service initiatives and data management – tend to be among those that have been already implemented,” the survey found. It said that these three also remained the ones with the highest priority “which suggests that there is something lacking in current solution(s) for customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention.” And it suggested: “A more holistic approach would drive greater utilisation of emerging channels, such as mobile and social media.” However, it suggested there was a deal of uncertainty as to how to go about doing this. “It is notable that survey respondents are familiar with the concepts surrounding CXM, but are unclear on how to implement an all-inclusive strategy.\" \nPremier Technologies \nPremier Contact Point provides a hosted contact solution that meets the needs of the modern contact centre.
