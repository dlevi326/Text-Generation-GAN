All the censored material in the latest group of emails is classified at the “confidential” level, not at higher “top secret” or compartmentalized levels, they said. \n“It’s somewhere around 150 that have been subsequently upgraded” in classification, State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters. \nStill, the increasing amounts of blacked-out information from Clinton’s email history as secretary of state surely will prompt additional questions about her handling of government secrets while in office and that of her most trusted advisers. The Democratic presidential front-runner now says her use of a home email server for government business was a mistake, and government inspectors have pointed to exchanges that never should have been sent via unsecured channels. \nToner insisted that nothing encountered in the agency’s review of Clinton’s documents “was marked classified.” \nGovernment employees are instructed not to paraphrase or repeat in any form classified material in unsecured email. \nMonday evening’s release amounts to more pages of emails than disclosed in the previous three months combined. Once public, it will mean roughly a quarter of all of the correspondence Clinton qualified as “work emails” has been published.
