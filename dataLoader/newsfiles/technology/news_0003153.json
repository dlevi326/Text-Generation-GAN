Logic dictates, therefore, that in fashioning a higher civilisation for this country, the ANC must be rid of tribal nationalism and regionalism. Regionalism, in the context of a South Afrika with a history rooted in apartheid segregationist policies, is an extention of tribalism.\nThat being the case, why are members of the ANC Youth League so strongly married to regionalistic politics? One of the main topics of discussion today is that there's no-one from the Eastern Cape in the top five. A lot of comrades from the said province are very aggrieved. The argument they are advancing is that \"the EC is not visible in the top five\".\nWhy does it matter that a person from the EC should be in the executive leadership if the ANC Youth League is truly representative of the struggles of South Afrikan youth? I want to think that because the ANC Youth League is a national organisation, its leadership should be conversant with issues facing all youth of this country, which are largely very common issues such as unemployment, poverty and economic disenfranchisement. In a case where it can be argued that certain provinces have specific struggles, I want to think that a Provincial Executive Committee, which works closely with the NEC, should be able to address and articulate these issues so that they find expression in the articulations and programmes of national. It doesn't require a person born in the Eastern Cape, therefore, to articulate issues. It requires a person who understands the issue.\nFurthermore, the regionalism argument is also problematic at a compositional level. There are only five positions in the executive, and nine provinces in South Afrika. It is mathematically impossible to represent every province in the top five. And so if the regionalist argument must be entertained, how does the exclusion of other provinces get explained? If, say, instead of a person from KZN being the Secretary General, we had someone from the Eastern Cape, does KZN then raise the same narrow argument? And if so, what about the four other provinces which will not be part of this leadership? Elsewhere, someone argues that the top five should be on a rotational basis. My question was: If you're electing people based on capacity (which should be the case) how do you justify rotational leadership? If in 2015 the creme de la creme of chief administration is from KZN, logic must dictate that such a person becomes the SG. What happens if in the next elective congress the best suited candidate for the position is from Limpopo, and it's Gauteng that is supposed to forward an incoming SG as per prior agreement from the previous congress? Will this person be overlooked for a mediocre person from Gauteng on the grounds that it's Gauteng's turn to get the position? If so, how does this build an organisation?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:26:56.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
