Source: Facebook\nHe doesn’t remember me? Source: Facebook\nIf only he knew. Source: Facebook\nWell, that escalated quickly. Source: Facebook\nThe images showed Mr Lamberson starting the exchange by saying the pair had met earlier before asking for some “green”.\nRealising the unlikely situation he found himself in, the police officer decided to pose as a drug dealer.\nThrough a series of exchanges, the narcotics officer flipped the tables and convinced Mr Lamberson to supply him with some cocaine.\nThe would-be drug dealer confirmed it was easy to score coke and he had connections to provide quality product that had not been “stepped on”.\nAfter arriving to complete the transaction, Mr Lamberson’s new friend from 7-Eleven was nowhere in sight.\nHowever, there was a number of Martin County Sheriff’s narcotics detectives waiting to greet him.\nMr Lamberson was subsequently arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance with the intent to sell. Let this be a lesson kids. Drugs don’t pay.
