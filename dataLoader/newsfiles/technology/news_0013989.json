Economists polled by Reuters had expected an addition of 194,000 jobs. \nThe Federal Reserve, which kept interest rates unchanged earlier this month, has said it needs to see more improvement in the labor market and be confident that inflation will increase before raising rates. Inflation remains below the Fed's 2 percent target. \n\"The ADP numbers were consistent with what we've been seeing in the last few months with the labor market continuing to tighten,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. \n\"It's only a matter of time before the Fed raises rates but I don't think that will happen in October.\" \nInvestors will look for clues on the timing of a rate hike when Fed Chair Janet Yellen and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard speak at a conference in St. Louis later on Wednesday. \nYellen said last week the central bank remained on track to raise rates this year. The Fed meets next on Oct. 27-28. \nS&P 500 e-minis were up 23.75 points, or 1.27 percent, with 248,374 contracts traded at 8:18 a.m. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 60.25 points, or 1.48 percent, on volume of 40,376 contracts. Dow e-minis were up 186 points, or 1.17 percent, with 36,617 contracts changing hands. \nU.S. stocks mostly closed higher on Tuesday after nearing August lows, helped by a bounce in healthcare stocks, with the S&P 500 snapping a 5-day losing streak. \nInvestors, worried about a slowing global economy, will be keen to put a bruising quarter behind them and look ahead to third-quarter earnings season, which begins next week. \nAlthough the market's recent rout, triggered by fears of slowing growth in China, has forced many strategists to slash year-end expectations, a Reuters poll shows the S&P 500 is expected to end 2015 roughly 11 percent above current levels. \nChicago PMI data for September is forecast to have shrunk to 53.0 from 54.4 in August. The data is expected at 9:45 a.m. \nShares of Ralph Lauren were up 6.1 percent at $110.40 premarket after the fashion powerhouse said its founder and CEO was stepping down and being replaced by the head of Gap's Old Navy division. Gap was down 6 percent at $28.40. \nWestern Digital jumped 11.5 percent to $77.40 after the data storage company said it would receive a $3.78 billion investment from Chinese infotech company Unisplendour. Peer Seagate rose 5.9 percent to $44.25. \nTesla was up 2.6 percent at $253.01 after the first delivery of its long-awaited Model X electric SUV.
