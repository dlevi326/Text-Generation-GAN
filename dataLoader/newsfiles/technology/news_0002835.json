(AP) â€” Wildlife officials say a black bear that seriously injured an elderly woman attacked her inside her northwestern Montana home.\nMontana Fish, Wildlife and Parks spokesman John Fraley tells the Flathead Beacon newspaper of Kalispell ( http://bit.ly/1LYEWPk ) that the department doesn't know how the bear got into the woman's home Sunday, but that it left through a window.\nFraley says bears in the Kalispell area have been \"extensively fed\" with bird feed and other sources. He declined to say who was feeding the animals or if they might face charges.\nIt is illegal to provide supplemental feed to deer, elk, bears or mountain lions.\nFraley called the attack \"severe.\" The woman remains hospitalized, and wardens are trying to trap the bear.\n___\nInformation from: Flathead Beacon, http://www.flatheadbeacon.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1LYEWPk", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-29T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T19:51:39.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
