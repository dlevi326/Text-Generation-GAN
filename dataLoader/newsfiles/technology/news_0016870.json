(Credit: Chris Wood/Gizmag) Image Gallery (8 images) \nWe've already broken down details on the second generation Moto 360 , which was revealed earlier today at IFA in Berlin, but what about actually strapping it on? Read on for Gizmag's early thoughts on the new smartwatch. \nThe new model is available in 46 mm (the same size as the original) and 42 mm variants, with both men's and women's versions of the smaller model on offer. The original Moto 360 was a little too large for some users, so it's a smart move from Motorola to offer a choice this time around. We tried both sizes, and the smaller version felt a little more natural on this male wrist. \nThe second generation release marks a small step up in display resolution (it's 360 x 330 spread out over 1.56-inches on the larger model, and 360 x 325 over 1.37-inches on the smaller one), and both sizes looked great under the show lights, with sharp, bright visuals. The cut-out portion at the base of the display – \"flat tire,\" as it's affectionately (or something like that) been branded – is still present on the new model, but since we're used to it from the original watch, it doesn't stand out like it did a year ago. \nThe straps are easily swappable via a quick release catch, and there's a wider range of customization available through the Moto Maker service. We got our hands on both the leather and stainless steel straps, and both give you the well-made, premium aesthetic you'd want out of such a device. The leather option felt the most comfortable on our wrists, though, with its soft, high-quality feel. \nThe way the straps attach to the body looks more traditional than on last year's Moto 360, where the band appeared to disappear into the watch. It does, however, make the new watch look a bit less distinctive. \nWe also took a look at the Moto 360 Sport, though the company only had a dummy unit on display. The silicone finish on the product didn't feel nearly as premium as the other models we tried, but that's not entirely surprising given that it's more fitness product than fashion accessory. \nBased on our initial impressions, the second generation Moto 360 looks to be a solid upgrade. Motorola's battery life estimates are also much healthier on the second generation smartwatch, with the company rating the larger device for two full days up time, and the smaller for a day and a half. If those numbers ring true, that could be a big selling point here as well – and perhaps the biggest reason to upgrade. \nThe second generation Moto 360 is available to pre-order starting today in the US, coming in at between US$300 and $430, depending on how you customize it using the Moto Maker service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T04:09:53.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
