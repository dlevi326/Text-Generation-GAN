Filtrair has been active in air filter media manufacturing since 1965 and has become a leading producer of air filtration products, driven by innovation and customer focus. \nThe rigid pocket filters of Filtrair are well-known products in the market with high-performance properties. Unique hydrophobic-treated air filters by Filtrair are the ideal solution for any environment with water droplet aerosol or high-humidity. Filtrair Drop Safe® filters \nFiltrair Drop Safe rigid filters (G4-M5-M6) serve as very efficient pre or final filters in air intake systems of combustion engines, in any environmental condition (including offshore, marine) and in any climate (including tropical). \nThey efficiently remove airborne particulate matter but also snow, mist and fog, acting as a filter and a coalescer in one. DS rigid filters are specifically designed for the elimination and drainage of freewater and airborne salt crystals and protect final filters from dust, salt and water. This prolongs the life of the final filter and increase the operational safety and lowers the energy costs. Filtrair Rigid Pocket Filters \nFiltrair Rigid Pocket Filters (G4-M5-M6-F7) are developed for gas turbines, compressors and turbo machinery for intake air, as well as exhaust or recycled air. They are typically installed in industrial installations with stringent requirements to withstand high airflow and high-pressure loads, as well as high dust concentrations. \nFiltrair Rigid Pocket Filters are synthetic fiber-based filters developed and manufactured at Filtrair's own high-tech media plant. The filter medium is constructed from selected high-performance fibers in a progressive density multi-layering technique to ensure high-depth loading with the optimal lowest pressure drop performance. \nThis results in long filter life, high fractional efficiency combined with high-dust loading and lower energy and maintenance costs. Filtrair hydrophobic media line \nFiltrair has a unique hydrophobic media line suited for GT Cartridge Wrap Pre-Filters, specifically designed to act as low-pressure drop pre-filters for pleated pulse-jet cartridge fine filters of combustion engine air intake systems. \nThey significantly prolong the pulse-jet cartridges' life and increase their operational safety. They are easy to install and change, cost-effective and have a coalescing function in case of high-humidity. Filtrair TMV rigid compact final filters \nFiltrair TMV serve as highly efficient final filters in air intake systems of combustion engines for any environmental condition. They are available in filter classes M6 to F9 (EN779) to E11 (EN1822) and remove any airborne particulate matter, including submicron one, providing full protection of the turbines key components from fouling, corrosion and erosion. TMV filters are specially designed for gas turbine air-intakes, high-performance and safety demands by having: 18m² or 30m² high-efficiency Microfiberglass medium Fully PU potted, leak-free all plastic frame (incinerable) Face guards for protection against handling damages Contact Details Energy rating system for air filters. Filtrair Drop Safe rigid pocket filters: The best solution for pre-filtration and water removal in any environment. Filtrair Rigid Pocket Filters are premium filters with the lowest pressure drop, resulting in lower energy and maintenance costs. Hydroline GT Cartridge wrap is a unique solution for canister protection in conditions that are high in humidity. TMV Rigid Compact filters are a heavy duty solution with optimised the lowest pressure drop during their lifecycle to ensure maximum power output.
