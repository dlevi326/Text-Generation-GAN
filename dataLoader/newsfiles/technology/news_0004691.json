For the first time, the National Association for Trusted Exchange (NATE) has joined with the Strategic Health Information Exchange Collaborative (SHIEC) and HIT Users Group (HUG) to present a joint, comprehensive conference with speakers and presentations addressing critical HIE opportunities including enabling patient access to their health information. \nDataMotion's technology has been lauded for overcoming interoperability issues and enabling secure communications between healthcare providers, electronic health records (EHR) software and HIEs. More recently, the company broadened the reach of its services to benefit the rapidly growing patient engagement and population health markets. The company was enlisted as a Platinum Sponsor of the HIE Conference to further promote and contribute to the movement towards greater patient engagement. \n\"Having access to health data helps patients make better decisions and leads to better outcomes,\" said Aaron Seib , chief executive officer of NATE, a not-for-profit association with a primary goal of enabling consumers to securely access and share their health information with family care providers, doctors and others. \"DataMotion is very established in the secure exchange of protected health information in the provider domain and is well-positioned to enable consumer-facing applications and services to benefit from these capabilities as well.
