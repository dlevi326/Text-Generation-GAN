But, he said, “There’s some things I’d do differently.”\nChief among them: convincing minorities and the poor that Republicans have their best interests at heart. “Darn it, I wish I could do that properly!” he said.\nRomney was unsparing in his assessment of the current frontrunner, and he said the general tenor of the race, with its rampant personal attacks, could hurt the GOP in the general election. He divided the field into “insurgent” candidates and “mainstream conservatives,” predicting that the contest would eventually come down to one or two of each. In the latter category, he put Chris Christie, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Lindsey Graham. Carly Fiorina might fit in this group, he said, but it was too early to tell.\n“I will support the Republican nominee,” Romney said. “I don’t think that’s going to be Donald Trump.”\nRomney’s evolution to party elder statesman has been a somewhat unexpected coda to his political career. Rather than retreat to enjoy his car elevator and his many grandchildren, he has embraced a public role as the voice of the GOP’s moderate establishment. In 2014, he endorsed numerous candidates, helping the party establishment’s picks get through tough primaries. And by sounding off on Trump, he’s given voice to the sentiments of many in the donor and consultant class.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T23:22:40.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
