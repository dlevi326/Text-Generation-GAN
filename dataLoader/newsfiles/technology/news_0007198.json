The analyst adds that from smart TVs to dedicated game consoles to portable dedicated streaming media devices, consumers are not just relying on one connected media device per household. Instead they are turning to multiple devices due to costs, ease of use, UI and navigation, compatibility with other ecosystems and the apps/services/features available. \nStrategy Analytics believes that for video service providers there is a definite opportunity to provide the comprehensive and compelling media experience consumers' desire, in a single connected device ecosystem. The ideal connected device ecosystem will provide all critical aspects vital to not only the media experience, but also the in-home experience, in one hub, on the larger screen. \n\"While the idea of committing to only one connected media device ecosystem is appealing in terms of consolidation, ease and costs, the ability to do so requires the ecosystem to provide the 'ultimate media experience' â€“ which, as is suggested by our research, no devices on the market currently do,\" explained Taryn Tulay, senior analyst and Connected Home UX report author. \n\"A smart TV provides embedded apps/services and connected features but still lacks aspects that a dedicated streaming media device can offer, such as cheaper pricing, portability, ease of content mirroring and a simplified remote,\" Tulay added. \"However, the majority of consumers expect their next TV purchase to be a smart TV, particularly with the anticipation that most smart TVs will be less expensive by the time they consider purchasing a new one. With the cheaper price of dedicated streaming media devices, the benefits of having an alternative connected device that provides different value-added experiences outweigh the costs of purchasing one in addition to a smart TV.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T10:23:26.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
