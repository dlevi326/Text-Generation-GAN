I am looking forward to helping other builders communicate better and improve operations from beginning to end using IHMS. While IHMS is a fantastic product, it is only the beginning. MOUNT HOLLY, NJ, September 03,   Mark Systems, the residential construction industry's leading provider of single-database ERP home builder software, is pleased to announce the addition of Curt Boatright to the Consulting team. Curt Boatright, the newest Senior Consultant at Mark Systems, played a major role in bringing two separate home building companies from start up to building 600 units per year. The first, he did without IHMS home builder software. The second, he immediately implemented IHMS and saw a major difference. \"The single database meant a lot to me. I only had to have one software package that covered everything we did as a builder! I knew it would improve communication between all my team members, and that is what we struggled with as we grew in the first company. The second time around I knew that if we didn't communicate effectively, seamlessly across all departments; in that market we would fail,\" said Boatright. Curt Boatright brings extensive industry experience and expert level IHMS skill to Mark Systems client base. Most recently serving as the Vice President of Operations at Legendary Communities, one of the fastest growing, privately held home building companies in the Southeast, Mr. Boatright decided to join Mark Systems a year after Legendary Communities was acquired by Meritage Homes. \"I love to help people and I always have. I am looking forward to helping other builders communicate better and improve operations from beginning to end using IHMS. While IHMS is a fantastic product, it is only the beginning,\" Boatright continues, \"I am an operations guy. I know that what I've learned can help others.\" Mr. Boatright came to the construction industry from Winn-Dixie Stores retail grocery chain with vast experience in executive level Information Technology management, where he held the position of Regional Director of IT Operations. He also comes to the Mark Systems consulting staff with a builder's license for residential, single family, detached homes. \"Curt worked through the implementation of IHMS, exploring all possibilities offered within the system. His ability to manage different products in multiple markets including Atlanta, Alabama, South Carolina, and North Carolina has provided him with invaluable experience that he can now share with our customers. Curt is a great leader and we are very happy to have him on our team,\" said Robert Cain, Vice President Consulting Services for Mark Systems.
