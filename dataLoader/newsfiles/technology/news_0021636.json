In addition, a hacked camera could provide access to other Wi-Fi-enabled devices in a person's home, such as a personal computer or security system.\nThe research released Wednesday by Boston-based Rapid7 looks at nine baby monitors made by eight different companies. They range in price from $55 to $260.\nSmart baby monitor for infants\nSproutling CTO and Co-founder Mathew Spolin discusses the hi-tech wearable band for your baby that can track their health and daily activity.\nThe cameras are often mounted over a baby's crib or another place where they spend a large amount of time. They work by filming the child, then sending that video stream to a personal website or an app on a smartphone or tablet. Some of the cameras also feature noise or motion detectors and alert parents when the baby makes a sound or moves.\nThe Rapid7 researchers found serious security problems and design flaws in all of the cameras they tested, says Mark Stanislav, a senior security consultant at Rapid7 and one of the report's authors.\nSome had hidden, unchangeable passwords, often listed in their manuals or online, that could be used to gain access. In addition, some of the devices didn't encrypt their data streams, or some of their web or mobile features, Stanislav says.\nThe problems with the cameras highlight the security risks associated with what's become known as the \"Internet of things.\" Homes are becoming increasingly connected, with everything from TVs to slow cookers now featuring Wi-Fi connections. But many consumer devices often don't undergo rigorous security testing and could be easy targets for hackers.\nRead More Next frontier for 'Internet of Things': Babies\nAnd if a hacker has access to one connected device, he or she could potentially access everything tethered to that home's Wi-Fi network, whether it's a home computer storing personal financial information or a company's computer system that's being accessed by an employee working from home.\nIn the Rapid7 study, researchers rated the devices' security on a 250-point scale. The scores then received a grade of between \"A\" and \"F.\" Of those tested, eight received an \"F,\" while one received a \"D.\" All of the camera manufactures were notified of the problems earlier this summer and some have taken steps to fix the problems.\nFor example, researchers noted that the Phillips In.Sight B120 baby monitor, which retails for about $78, had a direct, unencrypted connection to the Internet. That could allow a hacker watch its video stream online, as well as remotely access the camera itself and change its settings, the report says.\nRead More The growing need for more women cybersleuths\nPhillips NV released a statement noting that the model in question has been discontinued. It added that its brand of video baby monitors is now licensed to Gibson Innovations, which is aware of the problems and it working on a software update designed to fix it.\nThe researchers also tested the iBaby and iBaby M3S, Summer Baby Zoom WiFi Monitor & Internet Viewing System, Lens Peek-a-View, Gynoii, TRENDnet WiFi Baby Cam TV-IP743SIC, WiFiBaby WFB2015 and Withing WBP01.\nHigher camera prices didn't translate to higher levels of security. In fact, the pricier models usually came with more features, which left unsecured could give hackers more ways to potentially access a camera or its video stream, Stanislav says.\nIn order to protect themselves, consumers should keep an eye out for any camera or mobile application updates. In addition, if parents still want to use a camera that's known to be susceptible to hackers, they should use it sparingly and unplug it when it's not in use, Stanislav says.\nRead More Ten low-tech ways to protect your privacy online", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:12:55.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
