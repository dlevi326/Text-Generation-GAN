RELATED SAN FRANCISCO: Snapchat is expanding its \"replay\" feature for those disappearing messages, giving users an option to get another look at three \"snaps\" for a fee of 99 cents. The feature is the first by the popular social network to get revenue from its user base in addition to advertising messages introduced last year. Snapchat has been offering users one free replay \"and we've used it to relive those amazing moments... just one more time before they disappear,\" according to a blog post Tuesday from the California startup. \"But then we realized -- a Replay is like a compliment! So why stop at just one? Today, US Snapchatters can purchase extra Replays, starting at 3 for $0.99... They're a little pricey -- but time is money!\" Users can get a second look at any message, but can do this only once per snap. Snapchat in May said it raised $537 million in a new round of equity funding. The vanishing-message service did not disclose who bought stakes in the Los Angeles-based company, which came at a price estimated to give Snapchat a value of more than $15 billion, according to media reports. Snapchat has become a popular way for people to share videos or photos, and has nearly 100 million people using it each day, according to the company.
