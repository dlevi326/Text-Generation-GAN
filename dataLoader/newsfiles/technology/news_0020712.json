Thumbnail images can give presenters visibility to each participating device so they can easily toggle back and forth between content. \nThe projectors also include NEC's DisplayNote software that allows users to automatically save any notes they may use during presentations. \n\"The M series projectors subscribe to a 'bring your own device' philosophy with their wireless capabilities,\" said NEC Senior Product Manager Bob Guentner, \"and let educators determine what sources to display on screen in an instant.\" \nThe M333XS is equipped with 3,300 lumens and has a 0.6:1 throw ratio. The M353WS has 3,500 lumens and a 0.48:1 throw ratio. Each model delivers high-contrast images (10,000:1) and is filter-free. An ambient light sensor increases the lamp life up to 8,000 hours and both models have quick-start and auto power functions. \nOther features include: 1,24 x 768 and 1,366 x 768 native resolutions, respectively; DLP engine;", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:30:59.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
