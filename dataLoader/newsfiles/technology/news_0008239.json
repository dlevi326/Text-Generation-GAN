The US and UK were not included in the assessment. \nThe OECD's resulting Students, Computers and Learning: Making the Connection report found that academic achievement was more likely the result of socio-economic factors than access to technology. \n\"PISA results show no appreciable improvements in student achievement in reading, mathematics or science in the countries that had invested heavily in ICT for education,\" OECD education director Andreas Schleicher said. \nIn order to reduce inequalities in digital skills, the report suggests, \"countries need to improve equity in education first\". \n\"As long as computers and the internet continue to have a central role in our personal and professional lives, students who have not acquired basic skills in reading, writing and navigating through a digital landscape will find themselves unable to participate fully in the economic, social and cultural life around them,\" the report stated. \n\"[The results show] that once the so-called \"first digital divide\" (access to computers) is bridged, the remaining difference between socio-economic groups in the ability to use ICT tools for learning is largely, if not entirely, explained by the difference observed in more traditional academic abilities.\" \nPart of the problem is that schools haven't yet figured out how to use technology to make a difference in learning, according to the report. \n\"If students use smartphones to copy and paste prefabricated answers to questions, it is unlikely to make them smarter,\" Schleicher said. \n\"If we want students to become smarter than a smartphone, we need to think harder about the pedagogies we are using to teach them. Technology can amplify great teaching but great technology cannot replace poor teaching.\" \nAustralia on average has one student using a computer in schools compared to an OECD average of almost 5. \nJust under 94 percent of Australian students use computers at school, according to the report, while the OECD average sits at 72 percent. \nAround 80 percent of Australian schoolchildren say they browse the internet for schoolwork at least once a week during school hours. Throughought the OECD that average comes in almost half at 42 percent. \nAfter hours on school days, 75 percent of Australian students say they browse the internet at least once a week for education purposes, compared to a 55 percent OECD average.
