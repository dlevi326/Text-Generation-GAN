Learn how to deal with wastewater from shale gas fracking Issue of Water Concerns around the shale gas industry will be discussed at the 6th Annual Shale Gas Environmental Summit taking place on 26-27 October in London Flowback and produced water contamination analyses, re-use in fracking operations, treatment processes and disposal residues will be discussed at the Shale Gas Environmental Summit. â€” SMi Group LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, September 7,   SMi group reports: CIWEM, John Busby Ltd and University of Glasgow will be speaking on the issue of Water Concerns around the shale gas industry at the 6th Annual Shale Gas Environmental Summit taking place on 26-27 October in London, UK. Robert Westway, Senior Research Fellow, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow will be presenting his session on Induced seismicity from shale gas development in the UK: The role of fluid migration. His presentation will discover what techniques can be used for detecting leaks, what tells you that water is leaking, how can the impact be minimised and what the best practice for protecting the drinking water is. John Busby, director at John Busby Ltd will be giving his speech on dealing with wastewater from shale gas fracking. His talk will focus on flowback and produced water contamination analyses, re-use in fracking operations, treatment processes and disposal residues. He will also look into the Environment Agency permits regulation and how the fracking operators will deal with wastewater. In addition, the topic on integrating water management will be presented by Laura Grant, Policy Advisor, CIWEM. She will discuss the risks a shale gas industry could have on water and what the role of water and sewerage companies should be. The presentation will also cover how the impact on the water environment can be limited and the speech will be closed with conclusions for the progression of fracking. Join us at this industry leading event to meet sector experts and discuss the environmental impact shale gas has across Europe. The 2-day event programme will be focusing on regulation changes, planning applications and the political issues arising from drilling/fracking as well as solutions to combat problems relating to waste water and leakage and the resulting risks shale gas poses to health and human rights. Event will include two post conference workshops : Shale Gas: Stakeholder Engagement - Winning the Societal License to Operate, led by Michael Holgate, Energy Consultant, Aquatera The Shale Gas Industry in Germany and Europe - Legal Frameworks and Gaps, led by Andy Gheorghiu, Campaigner & Consultant, Andy Gheorghiu Consulting For more information or to register for this conference please visit www.shalegassummit.co.uk To register or to sponsor this conference Please contact Andrew Gibbons on +44 (0) 207 827 6156 or agibbons@smi-online.co.uk END", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T03:28:42.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
