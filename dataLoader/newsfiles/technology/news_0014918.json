(an industry leader of technical communication software for the manufacturing industry) and TID Informatik, GmbH ( http://www.tid-informatik.de - creator of CATALOGcreator®) will be offering a free webinar on September 24, 2015 from 12 noon to 1:00 pm MDT. This informative webinar will demonstrate how a spare parts catalog can be created directly from engineering CAD models using data from ERP and PLM Systems such as Siemens Teamcenter® and SAP®. For more information and to register for the webinar, please visit http://info.Lattice3D.com/spare-parts-catalog-any-CAD .\nThe webinar presenter is Lukas Tobler, Managing Director of CATALOGcreator USA. Tobler is a mechanical engineer, educated in Switzerland, with extensive experience using various PDM, ERP and MCAD systems. In his latest project using CATALOGcreator and solutions from Lattice Technology, he led the development and implementation of the automated process to create electronic parts catalogs for Buhler Industries in Switzerland.\n“I have led the implementation of automating the generation of electronic spare parts catalogs using solutions from Lattice3D and CATALOGcreator for many companies in Europe, saving companies tremendous amounts of manual effort,” said Tobler. “The electronic catalogs also are of higher quality and extremely user friendly for customers, customer service or service personnel who need to identify and order replacement parts.”\nAccording to Bill Barnes, General Manager, Lattice Technology, TID Informatik is a long-term value added reseller for Lattice Technology based in Germany. “TID Informatik has been extremely successfully in Europe implementing automated processes for the creation of electronic spare parts catalogs. Recently, they established an office in Georgia to directly serve manufacturing companies here in the United States. We are excited to be jointly presenting this webinar, which will demonstrate how effectively a company can repurpose their engineering CAD assembly models into a user friendly replacement parts ordering system.”\n** CHALLENGE--MANUALLY CREATING ELECTRONIC SPARE PARTS CATALOGS **\nAn important aspect of business for companies that design and manufacture products is ensuring that customers or service personnel are able to correctly identify parts to order. Many companies have manual processes for creating spare parts catalogs and often recreate drawings, which results in the following problems:\n Lack of clarity—Users often have difficulty clearly identifying the proper part when ordering. Increased cost—The human resources required to compile a spare parts catalog can be significant in terms of time and money. Increased errors—Recreating drawings can introduce inaccuracies. Multiple Data Sources—Catalogs must pull data from multiple sources (ERP, PDM/PLM and CAD), costing valuable time and possibly introducing errors. Delayed time to market—Creating the catalog can become a critical path for bringing a product to market.\nWatch this short animated video for an overview of the problems many companies face and our solution. ( https://youtu.be/Uswqn6Ha3bE )\n** SOLUTION--AUTOMATE THE CREATION AND LEVERAGE 3D DESIGN DATA **\nLattice3D and CATALOGcreator combine to provide a simple and cost-effective solution. Using an automated process, users can now create spare parts catalogs directly from the native CAD assembly model, pulling data from other systems such as ERP and PLM.\n“Using these solutions, companies that design and manufacture products can now leverage their 3D data across the entire enterprise,” continued Barnes. “Automating the creation of electronic spare parts catalogs is just one example of how Lattice3D can help companies reuse their 3D design data to save time and money—and increase quality.”\nAbout Lattice Technology, Inc.\nLattice Technology’s powerful software tools set the standard for technical communication for the manufacturing enterprise. Using Lattice Technology solutions, engineers and non-engineers alike can easily simulate assembly processes and create work instructions or technical illustrations—directly from 3D engineering data. Solutions from Lattice Technology benefit companies who produce products with high part counts, complex geometry, detailed manufacturing processes or any ongoing lifecycle support requirements such as documentation, maintenance, and training. Target industries range from those developing large products such as airplanes and automobiles to small, complex machinery and medical devices. Founded in 1997, Lattice Technology, Inc. is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan and Denver, CO, USA.
