If so, why is it being pushed out to so many computers where it wasn't reserved, and why does it try to install over and over again?\" the reader told The Inquirer. \n\"I know of two instances where people on metered connections went over their data cap for August because of this unwanted download.\" \nAutomatic downloads are often unwelcome, as Apple found out last year when it placed U2's latest album in iTunes users' music libraries . \n\"For individuals who have chosen to receive automatic updates through Windows Update, we help upgradable devices get ready for Windows 10 by downloading the files they’ll need if they decide to upgrade. \n\"When the upgrade is ready, the customer will be prompted to install Windows 10 on the device.” \nIf you want to download Windows 10, here's how .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:04:42.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
