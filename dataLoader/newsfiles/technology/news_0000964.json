The park would also house the High Technology Development Corp., the state agency charged with expanding commercial high-tech enterprises. \nState officials released a draft environmental assessment Wednesday detailing the project’s first of three phases, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported (http://bit.ly/1G4A2y5). The report shows that the initial stage, which is being called the “Innovation Block,” would cost $39 million and could be completed by 2018. \n“The concept of the Innovation Block is to foster collaboration between public and private enterprises by intermingling and creating perceptible physical connections among high-tech development, commercial office, retail, and educational uses and their communities to promote the exchange of ideas and stimulate innovation,” the report said. \nThe technology park would contribute to the state’s ongoing effort to advance a robust commercial high-tech industry. \nHTDC, created in 1983, announced in December its 80/80 plan to create 80,000 technology jobs paying $80,000 by 2030. \n“While 80/80 is an ambitious goal, by collaborating with entrepreneurs, the business community and government, we can diversify our economy and build Hawaii’s reputation as a good place to do business,” said HTDC’s executive director and CEO, Robbie Melton, in a statement at the time. \nHTDC has forged a partnership with HCDA and will help the development agency with plans for the new technology park. \nIn all, the proposed park will be about 350,000 square feet of public and private tenant space. \n___ \nInformation from: Honolulu Star-Advertiser, http://www.staradvertiser.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T06:09:50.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
