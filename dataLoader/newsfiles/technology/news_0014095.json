CIIE will become a Member of the Network for Global Innovation (NGIN), a group of innovation institutions working to accelerate market entry, provide access to customers/investors, share commercialization best practices, and provide network-wide technology platforms with the intent of delivering programming and funding. In a signing ceremony that included Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President and CEO Fred Walti of LACI, CIIE joined LACI’s Network for Global Innovation (NGIN), which brings together innovation institutions around the world aimed at accelerating the commercialization of clean technology on a global scale. Through the partnership, the two organizations have agreed to create a CIIE / LACI NGIN Landing Pad, a reciprocal program that enables entrepreneurs and innovators in the cleantech space to gain access to the California and Indian markets.\n“LACI is thrilled to welcome CIIE into the Network for Global Innovation family,” said Fred Walti, President and CEO of LACI. “They are a tremendous example of an incubator with a talent for helping entrepreneurs turn ideas into innovation.
