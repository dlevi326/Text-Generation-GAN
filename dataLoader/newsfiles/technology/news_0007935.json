The integrated reporting category is evaluated in terms of the internationally recognised IIRC framework. \nPrincess Mary said: \"Palsgaard has produced a complete, clear report, giving its reader a good understanding of the company's CSR activities and Palsgaard's determination to create shared value based on the opportunities and risks it identifies in the value chain. \n\"As a producer of food ingredients, Palsgaard is focused on palm oil sustainability issues, where it has set ambitious goals to ensure it remains an industry front-runner. \n\"The reader is guided along with good overviews and illustrations, and for each focus area, Palsgaard highlights its challenges, risks and future scenarios, which creates balance and provides insight into the company's environment. \n\"The company describes its corporate governance well, demonstrating dedication to CSR as an integrated part of the business. \n\"Palsgaard's report aligns with GRI G4, and comprises the company's Communication on Progress for the UN Global Compact.\" \nJakob Thoisen said: \"Our 2014 CSR report makes a clear statement that Palsgaard is committed to sustainability, answering an increasingly important requirement in the food manufacturing supply chain. \n\"We emphasise a high standard of reporting both as a way to enable better business with our stakeholders around the world, and as a tool that us helps to document and improve our overall performance.\" \nJoining Palsgaard on the podium as winners in their respective categories were Maersk Drilling, Carlsberg and Novo Nordisk. \nThe prize has been awarded annually for no fewer than 21 years, and this is the second year in a row that it has been presented by HRH the Crown Princess, an active proponent of sustainable development. \nThis is not the first time Palsgaard has been recognised by the annual conference for its CSR reporting practices. The company's 2010 CSR report won the national award as the best first-time CSR report.
