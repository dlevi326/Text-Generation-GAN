Bison Transport, number 59 on the Transport Topics list of the top 100 for-hire carriers in the United States and Canada, selected SkyBitz to help get better utilization out of its fleet of trailers and reduce its trailer counts. SkyBitz was chosen because of its product reliability, intuitive web services, customer service, and the convenience of an affordable subscription platform that eliminates any upfront capital investment. \nWith the rising cost of purchasing and maintaining equipment and growing business demand, it was paramount to Bison Transport to get more utilization out of their trailers. After an extensive pilot, Bison Transport selected SkyBitz for its asset management solution that provides frequent reporting and complete visibility of its fleet spanning broad geographic areas. Bison Transport tested SkyBitz products during one of the worst winters in 150 years in Canada and unlike other less rugged products, SkyBitz devices worked reliably even in the harshest conditions. \n“We selected SkyBitz because of its reputation in the industry for being a progressive company that continues to stay at the leading edge of technology. We wanted a partner that’s going to continue to anticipate our future needs,” said Nathan Enns, Maintenance Manager of Process and Data at Bison. “In the past, there was potential for our drivers to spend unnecessary time searching for a trailer in one of our yards. With SkyBitz, our operations group are able to help drivers find trailers in a much more efficient manner.” \nAccording to Enns, being able to prove with accurate data when a trailer arrives at a customer location and how long it is there helps Bison with demurrage and detention management through either billing or speeding up the unload process and getting their trailers back sooner. \n“We’re very pleased after a thorough two-year evaluation to prove out our solution and be selected by such a prominent Canadian fleet. We’re excited to provide Bison Transport with our best-in-class asset management services and technology expertise,” said Henry Popplewell, Senior Vice President and General Manager, SkyBitz. \nBison Transport chose the subscription-based enterprise solution, SkyBitz as a Service , empowering them with the ability to reduce capital expenditures and quickly benefit from more efficiency throughout its business. \nRecognized by the Truckload Carrier’s Association as North America’s Safest Fleet, Bison Transport has provided award-winning transportation solutions to the industry for over 45 years.
