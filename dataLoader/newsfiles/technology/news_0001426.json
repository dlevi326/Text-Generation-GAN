That means in one account you can hold traditional products such as shares and exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds. Punters buy and sell funds much like they would shares, with the same sort of dealing costs.\nUK broker Hargreaves Lansdown has hoovered up the market, commanding a quarter of retail stockbroking execution volumes at a huge profit.\nMight the same trend be happening in SA? The incentives are different, but one can imagine something like it emerging here. The Financial Services Board’s retail distribution review process looks set to shake up the business models of financial advisers. They are likely to be forbidden from earning commissions for putting clients in investment schemes and will instead have to charge an upfront fee.\nMany clients may balk when they see a rand amount upfront for the services of an adviser, and choose to do it themselves. That may create a large pool of self-directed investors looking for easy ways to buy and sell investments like unit trusts.\nResearch by my firm Intellidex shows that the fastest growing retail stockbroking product is exchange-traded funds. About 28% of retail stockbroker clients now hold exchange traded funds compared to 19% two years ago. Government’s tax-free savings account regime allows for stockbroking accounts, but they may hold only exchange-traded funds. These factors are driving familiarity with the principle of holding fund-like instruments in a stockbroking account rather than just equities.\nIt doesn’t take much of a leap to add actively managed funds to the pool, morphing stockbroker accounts into a broad investment holding account. Some operators are moving in this direction. Financial services group PSG is developing web-based technology that will allow clients to see their stockbroking accounts and unit trusts bought through PSG’s linked-investment product platform in a single place. The broker GT247.com offers a tax-free account with the firm buying and selling on your behalf.\nThe problem with adding unit trusts to this is that the big unit trust houses like Allan Gray, Coronation, Sanlam and Old Mutual don’t seem keen to do it. The commission structures are not supportive — they’ll pay commission to financial advisers, but are not interested in paying commission to funds platforms, as happens in the UK. So platforms here will have to charge a percentage of assets fee, which may mean they are treated differently to shares and won’t be very competitive compared to exchange-traded funds, which have an embedded fee. Sooner or later, a competitive fund manager will break ranks and offer its funds to stockbrokers for a commission.\nAnother lesson from the UK market is that the number of financial advisers is declining. This is probably because of the increased cost of compliance with burdensome regulations and changes to rules that have forced advisers to charge upfront fees, much as I think will happen here. For consumers who do not have large asset bases to justify advice fees, other providers are filling the gap. Hargreaves Lansdown walks a line of not offering advice, while holding the hands of clients through the investment process that is popular even though fees are comparatively high.\nWhat does this mean for the stockbroking industry? I think we’ve reached the end of a chapter that began with the dot.com boom. The firms that did well did so by offering sophisticated trading platforms that rivalled those of professional traders in investment banks. The Intellidex research shows declining interest in derivatives like contracts-for-difference and single stock futures. Instead a more conservative client is becoming the key market for stockbrokers and they are interested in holding long-term portfolios and getting careful guidance, looking for long-term savings rather than the chase of quick returns.\nThis trend is enhanced by technological and market reforms that are bringing portfolios into the traditional basket of equities. The competitive pressure on fees and commissions that have driven down the profits of stockbrokers worldwide can be slightly relieved by including funds and platform fees. Clients will pay them if they feel they are getting good service and reassuring investment strategies. That is a trend stockbrokers should take note of.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:36:08.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
