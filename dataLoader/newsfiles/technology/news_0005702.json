Finally someone commanding a larger audience has had the guts to speak out the obvious uncomfortable truth.\nMr Zuma is right in stating that before NATO's hurried and overt 'intervention' in Libya the nation was by any stretch the most prosperous in Africa, superseding by large margins many UN indicators of quality of life - health, education, etc. One can never really understand why the powers that be found it necessary to bomb the country into it's current state. It is even tempting to entertain 'conspiracy theories' that suggest they a hidden agenda. Why Libya? Was Colonel Gaddafi the 'brutal' dictator that BBC and CNN made him out? Did he 'murder his own people'? Was he even a dictator at all? Is it mere coincidence that the same colourful labels that were pinned on Colonel Gaddafi before his extrajudicial execution were used by the same agencies to describe Mr Assad?\nIt's also interesting to note that both Syria and Libya were relatively prosperous, secular, and peaceful nations. Both countries were headed by leaders who were accepted by the majority. The fact that neither was Alawite, nor Sunni, nor Shi'a was really never an issue. In fact the words Alawite, Sunni, Shi'a, and Cyrenaica became popular only after the so-called Arab Spring and on CNN, BBC and other similar news channels. The Libyan and Syrian 'migrants' are concepts that began their existence soon after both nations were targets of military intervention, overt and otherwise, by NATO Europe.\nI can understand president Zuma's bitterness regarding this matter, and he should be lauded for expressing it in public. The lame response by the EU representative is a hidden admission of their responsibility. For obvious reasons it had to be veiled in an aura of bravado. I mean, which European leader in his right mind receives correction from an African?\nIt is just as well that the refugees are headed to Europe. Europe destroyed their homes and livelihoods, as such Europe must provide them homes and livelihoods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:17:52.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
