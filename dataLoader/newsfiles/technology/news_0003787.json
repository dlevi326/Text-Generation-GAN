The game reacts to the player's emotional swings by intensifying or calming the experience. Laser Life lets people with RealSense equipped computers use their hands to gesture-control the game. \nJayant explained that there's no need for a camera to identify anything within a purely digital gaming experience, but one is needed if the game is designed to pull in elements from the real world. \nAs more developers allow their games to be augmented with data generated from computer vision technologies used by blind people to navigate their daily lives then blind and vision impaired people would have some familiarity inside gameplay and virtual landscapes, according to Jayant. \nEarlier this year, at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), RealSense camera technology brought 3D vision to robots and allowed drones to fly autonomously through obstacles. \nIt's where Jayant's team first showed their working prototype of the RealSense Spatial Awareness Wearable, a vest fitted with a computing module that connects wirelessly to eight thumb-sized vibrating sensors: three across the chest, three across the torso and two near the ankles of each leg. \nThe wearable system is designed to send impulses to its wearer's body based on cues from real-world surroundings. \nDarryl Adams, a technical project manager at Intel who was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) nearly 30 years ago, has been helping the RealSense research team test prototypes. \n\"This system is high resolution,\" said Adams, who said the Spatial Awareness Wearable helped him to get a better awareness of his surroundings, especially up close, where most social interactions take place. \nWhen someone or something gets near him, he feels a vibration on his body that indicates something is approaching from his right or left. \n\"It's like sonar telling you something is in your way, but this one sees more details.\" \nIt was after CES when researchers realized that their prototype, which gave Adams a better sense of reality, might have the chance to help blind people enjoy better virtual or augmented reality games, according to Rajiv Mongia, director of the RealSense Interaction Design Group. \n\"We're using a sense of touch — in this case, vibrations on different parts of the body—as a way to give people a sense of sight,\" said Mongia, who believes this sense of sight in reality is something that could be used in games and augmented experiences. \n\"The sense of touch is so immediate to me,\" said Adams, who agrees that haptics and RealSense technology could improve some gaming and virtual reality experience for him. \n\"First-person shooter games have become so sophisticated with so many stats and tools that come into play. I can't see those things. Period. If I tried to play, I'd be shot every time.\" \nHe said that gaming seems like a natural place for the RealSense assistive technology to evolve, but it could be challenging to optimize haptic language so that it's interpreting things that you're missing visually. \nA whole language — personal or universal — based on computer vision and haptics could be created using different parts of the body, according to Adams. \n\"Different patterns could be immediately interpreted as something that seeing people typically get through visual cues,\" he said. \nWith this physical-digital blending, Jayant said game developers could use the same feedback cues that would be used when interacting in real, physical settings. \n\"In real life, if you're walking down the street and there's an overhanging branch, then the system's top haptic motors worn by the person will go off. As you get closer to the tree branch, the vibrations get stronger and stronger, signaling to the wearer to duck or walk around that branch. \n\"During a game , if any person walks by, a visually impaired player could actually feel it as a wave going by them.\" \nJayant said that her team is not yet blending their real world navigation system with particular games, but her team sees great potential. \n\"This provides even more immersive and multimodal feedback for everyone,\" said Jayant. This video is not supported by your browser at this time. \nAs her team refines their existing prototype — bringing benefits of facial recognition and catalogs of real life objects, places and experiences to help blind people navigate the real world — Jayant will explore how computer vision can bring blind people strong sensibilities and quick understanding of the world inside games and virtual settings that someday might leverage the RealSense technology. \n\"This is technology that is still waiting to be realized, but the potential for the blind to join everyone else in virtual worlds is huge,\" said Jayant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:14:25.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
