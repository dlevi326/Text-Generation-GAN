Fairfax Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The federal government has been given the green light to introduce laws enabling it to strip dual nationals of their Australian citizenship, despite constitutional experts and some MPs warning the watered-down plan is still susceptible to a High Court challenge.\nControversially, the parliamentary committee that reviewed the proposed law said it should be applied retrospectively in limited cases. This would potentially apply to seven serving felons.\nIn bipartisan recommendations set to be adopted by the Abbott government and put to the Parliament within weeks, the joint committee on intelligence and security agreed to pare back counter-terrorism laws originally proposed in June that split the cabinet.\nGone is the initial proposal by Immigration Minister Peter Dutton that he be able to strip the citizenship from people without a conviction.\nThe committee proposed that a dual national in Australia can only lose their citizenship at the discretion of the minister if convicted of terrorist crimes that carry a sentence of six years or more. This will apply to people aged as young as 14. There would be a right of review.\nA dual national abroad can be stripped of their citizenship without a conviction if they are deemed to be \"engaged in relevant conduct\", or they had engaged in such conduct in Australia but left for overseas before being charged or brought to trial.\nAlso removed is the proposal to include as an offence the destruction or damaging of government property, which could have left common vandals prone to deportation.\nThe new proposals, however, do recommend that the laws be applied retrospectively to anyone who has been convicted of terrorist offences within the past decade and given a jail sentence of 10 years or more.\n This potentially applies to seven dual nationals currently doing time in relation to three separate plots that were foiled.\nThese were the plan to attack the Holsworthy military barracks, the plot to attack public sites in Melbourne and Sydney as uncovered by Operation Pendennis, and Faheem Lodhi, a Pakistani-Australian jailed for conspiring with Willie Brigitte to bomb the power grid and three military facilities.\nThe committee of 11 MPs acknowledged there was internal controversy over the retrospectivity and said it should be applied \"with great caution and following careful deliberation, with regard to the nation as a whole\".\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott supported retrospectivity while his deputy, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, said she opposed it in principle but could accept retrospectivity if applied on a limited basis.\nUltimately, all 27 recommendations were backed on a bipartisan basis and Mr Dutton indicated all would be adopted by the government.\nThe original proposals for stripping citizenship were deemed unconstitutional. Even though the laws have been pared back, legal experts who appeared before the committee said they would be vulnerable to a High Court challenge.\nAttorney-General George Brandis refused to give the committee a copy of advice from the Solicitor-General countering this view but sent the committee a letter vouching for the constitutionality of the laws.\nA minority of committee members remained concerned but, in recommending the laws be passed, agreed the government would bear the responsibility should they be successfully challenged.\nShadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus said the constitutionality of the laws or otherwise was now the government's responsibility.\n\"Despite requests by Labor, the government refused to release its legal advice to the committee. The government has assured the committee that it believes the bill will withstand constitutional challenge,\" he said.â€‹", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-04T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:23:41.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
