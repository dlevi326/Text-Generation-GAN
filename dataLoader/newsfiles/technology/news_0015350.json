Taken away; people will be willing to die for it, as well as kill for it. If any belief runs this deep, surely it should be respected, even if we do not agree? Surely it is each person’s prerogative to believe what they want since religion deals with the metaphysical?\nThere are some hard facts in life which simply cannot be disputed. Fact: the sun will come up tomorrow. Fact: winter follows autumn, summer follows spring. Fact; oceans are salty.\nHere’s another thing about religion; it simply does not deal with hard indisputable “sun-coming-up” facts. People have different concepts of the metaphysical and hence there are hundreds of different religions. Take logic one step further and it should bring us all to the conclusion that not one religion has the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\nIf there was one religion with the whole truth and nothing but the truth, it would have to be based on hard “sun-coming-up” facts, plain for all to see, in which case the whole world would believe one thing: one universal religion.\nUntil the day it should happen that human beings have one universal concept of the metaphysical because of hard “sun-coming-up” facts and one global religion, what use is there is arguing, or rather bashing one another about it? Little children fight:\n“My daddy is stronger than your daddy!”\n“Is not!”\n“Is too! My daddy can lift a car!”\n“Well my daddy is cleverer than your daddy!”\n“Is not...” On and on it goes.\nAccording to Kenneth I. Pargement in: “The Psychology of Religion and Coping: Theory, Research, Practice” religion is, among other things, a mechanism for coping with the world and life. Thinking of early Man, it makes logical sense to say: Man “created” God. Man looked at the elements and saw he had no control over it. In an effort to cope Man needed a Higher Being beyond himself to whom he could appeal regarding the elements.\nAs Man evolved, so did his concept of the metaphysical: different gods like the sun god, god of rain, merged to become a higher, more encompassing god. This “merged god” became the seat before which responsibility, guilt and blame could be laid down. As people came into contact with others’ gods, this merged god-concept also became a handle on power in the survival of the species.\nToday, patients on the organ donor list will soon be able to receive fully functional printed organs; no waiting list any longer. We are baiting our breaths while waiting for thinking, reasoning computers to emerge. We are treading on “God’s territory’; creative acts which, previously, would have been unthinkable. Yet ... yet we still persist: “My daddy is stronger than your daddy!” Other than technologically advancing, have we learnt nothing else? Have we, as beings, not evolved together with our technology?\nAlready treading on “God’s territory”, it stands to reason that we live in a time where many belief systems are about to be turned upside down and inside out. Vulnerable, disillusioned people become defensive and potentially aggressive. Have we not yet had enough of religious wars by whatever name we call them? They say a donkey bumps his head only once...\nAn ex-Christian myself, I am well aware of the growing numbers of ex-Christians, whether they turn spiritual or atheist. I am well aware of the general disdain towards Christians, even if few dare to speak openly about it, like Victor did on News24. One often finds ex-smokers seeming to be justified in feeling themselves “one up” on smokers, and then turning out the worst anti-smokers. One only has the need to prove yourself better or cleverer than another if, despite your “improvement”, there is still something lacking inside.\nVictor stated, in answer to my questions, that Christians are in need of “tough love’. To what end? If Victor is an atheist and by implication has no destination to his life’s journey’s end, why does he feel Christians are in need of tough love? It makes no sense. Christian-bashing is merely the other side of the coin of Bible-bashing.\nOn a purely human level, a concept we all have experienced the results of, is that people will treat one the way you show them you should be treated. If what you authentically show is strength of character, people will automatically treat you with respect. If what you show is weakness, you will be treated as the weakest link, pushed to the side and shown off stage. Persecution is a very strong theme throughout the Christian belief. Could this possibly add to an impression of the weakest link?\nBe that as it may, the point of all religions and belief systems are growth; to become better people. Talk, debate from the point of view that no one person, or religion has the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\nDiscuss to learn and stimulate each other, but don’t defame or deride. Religion or belief systems should be the “untouchable”; it should be the one subject that brings out the highest good in all humans.\nEx-Christians asking Christians why they don’t “dump” their faith is deliberately waving the red flag in front of a bull, and Christians retaliating with: “You arrogant b*@t@*d!” is not for the highest good of anybody, nor does it do justice to the concept of Christianity. As in war; there can be no winners here.\nReligion or any form of belief system is the part of “highest good” in each individual and should be more than tolerated; it should be respected. If we want to inspire or see the highest good in others, show them yours.\nThe next few years are going to see great changes, bigger changes than ever before and we are ill prepared for it. Changes like printed organs and reasoning computers are going to challenge us with moral dilemmas on an emotional level we have not even thought of yet. Moral dilemmas like: if a computer reasons for itself, can it be considered a living entity? Would switching off, and unplugging such a computer be morally wrong; like killing a human? Where would it fit into society; as opposed to animals?\nHumans rarely believe animals have souls, but would encounters with such a computer change that? Will our souls be challenged? How will it affect us as a species, and how will it affect us emotionally and socially? We do not have time for petty fights if the purpose of it is not growth.\nForty years ago John Lennon might well have been seen as a dreamer. Today, however the lyrics of his song: “Imagine” seems visionary. So; imagine if you will a world without countries, without reasons to die or kill for; we’re halfway there already. A world living as one; each man living from his point of highest good be he Christian, Jew, Muslim, spiritual or atheist.\nIn 1975 when Lennon wrote these words, a global village was as unthinkable as a world without religious conflict seems today. The threat of reasoning computers was only to be found in sci-fi movies. Yet according to Stephen Hawkins it could possibly already exist. If it doesn’t, it will come into existence very soon; quite a chilling thought as I type these words on my computer and you read this on yours.\nNow is the time for human beings to step up to the plate and let each look to his own soul through whatever means suits him. Let each act and speak only from his highest good as many changes are upon us; there is no time for petty fights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:03:50.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
