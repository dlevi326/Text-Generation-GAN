Collaboration among countries across the globe is required to share information and ensure protection for people and the environment, according to a JRC co-authored paper. \nThe paper Regulatory aspects of nanotechnology in the agri/feed/ food sector in EU and non-EU countries reviews how potential risks or the safety of nanotechnology are managed in different countries around the world and recognises that this may have implication on the international market of nano-enabled agricultural and food products . \nNanotechnology offers substantial prospects for the development of innovative products and applications in many industrial sectors, including agricultural production, animal feed and treatment, food processing and food contact materials. While some applications are already marketed, many other nano-enabled products are currently under research and development, and may enter the market in the near future. Expected benefits of such products include increased efficacy of agrochemicals through nano-encapsulation, enhanced bioavailability of nutrients or more secure packaging material through microbial nanoparticles. \nAs with any other regulated product, applicants applying for market approval have to demonstrate the safe use of such new products without posing undue safety risks to the consumer and the environment. Some countries have been more active than others in examining the appropriateness of their regulatory frameworks for dealing with the safety of nanotechnologies. As a consequence, different approaches have been adopted in regulating nano-based products in the agri/feed/food sector. \nThe analysis shows that the EU along with Switzerland are the only ones which have introduced binding nanomaterial definitions and/or specific provisions for some nanotechnology applications . An example would be the EU labelling requirements for food ingredients in the form of 'engineered nanomaterials'. Other regions in the world regulate nanomaterials more implicitly mainly by building on non-legally binding guidance and standards for industry. \nThe overview of existing legislation and guidances published as an open access article in the Journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology is based on information gathered by the JRC, RIKILT-Wageningen and the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) through literature research and a dedicated survey. A golden thread through the labyrinth of nanomaterials December 11, 2014 \nThe LICARA guidelines are geared towards small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from all branches of industry, and help weigh up the pros and cons of nanomaterials and make decisions on their use. The guidelines also do ... FDA outlines policy for overseeing nanotechnology June 24, 2014 \nFederal regulators want to hear from companies using tiny, engineered micro-particles in their products, part of an effort to stay abreast of the growing field of nanotechnology. How safe is nanotechnology research in Southeast Asia? June 1, 2015 \nResearchers in Malaysia are asking whether existing legal and regulatory frameworks in Southeast Asia are robust enough to consider the safety issues surrounding the technology. Developing new methods to detect nanoparticles in food July 8, 2015 \nThe production and characterisation of reference materials to detect silver nanoparticles in meat is feasible, a recent experiment has found. Using methods developed through the NANOLYSE project, two concentrations of silver ... EU agrees opt-out deal for GMO imports April 22, 2015 \nThe EU announced plans Wednesday to allow member states to individually decide whether to allow the import of controversial genetically modified foods and animal feed, drawing a sharp US response. JRC thematic report: Science for food May 13, 2015 \nThe JRC has released a new report on its scientific support to EU's \"from farm to fork\" policy which ensures Europeans enjoy safe and nutritious food, while facilitating the food industry to work under the best possible conditions. ...

Researchers from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, have shown that twisting straight nanowires into springs ... SLAC's ultrafast 'electron camera' visualizes ripples in 2-D material September 10, 2015 \nNew research led by scientists from the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University shows how individual atoms move in trillionths of a second to form wrinkles on a three-atom-thick ... Hybrid solar cell converts both light and heat from sun's rays into electricity September 9, 2015 \nScientists have developed a new hybrid, solar-energy system that harnesses the full spectrum of the sun's radiation by pairing a photovoltaic cell with polymer films. The films convert the light that goes unused by the solar ... Science provides new way to peer into pores September 9, 2015 \nRice University scientists led a project to \"see\" and measure the space in porous materials, even if that space is too small or fragile for traditional microscopes. Encapsulation layers keep carbon nanotube transistors stable in open air September 8, 2015 \nIndividual transistors made from carbon nanotubes are faster and more energy efficient than those made from other materials. Going from a single transistor to an integrated circuit full of transistors, however, is a giant ...
