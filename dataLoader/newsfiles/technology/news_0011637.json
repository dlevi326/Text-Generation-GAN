September 25, 2015 \nSAN CLEMENTE, Calic. - OvoControl P, \"birth control\" for birds, has been approved by the Department of Agriculture for use in Puerto Rico. OvoControl P is approved under a Special Local Needs (24(c)) registration in this unique ecological habitat. Pigeons have reigned over communities in Puerto Rico since their introduction by the first European settlers in the 1600's. In Old San Juan, the Parque De Las Palomas - \"The Park of Pigeons\" has the name for good reason. With easy access to food from tourists and perfect little coves and tree trunks for them to nest, hundreds of pigeons have flocked here and claimed the park as their own. OvoControl interferes with egg hatchability, causing the population of birds to decline through attrition. With proper use, pigeon populations typically decline by approximately fifty percent, annually. Parks and industrial facilities are increasingly implementing this safe and effective tool for pigeon management. \"Feral pigeons represent a scourge for the local businesses in the urban areas of Puerto Rico. There has been a tremendous amount of interest by pigeon impacted customers on the Island for this innovative solution,\" said Erick Wolf, CEO of Innolytics. The company's representative, Caroline Ward, president of EnviroControl in San Juan agrees, adding, \"Our customers need an effective tool to manage their pigeons over the long-term but still remain environmentally responsible. OvoControl meets all of these requirements.\" OvoControl is a ready-to-use bait, dispensed on flat rooftops with an automatic wildlife feeder. This effective and humane technology is especially useful for managing pigeon flocks in larger areas without having to resort to poisons and their associated risks.
