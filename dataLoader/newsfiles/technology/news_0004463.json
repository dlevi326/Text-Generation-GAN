A man holds up an elephant tracking collar which allows each collared elephant to show up on a map overlaid with land use, as farmland and development encroach ever closer on wilderness areas \nSamburu, some 300 kilometres (185 miles) north of the capital Nairobi, is home to around 900 elephants. \nBut conflict between elephant and man is increasingly common, with livestock encroaching onto the park as drought bites. \n\"In the short term, it helps improve security for the animals,\" Douglas-Hamilton adds, as close by, a bull elephant sniffs a helicopter visiting the reserve, before deciding it is harmless and continuing to drink in the river. \n\"In the long term, it allows better planning to establish corridors for the animals - areas often extremely vulnerable to human development,\" he added. \n'Elephantocide' \nThe technology is not cheap: each collar costs some $8,000 (7,000 euros) to buy, fit and maintain. \n\"The collars are able to tell us an animal is immobile, so we're able to react very quickly to send our patrol teams,\" said David Daballen, Save the Elephant's head of field operations, lifting the giant collars. \nComplementing the maps, researchers track the complex elephant family trees, recording every animal with long registration numbers. \nBut on the ground, efforts to protect the elephants are also deeply emotional for the conservationists. Conservationist Ian Douglas-Hamilton has spent his life among the giant animals and talks of an \"elephant genocide\" \n\"That's Flaubert, he's 26, the one with the collar,\" said Douglas-Hamilton, sweeping back his grey hair as he leans excitedly out of the pickup, driving slowly through the \"Artists\" family of elephants, with each group given a different theme of names. \n\"There's Rodin, and Matisse—but Gauguin sadly died,\" adds the 73-year old British zoologist, naming each of the 23 animals grazing among the bushes lining the Ewaso Ng'iro river, a lifeline snaking through the 165 square kilometre (65 square mile) reserve. \nDouglas-Hamilton, who has spent his life among the giant animals and talks of an \"elephant genocide\", explains it is the individual names given to the elephants he knows them by. \nThis month Google launched their Street View service in Samburu, part of a bid to raise awareness of the park and elephants, as well as boosting education and promote tourism. \nBut old tracking systems remain: outside the research centre in Samburu, long sad lines of dozens of elephant jaws are laid out, all killed by poachers or drought, the teeth of each providing valuable data as to their age at death. \n\"Here was one bullet, here another,\" said Daballen, lifting a bleached shoulder bone, belonging to an elephant called Ebony. \nThose gunshots did not in fact kill Ebony, finally felled in May 2011 by a bullet to the head. \n\"We're doing all we can, but the poachers are not going away,\" he added, waving at the lines of bones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T17:58:41.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
