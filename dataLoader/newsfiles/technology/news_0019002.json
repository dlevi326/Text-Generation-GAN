There are nearly 500 clinical trials recently completed, currently underway or beginning recruitment listed by the National Institutes of Health for telemedicine trials and many of these are utilizing mobile applications as one component of the system or can easily support a mobile system. Research and application of telemedicine and telehealth has been useful in several areas of disease monitoring. Monitoring apps can either put patients in touch with a physician member of a network or connect a patient to their existing physician.At least one app creates a virtual physician. \nExamples of products on the market include: Doctor on Demand Mobile App- Doctors on Demand, Inc.Doctor on Demand is an app and a telehealth solution that connects caregivers to patients via videoconferencing.
