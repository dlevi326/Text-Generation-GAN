Visitors to API World can learn about Evolution at Booth #314 or attend Mertech's presentation, \"The Evolution of Desktop Apps - Cloudification with APIs,\" Wednesday, September 30, 2015, 2:00pm , Expo Stage B.\nMertech Evolution API Server allows developers to expose desktop application functions as APIs then consume those APIs in different programming languages via multiple protocols including JSON-RPC, SOAP and Thrift binary. In its latest version, Evolution can now serve multiple protocols from a single process pool, tripling the maximum capacity of the server.\n\"We are excited to demonstrate Evolution's capabilities for the first time at API World,\" said Riaz Merchant, CEO of Mertech. “Evolution provides a powerful way to convert Windows desktop apps into a collection of API driven modules that can be accessed directly from programs developed in popular open source languages. These modules can then be deployed over any Cloud infrastructure. The flexibility to do this quickly has immense value for software companies looking to convert their desktop apps to the SaaS model.”\nMertech Evolution enables companies to:\nRapidly integrate existing desktop applications to the cloud Facilitate cross language development using Apache Thrift Convert existing function calls to APIs that can be served using HTTP or TCP Support JSON-RPC, SOAP, and binary protocols using the same codebase Easily test APIs using a built-in API testing framework Evolution development license is free and now available.
