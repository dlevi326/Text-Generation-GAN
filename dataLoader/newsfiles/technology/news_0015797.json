While firms have traditionally sought to keep data management technologies in-house, costs associated with internal development have increased the appeal of vendor solutions. According to new TABB Group fintech research, “ Enterprise Data Platforms: Evaluating Vendor Solutions ,” demand for faster analysis of unstructured data sources and security of that data are key drivers in this transition. \n“The need to combine and integrate various data sources is leading firms to invest in significantly more complex data architectures,” says research analyst Shagun Bali , who wrote the report covering seven data management use cases (risk management, regulatory reporting, fraud detection and surveillance, investigation and e-discovery, trading, social media analysis and CRM, customer profiling and targeting), It also details forward-looking solutions and key differentiators of five larger vendors’ systems: HP Vertica, IBM PureData, Oracle, MarkLogic and SAP HANA. \nWithin the capital markets, where firms have been slow on the uptake to upgrade their data management platforms, multiple silo’ed business groups such as risk, back- and middle-office operations, trading and compliance have viewed the same information differently, leading to material disputes about data quality, definitions, information storage and control, Bali says. “Individual lines of business and IT teams must work in sync. Data management projects should be considered more of a strategic-level initiative than an individual IT-aligned effort. Further, enterprise-wide implementation of a scalable data management platform should be viewed as a longer term, graduated increase in data maturity than a single data management project.” \nTABB believes firms should consider those vendor solutions that help achieve faster results through automation and simplification of various integration and implementation steps. Each vendor has its own unique capabilities that fit defined institutional requirements and firms should invest in those that support already existing solutions and data and applications. \n“The need to leverage existing and new data sets efficiently to generate alpha is not going away,” says Bali. “Firms need to invest in the right technology to deliver value at a lower cost to overcome these challenges and capitalize on new opportunities – or risk falling behind.” \nThe Executive Summary is available at www.tabbgroup.com ; the 18-page, 6-exhibit report can be downloaded by TABB Research Alliance FinTech clients and qualified media at https://research.tabbgroup.com/search/grid .
