In 1693, the collapse finally arrived: After not sleeping for five days straight, Newton sent letters accusing his friends of conspiring against him. He was refraining from publishing books, he said at one point that year, “for fear that disputes and controversies may be raised against me by ignoramuses.”\nNewton was, by many accounts, highly neurotic. Brilliant, but neurotic nonetheless. He was prone to depressive jags, mistrust, and angry outbursts.\nUnfortunately, his genius might have been rooted in his maladjustments. His mental state led him to brood over past mistakes, and eventually, a breakthrough would dawn. “I keep the subject constantly before me,” he once said , “and wait till the first dawnings open slowly, by little and little, into a full and clear light.”\nNewton’s tendency to dwell on his problems served an example of a phenomenon described in a recent opinion paper in the journal Cell: Trends in Cognitive Sciences. The paper’s thesis is that neurotic people—tense, panicky types who are consumed by gloomy feelings—get that way because they have an overabundance of negative, so-called “self-generated” thoughts. Rather than overreact to bad experiences, the minds of neurotic people create their own threats.\n“I thought, gosh, it seems like they have a built-in threat generator” Adam Perkins, a lecturer in the neurobiology of personality, got the idea for his hypothesis when he attended a lecture by Jonathan Smallwood, a reader in the Department of Psychology at the University of York. Smallwood explained how he had put people in an MRI scanner and allowed them to daydream inside the machine. Afterward, the participants rated their daydreams. Those whose daydreams were more negative had more activity in their medial prefrontal cortex: The region of the brain that processes threats. “I thought, gosh, it seems like they have a built-in threat generator,” Perkins said. The existing explanation for neuroticism is that neurotic people have a magnified perception of threat: They see a house cat as a tiger, as Perkins says. But that doesn’t help us understand why neurotic people sometimes get lost in whorls of depression and anxiety—even when nothing bad has happened. In other words, it’s not that these individuals overreact to rumors of coming layoffs at their company; they panic even when profits are up and everyone’s getting bonuses. In the throes of his meltdown, Newton had no reason to suspect his friends would betray him.", "external_links": ["http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(15)00154-0", "https://books.google.com/books?id=3ngEugMMa9YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Never+at+Rest:+A+Biography+of+Isaac+Newton&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAGoVChMI7fvJ867WxwIVCj0-Ch0sTwN3#v=onepage&q=gottfried&f=false", "http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/prism.php?id=40"], "published": "2015-09-03T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T14:16:53.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
