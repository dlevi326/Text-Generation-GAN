The introduction of enhanced Alerts combined with the navigability of the new infrastructure console and the full HTML5 interface empowers users of all experience levels to efficiently manage their data centers, buildings, IT infrastructure, and connectivity.\n“Data center managers are increasingly pressured to drive operational efficiency with limited resources,” said Paul Friday, Cormant CTO. “Cormant-CS 8 augments the user experience by minimizing the number of clicks needed in the software while taking advantage of all the previous benefits achieved, such as data accuracy, inter-disciplinary team communication, and process improvements from Workflow. Form truly follows function in this new version so users can effectively navigate through the software faster than ever before.”\nWith more than 50+ enhancements, Cormant-CS 8 is the biggest release since introducing Workflow over a year ago. Some key new features and enhancements include:\nAlerts\nBuilt-in, configurable, subscribable, and visual Alerts provide the timely information necessary for proactive management of any data point, such as power, capacity, or even process variables. Subscription options provide the right information to the right people and can be delivered via email, SMS, or API and seamlessly viewable throughout the platform including the dashboard, infrastructure console, asset tree, rack view, plan view, and more.\nNew Ergonomically-Designed Infrastructure Console\nNavigational ease is central to the new console view. Users can bookmark preferred sites, use breadcrumbs, and use the activity pane for quick click access to their most important and recently visited information. The advanced search feature is always available for effective assistance. Alerts are also viewable from within the console view for a seamless experience throughout Cormant-CS.\nResponsive HTML5 Interface\nThe updated web interface is intuitive with full HTML5 responsive design across all platforms and enables additional mobile functionality, beyond simple record updates.\nSearchable URL Page Links\nUnique URLs allow users to easily share content for team collaboration.\nWeb UI Overhaul\nThe Cormant-CS web interface received a dramatic overhaul from login to the dashboard to the infrastructure console (previously described) for a seamless navigational flow that includes the incorporation of actionable Alerts.\nThe advancements in the new Cormant-CS DCIM version 8 continue to help efficiently track and optimize all IT infrastructure and processes in data centers, buildings, and campuses. Cormant-CS is used by over 250 organizations on 6 continents, including 3 of the top 10 global banks and 2 of the top 5 telecommunications organizations.\nFor a free demo of the latest release, contact Sales at +1 805 747 4178 or email at sales(at)cormant(dot)biz.\nAbout Cormant, Inc.\nCormant has been an expert at IT infrastructure management software for the data center (DCIM) and beyond since 2001.
