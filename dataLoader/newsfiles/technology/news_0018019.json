He joined in 1995, and held a number of options, structuring and sales roles before leaving for Goldman Sachs in 2000. He rejoined in 2004, running the forex business for seven years before becoming co-head of FIC in 2012.\nLast November, he was tasked with leading the development of technology and the reduction of business complexity across the bank's platform. He will not be replaced in that role, according to the source.\nAmrolia is set to join algorithmic trading company XTX Markets as co-chief alongside former Deutsche colleague Alex Gerko.
