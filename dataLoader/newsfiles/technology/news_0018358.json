Additionally, when directly inserted into single cells, nanoFETs are able to detect intracellular electrical signals without exchanging with cellular ions; hence, the interfacial impedance and biochemical disturbances to the cells are minimized. To further decrease the intracellular probe size, the same group has developed a branched nanoFET to bridge the intracellular environment and FET detector elements 31 , 32 . The branched nanoFET was formed by fabricating a hollow SiO 2 structure on the silicon nanowire FET. During the etching step to remove the upper portion of SiO 2 , a controlled taper was achieved at the tip due to isotropic etching, which significantly reduces the probe size to 5 nm 32 . This small size enables direct measurements in the smallest intracellular structures, such as neuron dendrites and dendritic spines, which is difficult to achieve using conventional techniques. \nArrays of vertical nanowire electrodes have also been developed to form MEAs for parallel intracellular electrical recordings ( Figure 2b ) 33 , 36 ,​ 37 ,​ 38 . Although higher throughput is an advantage, concerns about using nanowire-based MEAs have also been raised because long-term culturing of cells with MEAs inside may perturb cell gene expression, proteomics, and other cell activities 39 . Nanowire MEAs are not able to target specific cells, and accurately positioning the sensing tip inside a cell can also be difficult. In comparison, a free-standing nanoFET provides higher flexibility for probing intracellular structures three dimensionally. \nIn addition to nanowires, CNTs are also used for intracellular electrical recording 40 . A CNT is a tube-shaped nanostructure made of carbon atoms, with a diameter on the scale of nanometers and a high aspect ratio 41 . Because CNTs are one of the strongest and stiffest materials in terms of tensile strength and elastic modulus 42 , CNT-based sensing devices, unlike glass micropipettes, are much more difficult to break. Moreover, with their exceptional carrier mobility and electric current density that are three orders of magnitude higher than typical metals, such as copper and aluminium 43 , CNTs are suitable for detecting the weak signals within single cells. In 2009, Bau et al. have demonstrated the use of a carbon nanopipette to perform intracellular electrical measurements 44 , 45 . A conductive carbon layer was formed via chemical vapor deposition of carbon on the inside wall of a glass pipette. The pipette tip was then etched away, exposing a carbon tip with a tip diameter of 100~200 nm. The carbon nanopipettes were able to record intracellular electrical signals in mouse hippocampal cells (HT-22) with minimal membrane damage. Direct electrical measurement with the carbon nanopipette showed that an increase in the extracellular K + concentration produces a significant increase in the membrane potential (i.e., a higher depolarization). One limitation of the carbon nanopipette is that it has the inherited conical tip from the glass mold, which may cause damage to cell membranes when the tip is inserted deeper into a cell. \nAnother representative CNT device, reported by Singhal et al. , has a CNT assembled at the tip of a glass pipette using conductive epoxy ( Figure 2c ) 34 , 46 . This CNT cellular endoscope is fabricated using a flow-through technique, which is more versatile than the magnetic assembly method 47 . The CNT endoscope is less invasive than traditional glass pipettes, as indicated by the statistical analysis of actin network stability and cytosolic calcium ion release. In addition to the small size, another reason for the minimal damage to the cell membrane is that CNTs with minimal surface defects exhibit nonpolar properties. Furthermore, this nonpolarity feature would enable the coupling between membrane-constituent lipids and the CNT surface, resulting in tight seals of cell membrane around the CNT probe 48 . The CNT device with a diameter of ~100–200 nm requires a membrane penetration force ranging from a few hundreds of piconewtons to tens of nanonewtons 49 . During intracellular measurement, by confining the interaction between CNT and the first few layers of surrounding ions or molecules, the interference from the rest of the cell volume can be avoided, leading to an increase in sensitivity and selectivity. In addition to intracellular measurement of small amplitude of electrical signals, the CNT nanopipette can also probe single organelles and monitor the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential in response to nanopipette insertion. Mitochondria are important for maintaining intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis because of their ability to buffer Ca 2+ , especially in the case of calcium elevation 50 . In the experiment by Singhal et al. , slight membrane hyperpolarization was observed in the mitochondria located near the CNT nanopipette tip, suggesting that the mitochondria sequestered Ca 2+ from their surroundings and forced the generation of additional energy. \nTo decrease the fabrication difficulties encountered in the construction of CNT nanopipettes, Yoon et al. have developed a new self-entanglement method 51 . The self-entangled CNT tip is assembled through dielectrophoresis with an electrochemically sharpened tungsten probe and multi-walled CNTs dispersed in solution. The probe has been used for intracellular recordings from vertebrate neurons in vitro and in vivo . In electrical measurement, impedance is also an important property for studying cellular functions and activities. Yun et al. have synthesized CNTs into the shape of towers and have embedded them into microfluidic channels as electrodes 52 for impedance measurement of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. To achieve parallel measurement, CNTs or carbon nanofibers (bundles of CNTs) have been built into vertically aligned sensing arrays for monitoring cell electrical activities or delivering materials (e.g., plasmid DNA molecules) into cells 53 , 54 . Intracellular optical measurement \nFor intracellular sensing using optical means, high-resolution optical detection is required and noise from neighboring sites must be minimized. Hence, researchers have developed near-field fluorescence imaging techniques to distinguish target signals from neighboring noise 55 , 56 . In near-field imaging, optical probes are directly inserted into single cells, and optical waves are transmitted to an external measurement instrument. Due to the small size and high efficiency in transmitting light, nanowires are excellent structures for building optical probes 57 , 58 . Using nanowires, Yan et al. have developed an optical intracellular endoscope that is able to accurately detect and record fluorescent signals ( Figure 2d ) 35 . The nanowire endoscope has a SiO 2 nanowire waveguide fixed on the tapered tip of an optical fiber and is inserted into a cell by using a micromanipulator. The endoscope can be optically coupled to either an excitation laser to work as a local light source for subcellular imaging or a spectrometer to collect local optical signals. It is capable of sensing pH changes by coating the nanowire tip with a polymer embedded with pH-sensitive dyes. Additionally, the endoscope is also able to collect fluorescence signals from a single quantum dot cluster in subcellular regions. Signal collection is highly sensitive to the distance between the quantum dot cluster and the nanowire tip, which enables high-resolution fluorescence mapping and probing of the interior of non-transparent living biological objects. \nTo detect the optical signal inside a cell, another device has been developed using GaAs nanowires. The device consists of photonic crystal cavities and functions as an intracellular nanoprobe for both sensing and photonic control 59 . The semiconductor nanocavity probe emits photoluminescence from embedded quantum dots and sustains high-quality resonant photonic modes inside a cell. The probes are minimally invasive to cells. They have been inserted into cells for days without interfering with regular cell division. After surface modification with biotin, the nanophotonic probes are able to perform in vitro label-free protein sensing to detect streptavidin. Modified AFM probes \nStandard AFM cantilevers have a conical or a pyramidal tip. There are a number of techniques for modifying the standard AFM tip. As shown in Figure 3a , a standard AFM tip has been modified, via focused ion beam (FIB), into a straight, long nanoneedle with a high aspect ratio structure of 100–300 nm in diameter and 2–20 µm in length depending on the original height of the AFM tip 63 ,​", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T13:28:37.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
