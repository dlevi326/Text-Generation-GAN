If Congress and the administration can't agree on a continuing resolution by Sept. 30, another partial shutdown will result. Any movement in the Republican-led on the Federal Employee Fair Treatment Act from Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) Senate is unlikely, especially in the short time before the end of the current appropriations period. The legislation was endorsed by the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal employees. 18F hackathon, round 2 \nThe General Services Administration's 18F outfit is hosting another hackathon Oct. 16. \nParticipants in the day-long event will be able to work on one data visualization or one of two data mashup projects at 18F headquarters in Washington, D.C. \nAt 18F's previous hackathon in May, two teams composed of various industry and academic representatives won the day, giving 18F a handful of data-cleaning solutions for $12,000 in prize money. The new 'free online school stuff' czar \nAndrew Marcinek will be the Education Department's first open education adviser. \nIn announcing the hire, the department said Marcinek would work in the Office of Educational Technology, and that his role will revolve around connecting public school teachers across the country with free learning materials online, from podcasts to games to text for courses. \n\"The use of openly licensed resources not only allows states and districts to adapt and modify materials to meet student needs, but also frees up funding to support the transition to digital learning,\" said OET Director Richard Culatta. \nMarcinek has served in a variety of education technology roles over his career, most recently as a co-founder of consulting team EducatorU and director of technology for a public school district in Massachusetts. Contractor survey pans sequester \nThe 2013 sequestration has had a significant impact on federal contractors, according to Grant Thornton's 2015 Government Contractor Survey released Sept. 17. \nThe survey noted that 42 percent of the more than small, medium and large federal contractors it polled for the study reported increased revenue from government contracts, while 37 percent reported reduced revenue. The remaining 21 percent reported no significant changes. \n\"The percentage of companies experiencing reductions is at the high end of the trends that we have noted over the many years we have published this survey,\" according to the study. \"The reductions this year are the inevitable consequence of altered government spending priorities as well as sequestration; this will almost certainly be resolved in the next year or two.\" About the Author \nConnect with the FCW staff on Twitter @FCWnow . <>", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T03:20:03.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
