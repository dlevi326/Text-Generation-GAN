Senior executives from more than a hundred key vendor partners attended the event together with Liberty Global's management teams in the areas of technology, IT, product development and procurement. \nLiberty Global recognized its partners’ achievements in five categories: Best Product & Service Quality, Best Support & After Sales, Best Innovation & Breakthrough, Most Sustainable Supplier and PartnerSpark. \nThe award for Best Product & Service Quality was won by Huawei, the Best Support & After Sales award was won by Prodapt, the award for Best Innovation & Breakthrough went to Alcatel Lucent and the Most Sustainable Supplier award was won by Cisco.

In this way, Liberty Global acknowledges its relationships with its partners and suppliers, especially those relationships that have structurally supported high level development and innovation across its business. \nThe Technology Summit was also the stage for Liberty Global’s second TV Appathon. Over 100 developers competed in teams over 48 hours to make the most innovative, intuitive, unique, appealing and technically superior TV app for Liberty Global’s next-generation video platform Horizon TV. \nThe winning team from tech company aFrogleap created a ‘Horizon LIVE’ app which will be launched soon on Horizon’s TV App Store and as a second screen app for smartphones and tablets. The app enables users to select shows on Horizon’s Replay TV service based on the number of interactions on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. \nThe TV Appathon is an annual event aimed at the countries where the Horizon TV service is available, thereby opening up its ecosystem for external TV app development and mobilizing both the international and local development communities of content providers and developers. Liberty Global’s TV App Store contains over 300 apps and is available to more than two million customers in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary. \nThe event was also attended by five young people from CoderDojo, a global movement sponsored on a pan-European basis by Liberty Global that provides young people with the opportunity to learn how to code.
