By leveraging the latest APIs available from leading operating system platforms Android and Apple iOS, ACE provides a development framework requiring minimal effort for developers while eliminating scalability issues associated with SDKs and App Wrapping technology. StarMobile joins more than 40 ACE member companies, a program created by AirWatch, Box, Cisco, Salesforce, Workday and Xamarin.\n“The consumerization of mobility within the enterprise is redefining business operations and processes like never before and IT and line of business need tools to meet these challenges”, said Mimi Spier, senior director of Strategic Business Development, VMware and Leader of ACE. “StarMobile joining ACE simplifies the development and deployment of mobile applications within the enterprise, and we’re thrilled that StarMobile is helping us to drive the ACE initiative.”\nStarMobile radically simplifies enterprise mobility by dynamically transforming any packaged on-premises (e.g., SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Infor, etc.) or cloud-based application (e.g., Salesforce, Workday, etc.), or custom-built system (including legacy “green-screen” applications), and any workflow into a mobile app with a native user experience. Therein, StarMobile leverages the enterprise’s existing investments in applications, workflows, infrastructure, data, and security without having to re-create them on each mobile device platform.\n“Traditional mobile app development has been, complex, time-consuming and expensive. As a result, 85% of companies have yet to deploy meaningful enterprise apps beyond email, calendar and contacts,” said StarMobile President and CEO, Todd Fryburger. “By working with AirWatch as part of the ACE initiative, customers can use the StarMobile platform to deliver enterprise mobility with unmatched speed, simplicity, economy and security. Therein, StarMobile helps companies to bridge the 'app gap' to consume any application from any endpoint (be it smartphone, tablet, PC, watch or “thing”), while at the same time simplifying security and control.”\nStarMobile was recently named a “Cool Vendor in Mobile App Development, 2015 by Gartner and an Emerging Vendor by CRN. StarMobile is currently showcasing their ACE solution in the Mobility Expo at AirWatch Connect.\nAbout StarMobile\nStarMobile is a codeless, cloud-based enterprise mobility platform that delivers any application to any endpoint, with a native user experience, faster, simpler and at a lower cost than any other approach.
