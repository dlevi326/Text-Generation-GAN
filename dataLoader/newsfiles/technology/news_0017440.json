TESEO DRAW also enhances performance in built-up areas, such as in urban canyons, where conventional navigation systems can lose accuracy. \nTESEO DRAW merges the satellite information with data from vehicle sensors such as the gyroscope, accelerometer, and wheel-speed sensors, to calculate location accurately in three dimensions including elevation. If the satellite signal is poor, TESEO DRAW compensates for the loss of accuracy, and if the signal becomes unavailable, navigation continues uninterrupted based on calculated location (dead reckoning). Road tests carried out by ST in difficult under-cover and urban environments have demonstrated continuous tracking from entry to exit in complex multi-level car parks, and at street level between tall buildings, where conventional systems have been unable to track the vehicle. \nGNSS 1 has revolutionized activities such as commercial logistics, asset management, and personal mobility. Over four billion GNSS devices are now in use worldwide 2 . By enabling high-accuracy 3D dead reckoning, TESEO DRAW expands the opportunities for developers to commercialize new applications. \n\"TESEO DRAW strengthens GNSS performance and eliminates barriers to continuity, enabling exciting new services to emerge,\" said Fabio Marchi√≤, Microcontroller and Infotainment Division General Manager, Automotive Product Group, STMicroelectronics. \"Users can also experience significant improvements in existing services such as fleet tracking, eCall, or ERA-GLONASS emergency response, usage-based insurance, road tolling, and anti-theft systems.\" \nTESEO DRAW firmware has multiple modes and is capable of referring to sensors on the vehicle's CAN bus or discrete sensors such as the odometer, reverse sensor, MEMS accelerometer and gyroscope, or MEMS inertial module connected to the TESEO III IC. \nST is the world's top-ranked supplier of MEMS motion sensors for automotive navigation 3 , telematics, and vehicle alarm systems, and is a leading provider of navigation engines with its TESEO IC family. With the launch of TESEO DRAW firmware, ST is uniquely able to provide a unified platform comprising navigation engines, 3D positioning capability, and motion sensors. \nTESEO III ICs loaded with the new TESEO DRAW firmware are sampling now, and will enter mass production in Q1 2016. \nAbout STMicroelectronics \nST is a global semiconductor leader delivering intelligent and energy-efficient products and solutions that power the electronics at the heart of everyday life. ST's products are found everywhere today, and together with our customers, we are enabling smarter driving and smarter factories, cities and homes, along with the next generation of mobile and Internet of Things devices.
