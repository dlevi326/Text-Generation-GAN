The new Trustwave Secure Mobility Platform helps businesses quickly discover and address security weaknesses and maintain compliance -- bolstering security in an era when businesses are increasingly using mobile devices including smartphones, tablets and mobile point-of-sale devices as business-critical, customer-facing tools. \nFor example, a distributed enterprise that introduces mobile devices into various locations needs to ensure that those devices are being used appropriately and where they are at any time. The Trustwave Secure Mobility Platform can help ensure security functions and policies are enforced -- helping the business use mobile technologies while following security best practices and complying with regulatory compliance standards. \n\"With smartphones and tablets rapidly replacing desktop computers for many business functions, and wearables and Internet-of-Things connectivity merging into the mix, it's critical that the scope of businesses' security practices moves beyond BYOD and the confines of the corporate network,\" said John Amaral, senior vice president of product management at Trustwave. \"The Trustwave Secure Mobility Platform does not require a team of expensive full-time employees or infrastructure to install, support and maintain mobile security solutions. Our new, cloud-based platform for mobile security is supported by our experienced team of managed security services experts across our global security operations centers who can install, monitor, update and manage businesses' mobile security controls.\" \nThe Trustwave Secure Mobility Platform helps organizations with all aspects of secure mobility, from applications to data and all communication in-between. The Trustwave Secure Mobility Platform delivers: Security controls for Android and iOS devices: The Trustwave Secure Mobility Platform includes security and compliance controls for both Android and iOS devices. It gives businesses the power to identify the security posture of their devices such as if screen locks and passcodes are activated, if the device is configured to use an internet proxy server, if the device's storage is encrypted, the device's physical location and other characteristics. Businesses can also remotely wipe the device, view and monitor all their mobile endpoints, and scan applications before and after they are installed to detect malware. Proactive protection for mobile point-of-sale (POS) systems: The Trustwave Secure Mobility Platform also brings proactive protection to mobile POS systems. Businesses using mobile POS devices have the same responsibility for maintaining compliance with cardholder data as they do with fixed POS devices. A secure card reader is critical but isn't enough. The Trustwave Secure Mobility Platform helps businesses protect against fraudulent use of their mobile POS devices and alerts them to tampering with applications on the device. The platform also delivers proactive protection and defense against malware and other threats. Anti-virus for Android devices: The Trustwave Secure Mobility Platform provides a way to scan applications before they are installed to detect malware, and scan installed applications for the presence of malware. It can also scan attachments in emails, and downloads from web browsers. Mobile \"health check\" visibility through the cloud: The Trustwave Secure Mobility Platform conducts security and compliance \"health checks\" and reports that information back through the cloud to the Trustwave TrustKeeper速 portal. Trustwave TrustKeeper delivers centralized, integrated and on-demand management of security and compliance allowing businesses to view and monitor both mobile and desktop endpoint security in a single view. \nFuture releases of the Trustwave Secure Mobility Platform are planned to feature integration with Trustwave's anti-malware service to protect mobile devices from advanced malware attacks. It will also feature two-factor authentication, enforcement of device policies such as the required use of a passcode and virtual private networks, the ability to send alerts after a device travels beyond a specific location and other capabilities. \nThe new platform complements Trustwave's existing security services for mobile endpoints which include mobile application penetration testing delivered by the elite Trustwave SpiderLabs 速 team as well as other services for mobile security. \nTo learn more about the Trustwave Secure Mobility Platform, visit: https://www.trustwave.com/Solutions/By-Challenge/Secure-Mobility-Platform/ . \nAbout Trustwave Trustwave helps businesses fight cybercrime, protect data and reduce security risk.
