On August 31, 2015 , SMCI disclosed that it would be unable to timely file its Form 10-K for the 2015 fiscal year due to accounting irregularities. According the allegations of a recently filed securities class action pending the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California , Case Number 15-cv-4049, SMCI committed securities fraud in connection with the foregoing. Our investigation concerns whether the Company board of directors has breached its fiduciary duties to shareholders, grossly mismanaged the Company, and/or committed abuses of control in connection with the foregoing. If you own SMCI shares and wish to discuss this matter with us, or have any questions concerning your rights and interests with regard to this matter, please contact: Robert I.
