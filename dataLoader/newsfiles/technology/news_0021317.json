By Lance Winslow | Submitted On September 04, 2015 \nTrust in Government seems to be at an all-time low in the United States, but why? Perhaps it is the election year where politicians opposing the current leadership call into question their dereliction of duty or embellish how bad things really are - or maybe it is all those hacking events. Our personal data stolen from government computers, our identities and tax return money stolen from the IRS data bases, and our medical records out in cyberspace even as we are forced to give more of our information to our government. \nThere was a rather telling article in Space War published on May 8, 2015 titled; \"Former US government employee tried to sell nuclear secrets\" by Staff Writers in Washington DC, which stated; \"A former Department of Energy employee has been indicted after attempting to hack agency computers to steal and then sell nuclear secrets to Iran, China and Venezuela, US officials said.\" \nWe've sure had a lot of secrets end up in our adversaries' hands over the last decade. Consider the Wiki Leaks guy, Julian Assange, or the Army Intelligence officer, Bradley Edward Manning, now known as Chelsea Elizabeth Manning, or other smaller blunders and you can see we have a problem; but why? \nIs it the lack of responsibility, self-righteousness, the need for acclaim and 15-minutes of fame, or is it something else? Is it about money for information? Is it about freeing information? What is going on today? It doesn't seem to be getting better, it appears to be getting worse. We've had defense contractors sell jet engine information to the Chinese, we've had corporate R&D employees of fortune 100 companies sell technical data to foreign competitors and rogue nations. As someone who follows the news on such things I see alarm bells ringing. \nWorse, we are not stopping the problem, in fact it is accelerating in numbers and in volume of data and information lost, stolen, and sold to the highest bidder. We've lost $100s of billions in proprietary information and we risked the lives of our service men and women, jeopardized our allies and global partners. What the hell is going on, I dare to ask. \nNo I am hardly the first person to write such scathing articles on this topic, and unfortunately, I won't be the last, and all we seem to be doing at the government level is throwing more good money after bad to clean up the act and prevent hackers from stealing our data. How can we trust them to protect us, when they can't even protect their own computer systems? Hmm - think on it. \nLance Winslow is the Founder of the Online Think Tank, a diverse group of achievers, experts, innovators, entrepreneurs, thinkers, futurists, academics, dreamers, leaders, and general all around brilliant minds. http://www.WorldThinkTank.net - Have an important subject to discuss, contact Lance Winslow.
