National Coordinator Maurice Smithers helps Nkhumiseni Tshivhase navigate around the new mobi site which is aimed at strengthening civil society and as a platform for people to connect and engage. Picture: Ilanit Chernick \nThe people’s platform for social justice Awethu! yesterday launched a text-based mobile website created to strengthen civil society and for people to connect and engage in discussions. \n“We want to use this platform to boost efforts to fight for social justice in South Africa,” said Awethu! national co-ordinator Maurice Smithers. \nAwethu! mobi users will be able to load civil-society news and events, start discussions and access resources, including the Bill of Rights and the constitution, in all official languages. \n“It’s a mobile site for everyone, not just Awethu!. We have created this to meet the needs of those who have the slowest internet connections and the cheapest phones, so anyone, wherever they are, can access it,” Smithers explained. \nHe added it was important to get the word out so people knew that there was a network to connect with. \nSmithers said the posts could be directed to the relevant NGOs and civil-society movements. \n“There will be moderation to check posts and discussions… this is nonpartisan and non-political; there are rules about what people can post or upload.” \nSmithers said anyone from around the country could register and access the site. \n“From there you can post events and discuss issues facing South Africa’s civil societies and social justice system. \n“For example, if there is corruption, Corruption Watch can be contacted on the mobi site, and advice and help can be given,” he said. \nDuring the site launch, there was a panel discussion with Awethu! and several NGOs about the state of civil society in South Africa. One of the main issues raised was that of funding and resources from the government. \nDavid Makhafola from the Southern African NGO Network said there was a serious funding crisis. “Community-based organisations and NGOs are compromised because of the absence of funding. The government cannot satisfy funding needs. We need to organise within ourselves. There is a need for the government and country to develop a funding process,” he said. \nAnother issue was that NGOs and community-based organisations were disjointed. \nNkhumiseni Tshivhase of the Thohoyandou Victim Empowerment Programme urged civil-society organisations to join forces, adding: “If we stand together, we can achieve more. Using this mobi site we, who work with survivors of sexual violence, can connect to other NGOs and community-based organisations creating a stronger network. It’s a platform for us to engage with others from around the country.” \nThe website includes a discussion board, a place to post events relating to civil society and a social justice library. \nGo to awethu.org.za", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T15:02:58.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
