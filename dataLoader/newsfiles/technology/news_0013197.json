Adaptive Lifecycle eliminates the need for marketers to set up and configure complex email campaign builders and segmentation tools, as it automatically makes data-backed decisions about when to engage a customer and how. “There’s been a lot of recent buzz about marketing automation, but most solutions have only halfway delivered, still relying on marketers to manually segment their customer base, create campaigns and determine the optimal timing,” said Jerry Jao, CEO of Retention Science. “With Adaptive Lifecycle, machines decide how best to nurture each customer and ensure there are no missed conversion opportunities.”\nThe Adaptive Lifecycle platform processes millions of customer signals daily, and uses that data to intelligently reach each individual customer throughout their lifecycle, whether they are brand new to the business or loyal repeat customers. It sends them relevant content, coupons, and products at the exact moment when they are most likely to make a purchase or potentially churn, and only presents the smallest incentive needed to convert them.\nFor example, a fashion retailer may have a longstanding customer who went dormant who will receive a deep discount to re-engage them, whereas a new customer will receive a welcome message and an introductory offer. All of this happens automatically after the retailer feeds the content and offers into the system up front.\n“Email drip campaigns are great for building relationships with customers and prompting them to take action, but they can be incredibly laborious,” said Jao. “Adaptive Lifecycle eliminates this burden and frees up marketers to instead focus on bigger-picture strategies and campaigns.”\nActions supported by Adaptive Lifecycle include true predictive measures such as At Risk of Churning, Completely Churned, or Ready for a Promotion, as well as standard triggers such as Abandon Cart, Price Drops, Replenishment, and Product Back in Stock – all powered by Retention Science’s predictive product recommendations and incentive optimization. For setup, marketers only need to insert JavaScript tracking code into their website and provide their preferred email templates, incentives and information about their products, and Adaptive Lifecycle’s machine learning models will begin automating their campaigns on an ongoing basis.\nABOUT RETENTION SCIENCE\nRetention Science, the global leader in Retention Marketing, helps retailers and brands understand, engage and retain their customers.
