The company said the drug was generally well-tolerated, but a Data Safety Monitoring Board review found the drug wasn't effective enough to continue.\nVerastem said it is no longer enrolling patients in the Phase 2 study and has initiated a wind-down.\nThe company said it would re-evaluate its priorities and focus its resources on its other treatments.\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n(END) 28, 2015 08:45 ET (12:45 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T16:54:59.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
