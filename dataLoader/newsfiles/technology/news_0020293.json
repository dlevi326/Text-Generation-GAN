With the introduction of the N10 – featuring one of the smallest EAS antennas on the market -- those limitations are gone.” \nThe N10 uses Checkpoint’s latest generation of detection platforms, which includes jammer detection for organized retail crime attempts to defeat the system, and the latest noise filtering and reduction software to ensure the N10 always performs at an optimum level. \nIts bright LED lit acrylic design acts as a highly effective visual deterrent for potential theft. The N10 can be wall or door-frame mounted or sited on an optional free-standing floor mount. In addition, retailers can swivel the antenna in any direction, as well as spin and tuck it out of the way when needed. \nRetailers using the N10 can choose from an enormous range of product tagging solutions from Checkpoint, including Alpha High Theft Solutions, as well as hard tags and soft labels. \nConsumers benefit from improved on-shelf product availability and open merchandising via the theft reduction effects of EAS, and the active deterrent N10 provides in reducing theft attempts in the protected stores. In addition, because of its smaller size, shoppers’ movements aren’t restricted. \nClassic N10 is available immediately. \nAbout Checkpoint Systems, Inc.
