They’re designed to help you improve your workplace visuals, with color that gets noticed, shapes that look and fit just right, and unbelievable ease of use so anyone can walk up and print.”\nKey printer features include:\nMultiple Print Colors: Both printers feature remarkable color printing because color is a differentiator when it comes to effectively improving workplace safety and productivity.

Faster Printing: Both printers feature automatic label setup so users can start printing immediately, drop-in ribbons and labels for 20-second material changeovers, and 5-inches-per-second print speed. Ease of Use: Designed to be intuitive so anyone can easily print labels, these printers are ideal for multiple users, centralized locations and lean/5S events. They’re also compatible with Brady Workstation Label Apps for added versatility. In addition to these features, the new BBP37 and BBP35 printers offer a wide variety of Brady’s durable label supplies.
