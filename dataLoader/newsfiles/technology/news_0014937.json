Gordon Gee made commercialization a priority toward the end of his tenure at Ohio State, but he retired in July 2013. \nTwo of Ohio’s largest research hubs, Ohio State University and the Cleveland Clinic, announced with gusto three years ago that they were joining forces to commercialize their medical-related work. \nOne official at the time called it “sharing the DNA of the two institutions.” \nBut leadership changes and key departures at both institutions have sapped momentum from the partnership, which officials at the time billed as “Ohio’s largest medical-commercialization network.” \nThe loss of momentum comes as data released last week show Ohio State still lags most of its Big Ten peers in licensing income. \nDespite total research spending of $982.5 million in 2014, third behind the University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin, Ohio State ranked 11th among the conference’s 14 schools in licensing income, at $2.2 million. \nNearly half of that $982.5 million came from the federal government, while another $118 million came from for-profit corporations. A breakdown was not available for the rest of those research dollars. \nBy comparison, among other academic and medical institutions in the state, Ohio University had licensing income of $10.7 million, while Case Western Reserve University’s licensing income was $3.2 million. The Cleveland Clinic drew in $16.2 million. \nThe 2014 data were released by the Association of University Technology Managers. \nRecent efforts to stoke collaboration between Ohio State and the Cleveland Clinic are taking place within broader meetings that include research partners such as Case Western, Ohio University and the University of Cincinnati, a Cleveland Clinic official said. \n“We’re trying to re-engage that right now, actually,” said Brian Kolonick, general manager of the Global Healthcare Innovations Alliance at Cleveland Clinic Innovations, the health system’s corporate-venture branch. \nOhio State and Cleveland Clinic officials met regularly for several months after the initiative was announced in July 2012. \nBut Kolonick said those meetings came to a halt about the time Ohio State’s then-vice president for technology commercialization, Brian Cummings, resigned in September 2013. That was followed a year later by the departure of Greg Wilson, director of business development at Ohio State’s Wexner Medical Center. \nPresident E. Gordon Gee made commercialization a priority toward the end of his tenure at Ohio State but retired in July 2013. He now is president of West Virginia University. \nThe Cleveland Clinic also has seen leadership changes. In 2012, Christopher Coburn, executive director of Cleveland Clinic Innovations, told a crowd gathered at Ohio State’s Technology Commercialization Office on N. High Street that “there really can be no more significant alliance than this teaming of our two institutions up and down I-71.” \nCoburn later moved on to a job in Boston. \n“I think it was time and allocation of scarce resources,” Kolonick said in explaining the lull in activity. “Leadership changes affect a lot of people down the line.” \nBut he said there haven’t been any rifts in the relationship between the Cleveland Clinic and Ohio State, which at times are competitors. \nOhio State’s Dr. Ali Rezai, director of the university’s neurological institute, said the change in leadership and reorganizations have challenged the partnership in recent years. \nOvercoming the challenges “requires communication that has been going on,” Rezai said. “Everyone is very positive.” He said that includes OSU President Dr. Michael V. Drake. \nRezai said the Neurotechnology Innovations Translator will formally begin in Columbus later this month, with plans to launch seven to nine seed companies within four years. The for-profit company will commercialize neurotechnology-related innovations at Ohio State and other institutions. \nOhio State will commit $20 million to the project, and the state’s Third Frontier program is kicking in an additional $21 million. Significant private investment also is coming from Minneapolis-based Medtronic, Cardinal Health and venture capitalists. \nWhile the Cleveland Clinic isn’t a formal partner on that project, Rezai said at least one of those seed companies — which haven’t been selected yet — might be built on the fruits of Cleveland Clinic research. \nOhio State officials acknowledged that the scope of the partnership, which set out in 2012 to identify 20 technologies as initial commercialization priorities, eventually narrowed on Rezai’s neuromodulation work. Neuromodulation uses implantable devices that alter activity in the nervous system through the use of electrical stimulation.“It was an experiment,” university spokesman Chris Davey said of Ohio State’s partnership with the Cleveland Clinic. “The direction that it took is not exactly the trajectory that may have been envisioned at the outset, but there were still some great collaborative efforts between the institutions. \n“Ohio State is perfectly willing to be entrepreneurial, and to be entrepreneurial means that you take risks.” \nDavey said Ohio State is not satisfied with its recent track record in commercializing its technology. “We are very focused on improving those numbers,” he said. \nBut he added, “I would caution against taking one specific innovative and experimental attempt at a collaborative partnership with another institution and then drawing a big, broad conclusion about what that means about technology commercialization at Ohio State.” \nAsked for evidence that technology commercialization has been a priority during Drake’s administration, OSU officials cited the recent establishment of the Accelerator Awards, a $950,000 internal funding program that helps researchers develop and market their inventions. \nDavey also said in an email: “We are seeing productive activity increase throughout the economic development pipeline, with more early stage concepts progressing on to secondary- and third-level stages of funding. That demonstrates the increasing quality of our pipeline.” \nFor example, Rev1 Ventures, a Columbus-based business incubator, expects to spin out six to eight Ohio State startups this year, up from three last year. \nBroad intellectual-property partnerships such as the Ohio State-Cleveland Clinic deal are complex. They can be more susceptible to leadership changes than affiliations that focus on clinical care, such as jointly operating a hospital, said Daniel Zismer, an affiliations expert and Wegmiller professor in the division of health policy and management at the University of Minnesota. \n“Deals come together with the experience and thinking of the leaders,” Zismer said. “You change the leaders and that disappears.” \nMoney, control and differing views among institutions about intellectual property also can challenge and sometimes scuttle intellectual-property ventures, Zismer said. \nAnd if the partnership is open-ended, as the Cleveland Clinic-Ohio State affiliation is, it can lead to thinking such as, “If I commit to this, what can’t I commit to someplace else?” Zismer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T13:50:46.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
