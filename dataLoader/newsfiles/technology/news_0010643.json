LiDAR technology has been around in the military and research circles, since the early 1960s. A typical LiDAR system mainly consists of three major components, namely laser sensor, global positioning system (GPS) unit, and an inertial navigation unit. The light detection and ranging system sends out laser pulses at the object/area to be mapped, and collects data by recording the pulses reflected by/from the object. In certain instances, as many as 100,000 such pulses are sent out every second. The European LiDAR market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 12.2% from 2014 to 2019.Initially, light detection and ranging systems were considered to be very bulky, hence they were quite expensive. Recent advancements made in the LiDAR technological process have revamped the size of a LiDAR system down to a point, wherein LiDAR technology has become an accurate and affordable solution. Therefore, advancement in the GPS and inertial navigation unit has resulted in propelling the growth of the LiDAR market in Europe.The report segments the market on the basis of product, application, and geography.
