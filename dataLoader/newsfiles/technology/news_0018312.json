(\"Rick\") Smith, Chief Executive Officer of Securus Technologies, Inc. \n\"In November, 2014 we purchased an exclusive with Vanu Tactical for their MAS product set, and in January, 2015 we purchased CellBlox and an exclusive with cellXion for additional MAS technology. On September 16, 2015 - we purchased additional technology and a United States Patent that helps to protect our investments,\" said Smith. \n\"MAS is a perfect complement to our high-tech software based product set - we want to help make the prisons and jails in the United States safe, secure, and productive environments for corrections and law enforcement as well as for inmates. We can assist in getting inmates educated and ready to get back into society better prepared to stay out of that environment for good. Getting contraband out of facilities is part of the solution - so we like our investments in MAS and have the best product set that exists in our industry to accomplish that solution. \n\"MAS systems do not usually stand on their own economically - but when we combine them with inmate audio communications, video, jail management systems, electronic medical records, grievance reporting, data analytics, parolee GPS tracking, location based services, inmate tablets, electronic books, and inmate education/job searches - that is a bundle of products that helps everyone,\" said Smith. \nABOUT SECURUS TECHNOLOGIES \nHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas, and serving more than 2,900 public safety, law enforcement and corrections agencies and over 1,200,000 inmates across North America, Securus Technologies is committed to serve and connect by providing emergency response, incident management, public information, investigation, biometric analysis, communication, information management, inmate self-service, and monitoring products and services in order to make our world a safer place to live.
