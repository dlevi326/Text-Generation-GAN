The online payment platform backed by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings will be roll out in phases at Marriott hotels. It will launch at 10 Marriott hotels in Greater China, in Shanghai Beijing, Sanya, Hainan province and Hong Kong.

Alipay can be used to pay for Marriott hotel reservations, in food and beverage outlets, and for conferences. Alipay says it has 400 million registered users responsible for 120 million transactions every day. Alipay reputedly has a 80% share of China's mobile payment market, a major motivation for Marriott to adopt the service. \"We have chosen to work with Marriott because of its highly celebrated brand image as well as its grand expansion plans both in Asia and the world. \"This is what we are looking for in our strategy,\" said Peng Yijie, president of international business at Ant Financial, the Alibaba affiliate which operates Alipay.
