Share on twitter by David Ramli The next time you make a Facebook complaint or tweet in anger at a Telstra staffer, be ready for the messages to last forever – even if you delete your accounts.\nLithium Social Web is a social media management platform used by Telstra, Vodafone Netherlands and Canon, among other companies, to deal with customers who contact them using Facebook or Twitter.\nOn Sunday, Dutch researcher Henk van Ess found that Lithium stores the entire transcript of the conversations between customers and the companies in a way that lets anyone find them using a simple Google search.\nOnce you have the internet address accessing other unseen accounts is merely a matter of changing the last six digits, which represent the thousands upon thousands of conversations that have taken place between the companies and their customers.\nA search through some of Telstra's recent chats with its users reveals most of the comments are public rants about poor service – unsurprising because customers rarely put in effort to praise their service providers for getting a positive experience.\nNone of the conversations held private data, apart from a customer who exclaimed they secretly ate entire bars of chocolate for breakfast. Telstra staff engaged in good practice by shifting users on to a separate private messaging service when they worked out what people wanted and needed to access their account details.\nBut many of the messages came from customers who had hidden their accounts from public view. Mr van Ess said some were even from deleted accounts that can no longer be found on Facebook or Twitter's systems – clearly a sign that the owners don't want to be found.\nTelstra is adamant that none of the messages are private and that customer privacy and security is paramount.\n \"The service provides customers to ability to engage in conversation and review their dialogue with Telstra in real time or at a point in the future,\" a Telstra spokesman said. \"It is a user's choice what he/she may choose to share on a social network, either by posting directly to a Telstra page, or by tagging @Telstra in a post to include us in a conversation.\n\"When either of these actions is taken the post becomes publicly available [and] regularly reminds customers of the public nature of the channel their dialogue is taking place [in].\"\nAnd on this point Telstra makes an excellent point: Fairfax Media found no evidence that things like credit card details or dates of birth were revealed.\nIf a customer had foolishly posted their personal details into any of these messages, thinking that merely adding the @Telstra tag in a post would keep it private, then these could also be free for anyone trawling the web to read.\nBut this is largely a symptom of the internet era we now live in – where every whisper becomes a shout across the ether and any programmer with the right skills can bring them all into a single book, filled with the rants and taunts of angry customers.\nRants and taunts that will last forever thanks to the internet – even if you delete your Facebook or Twitter accounts.", "external_links": ["https://www.rebelmouse.com/henkvaness/", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-09-24T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:17:40.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
