The enhanced range – which now boasts over 100 million possible product variants – offers greater flexibility for customers in sectors including defence, aerospace, industrial and medical. Zettlex InCoder Sensors \nZettlex IncOders are high precision, inductive encoders aimed at high reliability measurement of angle or angular velocity. Their non-contact design means they are ideally suited to the defence sector’s particular demands for precision and reliability in tough conditions, as well as its requirement for high levels of quality assurance, long term support and confidentiality. \nThe new expanded IncOder range includes 37mm (mini), 58mm (midi) and 300mm (maxi) diameter sizes. In addition, there is a new range of external mount stators and shaft clamp rotors, providing a wider choice of installation options for designers; increased options on connections, cabling, and measurement resolutions; improved measurement performance with faster update rates; the ability to select how many counts per revolution the IncOder produces. \n“The demand for IncOders continues to grow and Zettlex has responded with even greater product choice,” said Mark Howard, Zettlex General Manager. “We are already seeing significant, volume demand for the new mini and midi models and the economies of scale realised from larger production volumes are making IncOders an affordable alternative for mainstream industrial applications.” \nZettlex products are not ITAR controlled and contain no ITAR components. The company supplies standard and OEM products to defence equipment manufacturers for a wide variety of applications, including azimuth and elevation position controls; fire control and weapon safety systems; stabilised platforms; missile launchers, seekers and fin actuation controls. \nThe expanded product range will be available for the first time to visitors to the Zettlex booth at the DSEI show at ExCeL London. Selection of the correct product for a specific application will be made even easier with the release of a detailed and new-look IncOder Product Guide is available on-line at www.zettlex.com/shop/incoder", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T23:21:10.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
