The augmented technology covers the real world with computer generated data, which entirely changes the consumer experience. It changes what we see, feel, and hear. Augmented reality is a direct, indirect, or live view of a real-world environment, whose features are supplemented by a system generated sensory input involving video, graphics, and sound or GPS data. Virtual reality involves the creation of a virtual world that interacts with consumers. This virtual world is designed in a way that it appears more realistic to the users, while they cant differentiate between the real and virtual. Moreover, virtual reality could be experienced by wearing a virtual reality helmet, or goggles similar to oculus rift (which is a virtual reality headset device that completely engages users within the virtual world). Oculus rift is expected to be one of the key drivers for the global augmented and virtual reality market, with its launch in the first quarter of 2016. In virtual reality the user is secluded from the real world, and is immersed in a world that is completely fictional.
