Image caption James Schall is a senior director at SEGA, he started his career working in a video games shop dusting shelves Tip 1: Be passionate and communicate well \nJames says: \"Find out which gaming companies are near you and engage with them on Twitter and Facebook. \n\"Talk to companies in a way that proves you love what they do. They are more likely to talk to you if you say that you loved a game because of this level or that level. \n\"It shows not only are you interested in them but you've got some passion about you and that goes a long way.\" Image caption James works for SEGA which publishes the long running and successful Total War series of strategy games Image caption Samantha, 19, from Milton Keynes was at the EGX careers fair. She says she wants to work in gaming because \"you can create alternate universes and that's amazing\" Tip 2: Don't wait for job adverts \nJames' next piece of advice is to: \"send people your CV and show you're interested in them whether they've got a job going or not. \n\"Research is key. That's not only for the companies you're interested in and what they do. You should also research who you should speak with. \n\"The worst thing they can do is say no.\" Image caption Sam, 20, from Aylesbury wants to be a character artist, he knows there's a lot of competition but says that's not putting him off Tip 3: Get modding \nJames explains that: \"modding\" is huge part of gaming now. \n\"The system called Steam has an element on it called Steam Workshop where you can go in and fiddle with game code, create new maps, levels and characters. \n\"If you create a map and publish it on a network like that and a bunch of people like it, then that really stands out. \n\"It adds to your CV and it adds to the story you're telling.\" Image caption Football manager is one of the most popular titles that SEGA publish Tip 4: Gaming needs you! \nJames says: \"you don't need to be a physicist or a mathematician to work in gaming. \n\"We need people across a whole broad range of careers. \n\"Things like sales, HR, design, artwork, drama students for motion capture. \n\"We need business analysts, people who are just really good at Facebook and Youtube. \n\"You need a huge range of people to make a game\" Image caption Tye is 18 and from Milton Keynes. She says wants to work in the industry because \"I played games since I was a kid and I absolutely adore them. They've given me inspiration over the years\" Tip 5: Never give up \nJames tells us that gaming is \"a tough business to get into.\" \nHe adds: \"If you just expect to fall into the games industry, get a job and be successful then that's not going to happen. \n\"It's a lot of hard work so be prepared and never give up.\" \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:08:31.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
