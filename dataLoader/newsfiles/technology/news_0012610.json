The company will introduce satellite service for areas that are too difficult to reach with a wired network by the end of the year, it said in a statement Tuesday.\nChief Executive Officer Gavin Patterson said that the goals will depend on government support for the company, which has been called too powerful by rivals including Vodafone Group Plc and TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc. Communications regulator Ofcom is undertaking a once-a-decade review of the telecommunications market and has said it will consider splitting BT’s main business for consumers and corporations from its Openreach division, which resells access to infrastructure to competing providers at regulated rates. Ofcom’s initial decision is due around the end of the year .\nBritain’s former phone monopoly still has the largest Internet and fixed-line phone network. Competitors that rely on Openreach to offer their own service have complained that BT is slow to repair faults and that its control over the market has resulted in poor network performance. In a letter published in the Financial Times on Monday, the CEOs of Sky Plc, TalkTalk and Vodafone U.K. called for the Competition Markets Authority to join Ofcom’s review to “address the structural barriers to competition.”\nBT plans to hire an additional 3,000 engineers to reduce installation and waiting times and cut complaints. The company has also said it will go beyond the government’s goal of 95 percent coverage for high-speed fiber Internet service and will offer speeds of 300 megabits to 500 megabits per second to 10 million homes by the end of 2020.\nEarlier this year, BT agreed to acquire EE, the largest U.K. mobile carrier, from Orange SA and Deutsche Telekom AG for 12.5 billion pounds ($19.4 billion). The transaction would create the biggest phone company in Britain offering landline, wireless, broadband and TV services.", "external_links": ["http://media.ofcom.org.uk/news/2015/digital-comms-review/\\", "https://www.gov.uk/guidance/broadband-delivery-uk\\"], "published": "2015-09-22T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:59:32.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
