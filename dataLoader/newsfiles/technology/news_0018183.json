The city is located abut 165 miles (265 km) southeast of Chicago. \nBollore launched IndyBlue with 125 parking spaces equipped with charge stations, with an expansion to 1,000 expected. \nCustomers swipe a membership card at kiosks to rent one of the battery-driven Bluecars, which can run as far as 120 miles (193 kilometers) without charging. \nThe standard monthly BlueIndy membership costs $9.99 (8.90 euros) and members pay $4 for the first 20 minutes and 20 cents for each subsequent minute. \n\"Indianapolis will benefit from technology and processes proven in Paris for the last four years. Now Indy will be the model for North America,\" said Cedric Bollore. The company's electric-vehicle sharing service also operates in Bordeaux, Lyon and Arcachon in France. \nAccording to US media, although BlueIndy has the support of the mayor of Indianapolis, Greg Ballard, it was opposed by certain members of the City-County Council, which delayed its launch initially planned for early 2015. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T00:25:58.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
