Mary Meeker, partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, regularly publishes detailed statistics about internet usage. Earlier this year, she found that mobile usage was outpacing desktop or laptop . American users, Meeker found, used the former for 2.8 hours a day, compared to 2.4 hours for the latter.\nMobile devices are repositories for large amounts of personal and corporate data, and the big mobile companies do their best to protect them. They build protection into their phones, designed to restrict activities such as installing unauthorised software.\nBut potential threats will always exist and be within reach. Dean Weinert, head of mobile for security firm ThreatMetrix , gives the example of third-party app stores, ie those not owned or controlled by the owner of the operating system. “Third-party app stores are notorious for delivering hacked versions of legitimate applications that often contain malware,” he says.\nEven official app stores can suffer problems. Apple has always prided itself on strong security for its apps, yet in September malware infected as many as 4,000 of them in its App Store. Google’s store has hosted malicious apps as well. They made it past Google’s automated antivirus system, Bouncer – which is designed to scan new apps for malicious code – to do things such as secretly subscribe victims to premium SMS services.\nEven if apps aren’t designed to infect your system with malware, they may still be detrimental to your privacy by asking for permissions that they don’t need on your phone.\nIn 2014, Symantec began experimenting with scanning Android apps for vulnerabilities and privacy issues before they were downloaded. It found that almost a third of all apps scanned leaked SIM card information such as address book details, mobile PIN numbers and call history. Of the apps scanned, 13% (about 2m) sent the user’s mobile phone number off the device.\nPay attention to what you install, says Johnathan Kuskos, manager of the EMEA threat research centre at WhiteHat Security : “Some apps that exist in the marketplace fit the exact definition of malware. If the app is free, remember that you’re the product being sold.”\nTake a flashlight app. Its sole purpose is to turn on your phone’s camera flash for use as a light. If it asks for access to your camera, microphone, photo or media files, you should be suspicious. “Choosing to install something like this is making a conscious and active choice to put yourself unnecessarily at risk,” says Kuskos, adding that users should always read the reviews in the app store.\nThis advice is all very useful for individuals trying to secure their phones, but enterprises need a more strategic approach. Many of them now face the tricky problem of whether to allow employee-owned devices to connect to their networks and access their data, in a concept known as “bring your own device” (BYOD). Those that disallow BYOD would have to shoulder the cost of providing mobile devices themselves, or simply being non-mobile-friendly companies, which puts them at a disadvantage to their competition.\nCompanies allowing mobile devices onto their networks run the risk of compromise, according to security firm Checkpoint Software’s 2015 security report . It interviewed more than 700 businesses and found that 42% of them had suffered mobile security incidents costing more than $250,000 to fix. More than eight in 10 expected the number of incidents to rise this year.\nWhatApp widget BYOD presents various threats to companies. The malware and privacy issues facing individual users are just as threatening to their employers, but they must also contend with lost or stolen mobile devices carrying valuable data.\nThere are solutions, however. Some come in the form of software to manage mobile devices. “If you’re responsible for the infrastructure used by employees in a company, there are a large number of mobile management applications that you can use,” says Alex Rice, co-founder and CTO of HackerOne , a company that works with customers to set up crowdsourced vulnerability testing programs for their computer systems.\nKnown as mobile device management (MDM) or enterprise mobile management (EMM), these software products offer several options for IT administrators. They can be used to enforce policies such as mobile device encryption, scrambling company data on employee–owned devices. Some can “sandbox” company applications and data on personal devices in an encrypted, software-defined safe, so that it doesn’t mix with personal data. Others can remotely wipe a lost or stolen device when it next connects to the internet, or monitor what apps are used on a device.\n“You want visibility into what applications are installed on the devices in your company, and what effect that might have on you,” says Rice.\nAll this calls for another important component of any mobile security solution: a decent usage policy. “Having a strict mobile device policy should be part of the employee hiring process,” says ThreatMetrix’s Weinert. “Further, educational campaigns that stress the importance of mobile device security can be extremely effective. Non-security-conscious users pose a real threat to the enterprise.”\nThe UK government publishes BYOD planning and deployment policy guidelines that help companies minimise the potential dangers.\nThis is all very well, but companies actually have to do it. The Checkpoint Software survey found that 44% of companies didn’t manage corporate data on employee-owned devices. Managing mobile security is important, both at an enterprise and an individual level. But it takes some effort, and some mindfulness.\nTo get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, sign up free for Media Network membership .\nAll Guardian Media Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled “Advertisement feature” – find out more here .", "external_links": ["http://www.threatmetrix.com/", "http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2425201/mkero-android-malware-secretly-subscribes-victims-to-premium-sms-services", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34338362", "https://hackerone.com/", "http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js", "http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2015/jul/21/data-data-vis/0.1.5/index-whatsapp.html", "https://community.norton.com/en/blogs/norton-protection-blog/study-finds-mobile-privacy-concerns-often-traded-free-apps", "http://www.checkpoint.com/resources/2015securityreport/", "http://www.slideshare.net/kleinerperkins/internet-trends-v1", "https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/bring-your-own-device-guidance", "https://www.whitehatsec.com/"], "published": "2015-09-29T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:54:11.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
