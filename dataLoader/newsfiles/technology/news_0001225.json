For full details and registration visit: www.openmpcon.org \nSimon McIntosh-Smith of Bristol University will do a performance comparison between OpenMP 4.0 and OpenCL . There are many discussions about whether different programming models can achieve high performance and how easy that is for the programmer. For HPC applications, where performance is critical, this question is especially interesting in the context of OpenMP 4.0 and OpenCL which offer different constructs for describing data parallelism. \nMartin Jambor from SUSE Linux will offer a talk on GCC support to compile OpenMP 4 target constructs for Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) accelerators that summarizes their experience from ongoing development of a GCC branch which takes OpenMP code and compiles it so that it runs on HSA GPGPUs. They intend to merge the branch to GCC 6, and so the talk will also serve as a preview of what will be available in the GCC released in spring 2016. \nDmitry Prohorov of Intel will describe OpenMP analysis in Intel VTune Amplifier XE . This talk will present what they have been doing in Intel ® VTune™ Amplifier XE to support OpenMP performance analysis that shows the results in terms of the OpenMP constructs that the programmer operates with, instead of offering general tuning paradigms that can confuse OpenMP programmers rather than helping them understand the real problems in their code. \nPlease consider attending by signing up here. \nAbout OpenMP ARB The OpenMP ARB has as mission to standardize directive-based multi-language high-level parallelism that is performant, productive and portable. Jointly defined by a group of major computer hardware and software vendors and major parallel computing user facilities, the OpenMP API is a portable, scalable model that gives parallel programmers a simple and flexible interface for developing parallel applications for platforms ranging from embedded systems and accelerator devices to multicore systems and shared-memory systems. The OpenMP ARB owns the OpenMP brand, oversees the OpenMP specification and produces and approves new versions of the specification.
