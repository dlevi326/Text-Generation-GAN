According to the attorney general’s office, the allegations center on a contract Blatter signed with the Caribbean Football Union in 2005.\n“[T]his contract was unfavorable for FIFA,” the office said in a statement. “[T]here is as suspicion that, in the implementation of this agreement, Joseph Blatter also violated his fiduciary duties and acted against the interest of FIFA and/or FIFA Marketing & TV AG.”\nJack Warner, the president of the Caribbean Football Union at the time, is fighting extradition from Trinidad and Tobago to the United States. Warner was indicted by U.S. prosecutors in May in a multinational corruption investigation that targeted some of the most influential figures in global soccer. He and 13 other FIFA officials face charges of bribery, racketeering, and money laundering in the U.S. in relation to an alleged conspiracy to rig the World Cup host-selection process.", "external_links": ["https://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?lang=en&msg-id=58891Full", "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34318353"], "published": "2015-09-25T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T21:58:15.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
