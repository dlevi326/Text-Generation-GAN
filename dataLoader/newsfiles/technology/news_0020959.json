The miscreants first tried to force open the old brass lock and then the hinges, damaging the frame in the process. Clearly frustrated, they smashed through the wood panels to gain entry, no big deal you might say but again I would beg to differ!\nLess than 3 meters away was a bright shiny new window pane in the recently restored old building, a building that has witnessed more than 150 years of South African history and survived at least one earthquake. Why didn't they break the window to gain entry? There were at least another ten such points of easy access!\nPerhaps you are now wondering what I am going on about, well it is not about the three bottles of wine they stole and yes that is all they stole!\nThe wine itself was irreplaceable, a magnum, a Jeroboam and the largest of the three, a Nebuchadnezzar, a bottle holding 15 litres and difficult to manage in more ways than one! I digress, the anger I felt on Saturday morning was not about the lost wine it was about the wanton destruction of property!\nThere were no pieces of wood left at the scene of the crime, they had been carefully removed along with the wine. Friday night was cold and I thought that perhaps the splintered wood was needed for warmth in addition to the contents of the bottles. That was not the case, as we discovered later. Almost all the damaged wood was recovered, discarded a few hundred metres away together with the shattered magnum. Was it simply taken out of spite?\nSo by now you are asking, what is the point of this article?\nIt is about the wanton destruction and lack of respect for other people’s property. It is something we read about every day along with the violence, rape, child abuse, murder, corruption, crime of all description and the carnage on our roads, which, in my humble opinion, all have one thing in common- a blatant disregard for the rule of law!\nWe have a wonderful constitution, the ruling party has a freedom charter and both enshrine some pretty high ideals. Yes, we have poverty, unemployment and inequality, certainly they can all be blamed to greater or lesser degree for the rising levels of crime.\nHowever, I also beg to differ with those who withhold their labour or protest lack of service delivery, they certainly have the right to do so peacefully but so do those who choose to work or study.\nMore importantly, we ALL have the right to expect and demand that the State upholds the rule of law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T22:05:52.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
