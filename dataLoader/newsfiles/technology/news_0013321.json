Williams-Sonoma is a leading source for cookware and home furnishings in Southern California. Calabasas joins the Beverly Hills store, which integrated a showroom in July, and South Coast Plaza, in prominently featuring Williams-Sonoma Home. This Saturday at 10am, Williams-Sonoma hosts matriarch of the Kardashian-Jenner family and Calabasas resident, Kris Jenner, for an in-store event. Jenner will be signing her cookbook, In The Kitchen With Kris. Books may be pre-purchased at http://www.williams-sonoma.com/pages/store-events/store-events/book-signing.html . The brand is donating a portion of book sales to the charity No Kid Hungry. \nWilliams-Sonoma President, Janet Hayes remarks, “We’re thrilled to return to The Commons at Calabasas where the sense of community is so strong. We look forward to serving our customers here again and welcome them back to our store with a whole new look.” The retailer closed earlier this year when the lease came to term. Williams-Sonoma, after receiving dozens of letters from loyal fans expressing their desire for the retailer to return, was able to secure its original anchor position at the shopping center and introduce a newly designed store. \nWilliams-Sonoma’s location at The Commons at Calabasas features over 5,000 square feet and includes an eight-seat cooking island that will hold culinary classes for both adults and children. An outdoor area with landscaping and Williams-Sonoma Home outdoor furniture will also be new to the store.
