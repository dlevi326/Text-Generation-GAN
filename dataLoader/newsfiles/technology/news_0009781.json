That doesn't seem like the kind of community that we want to create.\" \nHe said he understood that it was awkward to click \"like\" on a post about events such as a death in the family or the current refugee crisis and that there should be a better way for users to \"express that they understand and that they relate to you.\" \n\"We've been working on this for a while, actually. It's surprisingly complicated to make,\" Zuckerberg added. \n\"But we have an idea that we think we're getting ready to test soon, and depending on how that goes, we'll roll it out more broadly.\" \nMore information: Highlights of Zuckerberg's Q&A: bit.ly/1W1dCam 0 shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:00:41.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
