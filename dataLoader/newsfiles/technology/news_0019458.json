Through the development of the Cinema EOS System 8K camera and professional-use 8K reference display, Canon aims to contribute to smooth production workflows, facilitating not only the input and output of 8K video content, but also such processes as 8K to 4K down-conversion and 4K cropping. \nThe Cinema EOS System 8K camera, being developed, will be equipped with a Canon Super 35 mm-equivalent CMOS sensor that makes possible high-resolution 8,192 x 4,320 pixel (approximately 35.39 million effective pixels) imaging performance, even at a frame rate of up-to-60 frames per second with 13 stops 1 of dynamic range and a richly expressive wide color gamut. Additionally, featuring a body size that realizes outstanding mobility and a design that delivers high levels of operability, along with an EF mount that offers compatibility with most of Canon’s extensive interchangeable EF lens lineup, 2 the camera will support diverse shooting styles and means of visual expression. \nIncorporating Canon image-processing technology, the ultra-high-resolution 8K reference display currently under development aims to achieve high brightness, high contrast (high dynamic range) and a wide color gamut. Additionally, with a pixel density exceeding 300 pixels per inch, a level approaching the limit of human visibility, the display intends to make possible ultra-realistic imaging that can enable the reproduction of even subtle changes in light. Furthermore, when used in combination with the Cinema EOS System 8K camera, the display under development will be capable of conveying truly impressive levels of visual expression. \nFeaturing a resolution of approximately 120 effective megapixels, the SLR camera now being developed will incorporate a Canon-developed high-pixel-density CMOS sensor within the current EOS camera -series platform, which will realize compatibility with most of the Company’s diverse interchangeable EF lens lineup. 3 The high-resolution images that the camera is being designed to be capable of producing can recreate the three-dimensional texture, feel and presence of subjects, making them appear as if they are really before one’s eyes. The camera under development is being designed to facilitate a level of resolution more than sufficient for large-format printing and extensive cropping capability while maintaining fantastic image quality. \nAbout Canon U.S.A., Inc. \nCanon U.S.A., Inc., is a leading provider of consumer, business-to-business, and industrial digital imaging solutions to the United States and to Latin America and the Caribbean (excluding Mexico) markets.
