Uber is appealing in the federal case to avoid facing a class-action trial that could force the startup to change its business model and might erode its $50 billion valuation.\nSan Francisco Superior Court Judge Ernest Goldsmith said Uber’s contract with drivers is “flatly inconsistent” because it says in one provision that a private arbitrator decides whether a dispute should be resolved in arbitration, and says in another that the choice is to made by a judge.\n\"I’m not going to fly in the face of a stark inconsistency in order to massage this into arbitrability,\" the judge told lawyers during a hearing Monday. Goldsmith issued a tentative ruling before the hearing, then made it final in court.\nUber will will ask a state appeals court to review the ruling, Jessica Santillo, a spokeswoman for Uber, said in an e-mail.\n“The Uber partner in this case agreed to resolve disputes of this nature through arbitration when she joined the platform last year,” Santillo said. “The right to arbitrate disputes has been confirmed multiple times by the Supreme Court.”\nUber said Barbara Berwick agreed to the arbitration agreement before using the company app starting in July 2014.\nIndependent Contractor When she later complained to the labor commissioner’s office that she was entitled to be treated as an employee, San Francisco-based Uber argued that she was an independent contractor and not entitled to recover claimed wages or expense reimbursement. A hearing officer in the commissioner’s office disagreed.\nThe commissioner said the company dictates standards such as how old a driver’s car can be and who is qualified to offer services through the Uber platform.\nUber appealed the commissioner’s finding in state court in June. Uber then argued Berwick’s dispute belongs in arbitration.\nFederal judges in San Francisco have refused to throw out driver employment status lawsuits against Uber and its rival Lyft Inc., saying the matter is best left to a jury to decide.\nThe case is Uber Technologies Inc. v. Berwick, 15-546378, Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco. The federal cases is O’Connor v. Uber Technologies Inc., 13-cv-03826, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:35:00.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
