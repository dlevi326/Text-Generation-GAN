(AP) -- The book \"The Martian\" is earning high praise from space, and the astronaut-reviewer can't wait to see the soon-to-be-released movie. \nNASA astronaut Kjell Lindgren (Chell LEND-grin) said Tuesday from the International Space Station that both he and crewmate Scott Kelly have read the novel. Lindgren told reporters he really enjoyed the book and hopes to get a copy of the film beamed up to orbit on October 2, the day of release, or shortly thereafter. \nThe astronauts chatted with the star of the film, Matt Damon, last month by phone. They called him while he was touring Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \nKelly -- who's almost halfway through a yearlong space station stay -- says it's difficult to compare his experience in orbit with a Mars trip. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
