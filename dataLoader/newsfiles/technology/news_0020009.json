This release contains a number of new features. \"Once again Ascert have been working on improving VersaTest's class leading performance testing capabilities.\" says Simon Miles, Ascert's Product Architect for the VersaTest product line. \"With the increased transaction volumes of modern systems and with virtualization providing an easy way to add processing power, Ascert have been working on enhancing the scalability of the VersaTest ecosystem.\"\nIn a modern IT environment corporate systems can be distributed locally or in the cloud and virtualization techniques allow the addition of increased processing power almost instantaneously. This release of VersaTest has features that help streamline the implementation of performance tests spread across multiple virtual, physical or cloud based systems using a model for zero-install deployment of driver nodes. VersaTest drivers can now easily be configured to split their resources both processing and data, across multiple systems.\nFurther enhancements to the product in version 1.10 include the integration of the VersaTest rich message viewer as a Java Web Start application that can be launched from the VersaTest Web UI.\nIn addition to time savings in testing, VersaTest decreases the time involved in analyzing testing results. With an easy to use GUI interface and “audit capture” functionality, the product increases both testing accuracy as well as ROI.
