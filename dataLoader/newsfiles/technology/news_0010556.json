The blog focuses on how to use Frames Data products, but also includes features that will be helpful for all dispensaries. \nThis new resource, which can be found at http://resources.framesdata.com , or in the main navigation bar of Frames Data , features a range of topics from support for Frames Data products and how to use them most effectively, to more general advice on topics of interest to all optical dispensers. Examples include “nuts and bolts” topics like how to update your browser and how to connect your barcode scanner. The responsive design allows visitors to view the blog on any platform – may it be on a mobile phone, tablet, or computer. The search feature also makes it easy for users to find what they are looking for by simply typing the topic into the search bar. \n“You’ll see that we’ve created quite a bit of useful content—articles to help you use Frames Data effectively of course, but also ways to manage your business more efficiently—and we wanted to create a central repository for all of that valuable information,” said Tom Doyle, director of marketing and key accounts for Frames Data. “Now it’s all in one place, organized for easy browsing, and searchable.” “We also found that many of our customers needed basic help becoming comfortable with their technology,” said Doyle. “That was an obstacle for Frames Data because they were not always getting the full benefit of their subscription. That’s why we’re including so many features that could be for anyone trying to be more productive or who is not as comfortable with a computer.” \nThe Frames Data blog will be updated weekly with new content; topics of interest to Frames Data subscribers and optical dispensaries in general.
