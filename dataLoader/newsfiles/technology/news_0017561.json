In the build-up to its press conference the Chinese giant, now the third-largest smartphone supplier in the world, promised products that will \"touch your life\" and touch technology was at the core of many of its announcements. \nFirst out of the blocks was a new flagship smartphone, the Huawei Mate S. Announcing the 5.5in handset, Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's Consumer Business Group, made much of its comfort and beauty. The Mate S features a dual diamond-cut all-metal metal body measuring 2.65mm at its thinnest point. A comfort curve across the back of the device is matched on with a Full HD Gorilla Glass 4-fronted display. \nTrue to its promise, the Mate S features some intriguing touch-based innovations. A Fingerprint Sense 2.0 touch sensor sits on the rear of the handset to facilitate one-handed operation whether for answering calls or, as Yu demonstrated on stage, taking a selfie. \nKnuckle Sense, first seen on the Huawei P8, can tell the difference between different parts of your finger, letting you launch apps by swiping – or \"knuckling\", if you will – an \"M\" to open a music app, a \"C\" for Camera, \"W\" for weather and so on. Launch camera #app by drawing a C with your knuckle. Amazing interactivity! #HuaweiMateS #IFA2015 pic.twitter.com/tuVQddP10E — Huawei Device (@HuaweiDevice) September 2, 2015 Worth the weight? \nPipping Apple to the post, the Mate S screen also features Force Touch technology to help it distinguish between a tap, swipe or forceful press on the screen. While this pressure sensitivity could open up some new user interface possibilities – a hard press to zoom in on an image, for example – Huawei also appeared to claim it could also be used to weigh things. We will be the first to let you know if the Mate S might be able to replace your kitchen scales in due course. How much does it weigh?

The rear camera here is a 13MP affair with optical image stabilisation and a sapphire-protected lens, while a Professional Mode offers more manual controls that many. An 8MP camera sits on the front with a \"soft lighting\" flash and Huawei's \"latest beautify algorithm\". \nRounding up the rest of the Mate S specs, a water-resistant nano-coating will keep the handset happy when wet or dry and 3-microphone directional listening helps to record meetings and conversations. \nThe Mate S will be available in versions with 32GB and 64GB of storage, both with and without Force Touch. Pre-orders commence on 15 September and while full pricing is still to be revealed, the non-Force Touch versions are reported to be priced at €649 (£476, $730) (32GB) and €699 (64GB). \nAt the press event, Huawei also announced the Huawei Watch, first revealed at Mobile World Congress earlier in 2015, and the Huawei G8 smartphone.
