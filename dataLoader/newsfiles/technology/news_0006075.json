The app allows drivers to pay for parking with their smartphones using Parkmobile’s mobile applications for iPhone, Android, Windows, and Blackberry phones. The Parkmobile service is being offered at approximately 1,000-metered spaces in downtown Ithaca and “College Town.”\n“The last major piece of the puzzle is here,” says Director of Parking Frank Nagy. “We can now offer our citizens and visitors a complete payment option! Coin, cash, credit card, cell phone, app, laptop, tablet and computer.”\nParkmobile’s mobile payment system is very simple and easy to use. Customers need only to register online at www.parkmobile.com or download the mobile app in their phone’s app store. Once registered, they may use the mobile app, internet, or a toll free number to pay for parking. After setting up their account, customers can immediately start using the system with their registered mobile phone. Enforcement officers will be able to see that a motorist has paid with Parkmobile using a wireless handheld device, so customers should not worry if the meter does not change. Mobile app users may also choose to receive alerts and reminders 15 minutes prior to expiration of their parking session. Time limits on meters still apply and Parkmobile will not allow users to purchase more time than allotted by the meters.\n\"Parkmobile is very excited to launch our mobile payment parking service in Ithaca,” said Jon Ziglar, CEO of Parkmobile, LLC. “With this new service, customers have a new and better way to pay for parking that is truly beneficial to them, as well as the City. Our mobile payments solution is a great example of another technology that can make our lives easier and more efficient.”\nAbout Parkmobile\nParkmobile, LLC is the leading provider of on-demand and prepaid mobile payments for on- and off-street parking.
