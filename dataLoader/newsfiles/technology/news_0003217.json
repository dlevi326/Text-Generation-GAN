On Earth, a single partial eclipse occurred over South Africa, the southern Indian Ocean and Antarctica. \nDuring a total solar eclipse , the Moon moves in front of the Sun as seen from Earth, their alignment and separation such that the Moon, situated much closer to Earth, appears large enough to block out the light from the much more distant Sun. \nBut, like yesterday, sometimes the alignment is such that the Moon only partially covers the Sun's disc. \nMeanwhile, ESA's Proba-2 orbits Earth about 14.5 times per day, dipping in and out of the Moon's shadow around the time of a solar eclipse. The constant change in viewing angle of Proba-2 meant that the satellite passed through the shadow three times during the eclipse yesterday. \nOne of these partial eclipses is presented here – it was captured at 06:32 GMT on 13 September – but all three, along with a fourth passage of the Moon close to the edge of the Sun, can be seen in this movie. \nThe image was taken with Proba-2's SWAP imager, which views the solar disc at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths to capture the turbulent surface of the Sun and its swirling corona – a glimpse of which can be seen in the background. 1 hour ago 0 Southern hemisphere to glimpse year's last solar eclipse November 24, 2011 \nThe tip of South Africa, Tasmania and most of New Zealand will -- weather permitting -- enjoy a partial eclipse of the Sun on Friday although the handful of hardy scientists in Antarctica will get the best view, according ... Proba-2 catches solar eclipse May 22, 2012 \n(Phys.org) -- Europe missed Sundays solar eclipse on the other side of the planet but ESAs space weather microsatellite Proba-2 passed repeatedly through the Moons shadow. Prepare for a total solar eclipse November 13, 2012 \n(Phys.org)—Tomorrow's total solar eclipse will only be visible in its entirety to ground-based observers watching from northern Australia, but ESA's Sun-watching Proba-2 satellite will have a ringside seat from its orbit ... Astronaut plus Proba minisats snap solar eclipse March 20, 2015 \nAs today's partial solar eclipse crossed Europe, it was also visible from space. ESA's Proba-2 captured a near-total eclipse from orbit, at the same time as its sister minisatellite Proba-V peered down to snap the shadow ... Guide to the September 13th partial solar eclipse September 9, 2015 \nEclipse season 2 of 2 for 2015 is nigh this weekend, book-ended by a partial solar eclipse on September 13th, and a total lunar eclipse on September 28th. Video: NASA's SDO catches a double photobomb September 15, 2015 \nOn Sept. 13, 2015, as NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, kept up its constant watch on the sun, its view was photobombed not once, but twice. Just as the moon came into SDO's field of view on a path to cross the sun, ... Recommended for you A shy galactic neighbor September 16, 2015 \nThe Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy, pictured in this new image from the Wide Field Imager camera, installed on the 2.2-metre MPG/ESO telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory, is a close neighbour of our galaxy, the Milky Way. Despite ... Nearby red dwarfs could reveal planet secrets September 15, 2015 \nAn accidental find of a collection of young red dwarf stars close to our solar system could give us a rare glimpse of slow-motion planet formation. Under Saturnian moon's icy crust lies a 'global' ocean September 15, 2015 \nBy measuring with exquisite precision the tiny wobbles of Saturn's moon Enceladus – whose cosmic quavers are detectable only in high-resolution images taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft – Cornell University researchers ... LRO discovers Earth's pull is 'massaging' our moon September 15, 2015 \nEarth's gravity has influenced the orientation of thousands of faults that form in the lunar surface as the moon shrinks, according to new results from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft. Solar Observatory discovers its 3,000th comet September 15, 2015 \nOn Sept. 13, 2015, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory—a joint project of the European Space Agency and NASA—discovered its 3,000th comet, cementing its standing as the greatest comet finder of all time. Prior to the ... Watching an exoplanet in motion around a distant star September 16, 2015 \nA team of astronomers has given us our best view yet of an exoplanet moving in its orbit around a distant star.
