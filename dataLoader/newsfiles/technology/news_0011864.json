HackensackUMC is implementing MphRx’s application called Forward (based on the company’s flagship Minerva platform) to help patients easily send their clinical records to the health system. MphRx, in turn, seamlessly integrates the patient clinical records with the clinical systems at HackensackUMC\nDr. Shafiq Rab, M.D., MPH, Vice President and Chief Information Officer at HackensackUMC said, “It is imperative that we advocate for the patient. For Healthcare Delivery to become efficient, outcomes to improve and costs to decrease, the portability of clinical data is essential. At HUMC, we believe that the patient is central to all activities. We are committed to interoperability, FHIR and the Argonaut Project. We are grateful to our partners MphRx who are dedicated and committed to the challenge and share our belief.”\nJeremy Marut, Director of Enterprise Architecture at HackensackUMC said, “If we’ve learned anything in this endeavor it is that we are indeed facing a challenge. Even systems that do communicate don’t do so easily. We are fortunate to work for leaders committed to changing healthcare, to have a team working with passion as well as a partner like MphRx motivated to change healthcare.”\nThrough Forward, MphRx enables patients to securely pre-fill visit forms, update their demographics, report relevant patient data and upload prior medical history from the comfort of their homes, even before arriving for their scheduled appointments. In essence, Forward allows patients to upload their entire patient history, including medical images (from DICOM CDs), clinical documents, CCD-A records, PDFs and even images through a secure, encrypted and HIPAA compliant platform using an engaging and easy to use web and mobile interface.\nVarun Anand, Co Founder of MphRx has been working very closely with HackensackUMC on this project. He states the following: “There is a very subtle and powerful difference in the way MphRx uses FHIR – it’s at the very heart of our data model. Our platform leverages the standard from the ground up, providing the much needed flexibility while building applications without compromising on interoperability. We found great partners in Dr. Rab and his team at HackensackUMC, who not only share our vision but are committing valuable resources to execute it.”\nModi Boutrs, Lead Systems Analyst at HackensackUMC stated that, “The interoperability between health systems, combined with the ease of use will make all the difference. This implementation not only makes it easy for patients to share their records with us, but also enables providers to have access to the information even before they come in for their appointments.”\nAbout MphRx\nMphRx is a healthcare technology company, headquartered in New York City with offices in Florida, New Jersey and New Delhi. It’s Minerva platform is currently being used at several large health systems globally to improve continuity of care and patient outcomes [collaboration].
