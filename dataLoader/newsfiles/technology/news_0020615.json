Providing a best-in-class gaming experience inside-and-out, both series build on Acer’s industry-leading display technology, which has been widely praised by gamers worldwide, combined with bold and angular Acer Predator design language and bright red accents.\nCurved Gaming at Full Throttle: Predator Z35\nThe Predator Z35 is the first product of Acer’s Predator Z Series curved gaming monitors with NVIDIA® G-SYNC™. Its 35-inch 21:9 UltraWide Full HD (2560x1080) panel features a curvature of 2000R for immersive, wraparound gaming. The Predator Z35 incorporates NVIDIA® ULMB™ (Ultra Low Motion Blur) technology(1) , reducing motion blur by delivering sharp edges in fast-paced gaming environments. It also supports overclocking to a lightning-fast 200Hz refresh rate, so gamers can find their enemies before they spot them and enjoy crystal clear turns on the racetrack, and features powerful audio with DTS® Sound, 9Wx2 speakers and Acer TrueHarmony technology.\nPixel-Perfect for a Competitive Edge: Predator XB1\nThe Predator XB1 Series features the latest NVIDIA® G-SYNC™ technology, giving gamers an advantage with incredibly detailed images and smooth visuals.

The 28-inch model (XB281HK) features a 4K UHD panel that has a fast GTG (gray to gray) response time of 1ms, rendering fast-moving actions or dramatic transitions smoothly without smearing or ghosting.\nIn-Game Advantage with GameView\nThe new Predator gaming monitors feature GameView technology, which allows gamers to swiftly toggle between three customizable display profiles, tweaking settings such as Dark Boost, Overclock, and aim-point assistance to suit a wide gamut of games. It allows quick display adjustment while in-game without the need to navigate through layers of OSD menus, a significant advantage when every split second counts.\nPricing and Availability\nThe Predator Z35 will be available in North America in December with prices starting at US$1199.99, in EMEA in December with prices starting at €1,099.\nThe Predator XB1 Series will be available in North America in November with prices starting at US$799.99, in EMEA in October with prices starting at €699.\nExact specifications, prices, and availability will vary by region.
