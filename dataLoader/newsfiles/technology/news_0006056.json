He would take to the CMTS stage to deliver a presentation on high performance polymers and composite materials later in the day. \nIf sheer numbers are any indication, it’s hard to argue the 3D printing revolution is not already well underway. A huge number of additive manufacturing companies have set up shop at this year’s manufacturing bonanza, taking over most of an entire hall. \nAnd for those who still think 3D printing is only useful for producing somewhat misshapen children’s toys, the capabilities and the ingenuity behind the emerging industry segment is difficult to overstate. A wide range of companies, Graphene 3D Labs among them, are even working to 3D-print high-value products such as batteries and moving machine parts, taking aim at a number of multi-billion dollar industries. Touting low price points, remarkably quick turnaround time and high reliability, Stolyarov thinks it’s only a matter of time before the market reaches a tipping point. \n“The advantage is huge. If you can teach 3D printing how to build the things, you don’t need to assemble them, you just 3D print them,” he said. \nBeyond the swelling ranks of additive manufacturers, the usual suspects were on the floor day two as well, demonstrating the latest breakthroughs in everything from automation to giant industrial fans. \nCMTS continues tomorrow, Sept. 30, before wrapping up Oct. 1.
