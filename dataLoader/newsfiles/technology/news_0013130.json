No more changing numbers, juggling multiple phones or missing important calls. \nStrone Roam allows you to stay in touch with family or business on your own phone number wherever you are, and without the fear of getting a huge bill when you get home. It works by placing your SIM card into the sleek, elegant device, which is about the size of a soft drink can. The Strone Roam stays in your home or office, connected to the internet and paired with an app on your phone. You can then make and receive calls and text messages without international roaming charges wherever you go on your travels. \n“It is time to put the fear of roaming behind us,” said Mr Tudor. “We are encouraging everyone that wants hassle-free, affordable global communication to go to Indiegogo and order their Strone Roam now.” \nFor more information on Strone Roam please visit their Indiegogo page: http://igg.me/at/strone \nAbout Strone Technology \nStrone Technology is the developer of Strone Roam, a new way to permanently solve the frustration of sim-swapping or exorbitant bills while roaming with your mobile phone.
