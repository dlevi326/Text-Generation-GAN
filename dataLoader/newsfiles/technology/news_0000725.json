Snap back to spaghetti. Oh there’s goes more spaghetti!”\n“So today I went back to purchase some spaghetti, instead of finding spaghetti in the packet, I found this. It was spaghetti! What should I do with it? Should I return the spaghetti?” McGloin asked.\nThe post has garnered more than 71,990 likes on Facebook.\nWoolworths’ social media team then had a field day incorporating more Eminem’s rap lyrics into hilarious Facebook comments showing their rhymes are just as fresh as their produce.\n“Dear Jamie, you can do anything you set your mind to man. The answer to your burning question is pretty clear ... All you need to do is Lose Yourself in the spaghetti, the sauce, you own it. You better never let it go! You’ve only got one pan, don’t miss your chance to cook, cuz dinner only comes once in a day. Yo,” they posted referencing Eminem’s Lose Yourself .\n“May I have your attention please? May I have your attention please? Will the real spaghetti please stand up? I repeat, will the real spaghetti please stand up? We’re gonna have a problem here,” they later commented to the tune of The Real Slim Shady .\nOne user Kyle Richards replied with his own verse, this time from the track Stan:\n“Dear Woolworths, I wrote you but you still ain’t calling. I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom. I sent two private messages back in Autumn, you must not’ve got ‘em, there probably was a problem with Facebook or somethin, sometimes I auto correct my words too sloppy when I jot ‘em. But anyway stuff it, what’s been up man? How’s your produce?”\nWoolworths responded in lyrical kind:\n“Dear Kyle, we meant to write to you sooner but we’ve just been busy. You asked about our produce? It’s as fresh as it could be.”\n“Who ever runs the Woolworths page needs a raise,” Alex Cameron chimed in.\n@PaddyNaughtin\npatrick.naughtin@news.com.au\nOriginally published as ‘Lose Yourself in the spaghetti’ goes viral on Woolies’ Facebook page", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153518665200027&set=o.147632815308858&type=3&theater", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/aussie-mans-eminem-rap-about-spaghetti-goes-viral-in-facebook-exchange-with-woolworths/story-fni0fit3-1227549350866", "https://twitter.com/PaddyNaughtin"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T10:46:10.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
