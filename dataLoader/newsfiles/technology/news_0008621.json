Telkom: 1m fibre connections by 2018 Article By: Hadlee Simons Mon, 07 Sep 2015 5:20 PM Share Fibre-optic cable. clix, sxc.hu \nTelkom has announced that it's targeting one million homes with access to fibre by 2018. \nThe company said in a press statement that 38 000 homes had been given access to fibre by the end of August 2015. \n\"The company will double the fibre rollout to 70 000 homes by December 2015 and will have capacity to connect 150 000 homes by March 2016 and 500 000 by December 2016. By 2018, Telkom will have provided access for one million homes to connect to fibre,\" it said. \nTelkom CEO Sipho Maseko told attendees at the SATNAC conference in Hermanus that the operator is committed to democratising broadband access. \n\nAddressing the digital divide \n\"We have set ourselves the objective of contributing to transforming the South African economy. South Africa is a developing democracy. We want to accelerate this development,\" said Maseko. \nThe operator added that while the rollout of fibre in large metropolitan areas will continue, it was working with the government to provide broadband to under-serviced areas. \nMaseko also acknowledged the digital divide in the country. \n\"We must recognise that the issue of access lies at the heart of the divide. You either have access or you don't. It's as simple as that. To cross the digital divide, you must provide universal access,\" said Maseko. \nTelkom also pointed out that it has started to reduce the cost of DSL wholesale prices, such as the sub-R50 1Mbps DSL line rental option. \nThe company also confirmed today that it will open copper access at 200 exchanges on a trial basis, \"thus effectively paving the way for a more open access approach, depending on the outcome of the trial\". \nMaseko also urged mobile networks to help Telkom bridge the digital divide. \n\"If we are to overcome the access deficit, and in light of the mobile revolution and the benefits this has engendered, South Africa needs to see wholesale access to the mobile local loop and active sharing of the radio access network. This is an imperative and an important precursor for democratising broadband,\" said Maseko. \nSouth Africa requires decisive, unambiguous action to ensure its competitiveness, Maseko added, calling for access to sub-1Ghz spectrum. \nMaseko also called on the government to \"reconsider important duties which limit broader access to affordable smart devices costing less than R1000\".
