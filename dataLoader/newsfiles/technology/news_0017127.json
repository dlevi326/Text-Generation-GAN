As a South African who still lives in South Africa, I am not having a go at South Africans who have left and who live in safer countries, because any sensible person will agree, whether we live in South Africa or else where, the level of violent crime is high in South Africa, compared to many other countries. If a person leaves South African shores because they are not prepared to live behind high walls/fences etc, and don't want to be the next victim of a violent crime, I don't blame them.\nThe point of my story is, I have a number of facebooks friends who live in either the UK, Australia, NZ, or America. One particular friend of mine, who lives in the UK often posts stories of violent crime in South Africa - often ending with something along the lines of \"let the rest of the world know\". Well, the rest of the world probably does know that violent crime in South Africa is a problem, but what is the rest of the world really going to do? Maybe shake their heads a little and say \"how awful\"? If an expat is going to post tragic stories of violent crime in SA, on their personal facebook page, what difference are they really going to make? Her posts hardly get any comments and she has got a grand total of 665 friends, many of whom live outside South Africa, so it just goes to show, that really, not many people actually care enough, even at the very least to comment, about violent crime. Yes, my facebook friend is saddened and angered by the level of brutality when it comes to crime in South Africa, and thinks she might make a difference, but is simply posting the occasional story on facebook about violent crime really enough to do so? If she was serious about letting the rest of the world know, she would be writing letters etc to the officials/politicians in the UK (she lives in Scotland) and telling them to put pressure on the SA govt. If she was really serious about letting the rest of the world know, she would organize protest marches (and maybe do a bit of good old toyi toying) outside South Africa House in London, if the level of violent crime really angered her so much. However, personally I think it's too easy to sit from the comfort of a safe first world life, and post about tragic stories in South Africa, instead of actively getting involved. A person can get all hot under the collar, and post stories onto their facebook but what difference will they really make unless they get out there and actively do something about it? Yes, maybe it angers them that they had to leave the country of their birth, a country that they would have preferred to stay in, if it were not for the high and often violent crime rate, but is flippantly posting stories about violent crime really going to make a difference, besides venting out your anger?\nOn the other hand you get South Africans who have the attitude that \"Ag well, crime happens everywhere in the world\" and that it's not uniquely South African. That to me, that is simply an attitude of living in cloud cuckoo land, because the level and amount of violent crime that happens in South Africa, does not happen everywhere else in the world. Yes there are countries with high violent crime rates but South Africa, is in the top 10 worldwide, when it comes to murder, and NO 1 when it comes to rape.\nQuestion is how much does the rest of the world really care about South Africa? A four year old South African girl was hanged here, around the same time as the pics of the little Syrian boy lying washed up on a beach off Turkey, having drowned because his family were leaving Syria as refugees. What's the difference between them? The little boy came from Syria, a war torn country, and the little came from South Africa, a country (simply with) a high crime rate. Difference is, because there is no \"official\" war in South Africa, very few people outside South Africa, will know of a four year old girl getting hanged, after being raped and because there is no heart wrenching picture of her, hanging from a tree. Amazingly the little girl survived, but she has had her innocence taken away from her, and she has to live with that for the rest of her life.\nBecause there is no \"official\" war in South Africa, and because it seems acceptable to the rest of the world that violent crime is high here, there is no real pressure on the generally corrupt and inefficient ANC govt to actively build up a really strong police service and a law system capable of sorting the criminals out properly, I fear nothing will change much in South Africa when it comes to violent crime. No doubt Zuma & many in the ANC would probably blame apartheid and Van Riebeeck, but simply blaming the past won't help much. More has got to be done by the Govt. They are the ones supposed to be leading this country, it is up to them to ensure we live in a country where violent crime is rare, and certainly a country where children getting raped is not common place.\nSo who will make a difference when it comes to decreasing the high and violent crime rate in this country?Certainly not an angry expat who only posts stories onto facebook, but who does nothing else, and certainly not a South African who still lives here, and flippantly shrugs their shoulders, telling us that crime happens all over the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T16:04:20.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
