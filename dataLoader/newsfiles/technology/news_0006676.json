Be kind. Always.”\n-I am not quite sure who said these words but they inspire me on a daily basis.\n***\nI am the type of person who walks around with a smile. My life is far from great and no, I am not an idiot. I smile because my smile is contagious but most importantly, I smile because my smile hides my fears, my insecurities, my shredded heart and my hollow soul. My smile is my mask. I am nothing without my smile. I have had time to reflect on my life from birth until now and it hasn’t been a “smiley affair”. As I bare my heart and soul, I can only hope that I manage to touch just one person who can either directly/indirectly relate to this.\nI was brought up by a single mother. Another absent father case, you’re probably thinking. Yes, this is nothing new in the black society but every case is different. Every story is unique. I was doing Grade 11 when I accidentally found out through my late great aunt that my ‘father’ wanted my mother to abort me because ‘he was just not ready to have a child’. This is something I wasn’t supposed to ever find out and I believe my mother would have taken it to her grave had it not been for that outburst.\nThe months that followed were of pure hell -so were the years. I fell into a dark pit of depression as I reflected on my early school days. In a sick, twisted kind of way, everything made sense. The pieces of the puzzle started falling into place. I remembered going to school on an empty stomach, with no lunchbox and very little hope of eating when I got back home. I remembered being excluded from school excursions because my mom couldn’t afford to pay for the trip. I remembered my friends rubbing salt into the wound by enthusiastically recalling every little detail of the awesome trip. I should have been there.\nAcademically I was doing well, very well. My mother would have loved to send me to a ‘good’ multiracial school but as you may have gathered – she couldn’t afford to. Nevertheless, I was the ‘perfect teenager ‘ , did everything right. I strived for excellence in all that I did. In my head I had this misguided conviction that if I did well, my father would realize that I’m a good child worthy of his love. I did not know why he had broken up with my mother all those years ago, I did not care. All I wanted was a father who loved and cared for me – even from a distance.\nI was forced to grow up before time. I had to assume a mother’s role to my siblings when my mother wasn’t around. While my peers were playing worry-free without a care in the world, I was at home checking my brothers’ homework and making sure that their school uniform was clean for the next day. I would prep for dinner, peel and chop the veggies to make things easy for mom when she got home. Eventually, I had to start working part time because mom wasn’t making enough money from selling beauty cosmetics and second hand clothing -mainly because her customers took things on credit and wouldn’t pay back. I worked at a local supermarket every weekday after school and full time on weekends and school holidays. I didn’t make much, but it did make a difference because I was able to buy myself the necessities (toiletries and sanitary supplies), the rest I would contribute towards electricity.\nI won’t lie, I did take strain. I was physically, emotionally and mentally exhausted. I couldn’t speak to my mother because I knew it wasn’t easy on her and knowing that I was battling would break her heart. At the time, there were only three things that made my life worth living. Reading helped me escape my harsh reality and every night I would pour my heart out into my diary . It didn’t solve anything but it did make me feel better. When things got too much, I knew I could always rely on my Goju Kai brothers and sisters for a good session of Randori sparring to release bottled up tension. Confronted with the reality of my situation, I had no choice but to toughen up. I was very angry towards my ‘father’ for not being there for me, but I hated my mother more for choosing to subject me to this cruel world.\nUp until today, I still have unanswered questions but the important thing is that I realized that God has a greater purpose for my life. I genuinely believe that my father’s absence in my life was a blessing in disguise. Had he been in my life, I may not have grown up to be this resilient, ambitious and assertive young woman that I am. I realize just how difficult it must have been for my mother to make the choice that she made and to see it through. I will forever hold her in the highest regard. So, to single parents: You are strong. You are amazing. Your kids will one day grow to understand and appreciate the sacrifices you have had to make for them to BE. To abandoned kids: You are fighters. Once (because you will, it’s a matter of when) you get over the rejection, the anger, the self-loathing, the insecurities and God-knows-what-else… you will realize just how strong you are. If you can get through that, in one piece (although that’s debatable) , you can face just about any challenge and come out stronger.\nRemember, forgiveness is your key to self-actualization.\nLove + Light x", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:17:12.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
