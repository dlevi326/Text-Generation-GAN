In addition to the salary, Davis' insurance, retirement and other benefits pushed the total package to more than $460,000, the audit shows.\nThe Legislative Auditor's office said making the compensation public is a requirement of Act 706, which says that agencies being audited must include a supplemental report listing the CEO's compensation, including travel, housing, per diem, etc.\nBill Davis, CEO of Slidell Memorial Hospital Courtesy Slidell Memorial Hospital The 229-bed acute care community hospital sued the Legislative Auditor's office to block the release of the CEO salary, contending that information was part of the hospital's \"marketing strategy'' and \"strategic plan,'' which shields it from the public, the auditor's office said.\nAfter Clark ruled in favor of the Legislative Auditor in August, the agency released the audit but withheld the information about the CEO's compensation. The hospital appealed Clark's ruling and sought a stay. But on Thursday (Sept. 17) she denied that motion and the Legislative Auditor released the full report.\nLegislative Auditor Daryl Purpera said Clark's ruling confirms the Legislature's intent to let the public know \"how much it is paying a public hospital's CEO in compensation, reimbursement and benefits.''\nThe hospital has argued that another legislative act, the Enhanced Ability to Compete Act, allows information such as salaries to be kept out of the public's view so as not to put it at a competitive disadvantage.\nDavid Mannella, chairman of the hospital's Board of Commissioners, said the act \"keeps a level playing field,'' between public hospitals and private hospitals, which do not have to publicly disclose such financial information. Mannella said the board wants to be \"as transparent as possible,'' but has held that salaries are strategic information.\nManella said the board contracts with a consultant to help establish executive salaries and that the CEO's salary is based on those salaries paid by hospitals that have similar demographics.", "external_links": ["https://app.lla.state.la.us/PublicReports.nsf/D580808FDC1FF24186257EC3006BBD17/$FILE/0000A890.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-21T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:19:36.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
