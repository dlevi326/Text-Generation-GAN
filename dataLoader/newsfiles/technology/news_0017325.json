After declaring she wasn’t in the house to make friends when she first arrived, Nina felt the wrath of the fiery food blogger at the cocktail party.\nThe pair came to blows while discussing what Sam was looking for in a lady.\nOther Stories ‘My husband and I haven’t had sex in a year’ Relationships Greek model saves drowning refugee World 0 comments Take his name and you’ll be called ‘actor’s wife’ Rendezview 0 comments Fleeced!

She’s trying to get a guy who’s whole life is about that,” Rachel told the cameras.\n“Has she not seen the calibre of women she’s up against in the house? I would like to see Nina go home tonight because I’m sick of hearing her voice.”\nAnd the feeling was mutual. Nina said she’d reached the point where she “couldn’t be bothered” speaking to the gatecrasher. “If Rachel received a rose over myself, I would be downright peed off. She is just not a nice girl,” the brunette said as it was nearing crunch time.\n“He needs to sell himself to ME.” But Rachel, who entered the mansion alongside fellow intruder Lana Jeavons-fellows, believes if she had come into the competition earlier, her Bachelor fate would have been different.\n“Obviously I came in very late, things had already started getting quite serious before I got in there,” she told news.com.au , adding the reception from the original ladies “was cold”.\n“You don’t want to make friends with girls who are going for the same guy because then it’s kind of like you’re going behind their backs.”\nWhile Rachel wouldn’t be drawn on her run-ins with Nina, she said she “never felt accepted” by the rest of the group, and was disappointed not to get any one-on-one time with Sam.\n“I would have loved to have gone out and spent the day with him, done something fun and adventurous, but the other girls obviously have their ways of getting through to him over what I could do ...”\n“If Sam wants me, he can come to me!” Ultimately, it came down to just the two intruders left standing. Sam handed the rose to recent frontrunner Lana.\n“He had to eliminate someone so I suppose he had to go with me because we hadn’t developed anything yet,” Rachel reasoned.\nSince leaving the mansion, the Brissie-based blogger says she’s currently still single and “on the prowl”. So single lads — watch out!\nWith five ladies left in the Bachelor nest, the all-important home visits are almost upon us.\nAnd one of the top five won’t make the cut.\nThe Bachelor continues Wednesday and Thursday nights, 7.30pm on Ten.\nGood riddance!
