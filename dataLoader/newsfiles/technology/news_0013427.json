Now everybody can sound like their favorite rock stars with no experience necessary,” claims John Devecka, Singtrix CEO. \nUnlike other karaoke machines, Singtrix ® offers the most advanced vocal effects technology available. It has hundreds of presets along with live pitch correction, which makes bad singers sound good, and good singers sound amazing. With the added ability to use music from almost any device (enabling the use of personal music libraries or even YouTube ® ), it is set to take your karaoke performance or party to the next level. \nAbout The EGC Group \nThe EGC Group , a full-service integrated marketing and digital agency with offices in Long Island and Manhattan, NY, provides services in advertising, online marketing, web development, data analytics, integrated communications planning, and strategic consulting. The client roster of EGC includes well-known brands such as Brother International, Canon, Sterling Optical and Red Mango, among others.
