The ANA has been operating more than 630 MSFVs since 2012. \"This additional supply of vehicles will support Kandaks currently operating MSFVs.\" \nTextron Marine & Land Systems senior vice-president and general manager Tom Walmsley said: \"Since being put into service by Afghan National Army Kandaks (battalions) several years ago, ANA soldiers have experienced the exceptional mobility, survivability and overall performance these vehicles are known for. \n\"This additional supply of vehicles will support Kandaks currently operating MSFVs, so that existing ANA vehicle inventory can be rotated in for regular service and maintenance work.\" \nCommando Select is a 90mm direct-fire vehicle designed to address the growing international requirement for significantly greater under-armour firepower, integrated on a highly mobile armoured vehicle. \nCapable of carrying up to seven soldiers alongside the crew, the vehicle incorporates a monocoque V-shaped hull, which is designed for protection against landmines and improvised explosive devices. \nAdditionally, a CMI Defence Cockerill CSE 90LP weapon system provides day / night combat capability for counter-insurgency and legacy combat operations. \nWork under the contract is scheduled to be carried out at the company's facility in Slidell, Louisiana, US, with vehicle deliveries starting next month and completing by February 2016.
