The operating system takes up less space than iOS 8 did -- 1.3 GB compared to 4.6 GB -- and if an iPhone doesn't have enough space to download iOS 9, a pop-up notification will give the user an option to delete and reinstall apps automatically. \nApple's next generation of iPhones -- the 6S and 6S Plus -- will come with iOS 9 by default. \nThe new phones go on sale in stores on Friday. Pre-sales began about a week and a half ago, and the company expects that demand for the new devices will also set records.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T18:51:20.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
