To secure its future, the mobile money group must now convince risk-averse banks its technology is worthy of long-term commitment. \nOn Wednesday, Monitise announced chief executive Elizabeth Buse was stepping down after only six months due to personal reasons as it also announced a pre-tax loss of £227m for the year to June 30 — more than three times the £63m it lost a year earlier. More Apple, Facebook and Google flex mobile ad muscle \nAnalysts say the bulk of the company’s problems stem from its attempts to transform its business model. In its early years, Monitise , founded by Alastair Lukies and Steven Atkinson, focused on building bespoke services for individual banks and financial services. \nThis was widely seen as an attractive proposition for groups needing to quickly provide mobile banking offerings to customers who are increasingly using smartphones and tablets. \nNow, Monitise wants clients to shift to its single “cloud” platform that can be accessed by all, providing it with more consistent revenues from subscriptions than charging licence fees for its products. \nThis has proven to be a more difficult sell than it hoped and the company has been hit by string of revenue warnings since the start of 2014. Shares in the Aim-listed company have lost almost 94 per cent of their value in the past 12 months. \nMonitise declined to comment for this story. But this week, Peter Ayliffe, chairman, said the “transformation of the business, while absolutely necessary, has been slower and more challenging than expected and has significantly impacted our financial performance”. \nConvincing large lenders to use its technology to bring in new digital capabilities has been a struggle. \nRoyal Bank of Scotland , which suffered another high-profile IT glitch in June delaying some 600,000 customer payments, uses Monitise for its mobile banking services. \nThe company also signed a seven-year partnership deal with Virgin Money at the end of last year and was working on a digital savings product for Virgin that was being trialled with bank staff, according to two people familiar with the situation. \nBut other established banks, such as Lloyds, have developed their own proprietary systems to support digital banking for customers, rather than rely on external platforms. \n“Monitise clearly offers a bank-grade solution, but it’s about persuading banks that that’s a good long-term solution,” said Milan Radia, an analyst at Jefferies. Monitise clearly offers a bank-grade solution, but it’s about persuading banks that that’s a good long-term solution \n- Milan Radia, analyst at Jefferies \nAdoption of its new technology has been slower than the company hoped, but several other factors have accelerated Monitise’s revenue declines. In July, Visa Europe a shareholder since 2011, began selling its stake in the company, mirroring a decision made a year earlier by Visa Inc, which was at the time Monitise’s largest shareholder. \nMonitise shored up its customer base in November last year by striking deals with Spanish bank Santander, telecoms group Telefónica and MasterCard that saw all three become big shareholders in the company. \nMr Radia said Monitise was reinforcing its neutrality by working with MasterCard. “Visa’s response was, as I interpret it, ‘we’ve put a lot of our know-how and resources into this relationship, you are our guys, you shouldn’t be working with MasterCard’. The implication is that that development, integration and revenue came down more sharply than had been anticipated.” Monitise has announced the departure of chief executive Elizabeth Buse \nDespite setbacks, analysts see some signs of hope. The company’s partnership agreement with IBM will help it build and implement its mobile platform, while also giving Monitise access to Big Blue’s client base of big corporate customers. French bank Société Générale has already capitalised on the partnership, by launching a new mobile banking offering with the support of IBM and Monitise, to be rolled out across Africa. \nTo try and reverse consistently falling revenues, Monitise is implementing a series of cost-cutting measures, reducing headcount, streamlining its research and development division and focusing on established markets. \nThis week, the company said revenues would not grow in 2016, but cost reductions should allow it to keep its target of turning a profit by the end of the next fiscal year. \n“You are still talking about a business expecting £90m in revenues in the current year,” said Philip Carse, principal analyst at Megabuyte. “It is not like a start-up where revenues just aren’t coming. \nMr Carse added: “The issue with Monitise is that they spent money like it going out of fashion, building geographic presence and trying to be all things to all people. I suspect the move to profitability doesn’t require bringing on board a lot more revenues. In the short term, it requires cutting back in a lot of these costs built up over time.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
