TEMIA's meeting featured a \"Who's Who\" list with the largest gathering of CEOs, presidents and leaders of TEM, Wireless Expense Management (WEM), Mobile Device Management (MDM), Manage Mobility Services (MMS) and Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) solutions providers. In total, 77 attendees from 35 companies and 11 guests from 8 firms attended the meeting. The agenda featured: - SWOT (Strength Weakness Opportunity and Threats) findings and analysis from a TEMIA industry survey. - A guest speaker from AT&T who addressed its new split billing program. - Ralph A. Rodriguez, Fellow at the MIT Media Lab, who presented key challenges in enterprise mobility management strategy: detangling device and app management in a session entitled \"MDM vs. MAM Slugfest: Who Wins?\" - Thought Leader Panels featuring TEMIA members. - Networking opportunities and a dinner. Meeting attendees found tremendous value in the meeting and shared their views. John Perri, Founder and CEO of Comview said, \"As a former board member and active participant in TEMIA, I am always impressed by how competitors can work together during these meetings for the better interests of end users and the industry. I was fortunate to lead the panel on Legislative Actions during the SWOT workshop. While regulatory activity like the California BYOD ruling and the EU elimination of roaming charges can be seen by some people as a threat, the overwhelming majority of industry participants see these actions and similar moves as opportunities to help customers successfully navigate through uncertainty and change.\" Michelle Forney, TEM Director at ISI Telemanagement Solutions , said, \"The TEMIA meeting was an excellent collaboration with colleagues. It provided the opportunity to meet and interact with thought leaders in technology and telecom expense management. During the CTIA Thought Leader panel discussions, I gained key insights and validation into industry best practices and the challenges we face with our clients. Overall the meeting and CTIA Super Mobility event was an excellent venue.\" Steve Haddock, Vice President of Sales at MOBI , said, \"One of TEMIA's greatest strengths is its ability to bring together the industries top leaders from around the world. We find ways to collaborate and work as a team to solve some of IT's greatest challenges in telecom. Through our SWOT Analysis, we discussed how the pace of change in mobility and cloud are dramatically accelerating, further exacerbating the challenge and complexity for enterprises to manage. The good news for enterprise IT leaders is that our members are investing heavily in software and processes, to greatly improve the value to our clients. Results vary based on several variables, but many clients are seeing a 200-400% hard dollar ROI while also achieving a 5x soft cost savings. Joe Basili, TEMIA Managing Director said, \"TEMIA member companies are well positioned to address best practices, performance metrics, open industry standards, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), with member companies that are able to draw on experiences from managing over $61 billion in telecom expenses on behalf of clients. These meetings demonstrate the value of collaboration and TEMIA.\"About TEMIA TEMIA's ongoing mission is to raise awareness, to improve the quality and value of solutions and to cultivate shared industry knowledge for Technology Expense Management (TEM), Telecommunications Management, Wireless Expense Management (WEM), Mobile Device Management (MDM), Manage Mobility Services (MMS) and Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) solutions.
