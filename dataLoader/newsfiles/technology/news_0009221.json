As the volume of products shipped increased, so did Utz’s concern about ensuring the integrity of every bag of snacks. Food safety became an issue for us,” reported Jeff Fuhrman, vice president of engineering. Utz needed a way to ensure that products were completely free of foreign contamination.\nWEPCO, Inc., in collaboration with Hytrol Conveyor Company, equipment suppliers, and the customer, devised the solution using new X-ray detection and innovative automation technology. The system conveys finished cartons through an X-ray system which detects the proper product weight and quantity of each SKU. The X-ray step improves both food safety and product quality. Fuhrman explained, “We are looking for foreign objects, missing product, seasoning conglomerates, and incorrect weights. DC managers are alerted when the X-ray system rejects a carton so employees can correct and reintroduce them into the system prior to the X-ray detector.”\nWEPCO is known for its innovative way of solving material handling challenges. Working with Hytrol, they devised a way to solve Utz’s food safety problem and improve product quality, and streamline operations, free up DC floor space, and improve productivity. Chris Paulsen, CEO of WEPCO, Inc., explained. To preserve available floor space, chose to elevate much of the conveyor systems, even locating the X-ray equipment on a structural mezzanine leaving the floor below for the palletizing operation. And for clean, quiet operation above the packaging floor, utilizing Hytrol Conveyors EZ-24 low voltage powered roller technology.\nTo learn more, go to: http://bit.ly/1Mdw1No\nAbout Hytrol Conveyor Company, Inc.\nHytrol Conveyor Co., Inc.
