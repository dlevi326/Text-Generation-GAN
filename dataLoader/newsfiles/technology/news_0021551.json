MGLVA offers personalized instruction, an interactive curriculum and individual attention to help students achieve academic success in ways that suit their learning style. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150316/181974LOGO \n\"At Michigan Great Lakes Virtual Academy, we strive to be a real partner to our families and work together to awaken the joy of learning in our students,\" said Kendall Schroeder, Head of School at MGLVA. \"Our online program is structured around the idea that every student learns differently, and we need to take an individualized approach to providing them with the best education possible.\" \nMGLVA families are invited to a back-to-school movie night for students and their parents on Thursday, September 3, 2015, in Novi, Mich. Families who are interested in the program, but are not yet enrolled, are invited to attend and learn more from MGLVA teachers, students and parents. There will also be a number of information sessions - both in-person and online - held throughout September. Details can be found at http://mglva.k12.com . \nMGLVA endeavors to provide support for both parents and students, creating a close collaboration among teachers, counselors, the school community and the enrolled family. In grades K-8, a parent or guardian serves as a Learning Coach, working closely with MGLVA instructors to help facilitate the student's progress. At the high school level, students follow a 4-year plan based on the Michigan curricular guidelines, facilitated by highly-qualified, Michigan-certified teachers, and the Learning Coach role shifts to one of mentorship in order to oversee, support and encourage. \nMGLVA supports families through the transition from a brick and mortar school to an online education. The school's Strong Start/Strong Finish Program is designed to help students build new school relationships and strong independent learning skills, while helping parents learn how to support their students' progress using the various tools in the online Learning Management System. As part of this program, MGLVA also holds face-to-face orientations every Monday in Traverse City, Bay City, Muskegon, Troy, Dearborn and Kalamazoo for new students. These sessions allow new families to meet school staff and other families. The facilities also support students with face-to-face tutoring, project-based learning and small group instruction. \nMGLVA provides courses in language arts/English, math, science, history, world languages, art and music, and graduates earn a high school diploma and transcript recognized by colleges and universities around the country. Face-to-face events and outings are organized to help develop and strengthen the school/family relationship and develop community. \nMore information on the school and upcoming events can be found online here: http://mglva.k12.com . \nAbout Michigan Great Lakes Virtual Academy Michigan Great Lakes Virtual Academy (MGLVA) is a full-time, online public charter school authorized by Manistee Area Public Schools, serving students in grades K through 12.
