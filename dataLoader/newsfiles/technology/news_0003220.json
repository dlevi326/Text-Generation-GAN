These monitored acceleration and measured how the hull behaved under certain conditions. This system allowed constant monitoring of the vessel and made a prognosis based on the weather forecast, parameters of the vessel and the readings.” \nCaptain Andrew Kinsey, Senior Marine Risk Consultant at Allianz Risk Consulting, said: “You can get so much data at this nano-level – how do you adequately collate, read and analyse it? When you can get actual reports on what the vessel was encountering, that will revolutionise construction. It’s fascinating and it’s not going to go away.” \nTo read an analysis on Big Data at ports, click here \nThe way that these smart ships will work will be through the use of nanotechnology in paints, coatings and materials, which will enable ships to talk to each other. \nThe ultra-sensitive monitoring through the use of acoustic fibres will allow the detection of minor changes in vibrations. \nThe end result will be that data and voyage data will be collected from the structure, components and other machinery parts of a ship to boost performance and safety. \nCaptain Rahul Khanna of Allianz is due to write a Technical Paper in the upcoming Mega-Ports Edition of PTI. \nCaptain Khanna is to analyse the threats that mega-ships pose to both ports and shipping itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T02:28:41.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
