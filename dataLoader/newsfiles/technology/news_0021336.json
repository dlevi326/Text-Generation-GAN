Yes, you’re right: “The Call of Cthulhu” is arguably HP Lovecraft’s best story, serving as a phenomenal introduction to his mythos of forgotten races, elder gods, and all manner of creepy-crawly monsters. But still, it’s high time that we gave some other gross, otherworldly creatures — eldritch entities so wildly unnatural as to blast the mind of any who lay eyes on them — the attention they so richly deserve. \nFortunately, we’re not the only ones who are interested in some slightly deeper Lovecraftian cuts, as just last year, cartoonist Johnny Ryan (the creator of Prison Pit and Pig Goat Banana Cricket ), did a series of illustrations of some of his favorites. Thrill to Johnny’s artwork, then make sure to go check him out on Twitter , Instagram , and Tumblr . Kassogtha \nTo find lesser-known, but still awesomely terrible Lovecraftian Great Old Ones, you don’t even need to travel outside of Cthulhu’s disconcertingly unforked family tree. That’s because Kassogtha, the big writhing pile of tentacles you see above, is both Cthulhu’s sister and mate. Together, they had two precious baby girls, Nctosa and Nctolhu. Between being the product of incest and those names, I’m sure they had a terrible time in middle school. Shub-Niggurath \nUnlike other Lovecraftian monsters and gods that actually show up in the author’s stories, Shub-Niggurath is pretty much just referenced in passing. Most of what we know about her — that’s right, she identifies as female — actually comes from stories that Lovecraft ghost wrote under different names, the contents of his letters or the subsequent Cthulhu Mythos writings of other authors. Where Lovecraft does speak of Shub-Niggurath though, he refers to her as both “The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young” as well as an “evil cloud-like entity,” which is absolutely terrifyingly badass enough for me. Ghast \nWhen most people think of Lovecraftian monsters, they mostly restrict themselves to the Great Old Ones, Outer Gods, Elder Gods, Great Ones, and so on. That’s a crying shame though, because Lovecraft’s Dream Cycle also has a bunch of totally bonkers monsters in it. To wit, the Ghast. They’re humanoid, but with no nose or forehead. What they do have are a pair of hooved kangaroo legs, which they bounce around on in search of tender, delectable Gugs. Gug \nThey might be Ghast food, but Gugs are still pretty serious customers, having been banished to the underworld for some terrible offense against the Great Ones. They’re giant monsters that live in humongous towers in underground towers. And as if that wasn’t bad enough, they’ve got arms that split into multiple forearms with massive talons at the end and big toothy maws that open vertically, unlike normal, reasonable, non-madness inducing horizontal mouths. Brown Jenkin \nSome of my favorite Lovecraft stories deal not so much with the Lovecraftian gods themselves, but with the monsters that they spawn. A great example of this is “The Dreams in the Witch House,” featuring Keziah Mason, an old witch who was subjected to the infamous Salem Witch Trials. Brown Jenkin is Mason’s familiar, a hairy, rat-like thing with a vaguely human face and hands. It fed on the blood of Mason, who some readers speculate was also Jenkin’s mother, having been impregnated by Nyarlathotep. Nyarlathotep \nMost Lovecraftian gods don’t bother setting foot upon the earth, preferring to hang out in cosmic exile or making their home within dreams and other wacky not-actually-physical places. That ain’t the case with Nyarlathotep, who often walks the earth in one of several different guises, including that of an Egyptian Pharaoh. His true form is a little more obscure, though like many of Lovecraft’s creations, there’s a fair amount of tentacles and leathery batwings involved. Mi-go \nNot all Lovecraftian monsters are gods or god-like entities, some of them are just straight up aliens, like the Mi-go. Made of some unnatural substance that doesn’t even occur on Earth, the Mi-go are like a gross cross between a fungus and a lobster, with batwings that let them fly from Earth to Pluto and even further away. Seeing as they worship (or at least revere) noted jerks Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath, it should come as no surprise that the Mi-go are kind of vicious and terrible. In fact, they waged a massive war against the Elder Things long before humans ever walked the Earth. Elder Things \nUnlike pretty much everything else on this list, the Elder Things aren’t really all that bad. I mean, sure, they’re terrible starfish-plant monsters that could drive a person mad just by laying eyes on them, but that’s not really their fault. Like the Mi-go, the Elder Things were aliens, but they were on top of their business, building colossal cities and societies that predate all human civilization. In between massive battles with the Mi-go and the Great Race of Yith, they also managed to create the monstrous race of the shoggoths. Shoggoth \nThe Elder Things originally created the shoggoths as a slave race (so, maybe the Elder Things weren’t all that nice of dudes), forcing them to build massive underwater cities through hypnosis. The shoggoths were humongous, amorphous blobs, made of protoplasmic slime with a bunch of eyes placed all of the place. They have tremendous strength and can use their icky, gross bodies to make whatever limbs they require for a given task. Eventually, they developed a consciousness of their own and turned against their Elder Thing masters. The Great Race of Yith \nMi-go and shoggoths weren’t the only things that the Elder Things had to contend with — they also had an ongoing issue with the Great Race of Yith. When the planet of Yith was about to be destroyed billions of years ago, its inhabitants used their psychic powers to plop their minds down inside of the most bad-ass, long-lived race they could find, which just so happened to be a cone thing with four crazy arms that lived on Earth. You know, like you do. Two of the arms had claws, one had a set of horns and the final one had a kind of “head” with eyes, ears and, because it’s Lovecraftian, tentacles. Dagon \n“Dagon” was one of the first stories that Lovecraft wrote as an adult, and as such, the Cthulhu Mythos he later became known for was still in its nascent state. But still, “Dagon” introduces a concept that Lovecraft would use over and over again: The idea that what humans thought to be gods were oftentimes malevolent extraterrestrial or extraplanar entities. In “Dagon,” a man sees a massive fish-like humanoid crawl up out of the ocean and embrace a type of holy monolith, so it’s fitting that the story is named after the Caananite fish-god, Dagon. \nEveryone loves Cthulhu — and with good reason! The whole octopus head, claws, and wing combo is a classic, and “Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn” sounds like something the Beatles could have written. But still, the next time you want to let your Elder God freak flag fly, consider giving some other Lovecraftian monsters your attention. It gets lonely in the outer darkness. \nWhen Aubrey Sitterson isn’t trying to usher in the return of the Old Ones, he’s working on his sword sorcery serial podcast SKALD and hosting his wrestling talk show STRAIGHT SHOOT .
