The panel will take place September 15th from 8:30 – 10:00 am at McCormick Place North, room N426a in Chicago, IL. Mr. Swain will open the session with a presentation on the topic of The Emergence of Omni-Channel Communications followed by a panel discussion, which he will moderate. Swain will be joined by Dan Beery, Doc Composition Manager of RR Donnelley, Marianne Gaige, President/CEO of Cathedral Corporation, and Mark Laube, COO of Microdynamics Group.\nCommunicating via multiple channels often still falls short of a true omni-channel approach. As marketers and transactional communication stakeholders begin to leverage a single view of their customers (and prospects) more strategically, the customer experience becomes an interaction with a brand—not a channel within the brand. “Communications channels and preferences have evolved,” noted Swain. “I’m excited to discuss the topic of omni-channel communications with a panel with such deep market insights.”\nConsumers want to engage with a brand at their retail store, online, via mobile app, through their hardcopy bill, direct mail piece, catalog or social media via a seamless customer interaction, independent of channel or device. “We’re thrilled to have Matt return to moderate our breakfast keynote session this year,” exclaimed Skip Henk, President and CEO of Xplor. “Our sponsors have recommended superb speakers to join Matt and we can’t wait to see it all come together on Tuesday.”\nRegistration for Xplor’s breakfast keynote is complimentary; however, space is limited to the first 200 registrants. Each attendee will also receive a complimentary Graph Expo Exhibit Hall pass as part of their registration.
