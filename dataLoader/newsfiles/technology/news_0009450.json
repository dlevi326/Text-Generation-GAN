The experiments performed provided a promising outcome.”\nThese security drones could play an important role within the container port and shipping industry, especially in preventing fatal incidents such as those seen at Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering’s shipyard recently, where two people were killed as a result of a ship fire. \nThe incident at Tianjin Port is another example of where security drones could be used to visually inspect harmful chemicals or to identify anybody who is not authorised to access warehousing space at a port.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:16:14.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
