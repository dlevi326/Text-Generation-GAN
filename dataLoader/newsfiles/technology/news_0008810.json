There are still five unaccounted for.\" \nCrews searched for missing people in the flood waters but scaled back the operation at nightfall as conditions were still dangerous. \nFlooding left streets clogged with mud, rocks and debris, Washington County Emergency Services said in a statement posted on Facebook. \nThe flooding reportedly began after heavy rain hit canyons just north of town. \nOne resident of Colorado City, just across the border in Arizona, told NBC news that the rain marked one of the worst storms he had seen in decades, lasting for only 20 or 30 minutes. \n\"Everyone is family here, and it's a tragedy however you look at it,\" the resident, Ted Barlow said. \nUS Senator John McCain of Arizona said his thoughts were with those affected by the storm. \n\"My deepest condolences are with the victims and loved ones of those killed in flash flooding along the Arizona-Utah border last night,\" he said in a statement, thanking law enforcement and search-and-rescue crews for their quick action. \nThe National Weather Service earlier in the day had issued a flash flood warning, prompting nearby Zion National Park to close its narrow slot canyons, the Weather Channel reported. \nScattered thunderstorms could appear in the Hildale area Tuesday afternoon, according to weather.com. \nHildale is located around 300 miles (500 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City. \nThe town was the home base for Warren Jeffs, the self-declared \"Prophet\" who was jailed for life after being found guilty in 2011 of child sexual assault. \nHe is the former president of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS), which split from the mainstream Mormon Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) in the early 20th century. \nThe town's population includes a mix of Jeffs' loyalists and defectors, according to NBC. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:25:43.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
