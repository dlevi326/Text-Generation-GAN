I typed an article not long ago, it was not published, whether it was received or blocked -or they yet to, God knows. Nevertheless, my fellow brothers, and sisters who are Atheist ought to take a closer read on this article.\nSlavery.\nGod had directions given to the Israelites, as to how they were to treat people who were not natives within any of the twelve tribes: \"Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\"--Exodus 22:21. As they had an experience with the slavery, they were not to treat the others the same way, but to love them as they loved themselves.\nCreation.\nOthers may think that the Bible could have two different creation accounts, which may lead to think of it being contradictory. Yet when you look at it, there is only one. In Genesis 1, it is the actual accounts, and Genesis 2, it gives additional details (meaning it expands) some of the things which happened at certain days in Genesis 1. For example, in Genesis 1:26,27, we are told in the 6th day of creation, God created human beings, male and female, in his image, then Genesis 2:7, 21 we are shown \"HOW\" these beings were made. That is, the first chapter of Genesis is chronological.\nThe Seed of Abraham\nThis depends on the context of that verse, but when you look at it, the seed of Abraham, in which all the world were to be blessed, it was a reference to Jesus (Galatians 3:16). Thus those who believe in Christ, the promises which were made to Abraham are for them. Israel as a nation had a role to play to be a blessing to the world, to a large degree, they failed in their purpose as they were in apostasy, which in Christ he fulfilled, and God through those who believe in his Son the promises shall be fulfilled.\nThe Flood.\nSatan has presented God as though he were some cruel tyrant, but this is not the case. In Genesis 6:3 is vividly clear that God gave the antediluvian a probation for 120 yeras for them to come to repentance, which means the very little ones of them they had an opportunity to repent, since Noah was sent to preach a message to them. (see 2 Peter 2:5). Yet what was the result? This was recorded of their attitude in Job: \"Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? \"--Job 22:15-17. It is man's actions which lead them to their destruction.\nThe Judgment of the Nations.\nWhat about those whom God destroyed using Israel, why would God let women, children and every one be destroyed? People, we need to realize that these nations were evil from old times but God gave them a time for them to reform and repent of their wickedness---they failed to yield their hearts to the Creator. Notice what God said to Abraham, years before even Israel was in slavery: \"And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years... But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. \"--Genesis 15:13,16. Imagine the amount of years from when this was spoken to Israel coming out of Egypt, to be an instrument of judgment to the nations---that's a lot of years for a chance for them to have come to God and repented of evil.\nThe Immorality\nOthers may think the Bible condone polygamy (and other forbidden acts) because of some of the the Bible heroes were involved in it but they fail to understand that what they did it was out of their own actions, nowhere did God say they were to do that. You need to understand that the Bible keeps a faithful record of the men of old. Paul says--1Co 10:11: \"Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:08:35.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
