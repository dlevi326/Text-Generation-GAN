KosmicMath was first introduced in 2009. Six years later it rocks the Solar System with a new update. https://youtu.be/dM2nPHpg0tM \nSlothMedia, LLC is pleased to announce the immediate availability of KosmicMath version 2.0 - the space themed mathematics game that encourages kids PreK through 4’th grade to master basic math facts. Landing on each planet rewards the child and the child is automatically leveled up through 20 levels of increasing problem complexity for each grade level. Parents receive notification of children’s performance and tracking towards mastery - as measured by quick recognition or math fact and correctness of answer. \nVersion 2.0 represents a continuation of the KosmicMath success launched six years ago. Since its inaugural release, KosmicMath has helped tens of thousands of children to master their math tables. KosmicMath encourages players to master their math tables by repetitively producing problems which are appropriate to the age and level of play in accordance to the scope and sequence expectations covering Preschool through 4th grade. KosmicMath supports up to 5 individual student players on an IOS device. Player data can be synchronized between multiple IOS devices in the family - ensuring that each tablet, iPOD or iPhone is up to date with your child’s current level of play. \nKosmicMath was designed and developed by a concerned parent whom has witnessed the wheels flying off the buss within basic mathematics training. With each political cycle comes a new and more ridiculous focus on fixing education - lending credence to a never ending standards and curriculum puzzle. KosmicMath cuts through the political correctness layer of teaching math and focuses on what is truly the most important aspects for early math learners - that being quick recognition of addition, subtraction multiplication and division. \nKosmicMath has been used by parents looking to give their child a boost in math table practice while relieving the tedium from repetitive problems. Put the repetitive nature to math facts to work in your child’s life and it will reward you. My youngest child has been with KM since Kindergarden and he was recently benchmarked by STARS testing to be operating at a full two years ahead of his sixth grade class. He was and remains a pinnacle inspiration to the KM authors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T06:52:27.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
