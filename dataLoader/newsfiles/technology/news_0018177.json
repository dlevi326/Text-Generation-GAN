Generally, and especially in the aircraft industry this rule holds true provided of course, the pilot knows how to take advantage of a twin engine.Without a shred of doubt, the second engine provides the pilot and passengers a degree of safety through redundancy. However, that safety might evaporate in a flash if the pilot is unable to leverage characteristics or advantages of a twin engine via the aircraft monitoring system.A single engine aircraft monitoring system is relatively simple. Impending failures are much easier to detect and take appropriate corrective action. When it comes to twin engine aircraft monitoring system, it gets a little bit more complicated.A twin engine aircraft monitoring system obviously holds twice the amount of data when compared to a single engine aircraft monitoring system. Both set of figures have to be read together and the pilot has to understand how each is connected with the corresponding set of the second engine. The pilot also needs to set the right alarm parameters so that if an engine failure is eminent, the pilot can reduce speed and altitude and land the plane as quickly as is possible before the engine quits.The combination of modern digital Aircraft Gauge system coupled with the presence of a second engine can sometimes lull the pilot into a sense of false security. The simple fact is, if one aircraft engine quits, the loss of power is not proportionate - it is usually around 80% or more and if there are passengers on board, it will not be able to maintain altitude and speed.The most critical time for twin engine aircraft is when taking off and landing. This is when half of all accidents happen. To avoid possible accidents and crashes during these critical phases, the pilot needs to thoroughly review of the aircraft's performance data. Thanks to latest Aircraft Flight Instruments especially like the ones manufactured by J P Instruments, the performance data can be easily downloaded and analysed.When reviewing the flight data, the pilot should use very conservative estimates for the takeoff distance and climb performances listed in the operating manual. Also, before each flight, the pilot must decide if a safe flight can be maintained after losing an engine. In most cases, the answer is no.Before flight, the pilot should power up the engines and carefully observe aircraft monitoring system to see if their aircraft is developing full power. Power problems if any can be detected by paying attention to the Aircraft Precision Products.Life of a single engine pilot is less complicated and decisions more easily made. If the engine in a single engine aircraft fails, the pilot glides and lands ASAP! There are no two ways about it. Similarly during takeoff if the engine fails, all the pilot can do is to decide on what not to hit at the end of the runway.Fact of life is that accidents and crashes can and will happen but can be avoided if proper attention is paid to the aircraft monitoring system.
