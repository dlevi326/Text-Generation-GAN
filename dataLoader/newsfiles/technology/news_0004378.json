To earn a Microsoft gold competency, partners must successfully complete exams (resulting in Microsoft Certified Professionals) to prove their level of technology expertise, and then designate these certified professionals uniquely to one Microsoft competency, ensuring a certain level of staffing capacity. They also must submit customer references that demonstrate successful projects (along with implementing a yearly customer satisfaction study), meet a revenue commitment (for most gold competencies), and pass technology and/or sales assessments.\nQUADROtech Solutions is a global ISV specializing in email data migration solutions. We are the only migration vendor able to provide 'one window' migrations of all email workloads - email archives, PSTs, and live mail - to Office 365 and cloud/on-premise hybrid environments.\n“Adding Microsoft’s Gold Messaging and Data Platform competencies to our Gold Application Development competency showcases our expertise in and commitment to today’s technology market and demonstrates our deep knowledge of Microsoft and its products,” said Dan Langille, QUADROtech’s Director of Business Development. “We set the industry standard in migration speed, ease of use, and data integrity. We are also the only migration ISV able to offer cloud-powered migrations that enable migration projects to begin within minutes or hours rather than days or weeks – all of which empowers us and our partners to help Microsoft and our mutual clients to realize the benefits of rapid active usage of Office 365.”\n“By achieving a gold competency, partners have demonstrated the highest, most consistent capability and commitment to the latest Microsoft technology,” said Phil Sorgen, corporate vice president, Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. “These partners have a deep expertise that puts them in the top 1 percent of our partner ecosystem, and their proficiency will help customers drive innovative solutions on the latest Microsoft technology.”\nAttaining the Microsoft Messaging competency demonstrates partner expertise in email management and server integration solutions. Equipped with exclusive training, the latest software and support on Microsoft Exchange solutions, partners help customers create communications they can rely on without the maintenance and infrastructure costs of independently managed systems.\nAttaining the Data Platform competency demonstrates partner expertise in some of Microsoft’s most in-demand products, including Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008 R2 with Hyper-V. By using the complete platform from Microsoft, companies can extend their Microsoft SQL Server infrastructure in the cloud and meet the requirements of the most demanding mission-critical workloads, empowering their IT departments and enabling business insights. Equipped with exclusive training, the latest software and support, these partners provide their customers with data warehousing solutions that manage and help secure their critical data using cost-effective, flexible and high-performance applications.\nThe Microsoft Partner Network helps partners strengthen their capabilities to showcase leadership in the marketplace on the latest technology, to better serve customers and, with 640,000 Microsoft partners in their ecosystem, to easily connect with one of the most active, diverse networks in the world.\nAbout QUADROtech: QUADROtech’s technology is used to power the migration projects of companies looking to migrate email archives, live mailboxes and PST files/offline emails to a range of new archiving platforms such as new versions of Enterprise Vault and Office365.
