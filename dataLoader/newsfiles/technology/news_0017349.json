The player, which has a curved shape to match Samsung's curved Ultra HD TVs, is due in early 2016; no pricing was announced.\nFox Home Entertainment announced plans to make all upcoming releases available in the 4K Ultra HD format, on the same day that traditional Blu-ray discs hit -- and to have discs out when the player arrives. Among the releases in the works: Exodus: Gods and Kings , Kingsman: The Secret Service , Fantastic Four , X-Men: Days of Future Past , Life of Pi , Wild and The Maze Runner .\nREVIEWED.COM TELEVISIONS\nSamsung Plays It Safe at IFA-Gearing Up for a Big CES?\nSamsung's player will support High Dynamic Range (HDR) content, too, providing an expanded palate of richer color representation. Fox will incorporate HDR into its releases, too.\nAppearing on stage at the Samsung event, Fox Home Entertainment president Mike Dunn touted the format. \"When my colleagues and I at Fox first saw the side-by-side comparison of Ultra HD with High Dynamic Range vs. HD, it was reminiscent of the difference between standard def and high def,\" he said. \"This is a massive leap forward for the consumer experience.\"\nFox and Samsung also announced they are collaborating on new TV technologies at the Fox Innovation Lab. \"We believe it is critical to have rich,\ncompelling content available to consumers as the UHD TV market continues to grow,\" Dunn said.\nBack in January 2015, Panasonic displayed an Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc player at the Consumer Electronics Show that the company expected to release by the end of 2015.\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider\n8 CONNECT 54 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1UunFlq TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e9b11c182cdf444d09b552a6180fb12b05d51a2c/r=300/https/reviewed-production.s3.amazonaws.com/1441256856000/Samsung-IFA-2015-hero-2.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1UunFlq", "http://televisions.reviewed.com/news/samsung-plays-it-safe-at-ifa-gearing-up-for-a-big-ces", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768674930224282-image1.jpeg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a00915d83197b35d7f170ff37f003bc17671e9cc/c=150-0-1950-2400&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/09/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768674930224282-image1.jpeg", "http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/samsung-electronics-shows-how-to-bring-the-internet-of-things-to-life-at-ifa-2015/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UunFlq&text=Samsung%20and%20Fox%20tout%204K%20Blu-ray%20Discs&via=usatoday", "https://twitter.com/MikeSnider", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UunFlq&mini=true"], "published": "2015-09-03T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:56:49.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
