The president's plane came down low to the ground, and the village was visible on the left side of the plane.\nThe pilots turned the plane around to fly over Kivalina again so the president could get a second look.\n\"On my way here, I flew over the island of Kivalina, which is already receding into the ocean,\" Obama said during his address in Kotzebue.\nHe described how waves sweep across the entire barrier island at times.\n\"For many of those Alaskans, it's no longer a question of if they are going to relocate, but when,\" Obama said. \"Think about that. If another country tried to do wipe out an entire town, we'd do everything in our power to protect it.\"\nHawley was among 10 village leaders who flew by charter plane to Kotzebue, and she introduced the president before his address.\n\"I think we're in a prominent place to get our issues addressed on climate change,\" Hawley said. \"It's all about life safety and food security.\"\nBrian Deese, Obama's senior adviser for climate and energy issues, said the federal government was working to address concerns in Kivalina and similar villages that find it hard to access federal funds for relocation.\nHe said that Alaska Natives had identified USDA water infrastructure grants as a particular source of funding that could be helpful.\nHawley said the village wants to build a 7-mile evacuation road and causeway to the mainland where residents voted several years ago to build a future school at a potential relocation site.\nErosion is only part of the impact of climate change, which is accelerating in the Arctic. Villagers say the migrations of animals they rely on for much of their diet, such as bearded seal and caribou, have become unpredictable and is taking place far earlier. That is forcing residents to travel farther to hunt.\nFor the past few years, the caribou that used to show up by the thousands near the village have all but disappeared.\nAlso, the ice that protects the shores from storm surges is forming later and melting earlier, allowing stronger storms to lash out at the eroding coastline.\nJoseph Swan Jr., who manages Kivalina's water plant, has lived in the village all his 47 years. He welcomed the opportunity for the village to be on Obama's radar because the president has global influence.\n\"It's great that somebody's finally paying attention, real attention, and letting us know we're not invisible,\" Swan said.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Josh Lederman contributed to this report from Air Force One over Kivalina.\n___\nFollow Rachel D'Oro at https://twitter.com/rdoro", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/55/17/8573906/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/55/17/8573904/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/55/17/8573904/7/920x920.jpg", "https://twitter.com/rdoro", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/54/26/8570295/23/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/55/16/8573852/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/55/17/8573905/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/55/17/8573905/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/55/16/8573852/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/54/26/8570295/23/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/55/17/8573906/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-03T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T12:43:43.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
