PriceWaterhouseCoopers forecasts out-of-home advertising will eclipse $45 billion worldwide by 2019. \nWith access to over 300,000 digital and static out-of-home billboards including roadside, transport and retail, BITPOSTER works with prominent media owners to reach a nationwide audience. Rubicon Project’s industry leading Orders technology platform -- the first and only platform of its kind in the market today -- will enable the automation of both the traditional paper as well as digital out-of-home advertising trading process, minimizing cost and time inefficiencies while ensuring maximum revenue and consumer reach for both buyers and sellers. The partnership makes premium out-of-home inventory, reaching 98% of the UK market, available to advertisers within Rubicon Project’s industry leading Orders platform this month. \nAidan Neill, CEO and co-founder of BITPOSTER, commented: “It’s no secret that a majority of the benefits of technology in advertising are associated with process automation, freeing up creative people to reach their customers with timely, powerful and relevant messages in any channel. This is precisely why Rubicon Project, the leading provider in the automation of advertising, is an ideal partner for us as we look to further enhance our offering. At BITPOSTER, we are focused on the technology infrastructure for outdoor media, which is a natural extension point for Rubicon Project’s demand. We’re really excited about the opportunity to work together.” \nJay Stevens, International GM for Rubicon Project, commented: “Even as the outdoor media segment of the market continues to grow, the buying and selling process is still largely built on traditional, manual trading processes. Rubicon Project’s mission has long been to automate the buying and selling of advertising across all media types and today’s announcement marks a significant milestone as we expand into the growing multi-billion dollar out-of-home advertising market. Through the strategic partnership, Rubicon Project’s technology will enable advertisers to reach audiences in out-of-home environments with the same efficiency and effectiveness they have been able to achieve online.” \nAbout BITPOSTER \nBITPOSTER is a leading UK-based advertising technology business focused on the outdoor media market.
