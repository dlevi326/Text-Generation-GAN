We will have to take a call as a group,\" said Kishore Biyani, founder of Future Group, India's largest network of retail store chains. \"There has to be clarity in the policy. That's it.\" \n\nTraditional retailers contend that while India bars FDI in e-commerce firms that sell products directly to consumers, foreign companies are allowed to operate online marketplaces that offer a platform for sale of global brands, putting them at a disadvantage. \n\nIndia allows 51% FDI in multi-brand retailing, with a whole host of conditions including 30% mandatory local sourcing and $100 million upfront investment. \"We will wait for another few days but if they (the government) still don't get a clarified policy, we will have no other option than to go for legal recourse,\" said Kumar Rajagopalan, chief executive of the Retailers Association of India. \n\nRAI, an industry body representing over 1,000 retailers, including Shoppers Stop, Reliance Retail and the Future Group, filed a writ petition against the government in mid-May asking for a level playing field in terms of foreign investment. \n\nThe Delhi High Court converted the petition into a representation on May 21 and directed the association to discuss the matter with the government, failing which they could approach the court again within four months. Since then, associations of mobile and footwear sellers have also filed similar petitions alleging FDI violations. \n\nBiyani had told ET in May that India's physical retailers and the marketplace model operated by foreign-funded e-commerce companies in India are largely similar â€” the only difference is the process of smart accounting by online retailers. He also said e-commerce companies are violating FDI laws \"in the spirit and letter\". \n\n\"Everybody knows that and I am not the only one saying that and my comment stands,\" he said. Now, brick-and-mortar retailers say they will push the case in the Delhi court, once again highlighting how e-commerce companies are allegedly circumventing India's FDI regulations. \"E-commerce is only supposed to translate the physical world into the Internet world and therefore deserves to be similarly regulated as commerce in the physical world,\" said Rajagopalan. \n\n\"Though the outcome of e-commerce and retail in the physical world is the same, the treatment meted out by the government of India to the two retail segments in the same market is inequitable,\" he added. \n\nE-tail discounts hurt retailers \nDiscounts offered by online players such as Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon have cut into the sales of brick-and-mortar retailers. Flipkart and Snapdeal have attracted billions of dollars in foreign funding while US-based Amazon has set up a fully owned subsidiary here and has pledged to invest $2 billion in India. \n\nOver the past few years, retailers have repeatedly asked the government to create a simple FDI policy without segregation by brands and channels. In its petition, RAI argued that the word \"retailer\" cannot be allowed to have different meanings for players on the Internet and in the physical space. J Suresh, chief executive of Arvind Lifestyle Brands, which operates a host of global stores including Gap, US Polo and Calvin Klein, said, \"We are just asking that if FDI is allowed in e-commerce, why should brick-and-mortar retail be considered a different sector? Both are two different channels within retail and policies should be uniform.\" \n\nIn August, the All India Footwear Manufacturers & Retailers Association filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, alleging violation of FDI norms by online marketplaces. \n\nThe case is scheduled to come up for hearing on Wednesday. Last month, the Kerala High Court admitted a case from the Mobile Retailers Association that accused e-commerce firms including Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal of FDI violations. The mobile phone dealers said the e-commerce companies enter into exclusive bulk deals with manufacturers to sell their mobile phones and such strategies would \"wipe out\" traditional sellers and result in lakhs of job losses.
