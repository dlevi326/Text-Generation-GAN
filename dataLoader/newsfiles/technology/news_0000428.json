We will make all these 4,800 buildings accessible through retro-fitting after doing an access-audit,\" said Mukesh Jain, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.\nPublic transport including railways stations, airports and buses will be covered in the second section of the campaign.\n\"Transport system is absolutely inaccessible in this country. While all international airports have been decided to be made accessible by July 2016, domestic airports will be done by July 2019.
