U.S. spending on prescription drugs rose more than 12% last year, the biggest annual increase in more than a decade, according to the largest pharmacy-benefit manager. The increase was fueled by expensive new treatments for hepatitis C and cancer.\nIn its report, ICER concluded that while Praluent and Repatha cut levels of bad cholesterol and may prevent heart attacks, the magnitude of their ability to extend healthy life doesn't justify the cost on a per-patient basis. ICER also said that even if only 25% of eligible patients took the drugs, some $100 billion would be added to U.S. health-care costs over five years at the prices set by the manufacturers.\nICER President Steven Pearson said in an interview that the analysis of the cholesterol drugs attempted to place a value on \"how much better do we think this will make patients' lives, and basically think of that as an anchor of prices.\"\nDr. Pearson said he hopes insurers use the report as \"a tool when they enter a room with manufacturers to negotiate prices.\" Some drug-plan managers have credited ICER's research with helping them negotiate discounts on expensive new hepatitis C drugs after ICER concluded the therapies would only be cost-effective at half their price.\nIn July, ICER received a $5.2 million grant from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation in Houston to expand ICER's research evaluating whether new drugs are worth their price tags. The Arnold foundation, which also funds projects to improve education and criminal justice, was started in 2008 by Mr. Arnold, a former Enron trader and hedge-fund manager, and Ms. Arnold, a lawyer.\nICER's first use of the new funds was to analyze the two new cholesterol-lowering drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration since July. Praluent and Repatha belong to a new category known as PCSK9 inhibitors and were shown in clinical studies to significantly reduce levels of bad cholesterol. Cutting cholesterol is believed to reduce the risk of heart attacks, though studies have yet to definitively demonstrate that Praluent and Repatha can do this.\nThe FDA approved Praluent and Repatha to help patients who need additional reductions in levels of bad cholesterol, beyond what can be achieved by a widely used class of drugs known as statins. In its report, ICER estimated that between 3.5 million and 15 million Americans with high cholesterol may be eligible to use the new drugs.\nWrite to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for Sanofi\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=FR0000120578\nAccess Investor Kit for Sanofi\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US80105N1054\n 08, 2015 19:07 ET (23:07 ", "external_links": ["http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US80105N1054", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=FR0000120578", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T09:26:23.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
