ON World’s analysis of 260+ smart lighting products found that retail sales of smart wireless lighting continues to accelerate with smart LED light bulbs now outselling other product segments such as switches, dimmers, plugs and sensors. Also, 2 in 5 smart lighting products are smart LED light bulbs or lighting strips and two-thirds of these were launched within the past 18 months.\nON World’s recently completed surveys with 1,000 US online adults found that 1 in 5 are planning to own a smart home sensing system within the next 24 months. Smart LED light bulbs are planned by over half of likely smart home adopters and the majority of respondents would like to integrate smart lighting with at least one other application.\nBy 2020, 37 million households worldwide will have a smart lighting system and the majority of these will also use one other smart home application.\nBased on input from 2,100+ individuals, ON World’s recently published report, “ Smart Home Lighting ,” covers the global residential wireless lighting controls market and includes 5-year market size forecasts (units and revenues) by product type, market channel, geography and technology; the results from two consumer surveys; an in-depth analysis of 260 smart lighting products; technology evaluation; and analysis of 40+ companies across the whole smart lighting value chain.\nA free executive summary is available from ON World’s website .\nAbout ON World:\nON World ( http://www.onworld.com ) provides global business intelligence on smart technology markets.
