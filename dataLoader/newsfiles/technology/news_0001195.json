Andrew Meares by Jonathan Barouch At a recent meeting with Wyatt Roy and a number of other federal government advisers, I commented to a fellow start-up chief executive that Wyatt articulated Australia's need to support its start-up community more fervently than many of us from the industry itself.\nIt was my first encounter with the 25-year-old Liberal Queenslander, who days before had returned from a bipartisan technology fact-finding trip to Boston with Labor's Ed Husic.\nWyatt freely Quote: d conversations he'd had with Israel's chief scientist Avi Hasson (Wyatt is leading another mission to Israel in November). He also said we should mimic tax legislation put in place by governments in Israel and Britain to incentivise investment in early-stage technology companies. I couldn't believe what I was hearing … a member of Parliament lobbying the benefits of start-up led innovation.\nThe Abbott-led government began talking about technology disruption earlier in 2015, with former treasurer Joe Hockey encouragingly using the word \"start-up\" several times during his budget speech in May. A number of members of government were clearly engaged on the matter, with former small business minister Bruce Billson and the former treasurer announcing changes to employee share option schemes and a draft paper on crowd-sourced equity funding.\nOthers like Malcolm Turnbull and Paul Fletcher were regulars at start-up co-working spaces and events. But it was unclear who in the government had the mandate to drive policies to support innovation, with some members of Parliament commenting privately on the need for a parliamentary secretary to galvanise the government's policy agenda.\nSo it came as no surprise to the technology community that our new Prime Minister promoted Wyatt to Assistant Minister for Innovation alongside Christopher Pyne as Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science.\nSaw a gap Wyatt saw a gap more than a year ago with the lack of a single figure championing the needs of the Australian technology ecosystem and, as any good politician would do, stepped in to fill it.\n The appointment is significant for a few reasons, not least of which is the fact that a 25-year-old now has a voice at the \"adults\" table. Too often we see the same grey-haired warriors dominating the conversation, both in corporate and political spheres.\nThe significance is that the Prime Minister's appointment of Mr Pyne's to this new portfolio elevates innovation back into the title of a ministry – and, more importantly, into the vocabulary of the electorate. Of course, this is not a new phenomenon. Labor had innovation in the title of its Industry Minister Kim Carr, even though we didn't see that government prosecute a start-up agenda.\nThe technology community has been arguing for more than a year that we need better access to Canberra and ideally a single port of call for all ideas, engagement and policies relating to jump-starting our technology ecosystem.\nMy strong hope is that Christopher Pyne and Wyatt Roy now become that single voice and open door. The new Prime Minister is talking the talk, saying this is his most important policy area, embracing change and driving the advancement of science and technology.\nEcosystem that is growing Time will tell if he can truly have an impact on the sector. Australia now has a Minister for Innovation and a tech-savvy minister assisting. We have a Prime Minister who has helped build and exit a technology company of significant scale, an ecosystem that is growing and entrepreneurs who are ready to seize the opportunity.\nThe true measure of success will be how quickly the government moves on its promises. Promoting STEM education, adding computer programming to the school curriculum and creating tax incentives to stimulate investment are just a few issues where it has promised action. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to get these policy settings right. If we don't the impact on the economy and employment will be significant.\nJonathan Barouch is founder and chief executive of location-based social analytics company Local Measure , which is headquartered in Sydney, with international offices in Singapore, London and the US.", "external_links": ["http://www.wyattroy.com.au/the-australian-opinion-put-start-ups-at-the-heart-of-the-new-economy/", "http://www.getlocalmeasure.com/"], "published": "2015-09-21T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:25:25.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
