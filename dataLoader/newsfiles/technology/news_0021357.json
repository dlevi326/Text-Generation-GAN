The guide details how branding on the space shuttle should look. Pic: NASA \nThe manual is the document that introduced NASA's \"worm\" logo - with the letters made up of thick lines. \nNo formal announcement or news release was issued to accompany the newly uploaded document. \nHowever many people have speculated that the move is an attempt to thwart two New York-based designers who created a Kickstarter to reproduce the manual in print. \nDesigners Jesse Reed and Hamish Smyth have been working with Richard Danne - one of the creators of the old NASA logo which was phased out in 1992. The document introduced NASA's \"worm\" logo. Pic: NASA \nFor $79, Kickstarter backers can reserve hard copies of the manual, complete with a foreword from Mr Danne. \nMr Reed hit back at NASA's apparent attempt to thwart his moneymaking plan. \nHe said: \"From what we see, they are scanning the pages rather quickly and without much consideration for reproduction value. \n\"Our scans will be much higher quality, perfectly colour balanced, and include the matching spot colours specified in the manual (among other signature elements) - something you don't really understand through a digital representation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T16:45:25.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
