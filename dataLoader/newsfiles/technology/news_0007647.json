According to the GSA Schedule, the video is available online to agencies of the federal government — without cost or obligation — at http://www.writesmart.com . “Many agencies have struggled in their efforts to implement the training requirements of the Plain Writing Act,” said Mike McClory, Director of the Write Smart program. “In our program, we look closely at the fundamental plain language practices used by top professional writers and editors in the publishing industry. It’s not just about little words and short sentences,” he added. “It’s about learning the techniques that help you organize your ideas in language that people will pay attention to — language that commands attention and earns respect.”\nWrite Smart has developed high-quality, low-cost writing solutions for people at every level of the federal government, from new employees to the Senior Executive Service. The 90-minute video is an introduction to a series of game-based, online and on-site courses focusing on a central theme: “Smart = Simple.” The objective is not only to upgrade the writing skills of employees, but also to enable people to avoid costly communication blunders and work together successfully.\nThe Write Smart program begins by recognizing that — because of well-publicized deficiencies in the American educational system — many people (even college graduates) enter the workforce without a solid understanding of the fundamentals of writing concisely and persuasively. As a result, the tendency to write muddled, meandering sentences, with careless errors in grammar and punctuation, has become more the rule than the exception.\n“In our program, we have found that playing games helps people learn the fundamental organizing patterns of the language quickly,” McClory said. “To improve their writing skills, people need to be stimulated — they need to be engaged. You can’t expect people to learn how to write interesting sentences and paragraphs if the training is boring.”\nAbout Write Smart ® LLC\nWrite Smart ® LLC (originally Write Right) was founded in 1983 when Mike McClory, editor of a monthly newsmagazine in Washington, D.C., began offering a series of writing classes for House and Senate staffers on Capitol Hill. The premise of his program was simple: solve communication problems by learning the plain English techniques used by top professional writers and editors in America’s publishing industry. Since then, thousands of participants in the Write Smart program have learned how to make their reports (letters, legal and technical documents, proposals, web postings, email messages, etc.) as interesting and easy to read as a magazine article. After the passage of the Plain Writing Act of 2010, Write Smart began offering classes and other educational resources over the Internet — at substantially reduced prices.
