He wanted that day to be perfect because of what it meant.\nHis grandmother, Hattie Marie Simon Griggie, would have turned 63 on Saturday if she had not lost her valiant fight with cancer two years prior. Thompson said he played the game in her memory.\n\"It was definitely on my mind,\" Thompson said. \"I wanted to score a touchdown for her. And I'm happy I did.\"\nThompson said his family gets really emotional this time of year, and he was hearing about it from his mom up until a few hours before game time.\nWATCH: Which Broncos running backs will make the Broncos final round of cuts?\nIt started to get to him.\nBut he had a game to play. Once the pads were on and ankles were taped, it was all about football. And on first-and-goal from the 1-yard line, the Broncos called his number and he punched it in up the middle for six points.\nThen, he followed it up with another run, right up the gut, for the two-point conversion.\nAdvertisement \"I think she would be real proud of me,\" Thompson said. \"She never saw me play, but I think it would have made her smile to see me scoring a touchdown.\"\nRunning backs usually don't like to tackle, and some prefer not to be tackled, either. But Thompson is a little different.\nHe seeks contact. When he was the starting running back at Duke, he also moonlighted as the special-teams captain.\n\"He does whatever you ask him to do, big or small,\" running backs coach Eric Studesville said. \"He understands a lot of his role, if he's here, is on special teams.\"\nAnd that's how he made the team last season. He joined a crowded backfield with C.J. Anderson, Montee Ball and Ronnie Hillman already in Denver. But Thompson made himself a valuable commodity on special teams and as a short-yardage back, which allowed the Broncos to keep him active in 15 games.\nThompson's Twitter bio references Galatians 6:9 which says: \"Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.\"\nThat defines Thompson's mind-set on special teams and how he got in the NFL as a whole.\nHe wasn't a star at Duke. In fact, he started just 24 of the 49 games he played and amassed only 1,244 yards over a four-year career.\nThe Broncos' Juwan Thompson powers into the end zone Saturday to score the game-winning touchdown against the San Francisco 49ers. ( Doug Pensinger, Getty Images ) As a senior, he was the team's starter to begin the year. By the end of the season, he had totaled only 355 rushing yards in 14 games.\nThompson was largely ignored in the draft process and was prepared to hang up his cleats before the Broncos saw his potential and signed him as a college free agent.\n\"I just wanted to give it a shot and see how much football I had left in me,\" Thompson said. \"I was going to go to grad school (at Duke). I already got in and everything. But I worked my (behind) off. And I made the team.\"\nNot only did he make the team, he was a key contributor. He rushed for 272 yards and three touchdowns and became the first undrafted rookie since 2006 to rush for two touchdowns in a game with his performance against San Diego in October.\n\"An opportunity is only an opportunity if you're in the position to take advantage of it,\" Studesville said.\nNow, a year later, Thompson is in the same position again.\nHis roster spot appears more secure, but you never know in this league.\nCoach Gary Kubiak noted Thompson's special-teams prowess as the main reason he has passed Ball in the running back rotation.\nStill, Thompson is not ready to let down his guard. Hard work is how he got in the league, and hard work is how he'll go out.\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/CameronWolfe", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0901/20150901__20150902_B1_SP02FBNBRONX~p1.jpg", "http://twitter.com/CameronWolfe"], "published": "2015-09-02T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:20:42.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
