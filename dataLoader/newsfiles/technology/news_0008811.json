It is often integrated into a system as a component which automatically performs a task or alerts a user of motion in an area. The multi-touch technology, which is an emerging technology, revolutionizes the way humans interact with machines, not only in business and infotainment applications, but also in day-to-day activities such as homes.The global motion sensor market was valued at USD 3.10 billion in 2014 and is projected to reach USD 6.45 billion by 2020, at a CAGR of 12.93% from 2015 to 2020.The demand for motion sensor technology has been increasing in recent years. The key drivers for this market are the adoption of motion sensors in multiple industries; the increased use of smartphones, tablets, and mobile devices; the integration of gyroscopes in mobile devices; and the rapidly growing interactive gaming industry. Motion gaming is the new trend in the market by which the user can perform multiple activities, such as cycling, running, problem solving, and many more. These kinds of activities guide a virtual character through different Slevels and stages of the game. While playing or performing these activities, users need to wear sensors that can measure their movements (sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers) and also sense their physiological measures (pulse, heart rate, and sometimes pulse oximeter oxygen saturation).The report includes company profiles of major players; their recent activities in the market, including new product launches, mergers & acquisitions, collaborations, and partnerships; and SWOT analysis. Some of the major companies profiled in this report are Bosch Sensortec GmbH (Germany), Freescale Semiconductor Ltd. (U.S.), STMicroelectronics (Switzerland), MEMSIC, Inc. (U.S.), Microchip Technology, Inc. (U.S.), InvenSense, Inc. (U.S.), Kionix, Inc. (U.S.), Honeywell International, Inc. (U.S.), Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Japan), and Analog Devices, Inc. (U.S.).
