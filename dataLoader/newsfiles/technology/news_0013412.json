I'm thrilled to be a part of the synergies and talent sharing of Toyota, MIT, and Stanford,\" Pratt said. \nThe researchers aim at developing intelligent vehicle technologies that can better \"recognize objects around the vehicle in diverse environments, provide elevated judgement of surrounding conditions, and safely collaborate with vehicle occupants, other vehicles, and pedestrians,\" he added. \nElectrical engineering and computer science Professor Daniela Rus will lead research at MIT while Fei-Fei Li, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, will head up the effort there. \n\"Our team will work to help intelligent vehicles recognize objects in the road, predict behaviours of things and people, and make safe and smart driving decisions under diverse conditions,\" Li said.
