An additional $1 million in penalties could be levied if additional violations emerge. \nTriumph recalled more than 1,300 motorcycles in September 2014 because of a defect that could reduce steering capability and increase the risk of a crash. \nAn investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that the company failed to report the defect for more than a year. The company also failed to submit required documents, including injury claims and progress reports on recall repairs. \nA telephone message seeking comment was left Monday with Triumph.
