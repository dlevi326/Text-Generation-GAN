The TrustMaps™ help software buyers quickly locate the solutions most highly rated and commonly considered by companies of a similar size, and therefore most closely aligned to their needs.\nEach TrustMap™ depicts CMS products on two dimensions – “likelihood to recommend” ratings by end-users and research frequency by prospective buyers on TrustRadius, as measured by unique page views.\nAll ratings come from authenticated users of CMS software products who reviewed or rated the product on TrustRadius.com.\nAlong with the TrustMaps™, TrustRadius Research also published a CMS Feature Report to help prospective buyers make a more informed product selection decision based on which features are most important to them. The report compares eight content management systems based on end-user ratings across 16 features, including code quality, themes and templates, WYSIWYG editor, API, extensions, and mobile optimization.\n“Some of the biggest trends in marketing, like personalization and the focus on customer experience, are highly relevant to web content management. CMS vendors are responding to these trends with new features and shifted positioning. First-hand insights from end-users are more important than ever before for those selecting a CMS,” said Vinay Bhagat, CEO of TrustRadius. \"Our CMS TrustMaps™, feature report, and arsenal of in-depth reviews provide prospective buyers all of the information they need to identify the best-fit solution for them.”\nBest CMS Software for Small Businesses (less than 50 employees)\nBased on average user ratings, the Top Rated products for Small Businesses are:\nWordpress Concrete5 Kentico 8 Joomla!\nBest CMS Software for Mid-Size Companies (51 to 1,000 employees)\nBased on average user ratings, the Top Rated products for Mid-Size companies are:\nKentico 8 Wordpress Drupal Cascade Server\nBest Accounting Software for Enterprise (over 1,000 employees)\nBased on average user ratings, the Top Rated products for Enterprises are:\nSitecore Cascade Server Wordpress\nThe CMS Feature Report is free and available here: https://www.trustradius.com/dlc/tr/cms-feature-report\nAbout TrustRadius\nTrustRadius is the leading research platform for business software based on authentic, in-depth user reviews.
