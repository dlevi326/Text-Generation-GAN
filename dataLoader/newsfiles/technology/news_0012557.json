That would mean at least $78 billion has been divested. \nFossil fuels -- especially coal, but to a lesser extent oil and gas -- contribute to emissions of carbon dioxide that have led to the planet's rising temperatures. \nScientists warn that, if left unchecked, global warming will seriously worsen droughts, floods and other disasters. \n- Bad for business, too? - \nUN climate chief Christiana Figueres said that the divestment pledges offered momentum for a year-end conference in Paris that aims to draft a new global agreement to tackle the scourge. \nBeyond the moral case, Figueres argued that fossil fuels would increasingly be a bad business choice as opportunities rise for cleaner energy. \n\"The alternative of business as usual will leave firms and investors locked into hundreds of billions of dollars in stranded fossil fuel assets as emissions are ratcheted downwards and renewable energies win the price parity race,\" she said. \nProfits of major oil companies have plummeted since last year, although industry analysts point to a variety of reasons including high output from Saudi Arabia, the fracking boom in the United States and easing tensions with Iran. \nUS activists were at the forefront of the divestment movement but the report by Arabella Advisors found that it has spread, especially to Australia, Britain and Canada. \nReligious institutions have divested some $24 billion from fossil fuels, said the Reverend Fletcher Harper, executive director of advocacy group GreenFaith. \n\"For faith communities, the Earth is our home and it is a gift, and we intend to pass it on to our next generations in at least as good condition as we received it,\" he said. \nReligious groups that have decided to divest include the Church of England, the Church of Sweden, the Episcopal Church, the United Church of Christ, the Lutheran World Foundation and the Unitarian Universalist Association. \nMinneapolis and Seattle are among cities that plan to divest. Universities include Georgetown, Oxford and Stanford. \nA year ago during a similar week of climate events in New York, the Rockefeller family announced that its $860 million philanthropic group was leaving fossil fuels. \nThe family grew wealthy thanks to Standard Oil, making John D. Rockefeller the world's richest person a century ago. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T02:54:45.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
