Who would have thought that after Guilielmo Marconi invented the antenna in 1906, it now becomes the source of many mystifying inventions using an antenna?\nPhysicists in the University of Wurzburg have invented the first Electric Light Antenna . Although, it is still in progress and requires more modification, the success it provides shows that tiny sources electric-powered light can be seen in the future. Antennas that emit light when connected or combined with electricity may seem implausible at the moment but given few more years, one can expect data transfer by using electromagnetic waves that are from the visible light of Nano-Antenna.\nAntennas were made to receive and transmit electromagnetic waves that automatically spread in the air without the necessity of wire. Indoor HD Antenna was able to receive magnetic waves that allow its user to have a clearer view of the latest news and happening in the television. As the antenna's primary use is to receive and emit signals, wireless data transfer has become possible. And with that, a group in UCLA ARAML (Antenna Research, Analysis, and Measurement Laboratory) that specializes in designing advanced antenna systems are trying to create an antenna that is powerful enough to allow Mars rover to communicate directly with Earth, losing the need for a middleman. This may seem improbable, but the likelihood of inventing an antenna that emits light when subjected to electricity is now in the progress, the invention of antenna that will enable interplanetary communication seems very much possible.\nWith the help of NASA's Engineer, the creation of antenna that will allow maximum communication is in progress, a 40 cm x 40 cm x 5 cm is what Mars Rovers can only occupy at the moment but the many potential it can bring to the innovation of humankind is unthinkable. Imagine, in the year 2050, man can fully communicate in the outside of the planet Earth and was able to unfold and understand some of the secrets of the Universe.\nSo far, this idea is still in the working progress but the much potential it uncovers excite the many scientists in NASA. The possibility of longer communication time with Mars Rover can bring many valuable scientific data that may bring an answer to some questions. Neil Armstrong set foot to the moon and all of that was possible because of the antennas that provide communication between the Earth and space vehicles.\nRCA indoor HD antenna may not be as advanced as the other antennas discussed, but it still possess a superior functionality that allows its user to receive broadcast clearly and effectively any living room television. It's high-end functions that have different options that ensure to fit rather perfectly in any situation. Just give a couple more years and RCA Antenna will be able to provide its user a clear broadcast from outer space.\nAbout RCA Antenna\nRCA offers the best and modern antenna with the form of superior functionality that is made with many options that fit any type of situations. They provide the best quality antenna that any consumer cannot find in the market.\nContact:\nDimitry Vital\nPR and Marketing @ RCA Antennas\nTelephone: 800-645-4994\nEmail Address: This email address is being protected from spambots.
