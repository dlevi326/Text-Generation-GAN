The militants' reach has expanded to other countries, including Libya, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and Afghanistan.\nUS-led airstrikes helped Syrian Kurds hold the strategic border town of Kobani in January, and seize another key border town, Tal Abyad, this summer. But a much-touted offensive to oust ISIS militants from the Iraqi city of Ramadi remains stalled; there have been grave losses among the few Syrian rebels trained by the US to fight ISIS; an ISIS-free zone announced by Turkey and the US has failed to materialise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T23:03:05.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
