Gmate SMART is available in all Kmart pharmacies as of September 2015. The Gmate SMART meter and App deliver fast and accurate blood glucose test results right to your smartphone. The Gmate SMART connects to the headphone jack of a smartphone. The Gmate SMART App is a free download on the App Store and Google Play store.\nThe Gmate SMART App stores an unlimited number of test results electronically with the date and time. There is no longer a need to write down blood glucose test results. A user can also add custom comments, actions or notes to each test result. The SMART App allows the user to email or SMS (text message) any test result or group of results to their doctor, caregiver or family member. The Gmate SMART is providing a faster and smarter way to manage diabetes.\nAs cloud technology grows, Philosys is working to create an App-to-Cloud secure connection in the next generation of updates. This will allow the user to setup a personal account with a secure login and password. The user will have the ability to see and manage test results online through a HIPPA compliant server and share their results with their physician or caregiver. The physician or caregiver will be able to set up alerts when the patient's test results are out of range. When an out of range test result is logged, the physician or caregiver will receive an email or text notification, alerting them to contact the patient.\nAnother great advantage Gmate SMART offers is the affordable cost of the test strips. At Kmart pharmacy, the Gmate SMART meter lists for $13.99 and the Gmate Test Strips list for $14.99, for a box of 50 test strips. This innovative meter will give customers an economical way to test their blood sugar and help them manage their diabetes effectively.\nThe Gmate SMART is changing the way we manage diabetes by improving health and lifestyle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:02:18.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
