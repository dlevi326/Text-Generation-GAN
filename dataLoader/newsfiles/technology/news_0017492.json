By working seamlessly together, restaurant owners can give their customers a streamlined, more interactive and aesthetically pleasing check-in experience.”\nThe package is powered by the HostMe app, which combines reservation, wait list, and loyalty program management into one easy-to-use product. An open-platform service allows for API integration, meaning owners and operators can easily merge HostMe’s features with existing corporate applications.\nThe complete HostMe product line is now available for purchase.
