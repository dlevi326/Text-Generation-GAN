A version of the technology is also on the Apple Watch.\nThe basic idea on the phones is that the amount of pressure you apply against the screen leads to different outcomes: You can summon menus, activate shortcuts or peek at hidden content. You might use 3D Touch to quickly shoot a selfie, play a song or drop a pin to mark a site on a map. The new phones also can supply the kind of tactile feedback that you get on the watch.\nMaybe the coolest use of 3D Touch on the new iPhones is through a camera feature turned on by default called Live Photo. When you take a photo, you can making it come alive with just a second or so of video, maybe cars moving in the background of an otherwise still photo.\nI'm eager to try Live Photo on the iPhone but it's not a completely novel concept. For some time now HTC has had a similar feature on its phones called Zoe.\nStill, Apple brings the kind of clout HTC could only dream about, and it is opening up Live Photo technology to developers, with Facebook among the first to take advantage. For instance you might use 3D Touch to check on your status or to check-in.\nOther highlights coming to the latest iPhones, which start at $199 with a two-year contract, include a beefed up 12-megapixel camera with improved (Apple says) autofocusing. You can also shoot 4K video.\nThere's a new rose gold color option that looks good from afar.\nAnd don't discount the collection of features that come to the new and (once you download it) old iPhones via iOS 9 software, including a lower power mode that can bail you out you before your device runs out of juice.\nMeantime, I suspect you'll come to like 3D Touch. It just may take awhile.\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY tech columnist @edbaig on Twitter\nAPPLE UNVEILS IPHONE 6S, IPAD PRO AND MORE Apple event reaction - Graham and della Cava | 02:53 Jefferson Graham and Marco della Cava weigh in on the Apple event and offerings of new iPhones, iPads and a revamped Apple TV.
