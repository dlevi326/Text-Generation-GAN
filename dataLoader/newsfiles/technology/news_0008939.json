(AP) - The wife of Washington Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan has apologized for \"disparaging\" and \"unfounded\" comments on her Twitter account about an ESPN reporter.\nThe Redskins issued a statement on behalf of Jessica McCloughan on Wednesday night in which she acknowledged making the remarks, which said the reporter exchanged sexual favors for information.\nJessica McCloughan's statement begins: \"I deeply apologize for the disparaging remarks about an ESPN reporter on my personal Twitter account. The comment was unfounded and inappropriate, and I have the utmost respect for both the reporter and ESPN.\"\nThat apology never mentioned Dianna Russini by name. But a statement issued by ESPN said, in part: \"Dianna is an excellent reporter who should never have to be subjected to such vulgar comments.\"\nScot McCloughan is entering his first season as Washington's GM.\n___\nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
