The Securonix Intelligence Platform was awarded an MVP earlier this year. \n\"Today's targeted attacks, whether launched by insiders or by external hackers, are primarily focused on stealing an organization's most sensitive data. Not only is Securonix Data Exfiltration Analytics an innovative technology solution that enterprise organizations need, but Securonix is a leader in providing technology that successfully meets the challenge of securing corporate and government agency assets against insider threats,\" said Kim Kay, editor-in-chief of Computer Technology Review. \nThe primary defense for organizations is application access controls and in some cases DLP (Data Loss Prevention) monitoring tools. Fully deployed, these controls tend to be defenseless against motivated insiders or outsiders and they generate a continuous stream of false positives. To combat these complex threats effectively, organizations need better context of a user's identity, behavior and their associated peers in order to pinpoint the real attacks and to focus monitoring efforts on what is high risk before it is too late. \nSecuronix Data Exfiltration addresses this challenge through real time monitoring and analysis of sensitive data access and usage at the source in applications (e.g. SAP, Oracle eBusiness, EPIC, other COTS, custom) and data repositories (e.g. SharePoint, Documentum, etc.). Securonix automatically detects high-risk data access and usage for real-time investigation and access removal, thereby reducing the exposure to sensitive data at its source. Meanwhile, if DLP monitoring at the endpoint, egress, or host is being used, Securonix will automatically identify the true high-risk DLP events through advanced identity, behavior and peer group analysis. The combination of these advanced monitoring and detection techniques provides the real user identity and behavior context to rapidly detect the most complex data theft and snooping attacks. \nComputer Technology Review is a US-based news portal that has been covering the best of IT, focusing on storage, cloud, virtualization, data protection, security and beyond since 1980.
