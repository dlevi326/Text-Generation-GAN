Unlike the more prominent additive plastic-melting type 3D printer, this printer can work with many different materials including wood, fabric, leather and, yes, food. \nThe Glowforge looks exactly like a giant inkjet printer from afar. But don’t let the mild form fool you, inside is a 45-watt laser that can burn through a quarter inch of plywood or acrylic and is also safe for use with food. \nThe printer can cut out accurate shapes on a sheet of material up to 20 inches by 12 inches. It can also be used as an engraving tool. That means you can cut a complex wood sculpture and engrave the surface of an iPhone with the same device. \nLaser-powered cutting machines available before were usually designed for production lines or professionals who know what they’re doing. The Glowforge, on the other hand, is beginner friendly. Features include a safely covered printing bed and WiFi connectivity. The Glowforge printer also has two cameras and distance scanners that it uses to measure the medium when you put it in. If you put in your laptop, it will automatically activate engraving instead of cutting. It also records the material’s dimensions (width, length and height) so printing is consistently accurate. \nCEO and cofounder John Shapiro shares: \nWhen we set out to make the laser affordable, our first decision was to put the software in the cloud and make extensive use of smartphone components. We quickly realized that we could use these technologies make Glowforge as intuitive and delightful to use as our favorite smart devices. \nThe startup will also be building an online catalogue for free and paid templates. Right now, Glowforge-tested projects include a rubberband gatling gun drone and engraved glass pantry spice bottles. 3D materials like the drone are printed flat and then assembled. \nThe Seattle-based startup has raised over $9 million funding from the likes of Google and Makerbot. The Glowforge printer will go on sale for $3,995, but for the first 30 days, e arly birds can snag one for just $1,995 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T20:25:57.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
