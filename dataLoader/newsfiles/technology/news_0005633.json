No Starch Press\nAs zombie movies and TV shows have shown us, it takes a lot of skill and determination to survive the zombie apocalypse. A new book from maker Simon Monk will teach you how to create your own power source and defend your home base with the use of simple circuits, Arduino, and the low-cost Raspberry Pi mini-computer.\nMonk's book -- \"The Maker's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse\" -- is available for preorder from the No Starch Press site , with an estimated release date sometime in October 2015.\nThe book will teach you how to do things like build trip wires and sensors to monitor zombie movement, set up surveillance systems and low-power lighting and contact other survivors with Morse code flashers and haptic communication devices.\nAnd it will teach you how to generate your own electricity with pedal and solar power so you can keep your base up and running for the duration of the outbreak.\nTwo versions of the book are available -- a $25 (about £15, AU $35) print version that also comes with early access to the ebook, and a $20 (about £15, AU $30) early access ebook-only version. Early access gets you access to 7 of the 10 chapters that have already been released, plus access to the remaining 3 chapters, plus appendices, once the book is finished.\nOf course, the guide won't show you how to build your own weapons -- you'll need to scavenge for those or stock up like the rest of humanity -- but it will teach you to distract zombies with noise makers and flashes so you can quickly escape a threatening walker as you try to live to fight another day.", "external_links": ["http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/08/657f0486-7331-4c42-a5b3-17fdb45c5017/resize/270xauto/d4f272428d05403896b9e1c7e75cf6a9/makersguidetozombieapocalypse.jpg", "https://twitter.com/simonmonk2", "https://www.nostarch.com/zombies?imm_mid=0d7e45&cmp=em-na-na-na-pr_makers_guide_to_zombie_apocalypse"], "published": "2015-09-09T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T02:23:29.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
