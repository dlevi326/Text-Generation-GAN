Splitsider reports that Stephen Colbert's new show—the one that premiered delightfully earlier this week, the one that seems to be trying to bring a new kind of intellectualism to late-night network comedy—has a writing staff that includes 17 men. And only two women.\nRelated Story What Funny Women Teach One Another (and Robin Williams)\nAnd: All 19 of those writers are white.\nFeel free to use this space to react with a loud groan or maybe a silent scream or maybe a dismissive “ ¯\\_( ツ )_/¯” or whatever else suits you.\nAnd, you know: I get it. Sort of. To take just one side of this, the gender question: Comedy writing skews male, famously and/or notoriously, and it’s to some extent easy to over-essentialize these things—the 17 men Colbert selected to write his material might be total feminists, and the two women might be raging misogynists, and they will all, regardless, bring a whole host of hidden and highly individualized experiences to their roles as the creators of a show that will ostensibly have a huge audience, and thus a huge platform, and thus a huge influence. There is, overall, an important difference between category and identity , and we should not be glib about any of that.", "external_links": ["http://splitsider.com/2015/09/17-men-2-women-colberts-writers-room-shows-that-nothings-changed-in-late-night/"], "published": "2015-09-11T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T00:29:12.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
