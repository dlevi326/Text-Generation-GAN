It has raised around $80 million from investors since its launch in 2000. \n\"I still have things I have to fix in our business and there is a somewhat tumultuous (financial) market environment ... Some things are a little more difficult to pin down,\" DeCesare said during a visit to Israel. \"It's when we're ready. If the market falls sharply next year I don’t want to go public.\" \nIn 2015, revenues are set to surpass $110 million, with billings from its 1,800 clients to top $140 million, he said. \n\"We will be raising money to try and continue to fuel that growth. We have an IPO in the horizon but I'm not ready yet.\" He would not comment on the size of a future IPO. \nDeCesare, who until last year was president of Intel's security division McAfee, said he plans to double the company's engineering staff in Israel to over 200 workers in the next 12-18 months and invest in sales and support staff. It employs another 300 workers in the United States and elsewhere. \nForeScout’s rivals include Cisco ( CSCO.O ) and HP's ( HPQ.N ) Aruba as well as Trustwave, which was acquired in May by Singtel ( STEL.SI ). \nGartner estimates that by 2020, 60 percent of information security budgets of companies worldwide will be allocated to breach detection and response — up from less than 10 percent in 2014. \nThat will mark a big change for companies, which currently rely on older firewall technology to secure their networks, spending $32 billion on security products in 2014, according to IDC. \nForeScout's investors include UK-based Amadeus Capital Partners, its largest shareholder, Accel Partners, and Pitango Venture Capital, Israel’s biggest venture fund. \nSeveral Israeli security firms such as Cyber-Ark Software ( CYBR.O ) have gone public in recent years with successful offerings, following in the footsteps of computer security pioneer Check Point Software ( CHKP.O ), Israel's biggest tech firm. \nForeScout, which works with other security providers, acts as the glue that connects together all the separate security investments companies have and are now making, said DeCesare. \nAnother former McAfee president, Dave DeWalt, now the CEO of breach-detection firm FireEye ( FEYE.O ), joined ForeScout's board in the past year, as did Enrique Salem, former CEO of Symantec ( SYMC.O ), another major cybersecurity player. \nAmadeus partner Richard Anton said the market for ForeScout's technology began to accelerate as smartphones became popular and more and more people started bringing their personal devices into work. So-called advanced persistent threats – cyber attacks by state-backed hackers – have further fanned demand, he said. \n\"Once we saw the market opportunity was large enough we decided to build it into a substantial public company,\" he said of ForeScout. \n(The story is refiled to fix typo in headline) \n(Editing by Eric Auchard and Susan Fenton) \nOur top news photography of the past day.
