(Photo: Disney Interactive)\n1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The next expansion of video game Disney Infinity 3.0 will tackle arguably the most important moments in Star Wars lore.\nRise Against The Empire — available Tuesday for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and Nintendo's Wii U — gives full attention to the original film trilogy, allowing players to revisit iconic scenes from the first three films.\nSo, no pressure.\n“It was an amazing experience but pretty scary at times as well,” said Paul Ayliffe, art director at Studio Gobo, who worked on the Infinity expansion.\nThe playset features six characters, including Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, both of whom are package with the expansion’s starter pack. Joining them are Han Solo, Chewbacca, Darth Vader and Boba Fett, who is exclusive to PlayStation owners through the end of the year.\nConcept art for the Disney Infinity 3.0 expansion 'Rise Against the Empire.' (Photo: Disney Interactive)\nThe expansion covers big moments through the course of the original Star Wars films: Episode IV: A New Hope, Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi .\nAmong the big moments featured in the play set: using snowspeeders on Hoth to corral an AT-AT Walker and flying through space to destroy the Death Star.\n“Playing three episodes in one play set is sort of a daunting task,” said Mike Thompson, game director at Avalanche Software. “I think we covered the key beats through episodes 4, 5 and 6.”\nDisney Infinity 3.0 launched last month with the Twilight of the Republic playset, which features characters including Anakin Skywalker, Yoda and Ahsoka Tano. The expansion sells for $34.99, while additional characters are $13.99 each.\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .\n1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1FAsrwH TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eb103d7989fe6eccc7879fb34115d585a4cf3838/c=953-0-3774-2121&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791207285815470-RATE-DeathStar.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1FAsrwH", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/441760f32f90d86f093da2b6c52fbb4f0bf358d5/c=60-0-1042-738&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791207498184910-infinity-darth.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791207498184910-infinity-darth.png", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FAsrwH&text=%27Disney%20Infinity%27%20expansion%20highlights%20original%20%27Star%20Wars%27&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FAsrwH&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8bcebd3982df79ba3a0cc9f9b10eceaf4f87b331/r=500x288/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791207498184910-infinity-darth.png", "http://twitter.com/brettmolina23"], "published": "2015-09-29T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:49:21.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
