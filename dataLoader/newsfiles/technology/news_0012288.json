As such, IQ264 can improve the quality/bandwidth performance of the encoder itself, unlike post-processing techniques that must accept and hope to improve upon whatever shortcomings are present in the original encoding.”\nIn addition to IQ264, the article covered several other approaches to video optimization. A recent blog post by Dr. Lee delineates some of the differences between the EuclidIQ approach and those of the other companies mentioned in the article.\nEuclidIQ will be demonstrating its IQ264 technology this week at the IBC convention in Amsterdam. A limited number of demonstration slots, for potential partners, are available by contacting the company directly at http://www.euclidiq.com .\nAbout EuclidIQ - Headquartered in Concord, MA, EuclidIQ has a legacy in solving complex video compression challenges. The company has two innovative technologies—IQ264 (H.264) and EuclidVIsion (MPEG-2)—that deliver significant bandwidth savings while maintaining visual quality. The company’s patented technologies augment standards-based encoders, and content encoded via EuclidIQ’s advanced algorithms can be decoded on any standards-based video decoder.
