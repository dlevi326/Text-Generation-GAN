News organizations invited for a pre-visit tour of the MACC had to promise not to divulge the facility’s location. Similar facilities were set up in Washington and New York. \nAt the Philadelphia facility, almost 100 people will coordinate information in meeting facilities equipped with telephones, and video feeds from around the city displayed on five projection screens and two mega-screen televisions, according to the Secret Service. \n\"Part of the reason for this very facility is information sharing,\" DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters in remarks during the MACC tour in Philadelphia. \"It's something we do all the time in connection to events like this, and on an ongoing basis. And it's something that, frankly, we are becoming better and better at.\" \nJohnson has declared the visits to all three cities as National Special Security Events , which require coordination and planning by multiple law enforcement agencies, headed by the Secret Service. \nThe Secret Service didn’t respond to FCW inquiries about general details of the MACC or other facilities related to the Pope’s tour. DHS deferred all questions about the events to the Secret Service, a component agency. \nThe silence isn’t surprising. Ahead of the visit, various media reports said ISIS and other terror groups could see it as a chance to strike, although federal law enforcement agencies have said that there are no known credible threats. \nThe specter still looms, however. ABC News reported on Sept. 15 that the FBI and DHS had arrested a 15-year-old boy in Philadelphia in late August who had been planning a“homeland attack … targeting a foreign dignitary.” The identity of the dignitary wasn’t mentioned in a DHS/FBI bulletin distributed to law enforcement, but ABC News said it was Pope Francis. A memo quoted by the network said the boy was “inspired by [ISIS] and looked to mount an assault that included multiple attackers, guns and explosives.” \nOn another front, the Federal Aviation Administration sent out a notice on Sept. 21 reminding the public that the air space around Washington, New York and Philadelphia and surrounding communities would be “No Drone Zones” from Sept. 22 through Sept. 27. \n“If you plan to attend any of the Papal visit events, please leave your drone at home,” said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta in the statement. “Anyone flying a drone within the designated restricted areas may be subject to civil and criminal charges.” About the Author \nMark Rockwell is a staff writer covering acquisition, procurement and homeland security.
