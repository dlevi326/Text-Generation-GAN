The campaign will be supported through online, print, digital and outdoor elements. In addition to the ad campaign, Verizon is executing a social-first initiative called # WhyNotWednesday in which it is delivering exclusive and unexpected content and experiences every Wednesday thanks to the Verizon network. #WhyNotWednesday demonstrates how 'Better Matters' extends beyond the advertising campaign, and is one more example of the advantages Verizon offers customers. Verizon's first #WhyNotWednesday gave customers a behind-the-scenes look at the VMAs red carpet with Vanessa Hudgens , last week included an announcement around exclusive content from the NFL on NFL Mobile and this week, #WhyNotWednesday is showcasing access to and exclusive content from MADE that will highlight New York Fashion Week experiences with designers Adam Selman , Jeremy Scott and other special surprises.
