Its proprietary technology platform combines industrial biotechnology and chemical catalysis to convert renewable feedstock into chemicals for use in a wide variety of everyday products, including plastics, resins, food additives and personal care products. \nBioAmber's bio succinic acid is easily incorporated into UPR formulations using standard reaction conditions. The bio succinic acid can be used in combination with other dibasic acids in order to achieve the desired properties of the cured thermoset resin. Additionally, incorporation of bio succinic acid improves the environmental profile of the UPR by introducing renewable content made from plant materials. When combined with a number of glycols, this new bio based building block offers unsaturated polyester resins with good reactivity, mechanical and thermal properties. \nPlease download this free white paper to read more.
