The fossil record is replete with groups, once mighty, that are no more. But sometimes the Darwinian reaper misses a species or two within such a group and these, the last of their kind, cling on to existence to remind the world of the way it once was.\nThe coelacanth, a fish from the Indian Ocean; the tuatara, a reptile from New Zealand; the pearly nautilus, a tentacled mollusc of the tropical seas—all are “living fossils” of this sort. And so is Trichoplax , a flat, sheet-like creature about half a millimetre across that is the only known member of a phylum called the Placozoa. This species seems little changed from the Ediacaran period, before the Cambrian explosion of animal life.\nIn this section Drugs that live long will prosper A charge that sticks Drawing the line Slippery customers Science Biology Microbiology Science and technology Life sciences\nThe Ediacarans are a mystery, not least because none of those known from fossils has any sign of a gut, or any other obvious way of feeding itself. But a study of Trichoplax , just published in PLOS One , by Carolyn Smith of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, in Bethesda, Maryland, and her colleagues, may explain how they did it.\nTrichoplax ’s six cell types do not include muscles. Instead, the animal moves around using whip-like cilia that grow out of one of these cell types. Their beating permits it to glide smoothly over surfaces, in search of prey.\nThe prey Dr Smith fed it were single-celled algae. When it came across a patch of them its cilia stopped beating and cells called lipophils secreted enzymes that broke the algae open, releasing their contents—some of which were fluorescent, so that what was going on could be observed by shining ultraviolet light onto the scene (see the “before” and “after” pictures below). What most intrigued Dr Smith was that lipophils from all over the animal’s body start secreting simultaneously. Moreover other cells, also acting in concert, then stirred up the broken-down algae, presumably to make their contents easier to absorb.\nThis was impressive behaviour for a creature that has no nerves to carry signals around its body. It does, though, have “fibre cells” that are connected by junctions which may be precursors of the synaptic junctions of actual nerves. It also has gland cells that contain peptides of the sort used by nerve cells for signalling. Perhaps these fibre cells and gland cells are precursors of nervous systems. Studying Trichoplax may thus help explain how nerve cells, the things that permit higher animals to be animate, and institutes of neurology to exist, evolved.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20150905_STP005_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T10:42:39.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
