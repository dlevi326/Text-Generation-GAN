Even the Apple Watch didn’t get such great plaudits with its hands-on reviews. The new smartwatch comes in two variants: standard and classic, and shuns Google’s Android Wear in favour of the Korean company’s own operating system, Tizen.Like the Apple Watch’s digital crown, Samsung’s next smartwatch features physical controls to complement the touchscreen setup. The rotating bezel can be used for a plethora of navigation options including scrolling, zooming and adjusting levels such as volumes and brightness. It’s as intuitive an addition to the smartwatch setup that we’ve seen so far.There’s no word on pricing or a release date as of yet. New Moto 360 [caption id=\"attachment_325\" align=\"\" width=\"865\"] The new Moto 360 (Lenovo)[/caption]Yes, just the Moto 360. Motorola, or rather Lenovo, has decided to stick to the familiar moniker of the Android Wear original for its smartwatch sequel.The bad news is that the dead area at the bottom of the circular screen is still there. The good news is that the 2015 Moto 360 comes in three sizes (well, two sizes and three different sized straps) and is highly customisable – over 300 combinations of bezel, strap and case are possible.The new Moto 360 is available to pre-order now and shipping starts later this month. Devices cost from $299.99 to $429.99. Moto 360 Sport [caption id=\"attachment_318\" align=\"\" width=\"865\"] The new Moto 360 Sport (Lenovo)[/caption]The Sport edition of Motorola’s next smartwatch is an entirely different beast thanks to the inclusion of a GPS sensor. It becomes only the second Android Wear device, after the Sony SmartWatch 3, to offer this connectivity. This is great news because it means that wearers can accurately track runs, using running apps, without needing to carry a paired smartphone around too.There’s no confirmation on when the silicone-strapped Sport will go on sale, or exactly how much it will cost, at this point though. Asus ZenWatch 2 [caption id=\"attachment_235\" align=\"\" width=\"865\"] The Asus ZenWatch 2 will come in two sizes (Asus)[/caption]Not officially launched at IFA, Asus raised some eyebrows by announcing a pretty cheap price point for its Android Wear sequel - €149 or €169 depending on the model you opt for (US prices, still TBC). One ZenWatch 2 model measures 49 x 41mm, with a 22mm strap, and one is a 45 x 37mm version, that sits on an 18mm strap.The duo are powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU and the water resistance has been boosted to IP67, meaning it can survive a 1m soaking for up to 30 minutes. An October launch is scheduled. Sony Wena [caption id=\"attachment_326\" align=\"\" width=\"865\"] The Sony Wena smartwatch (Sony)[/caption]This Sony effort isn’t another Android effort from the Japanese giant – in fact, there’s no visible OS at all. Putting the brains into the bracelet, the Sony Wena was announced earlier this month on the company’s First Flight crowdfunding platform but was on show for the first time over in Berlin.The watch faces have been designed in collaboration with watchmaker goliath Citizen but it’s the straps that pack the smarts - notifications, activity tracking and e-payments are all taken care of inside the stainless steel bands.It’s Japan only for now – although we’ve been told a US release could be on the cards for 2016.", "external_links": ["http://www.wareable.com/sony/sony-wena-review", "http://www.wareable.com/asus/asus-zenwatch-2-review", "http://www.wareable.com/samsung/samsung-gear-s2-review", "http://www.wareable.com/smartwatches/motorola-moto-360-2-release-date-price-specs-725", "http://www.wareable.com/android-wear/new-moto-360-sport-2-price-release-date-specs"], "published": "2015-09-08T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-07T20:47:05.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
