The Apple TV is a small, black box a bit larger than a hockey puck that plugs into your telly.\nIt comes with its own remote and lets you access services like Netflix or BBC iPlayer through your TV, effectively turning it into a smart TV.\nApple TV is a sleek set-top box with a stylish silver remote control\nApple first introduced Apple TV in 2007, and the last upgrade came two years ago.\nIn the meantime, other technology giants like Google, Amazon and Roku have brought out similar products that threaten to leave Apple behind.\nBut according to reports posted online, the world's most valuable tech company is planning a timely upgrade of its black box that will surely end up on any Apple fan's Christmas list.\nWhat's in the new version? The biggest change is that Apple is reported to be putting Siri (the \"digital assistant\" from the iPhone) into Apple TV .\nThe new Apple TV could include Siri - letting you search channels by speaking\nThat would mean that rather than use a remote to find your TV show, you could use your voice and dictate commands to it.\nThis isn't new technology - Microsoft offers a similar feature with its Xbox One games console.\nOther big updates include the introduction of an Apple TV app store, allowing third-party apps and games to be used on the gadget.\nYou may use an iPhone, but were you aware of the Apple TV?\nIn fact, games are rumoured to be a big part of the new Apple TV - it will let you play inexpensive app-style games on your TV using the remote, rather than splash out on an expensive games console like the PlayStation 4 .\nWhile Apple hasn't gone so far as to create its own channel or streaming service, the recent reveal of Apple Music and the Beats One radio station suggest it could be a possibility.\nPoll loading â€¦\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-09-08T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T09:15:32.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
