On Thursday, Israel’s security cabinet unanimously voted to approve a temporary series of measures meant to clamp down on rock-throwing.\nThe measures will last for three years and will impose a minimum four-year prison term for Palestinians who throw rocks and Molotov cocktails. As Reuters notes, that may include sentences for minors between the ages of 14 and 18 and possible fines for their parents, along with the cancellation of some benefits like welfare.\nPerhaps most notably, the measures also alter the rules of engagement with rock-throwers, expanding the permitted use of live fire by Israeli forces against individuals in some situations. In a statement, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office explained:\nThe security cabinet has decided to authorize police to use live ammunition against people throwing stones and Molotov cocktails when the life of a third person is threatened and no longer only when a police officer is threatened.\nThe cabinet’s decision goes against the recommendations of Yehuda Weinstein, Israel’s attorney general, who called for the minimum sentences to be instituted over the course of a one-year trial period and also opposed changing the rules of engagement.\n“Officials who took part in the meeting noted that the ministers accepted the attorney general's position that the minimum sentencing would only apply to adults who throw stones and firebombs,” noted Barak Ravid at Haaretz . “They also accepted his recommendation to leave a loophole that would allow judges to deviate from the minimum sentence as long as they can justify it.”", "external_links": ["http://www.timesofisrael.com/ministers-okay-tougher-measures-against-stone-throwers/", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/24/us-israel-palestinians-idUSKCN0RO29420150924", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/after-clashes-isreal-to-clamp-down-on-palestinian-stone-throwers/2015/09/16/9c7e8e8d-f9f5-4c54-ba15-2df1040ce82c_story.html", "http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.677421"], "published": "2015-09-25T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:08:36.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
