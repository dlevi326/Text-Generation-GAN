APL Logistics starts collaborative shipping solution ShipMax Alliance is designed to help shippers pair freight loads from compatible partners to common destinations and manage smaller deliveries to customers from multiple origins to common destination pairs. By Eric Johnson | Wednesday, September 09, 2015 APL Logistics last week launched a collaborative shipping solution designed to save time and money by optimizing and managing high-frequency truck deliveries across increasingly complex supply chains. The solution, ShipMax Alliance, helps shippers pair freight loads from compatible partners to common destinations, manage smaller deliveries to customers from multiple origins to common destination pairs, automate processes to streamline routes, customize cargo combinations and optimize delivery schedules. APL Logistics said the solution is aimed particularly at the consumer and retail industries, long a core market for APL Logistics’ services. The 3PL said the solution also enables users to track metrics through detailed carrier performance reports and dashboards. “APL Logistics saw customers struggle, sometimes manually, to handle a growing volume of smaller, more frequent deliveries to fulfill e-commerce or omni-channel orders,” said Fabio Duque, APL Logistics global vertical leader for consumer goods. ShipMax Alliance will initially launch in the Americas, with a planned roll out to other regions in early 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T00:21:16.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
