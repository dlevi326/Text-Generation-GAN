The interim data indicates that VolitionRx's NuQ blood tests detected 81% of colorectal cancers at 78% specificity equally well for both for early- and late-stage cancers. In addition, the tests detected 63% of potentially pre-cancerous adenomas (or polyps) including, most importantly, 67% of high-risk adenomas (the most likely to become cancerous). The preliminary results of this double blinded and independent trial demonstrate the NuQ test's potential to detect cancers over the complete spectrum of development, from pre-cancerous adenomas through early-stage to late-stage colorectal cancer.\nThe results will be presented today at 1:45 p.m. EDT during the Rodman & Renshaw 17th Annual Global Investment Conference in New York (webcast live at http://wsw.com/webcast/rrshq25/vnrx and archived for at least 90 days at http://www.volitionrx.com/news/events-calendar ), and will also be presented at the CNAPS (Circulating Nucleic Acids in Plasma and Serum) IX Conference in Berlin on Friday, September 11 at 3:05-3:25 p.m. CEST.\nColorectal cancer is one of the most preventable cancers, yet there are still 50,000 deaths and over 130,000 new cases diagnosed every year in the U.S. alone1. Colonoscopy examinations provide a high percentage of detection yet, due to their invasive and costly nature, more than one third of adults of screening age in the U.S. refuse to be screened with such a procedure2. The five-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is 90% when detected at Stage I but only 13% if detected at Stage IV. However, these cancers are typically detected at late-stage after the onset of symptoms. VolitionRx believes that there remains a high unmet medical need for tests that detect early-stage cancer and are also non-invasive and easy to use.\nVolitionRx's simple, cost-effective, non-invasive, NuQ colorectal cancer blood test is expected to consist of a panel of 4-6 individual ELISA assays. A function of the 4,800 subject trial is to optimize the composition of this panel; the amount of patient's blood serum available for the trial will allow up to 20 assays to be run per patient. The interim data gives results for the 4,800 samples using a panel of four NuQ assays chosen from the nine candidate assays that VolitionRx has manufactured on a large scale and run in this trial to date. The full study will analyze the sample set with up to 11 additional assays that are currently being finalized, to further refine the choice of assays in the panel to produce the highest accuracy detection rates.\nProfessor Hans Jorgen Nielsen, Professor of Surgical Oncology at Hvidovre Hospital in Denmark, who is leading the study, commented, \"These interim results are compelling, particularly those demonstrating high sensitivity for detecting early-stage colorectal cancer and potentially pre-cancerous adenomas. Most blood-based cancer biomarkers are more effective at detection of large late-stage cancers than small early-stage cancers, and very poor at detecting pre-cancer. The ability to detect both early and late stage cancers, as well as high risk pre-cancer, is critical in demonstrating the value of the NuQ test, as this may enable more cost-effective and successful patient outcomes. We look forward to providing an update on further results from this study, as well as results from an ongoing prospective 14,000 colorectal cancer patient screening study, for which the first 2,500 patient samples have already been collected and are currently being analyzed.\"\nCameron Reynolds, President and Chief Executive Officer of VolitionRx, added, \"We are very excited to report such strong results in our first large clinical trial and will continue to analyze the samples using up to 11 additional assays. We are looking for even better assay candidates and still have two key target assays to scale up for manufacturing for the next round of testing. We believe that this will enable us to develop the best panel of assays with the highest sensitivity and most accurate detection rates for early- and late-stage cancer. We anticipate providing the full data set for the 4,800-subject retrospective study in the first quarter of 2016. Given the strength of this interim data we are also moving forward aggressively with the CE marking of our products to enable them to be sold for clinical use in Europe and to begin the process in the U.S. with the FDA.\"\nInterim sensitivity findings for cancer and the possibly pre-cancerous adenoma in this 4,800-subject population type are outlined as follows:\nImportantly, the assays are not stage dependent. All results are age and gender adjusted, measured at 78% specificity against high risk or symptomatic patients who are otherwise healthy subjects referred for colonoscopy but found to have no bowel lesions or other comorbidities.\nThe NuQ tests utilize the Company's proprietary Nucleosomics technology platform, which identifies and measures circulating nucleosome structures for the presence of epigenetic cancer signals within the blood.\nThe full list of ongoing clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of VolitionRx's assays, including the 4,800-subject trial discussed here, include:\nColorectal cancer\nA 4,800 patient retrospective symptomatic population study (Hvidovre Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark) A 14,000 patient prospective screening study (Hvidovre Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark) A 250 patient prospective study (CHU-UCL Mont Godinne Hospital, Belgium) Pre-cancerous colorectal adenomas\nA 800 patient retrospective study (Hvidovre Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark) 27 most prevalent cancers\nA 4,200 patient prospective study that involves patients with the 27 most prevalent cancers (University Hospital, Bonn, Germany) Lung cancer\nA 600 patient prospective confirmatory study (University Hospital, Bonn, Germany) Prostate cancer\nA retrospective study to establish the efficacy of VolitionRx's NuQ tests to distinguish anaplastic prostate cancer, a particularly aggressive form of the disease, from typical castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the less aggressive form (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas) A 120-patient prospective feasibility study (ImmuneHealth, Belgium) Ovarian cancer\nA 40-patient retrospective feasibility study (Singapore General Hospital, Singapore) Endometriosis\nA prospective study to assess VolitionRx's NuQ tests for the diagnosis of endometriosis (the University of Oxford, United Kingdom)", "external_links": ["http://www.volitionrx.com/", "http://www.volitionrx.com/news/events-calendar", "http://wsw.com/webcast/rrshq25/vnrx"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:12:06.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
