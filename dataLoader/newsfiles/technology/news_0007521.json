Amazon’s homepage exploded this morning, showering the Internet with new hardware. They’ve got four new tablets and three new members of the Fire TV family. First up is the Fire. No Kindle, mind you… just Fire. It’s the dirt-cheap tablet we saw leaked a few days ago, and Amazon says it “sets a new standard for a tablet under $50.” By under $50, they mean $49.99. It features a quad-core 1.3GHz processor, a 1024 x 600 display, front and rear-facing cameras, and 8GB of internal storage. Amazon has also thoughtfully included a micro SD slot for expansion. Amazon also introduced two new Fire HD tablets, Fire Kids Edition, and new Fire TV devices. Heads up, Geek readers! Amazon�s homepage exploded this morning, showering the Internet with new hardware.
