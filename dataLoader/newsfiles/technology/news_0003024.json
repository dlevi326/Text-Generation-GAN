This practice addresses the risk, compliance and cyber security challenges faced by global financial services organizations as they strive to enable their businesses to operate in a world where everything is increasingly linked together. Optiv has engaged Marshall Lux, an experienced industry leader with deep expertise in financial services risk and regulatory policy, to serve as a senior advisor to the practice. The company also has hired financial security veteran Greig Arnold, a seasoned CISO working within the Fortune 50, to lead the creation of innovative solutions. \nOptiv’s Financial Services Practice combines the cyber security know-how and experience gleaned from more than 12,000 unique client engagements with technology from leading security product manufacturers to provide businesses with a comprehensive suite of integrated and tailored services in three key areas: security consulting , security operations and security technologies . \n“In an ideal world, a cyber security partner selected by a financial services company would have a deep understanding of the financial vertical and its unique problems, and have the ability to deliver a full spectrum of professional services, ranging from strategic to the very tactical, that work with the company’s security and IT organizations,” said Christina Richmond, program director, security services, IDC. “Only a very finite number of cyber security providers can be the end-to-end partner that can holistically apply products, policy, services, people, processes, strategies and tactics assembled to each client’s unique needs and applied ongoing and programmatically.” \nAs part of Optiv’s commitment to the financial services industry, the company has engaged consultant Marshall Lux to serve as senior advisor to the Financial Services Practice. Lux has nearly 30 years of experience advising some of the world’s most established bankers, financiers and C-suite executives. He also previously served as chief risk officer for all consumer products at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Lux is a second-year fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, where he has authored papers on community banking and mortgage finance. As a result, he has been tapped to speak before the U.S. House of Representatives and the St. Louis Federal Reserve later this month. \n“Cyber security and risk has become a board-level discussion in the financial services industry where we’ve seen an increase in security breaches and strict government regulations,” said Lux. “However, CISOs and other security leaders are dealing with a significant talent shortage and need support at all stages of planning, building and running their security programs. I’m excited to work with Optiv to help financial security companies balance ideals with realities and maturity so that they can better achieve security success.” \nTwo other recent additions to the Optiv Financial Services Practice are Greig Arnold and Patrick Sheehan. Arnold is a former chief information security officer of global organizations such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and KPMG. As a vice president in the Optiv Office of the CISO, Arnold is charged with creating programs and innovative solutions for the financial services industry. Arnold will closely partner with Sheehan, who serves as vice president and managing director of Optiv’s Financial Services Practice. Sheehan brings extensive experience working with large enterprises and understands the scale of these types of organizations and the business challenges they face. \n“Marshall, Greig and Patrick are valuable additions to our already exceptional team comprised of hundreds of cyber security experts,” said Dan Burns, chief executive officer for Optiv. “At Optiv, we live, breathe and sleep cyber security because it is our sole focus. We are excited to expand our Financial Services Practice and believe that we are uniquely qualified to help the industry effectively address business technology risks and help organizations execute mature security programs.” \nOptiv currently helps two-thirds of Fortune 500 global financial services and insurance organizations address and mitigate the risks posed by cybersecurity threats.
