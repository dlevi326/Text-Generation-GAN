The ESA outgassing tests can be considered passed for both coated and not-coated samples and they respond to the general outgassing criteria based upon the micro-VCM test (as defined by ECSS-Q-ST-70-02C). The general requirement for materials screening outgassing is RML<1.0% and CVCM < 0.1%. \nThe development of Windform materials has helped to advance additive technologies, and now allows for new and custom-made solutions for the space industry which were previously impossible to implement with traditional manufacturing methods. \nWindform Additive Manufacturing is suitable for a number of applications in which a highly durable material is required; the polyamide-based material can also be processed with high precision CNC machining.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:36:11.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
