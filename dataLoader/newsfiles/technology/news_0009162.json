Your competitors face the same challenges and opportunities you do, but the one who moves forward first has the competitive advantage. Homes constitute the single largest investment for most people. So, it isn’t a surprise that we have an entire cottage industry in the entertainment business that is devoted to home improvement. Updating your kitchen? There’s a show for that. Turning the basement into an apartment? There’s a show for that, too. One show, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, combines expertise with the very human emotions of compassion to give people struggling with home ownership hope for a brighter future. Transforming a home for a brighter future requires fundamentally different expertise from daily maintenance tasks. The best closet organizer or floor scrubber in the business is not the same go-to person for removing walls, rerouting plumbing and building that in-law unit. It takes a lot of people, with a variety of skill sets, to transform a house and the lives of the people living there. Conceptually, transforming a business follows the same pattern. You need the right expertise to implement the IT strategy that enables the business model. This presents a management challenge for IT leadership. Business strategies today involve blending the online and physical worlds in new ways that create competitive advantage and disrupt traditional ways of doing things. The IT staff that keeps the network running might not be the people to turn you into the Uber of your space. You might need new applications or a big data analytics engine, or an entire mobile strategy, that goes beyond what you have considered IT’s role in your business. But, you can’t make assumptions either. It’s possible you have been underestimating your IT team and they could rise to a new challenge if you just give them the opportunity. You might have people that could surprise you with their vision if they could stop focusing on day-to-day operations. Either way, the competitive environment demands that you ask yourself, “Do I have the right mix of human capital for digital transformation ?” If you don’t ask that question, you risk ceding competitive advantage to others who built their own teams to win. The good news: You don’t need to do it all alone. The right answer is likely a blended team of internal resources and external expertise. It’s the rare family that possesses all the expertise and resources to transform their home on their own. That’s why architects, contractors, stone masons and the rest of the home improvement crew all have roles to play. Because the required roles are different between maintaining IT legacies and building new IT-driven business strategies, digital transformation involves a new kind of partner portfolio. Managed Service Providers (MSPs), by their very nature, build expertise in various disciplines that everyone needs in a dynamic economy. Let’s consider two key disciplines for the modern enterprise: Security and big data analytics. Every major enterprise needs world-class security . But, in a world of escalating threats, building a world-class security team is an expensive proposition. MSPs allow you to tap that leadership expertise without having to build the capability yourself. Likewise, data scientists are scarce resources. Yet, big data holds the promise of new insights from the data your business produces naturally. MSPs can provide that insight engine on a service basis. For instance, CenturyLink recently bought Cognilytics , a group of brilliant data scientists with analytics models for key questions that all enterprises ask of their data. These are just two areas where a new kind of team is necessary and it is available with new partnerships. No one wants to live in the past, so homes need a makeover from time to time. It’s a chance to think about how you want to live in the future. The future beckons when considering the IT team as well. Do you have the skills to create competitive advantage for tomorrow? Or is it time for a makeover? Read the IDG Research report showing what IT leaders are doing to get started down this path. Get started on your digital transformation today.", "external_links": ["http://ow.ly/S3dML", "http://ow.ly/RLprU", "http://ow.ly/SehDr", "http://ow.ly/RLp4J", "http://ow.ly/RLlF7", "http://ow.ly/RLpU7", "http://ow.ly/RaRKe"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T22:55:40.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
