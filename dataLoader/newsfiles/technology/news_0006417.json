General Assembly in 1981, the theme of this year's commemoration is \"Partnerships for Peace--Dignity for All,\" which aims to highlight the importance of all segments of society working together to strive for peace. As a partner in this international effort, The Prem Rawat Foundation (TPRF) released a new video to help grow awareness that peace is possible for individuals across the planet. It's proving to be a popular message, as more than 770,000 people have already viewed the video via YouTube and Facebook . \nWATCH THE NEW VIDEO: \"YOUR SECRET WEAPON\" \nFeaturing an excerpt of a speech by the charity's Founder Prem Rawat, the video aims to remind people that they have the power to \"choose peace over chaos, love over hate, respect over disregard, and clarity over confusion.\" Even amid a world racked by violence, the video shares an empowering message that it's possible for people to choose a better way forward in their own lives. \n\"Personal peace is very possible because it has nothing to do with struggles on the outside. It is time to rethink what it means to be alive. It is time to think about the gift we have been given. All the citizens of this earth need hope,\" says Prem Rawat. \"Peace has become a hollow word that people say but don't mean because nobody knows how to go about it. The clue lies in knowing yourself, knowing who you are. Wherever you go, you carry the well of peace with you.\" \nProducing the new video is just one of many ways TPRF works year-round to fulfill its mission of helping build a world at peace, one person at a time. \nThe U.S.-based nonprofit sponsors international events with government, education and business leaders to promote the understanding of individual peace as the basis for world peace. TPRF has also developed the Peace Education Program (PEP) to help people discover inner resources such as strength, choice and hope, as well as to explore the possibility of personal peace. Diverse groups of people, from inmates to business leaders, are benefiting from PEP, which is currently available in 48 countries. \nKnowing that it's hard for people to focus on achieving peace unless the basic necessities of life are met, TPRF also operates Food for People , a model feeding program in India, Ghana and Nepal that is bringing about significant improvements in school attendance, community health and economic outlook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T06:30:02.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
