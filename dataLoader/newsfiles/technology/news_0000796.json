Will the state Chief Minister come to help such students by seeking contribution from the Centre?” Narlikar asked.\n“In earlier times, scholars were given an important place by kings and queens in their kingdoms. But in recent times, those with money and power are given respect in society,” he said.\n“Even intellectuals have failed to earn respect as they live for themselves and don’t want to work for the society. Research sector is also plagued by bureaucracy, red-tapism and lack of innovative attitude and creativity,” he noted.\nUrging the students to change this situation, he cited examples like that of Cambridge University, that has managed to keep up its quality and reputation even after 800 years of its existence. “This happens because it is very tough to get admission in this prestigious institution, only top brains can gain entry there,” he said.\n“Though everybody deserves a chance of getting education in democracy, intelligent students must be given advanced learning opportunities,” he said.\nThe university’s Vice Chancellor Siddharth Kane presided over the function.\nFirst Published on August 31, 2015 12:10 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:09:09.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
