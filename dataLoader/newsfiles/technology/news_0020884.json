LVS will be fully integrated into Microscan and the LVS name will become a brand within Microscan's barcode label verification portfolio. \nEstablished in Peachtree City, Georgia, in 1993, LVS has become an established provider of label inspection, print inspection, and barcode verification products, solutions, and services for the life sciences and other industries. The company has experienced rapid growth recently and is expected to continue this trend as its technology enables companies to meet UDI (Unique Device Identification) legislation and to improve product traceability throughout the manufacturing supply chain. LVS's technology, products, and solutions allow companies to inspect barcodes either off-line or in-line to achieve 100% compliance to UDI and GS1 standards. LVS is known for technology leadership and will benefit from being part of Microscan's global network as it looks to accelerate growth outside of North America. \n\"This is a strategic move for Microscan,\" says Scott Summerville, President of Microscan. \"There are many advantages to acquiring the trade and assets of LVS. The leadership team at Microscan has a strong interest in developing and investing in LVS's technology and products to support the market, which is expanding due to regulatory trends and corporate quality initiatives. We will have the opportunity to accelerate the expansion of LVS products and solutions into key international markets, and to leverage the substantial synergies between LVS and Microscan sales, technology, and operations.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:03:14.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
