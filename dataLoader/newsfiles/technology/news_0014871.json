We’ve transformed into a phone service with no boundaries, but with the unsurpassed quality, convenience and peace of mind customers expect from a home phone line.” \nThe expansion of the plan to Europe includes all 28 countries that comprise the European Union (EU), such as Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, plus Norway. \n“Many of our customers have friends and loved ones overseas,” said Lindsay. “We’ve seen incredible response to the addition of Mexico, Hong Kong, China and India into our Unlimited calling plan, and we’re certain that the expansion to Europe will be similarly well received. It gives us great joy to bring families and friends together and to play a part in making the world a little smaller.” \nCustomers who subscribe to the TWC Phone Unlimited calling plan enjoy the following benefits: For one low monthly price, make unlimited calls to mobile and landline phones at any time to anywhere in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Mexico, China, Hong Kong and India, and now including unlimited calling to all countries in the EU and Norway. No overage charges, no calling cards and pins, and no varying rates.

Or use your home phone number to place calls to any country included in the plan from virtually anywhere. So, if you’re traveling overseas, you can easily stay connected to friends and family back home; and if you have loved ones abroad, you can call them no matter where you are. All you need is a WiFi or cellular data connection and a qualifying Apple iOS or Android device.
