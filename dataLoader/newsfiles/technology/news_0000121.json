The new bundler efficiently straps varying product sizes from digest to tabloid, as well as mixed bundles at rates of 45 – 50 bundles-per-minute.\nThe TR6-K can be close-coupled with a variety of upstream stackers utilizing proprietary hardware provided by EAM-Mosca. “The stacker moves a bundle into the TR6-K where it is conditioned by backstops, side guides, press and kicker arms, and strap is applied,” says Edward Martin, vice president of sales and marketing for EAM-Mosca Corp., Mosca’s North American division. “The kicker then pushes the strapped bundle out of the strapper to maximize exit speed, while preventing damage to the bottom of the stack due to product slippage on the conveyor during rapid acceleration,” he continued.\nIn addition to the mechanical linking of stacker and strapper, the TR6-K offers an option for \"selective strapping\" of bundles based on book count or by varying strap tension, based on count, to prevent curling bundles or damaging product due to unnecessarily high strap tension. The machine features a B&R Controller and HMI with multiple levels of access to provide a wide range of programming ability.\nAccording to Martin, the TR6-K includes Mosca's precision constructed Strapway 6 for exceptional reliability and low total-cost-of-ownership. The strap track and sealer are assembled on a unibody fixture to assure a highly accurate mechanical system that enhances feed reliability. The strap feed channel features tool-less access for fast, easy cleaning. The sealer itself uses sealed bearings and an open construction concept to shed dust and dirt that minimizes cleaning and servicing requirements.\nThe TR6-K is available with a temperature controlled heat-seal strapping head or Mosca's proprietary Sonixs ultra-sonic sealing technology. Mosca's high speed, closed strap track provides unexcelled strap control and high feed reliability that is optimized to utilize EAM-Mosca's lightweight, economical 5mm strapping.\nThe TR6-K can operate in a single strap environment, or be paired with a turning device and second position strapper, typically the Mosca TR6-Pro, to create a complete, high performing cross strapping system.\nEAM-Mosca Corporation provides high-performance strapping system solutions to a variety of industries, including food, graphic arts, mailing, fulfillment, logistics, corrugated, wood, and other industrial or consumer goods. We combine innovative equipment with strapping materials manufactured to maximize machine performance and customer support programs that help our customers to meet their performance and productivity goals.\nTo learn more about any of EAM-Mosca’s other productivity enhancing strapping systems, please call us at 800-456-3420, or email us at info(at)eammosca(dot)com.
