The civilian labor force was slightly down from 5,721,000 in July to 5,703,000 in August. \n“I think the underlying story hasn’t changed that we are on this moderate growth path,” Teshome said. \nThe state saw these job gains: goods-producing industries, 300; construction, 2,700; professional and business services, 5,700; trade, transportation and utilities. 5,300; leisure and hospitality, 2,900; financial activities, 1,700; other services, 1,000; and educational and health services, 200. \nManufacturing saw losses of 2,300. \n“We don’t like to see the losses in manufacturing,” Teshome said. “There’s still a lot of demand for autos. The weak spots are for steel and energy.” \nOther losses were: mining and lodging, 100; information, 300; and government, 2,200. \n“The large decline in the labor force led to the drop in unemployment,” said George Zeller, Cleveland-based economist. “There are still too many workers who cannot find a new job after they get laid off.” \nZeller says the state is still behind the nation in job growth, and it is still short 17,000 jobs from pre-recession times. \nThe U.S. unemployment rate for August was 5.1 percent, down from 5.3 percent in July and down from 6.1 percent in August 2014. \nLocal unemployment rates for the Mahoning Valley will be released Tuesday.
