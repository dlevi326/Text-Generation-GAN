Tradeweb Adds Japanese ETP as New Trading Rules Come Into Force Comment Send to Kindle \nTradeweb Markets has announced that its new regulated marketplace for trading interest rate swaps in Japan today saw its first trade under Japan’s new mandatory trading rules for certain OTC derivatives. \nMarket participants also completed a significant number of other transactions on the Tradeweb electronic trading platform (ETP). In addition to ensuring compliance with the new requirements, the Tradeweb ETP provides users with a flexible, streamlined trading workflow, combined with post-trade processing and reporting services. \nThe Tradeweb ETP is supported by 18 dealers and allows traders to execute yen-swap trades on a request-for-quote (RFQ) basis or by using its order book. The platform can also be used to book voice transactions above block size. \nAfter execution, trade details are sent in real time to a middleware provider for clearing at the Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (JSCC). Where reporting is required by the regulations, details will be published on InSite, Tradeweb’s data publication portal. \nLarge Transactions First Up \nThe Japanese Financial Services Agency’s mandatory trading rules came into effect today, and require that certain derivatives trades between large financial institutions be traded on an ETP and publicly reported. \nThe rules cover onshore transactions in 5-, 7- and 10-year yen swaps, where both counterparties are financial firms with a derivatives balance of ¥6 trillion or more. Other yen-denominated swaps transactions may be traded on an ETP, but are not required to be reported. \n“The market has been preparing for the derivatives trading mandate in Japan for some time now, and there has been a trend toward electronic trading even before the regulations became effective,” says Andrew Bernard, managing director and head of Asia at Tradeweb. “To make it as easy as possible for our clients to comply with the new regulations, we’ve designed our ETP to provide an effective solution for trading, processing and reporting yen-swap transactions. Banks using the platform also benefit from greater efficiency and risk reduction in their trading functions.” \nBloomberg also launched its ETP for the Japanese market this morning.
