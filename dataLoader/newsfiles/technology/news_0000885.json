Integral’s customers leverage this deep and diverse liquidity to achieve greater profitability. \nFX traders struggle with the current fragmentation of liquidity in the market. To address these challenges, Integral announced the latest release of OCX that now incorporates resting liquidity from its three core customer segments: corporations, retail traders and institutional investors.

Integral also announced that its London datacenter located in Equinix’s London LD4 facility in Slough is live, offering its European region clients significant improvements in latency, pricing and execution. All of Integral’s customers, including more than 250 banks and brokers and 1,800 trading parties, are now seamlessly integrated with OCX as an additional source of liquidity. Recent studies show that customers are able to reduce their transaction costs by more than 50% by trading on Integral’s platform. \n“Customers trading on OCX are gaining a significant advantage over their competition,” said Harpal Sandhu, CEO Integral Development Corp. “They experience lower costs of trading, and the flexibility of OCX allows them to pursue opportunities unavailable to them in other markets.” \nFX Cloud™, Integral’s end-to-end electronic FX trading platform, combined with OCX allows banks, brokers, and asset managers to launch a robust and market leading FX business under their own unique brand and business model.
