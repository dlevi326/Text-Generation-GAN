But Launch Complex 36 has sat idle for a decade.\n“Too long,” Bezos said. “We can’t wait to fix that.”\nBlue Origin will also open a factory nearby.\n“We’re not just launching from here,” Bezos said. “We’re building here.”\nThe company will invest $200 million and create 330 jobs, officials said.\nIt is the latest effort to revive Florida’s Space Coast, which was economically battered after NASA stopped flying the space shuttles in 2011. Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX, the rocket company started by Elon Musk, and the United Launch Alliance , a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin , already use nearby launching pads at Cape Canaveral.\nBlue Origin has sometimes waited days or months to mention successes or failures. Bezos provided brief updates on Blue Origin’s website.\nBut even now, exactly what Blue Origin plans to launch from Cape Canaveral remains somewhat mysterious.\nThe rocket, still unnamed, will be large enough to reach orbit, and it will be introduced later this decade, Bezos said. But he did not give specifics about which markets he is aiming for.\n“We’re building a vehicle for humans,” Bezos said in a telephone interview. “That’s my personal passion.”\nBut such a rocket “can clearly lift payloads of all kinds,” he said.\nThe first stage of the rocket is to be fully reusable — landing vertically back on Earth — unlike most rockets today, which crash back to Earth after one flight.\nThat approach is similar to SpaceX’s attempts to land the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket on a floating platform, a first step to refurbishing and reflying it. Blue Origin had patented the barge landing idea, but SpaceX successfully challenged the patent, and Blue Origin has since given up on the claim.\nBlue Origin lost another skirmish with SpaceX last year in the bidding to take over one of two launch pads at the Kennedy Space Center that NASA used for the space shuttles. After that setback, Blue Origin looked at options in five states before deciding on Launch Complex 36.\nIn April, Blue Origin completed the first test flight of its New Shepard spacecraft, accelerating past three times the speed of sound to reach an altitude of 307,000 feet above a testing site in Texas. The capsule, with no passengers, separated and parachuted gently to the ground. The booster, designed to land back on the ground, crashed because of a malfunction in the hydraulic system. New Shepard, which is to take tourists on suborbital jaunts, will continue to launch from Texas.\nBezos also looked to the future.\n“I don’t know how long this will take,” he said, “but one day I look forward to having a press conference with you guys in space.”", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-16T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:47:01.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
