We expect commodity markets to remain subdued for several years to come given that excess supply has coincided with a slowdown in demand.\n\"If major commodity prices remain at current levels, our analysis implies that, in the absence of substantial restructuring, nearly all the equity value of both Glencore and Anglo American could evaporate,\" said Mr Hillcoat.\nPrices for several key commodities that Glencore produces have fallen to multiyear lows as a result of a combination of excess supply and slower Chinese economic growth.\nCopper, the company's biggest earnings driver and a barometer for the health of the global economy, is down a fifth so far this year, having hit a six-year low last month.\nAt 12.38pm, Glencore was down 23.53% to R16.02.\nIn the last year, Glencore has lost 74% of its value.\nThe company is currently valued at about R306bn.", "external_links": ["http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=GLN"], "published": "2015-09-28T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:17:35.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
