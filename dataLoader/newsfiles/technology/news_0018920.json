BNY Mellon relayed the news to some clients.\nBut the problem was far from over.\nBy nightfall, BNY Mellon vendor SunGard Systems Inc. hadn't been able to repair problems with its system, which allows money managers to give investors the values of their holdings. Thus began a weeklong crisis in one of the most basic but crucial sections of Wall Street's infrastructure.\nPeople can trade thousands of securities betting on assets around the world in a blink of an eye. Ultimately, though, they all end up with BNY Mellon or rivals that officially record who owns what and what those holdings are worth. If the system that tracks that information fails, trades can't flow smoothly, and some investors may have difficulties getting their money. Last week, that system failed.\nAt one point, BNY Mellon employees became so frustrated that they insisted SunGard workers travel from the accounting service's headquarters in Wayne, Pa., to BNY's New Jersey offices so they could oversee their work. The problems were so severe, SunGard had to rebuild its system from scratch.\nBNY Mellon is reviewing its relationship with SunGard, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nSunGard has said that routine maintenance of its widely used InvestOne platform caused both the system and a backup to become corrupted. \"Because of the unusual nature of the event, we are confident that this was an isolated incident,\" SunGard spokesman Michael Gormley said in a statement. \"A full, root-cause analysis is underway.\"\nBNY Mellon's problems cascaded across Wall Street, hitting clients including Invesco PowerShares, Prudential Financial Inc. and Voya Investment Management. They have taken a toll on BNY's reputation and become a source of headaches for investors that have lingered into this week.\nMutual-fund and exchange-traded fund companies still are examining their funds to see whether their investors were shortchanged by differences between manual calculations of their funds' values and the revised totals they eventually received from BNY Mellon. Those differences could create liabilities later, industry experts and attorneys said. Some fund companies are now focusing on whether employee retirement plans may have been affected. As recently as the middle of this week, some retirees still couldn't access their money.\nSuzanne Puchalsky, a 401(k) investor in New York, said she tried to transfer her investment at Voya Investment Management, one of the firms affected by the software problems, to Fidelity Investments. After more than a week of waiting for the check to clear, Ms. Puchalsky was told by Voya on Wednesday that her funds still couldn't be released because of net-asset-value discrepancies, she said. On Thursday, she said she was told by Voya the problem had been resolved. But because her balance is lower now than when she first tried to move her money, and pricing issues affected the firm, \"the concern is if the loss is accurate,\" she said.\nA spokesman for Voya said in a statement the company couldn't comment on specific clients but that there could be instances when a customer disbursements are delayed to ensure account information is up to date. \"In those cases, we are working to mail checks, make disbursements and send confirmation statements as soon as possible.\"\nThe disruptions hit a steady business that together with other investment services accounted for nearly two-thirds of BNY Mellon's $15.7 billion in revenue last year. They began at one of the worst times, the morning of a volatile session that included an intraday drop of more than 1,000 points for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. SunGard has said its system problem wasn't related to the volatility. The bank is also in the crosshairs of activist investors who have pushed for cost cuts and a management shakeup.\nThe Wall Street Journal pieced together the events of last week via interviews with more than a dozen executives and employees at mutual-fund firms, BNY Mellon and SunGard.\n\"We mobilized our people from around the world and brought in leading technology companies...to restore the SunGard platform and clear out the backlog,\" said BNY Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine in a statement.\nWhen SunGard's system didn't come back online after the first day, hundreds of BNY Mellon employees worked through the night, taking turns sleeping on cots strewn across the office and sharing company-ordered Chinese food.\nSunGard delivered a new version of its system around midnight Aug. 27, four days after the problems began. At 4 a.m., just as the bank's employees began to make headway calculating fund values, the system crashed.\nWith frustration mounting, BNY Mellon ordered SunGard to bring key members of its team to work at BNY Mellon's New Jersey technology headquarters. From that point, every change they made to any of the software had to be approved by outside engineers BNY Mellon had brought in to help.\nBNY Mellon was working on a separate contingency plan, mobilizing more than 100 accountants to manually calculate the values of thousands of fund securities.\nThe setbacks frustrated fund companies, which had been told by BNY Mellon on a conference call Wednesday afternoon that the issue would likely be resolved by the following day. \"It's a mess,\" one fund executive wrote to colleagues in an email Wednesday that was described to the Journal. Another fund company told a BNY Mellon relationship manager: \"If our shareholders lose anything, you're paying for it,\" said a person familiar with the conversation.\nInside the bank, senior executives including Chief Executive Gerald Hassell huddled in a war room, monitoring the hour-by-hour progress. On Friday, the problem still unfixed, Mr. Hassell addressed a room of dozens of accountants, engineers and executives.\n\"Goal No. 1,\" he said, \"is that we're going to come out of the weekend with a stable operating platform. We are going to have prices to the market Monday morning for last week.\"\nThe SunGard system finally began to work properly the next day. It wasn't until Tuesday night, when they had fully made it through the backlog of pricing data, that some BNY Mellon executives felt they could take a breath.\nWrite to Kirsten Grind at kirsten.grind@wsj.com\n 03, 2015 19:26 ET (23:26 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T08:11:11.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
