With its configurable analytic engine, InsitePro allows users to design risk scoring analytics that address specific business needs. InsitePro applies reliable peril and geospatial data in a way that fits a carrier's approach to risk. \n\"InsitePro's flood analytics are changing the way flood insurance is priced and delivered,\" stated Product Manager Ivan Maddox. \"With the Atkins agreement, Intermap will be offering risk scores for all natural perils, including earthquake, hail, tornado, and wind (straight-line and hurricane). InsitePro can now replicate the innovation brought to flood risk assessment across these other perils, delivering custom analytics to underwriters that are based on dependable data and their own view of risk.\" \nUsing InsitePro, carriers can automate the risk pricing activities that they are comfortable with and identify risks that need further analysis by an underwriter. It offers fast answers for most properties and allows the carrier to add value where appropriate. Including all perils will enable a carrier to write complete property coverage for homes and businesses to differentiate themselves from carriers that only offer standard coverage. \nFor more information, please visit http://www.intermap.com/software/insitepro . \nRegister for Intermap News Alerts at http://www.intermap.com/pressreleases . \nAbout Atkins Atkins ( www.atkinsglobal.com ) is one of the world's most respected design, engineering and project management consultancies, employing some 18,000 people across the UK, North America, Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Europe.
