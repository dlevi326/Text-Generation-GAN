It was the last league game of the 2007 Super rugby series, the Bulls taking on the Queensland Reds. The equation was simple. If the Bulls won the game they would end fourth on the log and take on the Sharks in Durban in the semi-final. If they won with a bonus point they would finish in third place and would have to travel to New Zealand to play the defending champions, the Crusaders. There was also the possibility of ending second on the log and securing a home semi-final but that would require a 72 points differential, something that was never achieved before in Super Rugby. Surely unthinkable?\nWell, no one told the Bulls. They were rampant. The Reds, decimated by injuries were pulverized 92-3. The Bulls went on to beat the Crusaders in the semi-final and two weeks later the Sharks in Durban to win South Africa’s first Super Rugby trophy. The Bulls coach, Heyneke Meyer, was hailed as a messiah in South Africa. The match was a springboard for a number of players, ironically some of them still playing for South Africa eight years later. Eight years is long time in Rugby…\nThe Reds coach, Eddie Jones cut a forlorn figure in the stands that night. His team had had a torrid season. They were last on the log prior to the Loftus massacre. Pressure was already mounting prior to the game and the humiliating defeat was the final straw. He resigned shortly afterwards.\nIt was as if the rugby gods had purposefully kept them apart. Japan was the only country in the world’s top twenty that South Africa had never faced in a rugby union test match. The rugby gods also kept Jones and Meyer apart since that fateful day at Loftus but they were going to resume their rivalry at the Brighton Community Stadium. Rivalry only in name really. Surely Jones’ Japan with one win from 24 previous rugby world cup pool matches was never going to be a match for Meyer’s two time world champion Springboks.\nWell, of course no one told the Japanese. They were rampant. The Boks were defeated 32-34, in front of 30 000 rowdy Japanese supporters. Heyneke Meyer cut a forlorn figure in the stands that night, his coaching future surely in jeopardy.\nAnd Eddie Jones could only smile. There is an old Japanese proverb that says: “revenge is a dish best served cold”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:16:52.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
