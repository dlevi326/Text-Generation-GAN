Owned and produced by CEA, CES is the world’s gathering place for all who thrive on the business of consumer technologies and will run January 6-9, 2016, in Las Vegas, Nevada. \nTo enter, startups can submit a video of up to three minutes in length that highlights how their technology improves the lives of seniors or people with disabilities. Videos must be submitted before 11:59PM EST on September 18, 2015. Full details about the CEA Foundation’s inaugural video contest including rules and entry form can be found online . \n“The global technology community is providing innovative products and services that are enabling people with disabilities to access technology and enhance their lives as never before,” said Steve Ewell, executive director, CEA Foundation. “We are excited to recognize these life improving technologies at CES, the annual global epicenter of technology, and help recognize the important work being done in our industry.” \nNew for 2016, CES will launch the Accessibility Marketplace to highlight technology that provides the support needed for people with disabilities to live healthy, independent lives that are whole and full. Starting with the design, products and services are enhanced to provide direct, unassisted and/or indirect, compatibility assistance for a person with disability’s needs. In this Marketplace, attendees will see how accessible technology facilitates connections, enhances learning as well as education of disabilities and capabilities, and improves the quality of life for many people living with disabilities. \nThe CEA Foundation was created three years ago with a mission of linking seniors and people with disabilities with technology to enhance their lives. Accessible consumer devices are allowing for more low cost solutions for the more than 56 million people with disabilities and the millions of people over the age of 65. \n“Thanks to many of these technologies, we now see that people are living independently longer, staying connected with friends and family and enabling greater control of our environments,” said Ewell. \nIn addition to the video contest and new Marketplace, CES continues to feature the Innovation Awards Accessible Tech category and conference panels focused on accessibility.
