With power consumption of less than 1 mA, compared to the 5 mA required by two single-function gyroscopes, the gyro can be an \"always on\" sensor. Accelerometer power consumption in low-power mode is as low as 10 µA. \n\nThis latest addition to the iNEMO range of inertial motion sensors offers the industry's lowest power consumption (0.85 mA in normal mode, 0.4 mA in low power mode) and smallest package size (2.5 X 3 X 0.83 mm).The chip supports both electronic and optical image stabilization (EIS) and Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) techniques, which helps minimize image blurring caused by camera motion when, say, a selfie is being taken. Thus the sensor lets equipment manufacturers minimize size, system complexity, and cost, while extending battery life. \nOther significant features of the sensor include an accelerometer output data rate (ODR) up to 6.66 kHz and a gyroscope ODR up to 3.33 kHz; smart FIFO for dynamic data batching and smarter power management: 4-kbyte FIFO and 4-kbyte flexible (FIFO or programmable); full-scale acceleration ranges of ± 2, 4, 8, and 16 g; full-scale angular rate ranges of ± 125, 245, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 dps; and supply voltage from 1.71 to 3.6V, with independent IOs supply down to 1.62V. The LSM6DS3H is available now in volume at a price of $1.61 ea. / 1k. \nLearn more about STMicroelectronics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T17:20:54.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
