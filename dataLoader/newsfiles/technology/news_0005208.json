Your brand's story is your own and that affords a natural tie in for emotional connections because stories are familiar. Content amplification. Wied sites an example of a customer that launched a new platform and chose to promote the launch through their owned channels and limited the amplification to a blog post. Wied knows that isn't enough and she suggests you should maximum your distribution and choose your outlets based on your target market and strengths. \nTo read further on the three ways to combat content blindness in your content marketing strategy, read Wied's entire article here: http://bit.ly/1W4WIYk . \nPR Newswire's Small Business PR Toolkit is a comprehensive resource that provides small businesses and entrepreneurs the tools to develop an affordable public relations and marketing plan that helps generate interest from potential customers, engage with key audiences and grow their businesses.
