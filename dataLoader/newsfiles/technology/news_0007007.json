As a result, they became more mobile and adaptable to different habitats and changes in their environment.\nTogether these changes gave early humans a better chance at evolutionary success.\nThe study focused on 152 fossil teeth samples collected by Yohannes Haile-Selassie, curator of physical anthropology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, from the Woranso-Mille study area in the Afar region of Ethiopia.\nThe teeth were from a mix of animals including monkeys, antelopes, pigs, giraffes, elephants and human ancestors.\nThe carbon isotope distribution in the teeth was the target because it indicates what the creatures ate during teeth formation.\n\"This research reveals surprising insights into the interactions between morphology and behavior among Pliocene primates,\" said Haile-Selassie, who was a co-author of the paper and leader of the research project behind it.\n\"The results not only show an earlier start to grass-based food consumption among hominins and baboons but also indicate that behavioral change does not always precede form,\" he said.\n\"In the earliest baboons, dietary shift toward grass occurred before its teeth were specialized for grazing. On the other hand, hominins have acquired dental morphology that would allow them to eat grass-based food resources as early as 4.2 million years ago,\" Haile-Selassie said. \"However, they did not start fully exploiting these food resources until after 3.8 million years ago.\"\nAn advantage to the expanded diet is \"you can then range wider,\" Levin said of the human precursors that would have included several species including Australopithecus afarensis , extinct some 3 million years ago and represented most famously in the fossil informally known as Lucy. \"You can be in more places, more resilient to habitat change.\"\nAnimals with more specialized diets are more vulnerable to extinction, because changes in habitat can eliminate the staple upon which they rely, Haile-Selassie said.\nPrior to the dietary expansion, Haile-Selassie said, human ancestors maintained a tree- and shrub-based diet.\nAfter the expansion, they could also consume warm-growing-season grasses and sedges, as well as crassulacean acid metabolism plants that include cacti and succulents.\nThe researchers said grass-based foods are not limited to grasses and their roots, but also the tissue of creatures that ate grass, such as insects and birds.\nBeverly Saylor, associate professor of stratigraphy and sedimentology at Case Western Reserve University, was another co-author of the paper.", "external_links": ["http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/09/09/1424982112.full.pdf?sid=4d36179b-6c79-4d40-9b14-af74657b12e2", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPUHbriLdIQ"], "published": "2015-09-20T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T05:36:22.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
