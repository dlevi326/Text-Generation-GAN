NeweggNET is the easiest and most convenient way for a small business to set up a computer network complete with all requisite necessities: router, computers, printers and tech support. \nSmall businesses often fall victim to their own success when rapid growth demands IT requirements outside the business’s technical capabilities. These companies need a simple, cost-effective way to customize the perfect computer network, and NeweggNET meets that need with the added benefits of service and support to ensure seamless deployment. \n“Many of our customers first visit Newegg when setting up home offices – we wanted a way to grow with these entrepreneurs as their businesses continue to expand,” said Merle McIntosh, VP Newegg Business North America. “NeweggNET offers growing businesses the knowledge depth of an IT consultancy, with the ability to purchase and easily set up a customized computer network.” \nNeweggNET is designed specifically for small businesses of up to 50 employees seeking high-quality, easily installed computer networking solutions. Customers can visit the NeweggNET online configuration tool, select the number of users and NeweggNET recommends a complete hardware bundle. All the hardware comes with an intuitive Quick Start Guide for easy setup. The package also includes free tech support for 30 days, with the option to purchase remote, on-site or subscription support for a longer duration. More information is available at http://www.neweggbusiness.com/neweggnet-solutions . \nNeweggBusiness Technical Support \nNeweggBusiness Technical Support offers comprehensive, single-contact IT support for small- and medium-sized businesses. Customers have the option of selecting on-site technical support with an independent technician who provides hands-on installation and trouble-shooting. Customers can also opt for remote technical support where problems are resolved by remote technicians who talk customers through issues via phone, while connecting to the user’s computer to troubleshoot directly. All support technicians are based in the United States and are readily accessible when needed. NeweggBusiness Technical Support offers competitive pricing, starting at $34.99, with additional discounts for monthly and annual support subscriptions, as well as single-session discounts.
