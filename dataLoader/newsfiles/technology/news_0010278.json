The new version of the app allows users to create a Flashgap and invite friends to join the group album. The timer begins and all photos taken in the album disappear within three seconds... It is only the next day, at 12:00pm, that the full album is revealed with all the pictures taken by the participants on the previous night. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150921/269032 \nFlashgap launched into beta six months ago in the UK, and over 2 million photos and videos have already been taken and uploaded. Some key new features include comment sections on pictures, privacy options for open or closed albums, and the ability to connect groups via third-party social and messaging platforms. The app is now available on both iOS and Android and is free of charge. \nThe real revelation and outbreak that pushed Julian Kabab into creating Flashgap, were the end credits in the movie 'The Hangover', where pictures from the previous night are revealed. \n\"We've had great early success in Europe and judging off the popularity of Flashgap for events, we believe that it could become of common use among people in their 20's for parties, weddings, concerts or any type of moments,\" said Flashgap's CEO Julian Kabab. \"The real objective of a startup is to stand out and swim the other way, change the user experience and establish a new product in everyone's daily habits. Flashgap's differentiation lies in the surprise generated by sharing the discovery of every picture the next day at the same time. The app is really about enabling you to relive the best moments from nights out with friends without needing to censor yourself on social networks because you might not look perfect or something embarrassing happened. It all just stays between you and your group of close friends.\" \nThe funding will be used to further develop key features and create a U.S. based team. \nFor more information or to download the app please visit - https://www.flashgap.com/ . \nABOUT FLASHGAP Based in Paris, France, and launched in beta in December 2014, Flashgap has gained popularity with the European college crowd, with over 2 million photos and videos shared to date. Founded by a group of four young friends, including CEO Julian Kabab, the team has quickly grown to 12 full-time members in the past six months, working to develop new fun and interactive ways to share and enjoy the best memories between close groups of friends. \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/time-delayed-photo-sharing-app-inspired-by-the-hangover-raises-15m-to-launch-in-us-300146926.html \nSOURCE Flashgap", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:56:50.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
