Three for the price of one -- mobile electrons multiplied in quantum dot films October 14, 2011 \nResearchers of the Opto-electronic Materials section of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and Toyota Europe have demonstrated that several mobile electrons can be produced by the absorption of a single light ... Scientists report first solar cell producing more electrons in photocurrent than solar photons entering cell December 15, 2011 \n(PhysOrg.com) -- Researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have reported the first solar cell that produces a photocurrent that has an external quantum efficiency greater than 100 percent when photoexcited ... Nontoxic quantum dot research improves solar cells December 11, 2013 \nSolar cells made with low-cost, nontoxic copper-based quantum dots can achieve unprecedented longevity and efficiency, according to a study by Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sharp Corporation. New approach may be key to quantum dot solar cells with real gains in efficiency June 19, 2014 \n(Phys.org) —Los Alamos researchers have demonstrated an almost four-fold boost of the carrier multiplication yield with nanoengineered quantum dots. Carrier multiplication is when a single photon can excite multiple electrons. ... Getting two for one: 'Bonus' electrons in germanium nanocrystals can lead to better solar cells February 14, 2015 \nResearchers from FOM, the University of Amsterdam, the Delft University of Technology and the University of the Algarve have discovered that when light hits germanium nanocrystals, the crystals produce 'bonus electrons'. ... Recommended for you Ultrafast photodetectors allow direct observation of multiple electrons generated by a single photon September 14, 2015 \nOne of the big benefits of the tiny semiconductor pieces known as quantum dots is that they can crank out multiple electrons from a single photon, a feature called \"carrier multiplication,\" which could lead to cheap and highly ... Curly nanowires catch more light to power nanoscale electronic circuits September 11, 2015 \nIn the question of curly versus straight, new evidence suggests curly wins – at least in the world of nanowires. Researchers from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, have shown that twisting straight nanowires into springs ... SLAC's ultrafast 'electron camera' visualizes ripples in 2-D material September 10, 2015 \nNew research led by scientists from the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University shows how individual atoms move in trillionths of a second to form wrinkles on a three-atom-thick ... Hybrid solar cell converts both light and heat from sun's rays into electricity September 9, 2015 \nScientists have developed a new hybrid, solar-energy system that harnesses the full spectrum of the sun's radiation by pairing a photovoltaic cell with polymer films. The films convert the light that goes unused by the solar ... Science provides new way to peer into pores September 9, 2015 \nRice University scientists led a project to \"see\" and measure the space in porous materials, even if that space is too small or fragile for traditional microscopes. Encapsulation layers keep carbon nanotube transistors stable in open air September 8, 2015 \nIndividual transistors made from carbon nanotubes are faster and more energy efficient than those made from other materials. Going from a single transistor to an integrated circuit full of transistors, however, is a giant ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:02:00.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
