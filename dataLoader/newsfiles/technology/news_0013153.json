When the users install the app, it floats at the top of the screen so the users can quickly take a screenshot of the whole screen or a particular region.\nIt is touch-friendly so it is easier to select than a desktop app and has full pen support so the users can write or draw directly on the screenshot.\nThere was an app called ‘Snipping Tool’ included with Windows, but this makes it much easier to share screenshots and annotate them without the need for any other software.\nFirst Published on August 29, 2015 6:10 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T08:58:09.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
