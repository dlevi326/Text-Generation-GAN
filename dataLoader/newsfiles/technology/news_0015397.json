A report entitled Death of the Contact Center pronounces: “The traditional call centre is dead.” It argues: “Driven by the explosion in communication options and widespread customer acceptance of new self-service channels, the era of the traditional call centre has well and truly passed.” The traditional call centre may well be, if not dead, on its last legs, but its offspring, the contact centre, certainly is not, as the report observes: “Let’s not move forward with any funeral plans just yet, because the ‘death’ of the traditional call centre merely gives rise to the contact centre of the future. Live support channels are still critical for customer service; they just need to evolve in order to keep pace with rapidly shifting consumer preferences.” Given this statement, one has to ask: Why is the report titled “Death of the Contact Center”, and why does it show, on the cover, a grave stone bearing the legend R.I.P Contact Center? Despite its statements, the report appears to regard call and contact center as being largely synonymous and to define them as providers of live services from a human agent, as opposed to customer self-service provided purely by technology, ie IVR systems that do not resolve to a human operator, and the use of web sites for both the input and output of information. It gives figures showing the uptake of three types of ‘self service’ and says: “None of these methods of self-service were even widely measured just two years prior, a testament to how quickly customers have shifted their preferences for engagement. For simple, straightforward inquiries, customers don’t want to pick up the phone and speak to a live support agent.” That might be true, but two of the three ‘self-service’ methods listed requires real-time interaction with a human operator: “24 percent of consumers reported using an online virtual agent; 25 percent of consumers reported using online screen-sharing; 27 percent of consumers reported using the click-to-call feature from a company website.” Online screen-sharing and click-to-call are not self-service methods: they are merely new ways of interacting with a customer service operator enabled by technology developments. The call/contact centre is neither dead nor dying, merely metamorphosing into something for which, given that call centre seems to be synonymous with contact centre, we need a new name: interaction centre perhaps? \nPremier Technologies \nPremier Contact Point provides a hosted contact solution that meets the needs of the modern contact centre.
