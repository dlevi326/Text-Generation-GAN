Pic: File Share by email A group of cyber-criminals are ramping up attacks on financial institutions who refuse to pay protection money using Bitcoin. \nKnown as 'DDoS for Bitcoin', the group is responsible for a significant number of Bitcoin extortion attempts over the past two years, a new report claims. \nIts leaders have so far evaded international police forces despite hitting Bitcoin exchanges, online casinos and more recently banks and clearing houses. \nThe group has carried out almost 150 attacks, according to research carried out by net firm Akamai, and the UK National Computer Emergency Response Team said there is a \"marked increase\" in attacks. \nIn a report on the group, Akamai's security division boss Stuart Scholly said: \"The latest attacks - focused primarily on the financial service industry - involved new strategies and tactics intended to harass, extort and ultimately embarrass the victim publicly.\" \nThe group uses a large network of computers to send around 13 gigabits of data every second towards its victims, temporarily overwhelming their computer systems. \nThe largest attack so far sent 56.2 gigabits of data per second to a target company. \nPayments of up to £10,000 are demanded, and Akamai said many victims have likely paid up to avoid having their sites hit. \nThe firm said it's possible to defend against the attacks by filtering data which comes from system controlled by the group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T05:40:18.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
