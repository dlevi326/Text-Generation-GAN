USBCDC is making a tax equity investment in the project, under a separate agreement. \n\"This agreement with leading investors such as Santander and USBCDC demonstrates our ability to develop consistently bankable solar projects,\" said Dr. Shawn Qu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Canadian Solar. \"Securing financing for the Mustang project is an important milestone as we work to execute on our pipeline of late stage projects.\" \n\"By supporting renewable energy projects like the Mustang facility, we can help sustain the environment and stimulate the economy,\" said Jorge Camina, Head of Project Finance at Santander Bank, N.A. \"Financing Canadian Solar and Recurrent Energy in this milestone project demonstrates our commitment to supporting leading sponsors of renewable energy projects.\" \n\"USBCDC is excited to partner with Canadian Solar and Recurrent on this investment, which will lead to economic development and job creation in Kings County, while providing additional renewable energy resources to California electric customers,\" said Adam Altenhofen, vice president of U.S. Bancorp Community Development Corporation, which invested $101 million in renewable energy tax credit equity in the project. \nThe Mustang project, covering an area of approximately 1,000 acres in Kings County, is expected to reach commercial operation in the fourth quarter of 2016. The project began construction in summer 2015 with Blattner Energy serving as the provider of Engineering, Procurement, and Construction services (\"EPC\"). \nThe Mustang project is expected to generate enough clean solar energy to power approximately 28,000 homes. The electricity and associated renewable energy credits (RECs) generated by the facility will be sold under long-term power purchase agreements. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T16:10:35.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
