Not only are we bringing the state-of-the-art portable glass NetSuite Challenge Court to Justin Herman Plaza for the first time, but we are also showcasing world class women's pro squash and now juniors. It's a true feast of squash, which we know will just help propel the sport further in the Bay Area.\" \"We're thrilled to help make new opportunities in the sport of squash available for junior players in the area,\" said Evan Goldberg , NetSuite Co-founder and CTO. \"We look forward to some fierce competition and exciting matches.\" The NetSuite Junior Silver organizers are expecting more than 100 participants. \"It can only be positive with the NetSuite Open using so many different clubs in the bay area for matches, exhibitions, clinics etc. All our juniors can be up close and personal with the best players in the world at their own clubs.
