Other items on show include an internal combustion engine, as designed by Karl Benz, and a mechanical television system, which was masterminded by Logie Baird.\nThe international consortium of researchers behind the PRaVDA (Proton Radiotherapy Verification and Dosimetry Applications) project is led by the University of Lincoln’s Distinguished Professor of Image Engineering Nigel Allinson MBE.\nFunded by the Wellcome Trust, he and his multinational team are developing one of the most complex medical instruments ever imagined to improve the delivery of proton beam therapy in the treatment of cancer. The advances they have made in medical imaging technology could make this type of therapy a viable treatment for many more cancer sufferers.\nThe world-first technology developed by the team uses proton beams to localize treatment, causing less damage to healthy tissue.\nProfessor Allinson, from the University of Lincoln’s School of Computer Science, said: “It is an amazing honor for our work to be included on the IET’s show wall, and to be up there with some of the all-time greats of engineering innovation.”\nThe IET’s year-long show wall exhibition is part of a series of initiatives to celebrate the launch of the new Savoy Place venue in London, which officially opens in November 2015. The exhibition will include a layer of PRaVDA’s Proton Tracker Unit, which will feature alongside other pioneering innovations from across the globe.\nThe PRaVDA research consortium was also recognized by the institution in November 2014, when it won the Model-based Engineering category at the prestigious IET Innovation Awards, which recognize the best global innovations in engineering, science and technology.\nLater this year, the PRaVDA team will continue its work by using coveted time on the South African National Cyclotron (a type of particle accelerator), near Cape Town, to try to produce a world-first clinical-quality Proton CT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:14:50.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
