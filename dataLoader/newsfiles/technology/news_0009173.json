This sensor uses patented technology to detect bubbles even smaller than 10µm in diameter -- bubbles smaller than the human eye can see.\nFlorence, KY (PRWEB) September 22, 2015\nThe new Balluff MICROmote® optical precision tube sensors are designed to detect free-floating air bubbles in transparent liquids. These free-floating air bubbles have dimensions smaller than their tube's inner diameter.\nThe sensor's ability to detect free-floating air bubbles results from a uniform illumination of the tube's liquid column. This uniform illumination is created by a concentrated arrangement of multiple light beams, each with an individual uniform intensity distribution, surrounding the tube. When a small air bubble enters the sensing field it induces a significant signal jump on the sensor's receiver elements. This signal jump enables reliable detection of the tiniest air bubbles, even microbubbles. (A microbubble is defined as a bubble smaller than one millimeter in diameter.)\nTogether with the microprocessor controlled MICROmote® amplifiers, with either switching or analog output, these tube sensors form a complete detection system with diverse application possibilities for laboratory, analysis and medical technology.\nLearn more about Balluff's line of tube sensors .\nDownload high resolution images on Flickr .\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12973784.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12973784.htm", "http://www.balluff.com/balluff/MUS/en/products/tube-bubble-air-in-line-photoelectric-sensors.jsp"], "published": "2015-09-22T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T08:34:16.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
