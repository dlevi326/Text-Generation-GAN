Someone with a direct experience in designing games would have been better.\"\nIwata, a leading figure in the videogame industry, oversaw the success of Nintendo's Wii games console and a surge in revenue before smartphone games started eating away at its success.\nA visibly thinner Iwata announced last year that he was sick and did not attend the firm's shareholder meeting in June 2014, although the severity of his illness was unclear at the time.\nHe returned to work over the following months and continued to be the public face of Nintendo, including when the company announced financial results in May.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T15:52:26.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
