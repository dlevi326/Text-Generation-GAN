The recently launched site took top place in both the General Website Categories: Education and Website Features: User Experience divisions at the renowned annual competition, which is judged by the Academy of Interactive and Visual Arts. Launched in June of this year, “This Is Michigan” breaks new ground in the collegiate athlete recruitment space by seamlessly integrating rich video content, curated student athlete social media, behind-the-scenes features and dozens of testimonials from past and present University of Michigan athletes. \"Our goal was to create an experience that truly immersed potential recruits and their families in what life is like as a U-M Student Athlete – get a little maize and blue on them,\" says Adam Wilson, Co-Chief Creative Officer with Enlighten.\nThe site, which is completely responsive and optimized for desktop, tablet and smartphone use, was designed after extensive interviews with every University of Michigan coach, along with student athletes and new recruits. Robust photo galleries and detailed information on all 31 of U of M's sports teams serve to familiarize visitors with Ann Arbor, the U of M campus, and the coveted school itself. \"The school, the community – it’s really a very rich story. So, we applied a tremendous level of scrutiny to the photography choices,\" says Enlighten Creative Director Mike Gatto.\n\"That ThisisMichigan.com was selected as a best-of-the-web site is an honor and a great achievement,\" Steve Glauberman, CEO of Enlighten, says. \"We're particularly proud of the spotlight that the W3s have put on the user experience, something that was a major priority for everyone involved in this project. 'This is Michigan' truly is a one-of-a-kind recruitment site, designed to meet and surpass its users' multiple, multi-platform needs.\"\nThe winners of the W3 Awards, now in its 10th year, are determined by leading media, interactive, advertising and marketing professionals.
