Emerson Hsiao, Senior VP of Andes Technology USA Corporation was presented the award during TSMC's recent Open Integration Platform Ecosystem Forum that brought together TSMC's design ecosystem partners and customers to share solutions to today's design challenges. \n\"We are extremely proud that TSMC has honored Andes Technology Corporation with its 2015 Open Innovation Platform Partner of the Year,\" Hsiao said. \"The CPU architecture that Andes Technology Corporation developed less than 10 years ago by its world class computer and software architects and engineers is shipping in over 700 million System on Chips, the vast majority of which have been fabricated at TSMC's leading edge foundry. We have worked closely with TSMC to ensure our IP can leverage the foundry's low power and high performance processes to help achieve the best power/performance results for our mutual customers.\" \n\"Andes Technology Corporation has developed into a valued TSMC partner,\" declared Suk Lee, Senior Director of TSMC's Design Infrastructure Marketing Division. \"As TSMC has evolved to serve emerging markets such as the Internet of Things, we have expanded our ecosystem to support new products and customers. Having an emerging partner developing CPU IP to meet the low power needs of rapidly growing applications like IoT helps us serve this next generation of chip designs.\" \nAndes and TSMC OIP Forum The Andes Technology Corporation presentation \"Tackling Power and Security Issues for IoT Devices,\" by Emerson Hsiao, Senior VP of Andes Technology USA Corporation has been selected for publication in the proceedings of the 2015 TSMC Open Integration Platform Ecosystem Forum. The CPU architecture that Andes Technology Corporation developed less than 10 years ago recognizes the new computing paradigm for low-power devices and includes hardware functionality specific for power savings required for machine-to-machine interaction. Andes' next generation 32-bit CPU core offers power savings far exceeding other legacy architectures in the same silicon footprint and with the performance of a high-end 32-bit CPU. \"Tackling Power and Security Issues for IoT Devices,\" describes these power saving features and shows how new IoT devices can benefit from them. \nAbout Andes Technology Corporation Andes Technology Corporation is a leader in developing high-performance/low-power 32-bit processors and associated SoC platforms to serve the rapidly growing embedded system applications worldwide.
