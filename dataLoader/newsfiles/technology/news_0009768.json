Uphill first proposed buying ISSI in March for $19.25 a share, or about $640 million, and eventually won the tug of war with its $23-a-share bid that values ISSI at about $736 million.\nThe California-based company said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. extended its review and will undertake a more thorough investigation. According to the CFIUS, for some transactions—including those that would result in the transfer of control of \"critical infrastructure\" to a foreign person—the committee is required to conduct a 45-day investigation.\nCFIUS has indicated that the investigation will be completed no later than Nov. 2, according to ISSI.\nThe company now expects to complete the transaction in the fourth quarter. Previously, ISSI anticipated closing the deal in the third quarter.\nISSI had said it preferred the Uphill tie-up to one with Cypress in part because of regulatory concerns.\nShares in the company, up about 35% this year, were inactive premarket.\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com\n 16, 2015 09:25 ET (13:25 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T03:17:11.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
