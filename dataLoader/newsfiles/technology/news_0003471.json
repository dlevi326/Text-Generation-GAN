A. Volkswagen installed software in roughly 482,000 diesel passenger cars sold in the U.S. since 2008, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A. The EPA Volkswagen Group CEO Martin Winterkorn issued a statement Sunday saying that the company will fully cooperate with government investigations and has ordered an internal probe. The software also would have helped the cars' fuel economy numbers, since they get better gas mileage when the emissions control system is turned off. Winterkorn could also face scrutiny from Volkswagen's board, which meets Friday, and investors, who watched the company's shares plunge 17.1 percent Monday to a three-year low. The Oscar-winning actress played it coy when asked about her relationship with photographer Bryan Randall.
