Bradley Kanaris Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Liam Mannix Commonwealth Bank customers have been hit by a widespread technology outage affecting their credit cards , net banking, mobile banking, phone banking ATM, Bpay and eftpos services.\n\"The cause is under urgent investigation & we're working to fix this as top priority,\" CBA replied to one frustrated customer on its Twitter feed.\nThere are reports that money paid for bills is not going through, and several customers report being stranded at supermarkets and service stations, unable to pay for fuel or groceries.\nCustomers are reporting error messages on their Commonwealth Bank smartphone app, and problems accessing their credit cards or home loan accounts.\nFurious users are taking to social media to vent. It was only a few months ago that the bank suffered a huge, similar outage on a Friday, although that one only lasted a few hours. This outage appears to have already gone on for much longer.\nThere are also complaints from customers of being unable to use their credit and debit cards in stores. Phone banking is also hit, as are travel money cards.\nWidespread outages are affecting Commbank customers.
