Two years later, Sorah moved to San Francisco and fell in love with both the city's character and its dynamic real estate market.\nMichelle Balog, Climb's Managing Sales Director, said, \"Lucas Sorah is our newest Climber in the rapidly growing Climb team and we couldn't be happier to have this Southern Californian decide to make his new home in San Francisco and with Climb family.
