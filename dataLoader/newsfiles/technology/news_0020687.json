Only R3 billion a year was channelled towards service delivery in the mostly rural province, many areas of which are in need of basic services such as running water and electricity.\nThe former provincial director-general, Professor Job Mokgoro, said in May that R1.2 billion was being channelled to payments for accruals from previous financial years.\nBriefing the standing committee on public accounts in Mahikeng today, Premier Supra Mahumapelo said the shocking revelation of the ghost employees was the result of a process undertaken to verify every government employee in the province’s salary payment system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:07:10.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
