ModelStream bridges Autodesk Revit with IBM Maximo, providing a tool that enables facility management and operations and maintenance teams to directly access building information model (BIM) data developed during the design and construction process. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150810/257366LOGO \n\"ModelStream is a prime example of how Microdesk is constantly striving to recognize ways to align and support the AECO industry,\" said Michael DeLacey, President of Microdesk. \"Our AEC and Facility Management experts have developed a game-changing solution that directly connects asset management systems with BIM models, enabling owners to seamlessly access all critical building information immediately after project close-out.\" \n\"ModelStream is an innovative new product that finally addresses a major pain point for owners and facility managers with its bi-directional connection between Autodesk Revit and IBM Maximo information to create a fully integrated asset management system,\" said George Broadbent, Director of Asset Management at Microdesk. \"By bridging the gap between BIM models and Maximo, facilities and operations teams will now be able to easily visualize potential problems, track equipment, identify assets, and access data essential for effectively managing a building throughout its lifecycle.\" \nBridging Autodesk Revit with IBM Maximo Microdesk's ModelStream connects the information-driven power of BIM with the comprehensive asset and maintenance management system IBM Maximo. Rather than deal with the time consuming process of manually populating a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS), ModelStream's configuration can be accomplished in a matter of hours and assets synchronized in just a few minutes. \nThe Benefits of ModelStream ModelStream provides a solution to owners and facility management teams that allows them to directly access critical information from IBM Maximo and Revit. Information is synchronized between the two programs and staff can access all project data, including the BIM model, right from IBM Maximo. Rather than having to sift through multiple data sources, personnel can access all space, asset, and maintenance information from a single comprehensive enterprise asset management system. \nLearn More about ModelStream Microdesk is offering an introductory \"Jump-Start Package\" for ModelStream that includes technology assessment and consulting services, software installation, and support.
