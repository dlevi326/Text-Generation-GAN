SAN JOSE, Calif. , Sept. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Hosted by distinguished networking technologist and author Ivan Peplnjak, the popular \" Software Gone Wild \" podcast features an in-depth roundtable discussion on ADARA Dynamic Link State Protocol (DLSP). Emerging as the successor to Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), DLSP enables real-time, performance-based cloud computing and networking through cloud software and SDN applications and is being readied as a standard in networking and computing. ADARA DLSP has been tested and proven in deployments of all sizes, from minor to hyper-scale. It solves the challenges of performance, scale and automation for cloud networking, SDN, packet/optical Integration, WAN routing, virtualization and optimization, virtual and physical routing and switching. DLSP is potentially the most important advancement in networking; the most dynamic, flexible, highest-performing, most scalable networking software ever developed. When: Friday, September 18, 2015 Who: Host: Ivan Pepelnjak , CCIE#1354 Emeritus, Founder of ipspace.net , and author of Cisco Press books on EIGRP network design and MPLS and VPN architectures Co-hosts: Ethan Banks , CCIE #20655 and Co-Founder, Packet Pushers David Gee , Founder, ipengineer.net blog Guests: Dr. Marcelo Spohn , Chief Scientist, ADARA Raghu Gangi , Principal Engineer, ADARA About ADARA Networks ADARA Networks is an industry-leading developer of production-ready, open standard, vendor-neutral Layer 2-7 software-defined networking (SDN), cloud computing and networking solutions.
