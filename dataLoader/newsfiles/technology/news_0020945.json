But religion and the right to freely worship have become victims of it.\nMore than 500 churches and monasteries - many hundreds of years old - were left to ruin, looted or converted for other uses in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north of the island after Turkey invaded and split the island along ethnic lines following a coup aiming at union with Greece.\nIn the internationally recognised south, only a fraction of the 110 mosques operate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:19:13.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
