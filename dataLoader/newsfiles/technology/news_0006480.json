It’s Jorge Mario Bergoglio, I thought. There was one person I wanted to call with the news as soon as I saw it—my grandfather. And when I did, he was overjoyed. My family is Argentine and, we just had learned, so was the next pope.\nThe news didn’t feel exclusive to religion. It felt like something more—like a signal of hope.\nWhen Pope Francis arrives to the U.S. on Wednesday for a six-day visit, he touches down not only as the Holy Father, but as a man from the tip of South America. And Hispanic Americans across the country may well feel what my family and I felt that day—hope.\nLatest from Politics The 2016 U.S. Presidential Race: A Cheat Sheet\nThe U.S. has seen an influx of Latinos in recent years. Hispanics now account for 17.4 percent of the U.S. population. But even as their numbers have grown, the percent of Hispanics who practice Catholicism has declined. When Francis addresses the throngs that have come to see him this week, he will be speaking to an American Catholic Church that is rapidly growing more Hispanic, and a Hispanic community that is rapidly growing less Catholic.\nIn 2014, a Pew research survey found that the number of Hispanic Americans who call themselves Catholic had dropped by 12 percentage points since 2010, when 67 percent of Hispanics were Catholic. Four years later, nearly one-in-four Hispanics defined themselves as former Catholics. The survey also found that 22 percent of Latinos are Protestant and 18 percent are religiously unaffiliated.", "external_links": ["http://www.pewforum.org/2014/05/07/the-shifting-religious-identity-of-latinos-in-the-united-states/", "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/25/u-s-hispanic-population-growth-surge-cools/"], "published": "2015-09-21T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:28:02.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
