(“MACOM”) (NASDAQ:MTSI), a leading supplier of high-performance analog RF, microwave and optical semiconductor products, today announced the new MAXP-37161, a highly integrated, low power, fully non-blocking 16 channel 28 Gbps crosspoint switch targeted for 100G Ethernet, EDR InfiniBand and OTN applications. \nIn addition to its switching capabilities, the MAXP-37161 is designed to compensate for signal loss in backplanes and copper cables. The switch is equipped with integrated Clock and Data Recovery (CDR), Adaptive Continuous Time Linear Equalization (ADCTLE) and Decision Feedback Equalization (DFE), compensating up to 32 dB loss at 12.9 GHz. Retiming is used to eliminate residual jitter and provide customers with a clean signal for transmitting to downstream devices. \nMACOM’s new MAXP-37161 also offers diagnostic features, including on-chip eye monitoring for link margin evaluation or receiver optimization and integrated PRBS generators and checkers. The MAXP-37161A is offered in a 15 x 15 mm BGA package, enabling flexible placement on high density line cards. \n“Emerging cloud services data centers drive a need for flexible bandwidth management at the network and system level,” said Marek Tlalka, Director of Marketing, MACOM. “We believe that the MAXP-37161 addition to our wide portfolio of crosspoint devices is an ideal switching device that addresses these needs in server, switching and routing applications.” \nThe MAXP-37161 is rapidly being adopted by companies such as Metamako, a leading Australian-based company in deterministic ultra-low latency devices for the financial trading community. It is anticipated that MACOM’s crosspoint switch will enable Metamako devices to handle 25 Gbps communications, the new standard in networks. \n“This is a great collaboration and one of the first to bring 25G data capacity to financial institutions,” said Dr. Dave Snowdon, Founder and Co-CTO, Metamako. “Low latency crosspoints are an ideal solution for switching platforms targeted for high frequency financial trading applications while enabling next generation 25G and 100G connectivity.” \nThe MAXP-37161 will be shown in private demonstrations for customers, partners, press and analysts at ECOC 2015, Meeting Room M8 at the Fiera Valencia, in Valencia, Spain, from September 28 th -30 th .
