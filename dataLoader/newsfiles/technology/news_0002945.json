But he acknowledged to Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton that the communications of senior U.S. officials are highly sought after by foreign intelligence agencies. \nRogers says that if he learned that a top foreign official was emailing over a private server, he would consider that an intelligence-gathering opportunity. \nClinton has said she is sorry she used a private email server as her exclusive email account for government business when she was secretary of state, but the issue has continued to shadow her presidential campaign. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:02:58.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
