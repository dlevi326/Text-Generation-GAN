The round was led by Baseline Ventures, with participation from Bain Capital Ventures, Divergent Ventures, Ignition Partners, and Cloud Capital Partners. Previously, Iron.io raised $5.5 million in seed funding. \nDue to the rapid growth of APIs and ensuing complexity of the software stack, Enterprises are adopting a microservice architecture: breaking down complex applications into small, independent processes. Iron.io's flexible language-agnostic and ability to be deployed on public, private, hybrid cloud or on-premises have made it a popular choice for scaling this new architecture, abstracting and managing the billions of compute tasks necessary to run and deliver software. Current customers include HotelTonight, Turner Broadcasting System, Bleacher Report and Twitter's Periscope. \nWhether you're a media company pushing news updates or an IoT company managing sensor data and implementing services based on that data, job processing and delivery must be scalable and reliable. \n\"We're at a critical juncture in software, where applications are continuing to break down into smaller distributed services. These services are generating billions of discrete events across a host of cloud and on-premise infrastructure,\" said Chad Arimura, Iron.io CEO. \"Iron.io is the glue ensuring those compute tasks always happen no matter the scale, enabling Enterprises to rapidly deploy new applications. This funding will serve as a force multiplier for us as we onboard new customers and build our team to meet the growing demand.\" \n\"The microservice architecture is changing the way software is being built. It enables the continuous delivery of applications in any language, across a host of on-premise and cloud environments. Iron.io's event-driven services are a key part of this architecture, giving Enterprises the control and choice for where they run their workloads,\" said Steve Anderson, founder of Baseline Ventures. \"Iron.io's rapid growth in the Enterprise and among developers is a testament to the fact that this architecture is becoming widely adopted, with Iron.io a key piece of this stack.\" \n\"Iron.io's IronWorker has become our go-to platform for scheduling and running our Ruby-based ETL worker pipeline, which enables us to provide fast, accurate hotel room availability to our users in real time,\" said Jatinder Singh, Director of Engineering - Platform at HotelTonight. \"Iron.io was a great partner for us while we were architecting our ETL pipeline. We're pleased to see them continue to grow and expand their services for customers like us.\" \n\"The Pivotal Cloud Foundry Cloud Native platform is quickly becoming the environment of choice for modern enterprises looking to rapidly, consistently and reliably deliver the next generation of web, mobile and IOT applications,\" said Nima Badiey, Pivotal Software, Head of Business Development. \"Critical to the success of these applications are services like Iron.io's event-driven solutions because they empower developers to easily build complex, distributed applications designed for Internet scale.\" \nThis new funding will be used for growing Iron.io's team including engineering, sales, marketing and customer support. \nAbout Iron.io Iron.io's event-driven computing platform delivers and processes 100s of millions of messages and tasks through IronMQ and IronWorker. Its asynchronous workloads operate in public and private clouds, on-premises, or hybrid environments. Iron.io's messaging queuing, task processing, and job scheduling solutions are used for event processing, transaction processing, mobile and IoT compute, microservices, and other asynchronous computing patterns within modern cloud applications. Iron.io is leveraged by some of the world's most exciting companies such as HotelTonight, Turner Broadcasting System, Bleacher Report, Twitter, Untappd, and Google. Learn more at www.iron.io .
