Picture: REUTERS TAIPEI — More than 7,000 people were evacuated in Taiwan as \"super typhoon\" Dujuan swirled towards the island on Monday, gathering strength as it bore down on the east coast.\nTorrential rains and high winds are forecast across Taiwan from Monday afternoon, with an earlier landfall now predicted — about 9am to 10am GMT — as the storm speeds up. Crashing waves were already battering the northeastern coast by midday and fishing boats have been called back to shore. Panicked visitors to the island’s east — many of whom had headed there for the Mid-Autumn Festival long weekend — crammed onto trains away from the coast before rail services there were suspended.\nHigh-speed rail services in the west were also cancelled.\nAuthorities have warned that coastal areas could be particularly dangerous as tides are affected by the current \"supermoon\" — a rare astrological event in which the moon appears brighter and larger.\nThis is because the moon has reached its closest orbital point to Earth and therefore has a stronger gravitational pull than usual. The storm intensified as it approached Taiwan, with gusts of 227km per hour. Taiwan’s weather bureau upgraded Dujuan to a \"strong typhoon\" on Sunday, while other regional weather bureaus, including the Hong Kong Observatory, categorise it as a \"super typhoon\".\n\"The whole of the island should heighten vigilance against severe winds and torrential rains,\" a spokesman for Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau said. Almost 3,000 people were evacuated on Sunday from Taiwan’s Green Island and Orchid Island — popular with visitors.\nMore than 4,000 were moved on Monday ahead of the storm.\nNew Taipei City mayor Eric Chu said they were from vulnerable areas, including the hot spring town of Wulai, just outside Taipei.\n\"In areas that could become isolated during the typhoon, sufficient rescue and communications equipment will be deployed in advance. We hope residents can co-operate with us,\" said Mr Chu.\nAboriginal mountain communities are particularly at risk during typhoons, often hit by flooding and mudslides.\nWulai was hit hard by Typhoon Soudelor in August with some residents unable to return home for weeks.\nShops and hotels have remained closed as roads and flood damage are yet to be fully repaired.\n\"To be honest, we all feel very depressed. Any damage may further prolong the time needed for reconstruction,\" Chou Chih-kang, a Wulai neighbourhood chief, told AFP.\nThe weather bureau warned that the \"massive amount of rubble\" on mountain slopes and riverbeds since Soudelor led to further damage.\nHundreds of passengers crammed onto high speed trains away from the eastern cities of Hualien and Taitung before the services were suspended. More than 24,000 troops are on standby for disaster relief and evacuations, with 100 shelters set up. Emergency response centres have been established in the north and east.\nDujuan was 110km off the coast of eastern Hualien County at 7am GMT Monday, moving at 23km per hour. A concert by US rock band Bon Jovi due to take place in Taipei on Monday was cancelled, while 169 international and 59 domestic flights were also pulled.\nFerry services and flights to outlying islands have already been suspended. Dujuan will pass near the Japanese island of Ishigaki as it approaches Taiwan. Japan’s meteorological agency has warned it could trigger waves 13m high.\nAbout 100 domestic flights were cancelled in Japan, while 3,200 households lost power in Ishigaki and on other islands, local media said.\nThere were no reports so far of damage or injury.\nThe storm is on course to hit mainland China from Tuesday, but is forecast to have weakened by then.\nTyphoon Soudelor caused at least eight deaths in Taiwan last month and killed 21 people in China.\nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:19:27.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
