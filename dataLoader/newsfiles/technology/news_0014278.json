Digbijay Mishra Digbijay Mishra ,TNN | Sep 5, 2015, 06.18 AM IST The focus on food delivery could be an attempt to reduce losses as the outlook of investors is changing and they now expect companies to have a shorter timeline to profitability. RELATED About three months ago, Zomato announced its entry into food delivery -the online food guide no longer just helps you pick what to eat, it gets the food to your door step. It may seem like it's a little late to the delivery game considering the deep pockets and head start of Foodpanda, TinyOwl and Swiggy, but making a success out of it may be critical to sustaining its global growth. Gurgaon-based Zomato lists about 1.4 million restaurants across 10,000 cities in 22 countries and plans to add at least eight more geographies by the end of March 2016. That makes it the second biggest company in the world in this space -US-based Yelp is the leader with a presence in 32 countries. Zomato is also one of the few Indian consumer brands to have stepped so far from home, bought out dominant players in other markets, and given global biggies a run for their money .Brands like Titan, Cafe Coffee Day and Hidesign have tried it, but over the years have withdrawn from most global markets. Can Zomato be different? \"Zomato is a great success story the way it has been able to expand all over the globe. I don't recall any other Indian brand which has done such a thing successfully,\" says Arvind Singhal of management consulting firm Technopak. Zomato, which was started as a restaurant listing platform in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah, made its global foray early in 2012 when it began operations in Dubai, and expanded to seven countries, including the UK, South Africa and Sri Lanka, by mid-2013. Goyal and Chaddah came up with the idea for what would become Zomato while working at management consulting firm Bain & Company. They saw colleagues poring over menus every day at lunch, and to save time, scanned cafeteria menus and uploaded them on the company intranet. The success of the idea led them to quit their jobs, borrow from family and friends, and set up Foodiebay with restaurant listings in Delhi NCR. In two years, after they got funding from Info Edge, they renamed the company Zomato, and by 2011, went to Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad. The company now has 2,700 employees worldwide. Since July 2014, Zomato has acquired nine companies in countries as far apart as New Zealand, the Czech Republic, Turkey and the US. The largest of this string of global acquisitions was Seattlebased Urbanspoon, an online food search guide with about 31 million users and a directory of 1 million restaurants, which it bought for $52 million in January 2015. On the company blog, Goyal announced it with \"It might seem crazy but...we just acquired Urbanspoon.\" It wasn't crazy; it was a calculated move to enter the US and counter its biggest competitor Yelp. The deal was one of the largest ever foreign acquisitions by an Indian startup, and pitted Zomato against prominent players in developed markets. Urbanspoon was a dominant player in the US, Canada and Australia, and the buyout also helped Zomato make gains in the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Ireland. Almost overnight, as a graphic on its blog points out, it went from 35 million visitors a month to 80 million. However, Yelp still has more than double the users of Zomato in the US. This is the challenge for Zomato, which is pouring considerable energy and cash into gobbling up the US pie. \"I want the US to be one of our biggest markets and a lot of work is underway. Urbanspoon has given us a strong foothold in the market and we are continuously increasing our user base,\" Goyal told TOI. Goyal and his team have used a canny combination of entering markets solo and acquiring major local players to garner local expertise as well as tech know-how. It not only has a library of menus, lists of restaurants and photos of food, but also adapts content to the local market. In the Czech Republic, which it entered this year, Zomato provides the price of a pint of beer, which to locals is an indicator of how pricey a restaurant is. Writing for Medium, marketing specialist Denis Bravenec said Zomato had beaten Yelp in Czech as the app addressed local needs. \"The quality of reviews and number of locations that are listed on Zomato are superior to those available on Yelp...By displaying tailored suggestions rather than a vanilla search functionality , Zomato is able to demonstrate better local expertise and offer greater value to its users,\" he wrote. Goyal concurs: \"Catering to the specific needs of different countries is what has helped us garner a large number of consumers worldwide.\" Zomato has also been adding new segments, including cashless payment (in Dubai, with plans for other countries where it is allowed), online food orders, last mile delivery, and table reservations. But revenues are lopsided, and overall profitability is a long way off. Around 75% of revenue is generated in India and UAE, the two countries where it is profitable. New Zealand, Philippines and Indonesia are close to making profits, said Goyal. The focus on food delivery could be an attempt to reduce losses as the outlook of investors is changing and they now expect companies to have a shorter timeline to profitability. Yelp's valuation has dropped dramatically in the past year, from close to $6 billion to about $1.7 billion now. The company, which reported revenue of about $400 million for 2014, is now struggling to win advertising revenue in a crowded market. Zomato, with barely $25 million in revenue, was valued at over $700 million in its last round of funding. Till very recently Goyal was not convinced about the idea of getting into food delivery. However, he may have been compelled to review that following the recent downturn in financial markets and the fact that newer, on-demand food ventures like TinyOwl and Swiggy had tanked up with venture money and were con fronting Zomato head on. They not only offered consumers hyper-local discovery but also the option to order at no extra cost. But the problem is, the newer players are cornering this market aggressively. TinyOwl has a significant share in Mumbai and is expanding into major cities. Swiggy, which is in three cities, has been making the right noises, while Foodpanda is Zomato's biggest rival here. All are cash rich TinyOwl raised Rs 100 crore in February; Foodpanda recently acquired Just Eat and TastyKhana for greater reach and serves more than 100 cities. \"Even now Zomato is a reluctant entrant in the delivery space. They do not have a call centre and are not ready to do the heavy lifting, which would mean getting into operations. They've picked up stakes in delivery startups like Pickingo and Grab and tied up with Delhivery to make last-mile deliveries, not wanting to do it themselves,\" says the founder of a rival food-delivery startup. Some investors even question the viability of the delivery model. They say average order sizes need to go up exponentially in India for these platforms to break even. Singhal of Technopak is more optimistic: \"The forward integration into food delivery rather than just providing information will enable Zomato to have a share of the transactions. I expect volumes of such transactions to go up significantly in the near future, which means more revenue for the firm.\" But the biggest worry for Goyal and Chaddah would be the slide in stocks and the rupee, which may impact future funding.\"Without significant funding, will they be able to continue with their aggressive global expansions, or even sustain their existing operations, especially given that large amounts of money will be required to make a success of food delivery in global markets?\" asks an industry analyst who did not want to be named. A lot rests on the answer to that question. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Zomato's,investor,foodiebay,Arvind Singhal  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T04:08:22.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
