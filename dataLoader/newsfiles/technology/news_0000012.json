These new features, combined with dedicated feeds with personalized sports news and commerce launching later this fall, create the ultimate sports hub for fans. “We believe the next great global sports media brand will be one that provides fans a personalized sports experience within editorial content, commerce and social,” said Fancred’s CEO, Hossein Kash Razzaghi. “We started with social and are excited to build on our incredible community by adding live streaming video and scores to the Fancred experience.”\nWith technology changing the sports landscape and over 500 million fans on mobile daily, Fancred seized the opportunity to develop a new way for fans to communicate and consume sports content on one personalized mobile network. Fancred is the only sports app with a live streaming feature native to its product, which opens the door for users to create unique content ranging from “fan reactions” at games to their own post-game analysis as well as discover relevant content from fellow fans and sports personalities. Fancred has been working with regular fans, bloggers, beat reporters, publications, teams and partners to create unique and recurring live five-minute shows available exclusively on Fancred.\nThe live streaming video feature is capped at five minutes and gives content creators carte blanche to stream sports experiences and express their sports takes with the ability to react during the video by switching the camera view. Broadcasters can select people they want to notify about their live streaming video and also share live feeds to Twitter and Facebook. Viewers can upvote and downvote the video content, creating a real-time polling system within the feature. What’s more, publishers can include a link at the end of the video to drive traffic back to their website or related content of their choice.\nTo make Fancred the complete destination for sports fans, the company has also incorporated personalized real-time scores and schedules complete with favorite teams, times and TV channels. In the very near future, Fancred will introduce a custom news feed so fans can read articles and watch videos from their favorite sites, writers and broadcasters. Additionally, the company will add a shopping tab where users can buy sports gear and tickets.\nAbout Fancred\nFounded in 2012, Fancred is evolving from a sports social network into the next global sports media platform for sports fans. It’s a customized mobile sports experience with live streaming video, personalized real-time scores and an active social community. Editorial content and commerce are coming soon.\nFor more information about Fancred, visit http://www.fancred.com and Facebook or follow @fancred on Twitter.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYW5jcmVkLmNvbQ==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9ibmMubHQvbS9hQVRJbnhMdDVt", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vRmFuY3JlZA=="], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T17:49:34.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
