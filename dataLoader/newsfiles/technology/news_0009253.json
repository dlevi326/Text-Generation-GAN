This is a major showcase of what Thailand golf has to offer travelling golfers from all over the globe.\nThe Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) in cooperation with the International Association of Golf Tour Operators (IAGTO) hosted golf tour operators and buyers from key markets worldwide to connect with suppliers from all of Thailand’s golf destinations. The Petchaburi and Prachuap Khirikhan Golf Course Association was another main participant to ensure that local golf courses were high on shopping lists.\nApart from representatives of Thailand golf courses, the buyers came from 29 countries from Europe, Asia and Australia with 146 individual businesses; from Belgium to Bulgaria, from the Netherlands to Norway and from Sri Lanka to Sweden. The Chinese contingency alone consisted of 39 separate business operators. The TAT was well represented with staff representing Thailand tourism from 27 countries worldwide attending as well as local and regional management.\nEstablished in 1997, IAGTO’s membership comprises 2400 accredited golf tour operators, golf resorts, hotels, golf courses, receptive operators, airlines, tourist boards, approved media and business partners in 98 countries including, at its core, 589 specialist golf tour operators in 61 countries.\nIt is estimated that IAGTO’s operators control over 85% of golf holiday packages sold worldwide. “We strive to provide information, create opportunities and make introductions that will help you develop your business faster, with less effort and less cost. Our staff around the world are constantly developing new services for our members to take advantage of. We pride ourselves on being at the heart of the golf tourism industry and invite you to join us.” says Peter Walton, Chief Executive, IAGTO.\nThe 5th Asia Golf Tourism Convention (AGTC) will take place in Chiang Mai from 24-27 April 2016.\nThe AGTC is a premier golf travel event in the Asia Pacific region. It is likely to attract a record number of golf tour operators from around the world, along with golf travel suppliers from every golf destination in the Asia Pacific.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T12:49:27.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
