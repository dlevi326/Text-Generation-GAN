This September, iOS 9 was released.\nEric Risberg In this Sept. 9, 2015 photo, people look over the new Apple iPhone 6s models during a product display following an Apple event in San Francisco. Photography gets even better with Apple's new iPhones, making them worth getting for $100 more than last year's models.(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) One feature on the updated operating system is Wi-Fi Assist, a tool that enables users to maintain the fastest connection possible when using any data related applications or features.\n>> Read more trending stories\nThe feature targets this problem:\nWhen a user connects to a Wi-Fi network that is slow or unresponsive, the cellular device will continue to operate on that slow connection, prolonging apps and webpages from loading and fully developing. Before the update, users had to manually disconnect from a poor network to use their own data and take advantage of a faster connection.\nNow, Wi-Fi Assist automatically disconnects an iPhone from a poor connection and switches to cellular data when data usage proves to be the faster or stronger connection.\nWhat’s good about this feature is that users are saved the frustration of turning on and off their Wi-Fi and having to figure out which connection works fastest.\nWhat’s bad is that users who don’t have unlimited data may overuse their allotted data, resulting in unexpected charges and fees. Plus, without Wi-Fi Assist, users have full knowledge and control of whether they were using his or her own data or utilizing a Wi-Fi connection.\nTurn off Wi-Fi Assist in three easy steps.\n1. Click \"Settings\" on the homescreen of your Apple device.\n2. Click \"Cellular.\"\n3. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and toggle off the Wi-Fi Assist option.\nTrending on Facebook\n10 things to know about the supermoon lunar eclipse Alleged robber picks the wrong teen to mess with Must see: Man ignites gas station trying to kill spider with lighter Woman goes to church, finds out her husband is newly married Woman photographed sitting on sea turtle arrested More popular and trending stories\n</p", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/09/28/3c/32/Wi-Fi_Assist.png", "https://www.facebook.com/CMGNationalNews", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/09/28/90/42/Wi-Fi_Assist_2.png", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/09/28/1e/4f/Wi-Fi_Assist_1.png", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/09/24/58/8f/Digital_Life_Apples_New_iP.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-28T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T04:10:22.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
