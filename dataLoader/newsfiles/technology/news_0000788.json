Pager customers, who pay about $200 per visit and $25 for a phone consultation, will have the delivery fee included in their visit charge. \nZipdrug users place pharmacy orders on their phones and can track a Zipdrug messenger's trip until their medication arrives. The company charges for the cost of medication, plus a $10 fee, and delivers to most areas of Manhattan. The first delivery is free. \nIts messengers can't deliver prescriptions that qualify as controlled substances, and a patient's physician must electronically submit the order to the pharmacy, said Stu Libby, Zipdrug's chief executive and co-founder. \nAlthough the company has plenty of competition from pharmacies that deliver, as well as large mail-order services—such as Express Scripts, CVS Caremark and UnitedHealth Group's OptumRx—Mr. Libby believes the service offers superior convenience when a person needs an order filled quickly and doesn't want to venture out to the corner drugstore. \n\"We're not trying to introduce a new service,\" he said. \"A lot of pharmacies do deliver. We're just trying to make it easier. I like to equate it to ordering a car service before Uber versus ordering a car service with Uber.\" \nPager raised $14 million in Series A funding from investors including Maryland-based New Enterprise Associates and Ashton Kutcher's Sound Ventures in July to expand to San Francisco. It plans to bring Zipdrug's on-demand prescription delivery service with it to California as it ramps up its business in that market in September. \nThe company also said Monday it has introduced an app for the Apple Watch that will dispatch a doctor with a single button tap. \n\"For us, the partnership with Zipdrug is a natural extension of our on-demand approach,\" said Andrew Chomer, Pager's vice president of marketing. \nLanding an agreement with a service like Pager is important for Zipdrug as it seeks exposure and growth. The company, which was founded earlier this year, has partnered with \"dozens\" of medical practices to introduce itself to new patients, Mr. Libby said. \nOne such partner is Dr. Matthew Schulman, an Upper East Side plastic surgeon who started working with Zipdrug in July. He said he often prescribes two to three drugs for each surgerym and he feels the company's service gives his practice an edge. \n\"My practice is high-end,\" he said. \"I have a patient base that I thought would embrace the technology, and I'm always looking for things that can make patients' experience with me better. As of now, I'm thrilled to be the only plastic surgeon in Manhattan who has access to Zipdrug.\" \nMr. Libby declined to disclose how many people had used the service and how many prescriptions it had filled thus far. He said he hopes the service can demonstrate that patients are more likely to take their prescribed medicine when using Zipdrug, preventing costly hospital visits. \n\"If we can prove that same-day delivery of prescription medications can reduce the cost of care on a population, then we're really winning,\" Mr. Libby said. \"That's really the goal here.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T02:48:14.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
