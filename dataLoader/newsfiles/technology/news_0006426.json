Insurers would cover first party and third party claims, loss of business income, notification expenses, crisis management expenses, associated regulatory fines and penalties to the extent insurable by law, as well as direct financial and consequential loss, she said.\nEach underwriter may, however, have different terms and conditions.\nThe Protection of Personal Information Act would revolutionise how organisations manage personal information and data, said Ms Wolman.\nIn 2013 President Jacob Zuma signed the act into law.\nThe law sets the conditions of how any individual who processes personal information must handle, keep and secure it.\nIt requires widespread reforms that the private and public sectors must introduce to ensure personal information and data they collect are protected. It has strict guidelines on what data can be obtained, how it can be used, and kept up to date.\nBusinesses that fail to comply with the act face stiff penalties, including a R10m fine, or prison terms.\nKPMG’s Global CEO Outlook 2015 report shows that although cyber security is one of the five top risks that executives are most concerned about, only 50% of bosses are prepared for a cyber attack.\nThe report explains that cybercrime is an unpredictable risk.\nGreg Bell, KPMG’s US cyber leader, said until recently there had been too much attention focused on prevention, and not enough on protection and response.\nLast week a report by specialist insurer Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty suggested cybercrime cost the SA economy nearly R6bn annually, while $445bn was lost to this activity globally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:53:29.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
