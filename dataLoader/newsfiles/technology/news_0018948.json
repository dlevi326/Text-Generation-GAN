After opening their accounts banks must develop an automated system to transfer worker wages under the WPS said the Ministry. \n\nThis automated system should be such that the labor ministry and the Ministry of Interior should be able to actively monitor and ensure that all WPS-beneficiary workers are paid salaries. The ministries would simply insert a ‘Card Number’ of a company in their computer systems and immediately the screen would show the number of workers in its employ their salaries and whether or not they have been paid. The labor ministry has a dedicated inspection unit only to keep tab on companies and ensure they comply with the WPS. Inspectors rigorously trained in their job would catch violations if any and take the violating company to task. \n\nAll companies must pay their workers through the WPS within seven days of the due date. Delays will be punished and a reconciliation would be possible only if a complainant (worker) takes his complaint of delayed payment back said the Ministry. \n\nNon-compliers can even be prosecuted as per the amendment to the labor law that were carried out this year to help implement the WPS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:09:15.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
