Picture: TREVOR SAMSON Related articles Parliament wrestles with unruly acts EDITORIAL: Malema suspension wrong Malema thrown out of Parliament for calling Ramaphosa a murderer In this article Companies and organisations: Economic Freedom Fighters People: Baleka Mbete | Cyril Ramaphosa | Julius Malema ECONOMIC Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has come out swinging against Parliament’s controversial new rules and has vowed that his party will fight them.\nMr Malema was unceremoniously ejected from the National Assembly last week for calling Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa a \"murderer\". Presiding officer Grace Boroto ordered the EFF leader to withdraw the remark — he not only refused but also repeated the refrain after which she called in Parliament’s new \"bouncers\" to remove him from the chamber.\nThis week Mr Malema said his party had written to parliamentary Speaker Baleka Mbete demanding immediate action against Ms Boroto.\nSpeaking to journalists in Braamfontein, Mr Malema charged that the new rules had been passed irregularly and allowed for MPs to be assaulted.\nHe also called Parliament’s new security recruits \"bouncers\" and \"blood-thirsty apartheid agents\".\nThe EFF leader likened his removal from the National Assembly to an act of mob justice and said the party would fight against what it believed were unjust rules.\n\"Freedom of expression and speech are protected by the Constitution. We will not allow the ruling party to militarise Parliament, and we will forever remind presiding officers that we are not guests of (President Jacob) Zuma and Baleka Mbete, but representatives with maximum freedom of speech,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the EFF’s Constitutional Court quest to get Mr Zuma to \"pay back the money\" — as recommended by Public Protector Thuli Madonsela — for nonsecurity upgrades to his Nkandla homestead is scheduled to be heard on February 9 2016.\nThe party welcomed the court’s decision to hear the matter, and Mr Malema invited Ms Madonsela to join the EFF in its case if she so wished.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:33:26.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
