While most earthquakes are over in under a minute, moonquakes can last for an afternoon. In the 1970s, at least one 5.5-magnitude moonquake shook the lunar surface at full force for more than 10 minutes straight, then tapered off gradually over the course of several hours.\n“The moon was ringing like a bell,” Clive Neal, a geological sciences professor at Notre Dame, told NASA about the Apollo-era lunar seismic data he and his colleagues examined. A strong moonquake would be enough to devastate a hypothetical human settlement—breaching a moon base’s seal and causing a catastrophic loss of oxygen—which is part of why scientists became interested in studying the phenomenon in the first place.\nBeginning in 1972, astronauts left seismic sensors on the moon, where they gathered data for about five years until the network was shutdown amid budgetary concerns in 1977. Still, the sensors transmitted evidence of more than 12,000 moonquakes in the time they were running.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:25:53.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
