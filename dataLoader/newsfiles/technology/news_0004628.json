This moves TheStreet, Inc. towards a consolidated newsroom under a single Editor in Chief, as part of its \"OneStreet\" initiative. Jeff has more than 15 years' experience at The Deal, joining at its inception in 1999. As Editor in Chief of The Deal, Jeff oversees The Daily Deal, a twice-daily digital newspaper covering the day's top M&A stories; Ahead of the News, an exclusive compilation of advance intelligence; and delivering daily exclusives & breaking news alerts across M&A, private equity, activism and restructuring. Under Jeff's leadership, over the past 2 years The Deal staff won SABEW Best-in-Business awards for Digital General Excellence. A lawyer by training, Jeff has been a professional writer and editor since 1983. He entered the industry as a stringer for the Courier-News, a daily newspaper in central New Jersey . As a writer for New Jersey Reporter, a public policy journal based in Princeton , he won several awards for his coverage of state politics and government, and served as a political commentator and advisor for television stations in New Jersey and Philadelphia . He has also covered the courts for Manhattan Lawyer, a unit of American Lawyer Media, worked as a reporter for the New Jersey Law Journal—for which he established \"Appellate Watch\", a column about the state Supreme Court—and was associate editor of the Law Journal, directing some of the paper's signature projects, and assistant managing editor for the New York Law Journal. This move is part of a strategy to integrate and create synergies across TheStreet.com and The Deal's .newsrooms. Select articles from The Deal are published on TheStreet.com, and Jeff has collaborated with TheStreet.com writers and editors from time to time to source and distribute deal news. Bringing the two newsrooms under Jeff's leadership should unlock further efficiencies and increase the flow of original, quality news and content. \"Jeff is exceptionally well qualified for this position. His long-standing experience at The Deal, which successfully transitioned from an advertising to a subscription model, is uniquely suited for TheStreet.com. He is skilled at developing sources and writing stories, which The Deal's lucrative subscribers want to read. His expertise will take TheStreet.com to the next level,\" said Ms. DeMarse. Kanige takes over the role from Janet Guyon, who will pursue opportunities outside of TheStreet. DeMarse remarked, \"Janet has worked tirelessly to improve the relevance of TheStreet.com in today's ever-changing digital media landscape, while significantly boosting quality, traffic and story production. Janet will always be a valued friend of TheStreet.\" As part of the transition, The Deal's managing editor, Anthony Baldo , will assume additional duties in The Deal's day-to-day news operation.
