The unique, new, and easy to identify logo features a phone inside a magnifying glass with a question mark.\n“The new logo better communicates what Check Who Called is,” said Legend’s Gate Media President Scott Rezka. “With more mobile visitors, the addition of the image of a phone inside a magnifying glass with a question mark can be used to easily identify Check Who Called on smaller devices or apps.”\nThe new logo was chosen by running a design contest. The contest ended with over 650 entries from logo designers all over the world. Legend's Gate Media decided on a crowdsourced design because of the wide variety of logos that would be submitted. \"It is great to have many options to choose from. When we picked the new logo, we worked with the designer one-on-one to make it exactly what we wanted,\" said Scott.\nThe \"New Logo $10,000 in Prizes Giveaway\" runs until December 31, 2015 and is open to residents of the United States and Canada.
