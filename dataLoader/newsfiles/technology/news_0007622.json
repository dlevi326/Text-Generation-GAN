September 23, 2015 \nMEMPHIS, Tenn.-- ServiceMaster Global Holdings announced several executive moves designed to help the company pursue new growth opportunities and advance the use of digital and mobile technologies to improve service to the 5 million customers it serves each year. Mark Barry has been promoted to chief marketing and strategy officer. Barry joined ServiceMaster in 2012 as president of its American Home Shield home warranty business and has been serving as group president leading both AHS and the company’s Franchise Services Group. In his new role, Barry will oversee company strategy, including competitive intelligence, insights and analytics, as well as all marketing, pricing and business development. “Mark has done an outstanding job helping AHS achieve strong revenue and earnings growth, while introducing a number of improvements in the company’s digital and service capabilities,” said Rob Gillette, ServiceMaster’s chief executive officer. He noted that under Barry’s leadership, AHS has grown its customer base nearly 15 percent – to 1.5 million, including the 2014 acquisition of Wisconsin-based HSA Home Warranty. “By applying many of the same successful strategies Mark has introduced at AHS,” said Gillette, “we believe there’s a significant opportunity for ServiceMaster to grow by meeting the rising demand for expert help in protecting and maintaining homes and businesses in an increasingly `do-it-for-me’ world.” Replacing Mark as AHS president is Tim Haynes , who has served as ServiceMaster’s senior vice president and chief information officer since 2014 and played an instrumental role in driving many of the technology initiatives that have helped fuel AHS’s growth. Haynes joined ServiceMaster in 2012 as vice president of IT, supporting AHS after spending several years in global roles at Nissan and GMAC. “Tim’s broad knowledge in strategic business and technology planning, global IT systems and project management has helped us begin to leverage technology as an enabler of growth in all of our businesses,” said Gillette. Jamie Smith will replace Haynes as ServiceMaster CIO. He joined AHS as vice president of IT in 2014 after nearly 20 years of experience, including various IT leadership roles at Nissan, IBM and PriceWaterhouseCoopers. “Jamie brings a combination of IT and business experience, with a deep understanding of call center technology, sales, finance and a strong marketing background,” said Gillette. “His expertise will ensure the continued growth of our digital channels and improvement in our customer experience across all of our businesses.” Gillette added: “ServiceMaster has an unmatched network of trusted professionals who perform essential services to protect and maintain 75,000 homes and businesses each day. These organizational changes will strengthen our ability to serve our customers and create more opportunities to serve new ones in an increasingly digital-mobile world.” Related Modern Exterminating Celebrates 60 years of Serving the Midlands September 23, 2015 \nThe South Carolina company was founded in 1955 by the Matthews family, which still owns and operates it today.
