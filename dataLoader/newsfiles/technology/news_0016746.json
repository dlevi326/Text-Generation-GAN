PLEASE DO NOT share, or post the video,\" tweeted Brent Watts, the TV station's meteorologist.\nThat request was retweeted more than 2,000 times in the hours that followed, and the sentiment spread far further.\n\"Please if you see video of the shooting posted on FB or anywhere, take a stand,\" tweeted former professional hockey goalie and NHL coach Corey Hirsch. \"Do not watch or share.\"\nMany Facebook and Twitter users on the West Coast who woke up learn of the story - and of the fact it was captured on video by the gunman - were filled with dread at the idea of its spread, and worried they might not be able to avoid seeing it on their feeds.\nThey were pleasantly surprised at its absence.\n\"I find most people in my feed have spoken against watching the footage,\" said Jessica Ward-Ramirez of Los Angeles.\nAnother user, Corrine Marquez, said via Facebook that it's \"shameful to recirculate the video. I have not seen it nor do I wish to see it. Thankfully, no one on my feed has given the shooter the attention he was seeking.\"\nShe said the only mention she found of the story was one friend declaring that he had deleted another friend who chose to share it.\nAlong with their admonitions, some suggested alternative video and images to share. One popular option was video of the victims' news colleagues paying tribute to them on the air. Another was a joyful selfie taken by the victims.\nIt was far from the first time masses of users avoided recirculating graphic online video. In recent years most have stayed far away from sharing Islamic State militants' beheading videos.\nBut some social media users said they were grateful that there appears to have been a moment of mass restraint.\n\"I don't know if that means there's been a turning point,\" Joseph Vasquez said after seeing a Facebook feed that was free of the video all day. \"I hope so.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
