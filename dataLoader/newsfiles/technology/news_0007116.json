It was expected to land on Japan's main Honshu island on Wednesday. \nJapan's weather agency issued heavy rain and strong wind warnings, with Japan Airlines saying some southwestern regional airports could see delays or cancellations. \nRival All Nippon Airways said its morning flights to and from the central city of Nagoya might be cancelled. \nLast month, powerful typhoon Goni hit the southernmost main island of Kyushu, leaving at least one person missing who was later found dead, more than 70 others injured and disrupting rail and flight services. \nMore than 600,000 people were advised to evacuate ahead of the storm. \nnf/pb/eb", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:41:41.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
