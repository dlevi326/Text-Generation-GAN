The classified material appears in redacted form, occasionally in emails discussing internal operations and personnel.\nState Department spokesman Mark Toner said that all the emails weren't classified when sent but have since been retroactively made classified.\nMrs. Clinton corresponded mostly with a tight-knit circle of State Department aides, along with Mr. Blumenthal who filled her inbox with policy missives, domestic political gossip and information about foreign governments.\nAfter getting an update from Mr. Blumenthal on the British elections in May 2010, Mrs. Clinton sent him a reply that said: \"I shared your emails w Bill who thought they were 'brilliant'!' Keep 'em coming when thou can.\" The email appears to refer to her husband, former President Bill Clinton.\nMr. Blumenthal and Mrs. Clinton exchanged emails about the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court decision that helped reshape the campaign finance landscape, with Mrs. Clinton calling it \"unbelievable.\" Mr. Blumenthal suggested a legislative fix, but Mrs. Clinton said it may take a constitutional amendment.\nWeeks earlier, Mr. Blumenthal said he had a \"eureka idea\" for the midterm elections, which ended with the Democratic loss of control of the House. He also sent a lengthy memo about the state of the Republican Party in 2010, saying it was \"captive to the swamp fevers of the extreme right.\"\nThe emails offer hints to the now-redacted information. In September 2010, Mrs. Clinton asked former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to go to the Middle East in hopes of advancing the peace process.\nAt one point, he emailed her to say that he had an update to offer. \"Ready to speak when convenient but should do it on secure line.\"\nDespite that concern, he continued to email her account with information that was later deemed classified as \"confidential\" and blocked from public release.\nMrs. Clinton and one of her top aides, Jake Sullivan, also sent emails that were redacted as part of the same chain.\nFederal Judge Rudolph Contreras has ordered the State Department to produce monthly releases of the approximately 55,000 pages of emails Mrs. Clinton turned over last year, with the last batch expected in January.\nMrs. Clinton's use of a personal email server at her New York home, which is fueling a congressional probe, befuddled even her agency's digital gurus. In one email, the State Department help desk emails Mrs. Clinton to ask if her account is active. The agency's help desk \"had no idea it was YOU, just some random address so they emailed,\" top aide Huma Abedin explained.\nMrs. Clinton's use of a private server while at the State Department for both government business and personal correspondence has sparked a controversy that has roiled her presidential campaign. Polls show more voters are questioning her honesty and trustworthiness.\nLast week, Mrs. Clinton said it \" clearly wasn't the best choice\" to use her own server, but noted that it was lawful.\n\"My use of personal email was allowed by the State Department. It clearly wasn't the best choice. I should've used two emails: one personal, one for work. And I take responsibility for that decision, and I want to be as transparent as possible,\" she said.\nThe latest set of emails is the fourth release of documents from Mrs. Clinton's time in office from 2009 until 2013. Previously, the State Department released records pertaining to the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, as well as thousands of pages of emails on a range of personal and professional topics.\nThe release of Mrs. Clinton's records has been delayed by a controversy about the presence of classified information on her server—with multiple government agencies seemingly at odds about what should be considered classified.\nTwo inspectors general concluded that Mrs. Clinton's inbox contained material that was classified when it was sent. The Clinton campaign and the State Department acknowledge that much of the material has been retroactively classified but contend that Mrs. Clinton didn't send or receive anything with classification markings.\nMany of the most sensitive and controversial of her emails are being reviewed as part of a multiagency process. State Department officials have noted that such referrals and consultations with other agencies don't mean the emails ultimately will be deemed classified.\nMore than 60 emails containing redacted classified information have been released so far—with additional examples of classification expected in the future.\nSeparately, another 305 emails have been flagged for further review by the five intelligence agencies clearing Mrs. Clinton's emails for public release.\nThe FBI is investigating the presence of classified material on Mrs. Clinton's private server, but Justice Department officials maintain that she isn't the target of the probe.\nMrs. Clinton's campaign has sought to portray the controversy about the presence of classified information in her inbox as a bureaucratic fight between agencies.\n\"When it comes to classified information, the standards are not at all black and white,\" Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said this month.\n\"In the absence of markings that officially designate something classified, reasonable people each taking their responsibility extremely seriously can nonetheless disagree on the character of the information they're dealing with,\" Mr. Fallon said during a conference call with reporters.\nFelicia Schwartz and Gary Fields contributed to this article.\nWrite to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com\nSeptember 01, 2015 02:55 ET (06:55 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:50:28.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
