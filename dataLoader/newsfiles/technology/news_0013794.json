In a South African context this proverb is extricably linked to the value or principle of “Ubuntu”. People have different interpretations of this value but the key message to take from this value is that no one is an island and we should care for the welfare of others like we do for ourselves. Surely if it takes a village to raise a child the obvious implication is that the success of the child depends on the community. Nowhere is this more important than in education.\nChallenges\nIt has been widely written that parent and community involvement in rural schools is poor and sometimes only limited to their roles in School Governing Bodies (SBG). In same vein, it has been widely written that parental involvement in more affluent schools in high and the success of these learners is linked directly to the involvement of their parents. There is still a big misconception amongst some parents especially in rural communities that education is the responsibility of the school and the government.\nThis is very far from the truth, in fact, literature suggests that parents play a very crucial role in their children’s education. A study by Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler (1995) found that effectively engaging parents in the education of their children has positive influence on the success of the learner. Pitt et al (2013) argue that parents are key parts of the immediate ‘eco-system’ of a child, and are critical in a healthy development of the child, including the functioning and progress of the child.\nHowever, it has also been found that parents at times are not necessarily aware or equipped to support and deal with challenges faced by their children. At times the reasons for poor parental involvement are linked to the inability of the school to effectively manage communication with parents. School personnel often tend to see education from an in-ward looking perspective and do not see education as extending to the larger community. These are just a few of many challenges relating to parent and community involvement that confront the education system.\nWhat is currently being done?\nThe Department of Basic Education (DBE) has initiated a number of programmes to train SGB`s and parents on aspects relating to effective governance and school management as well providing support to learners at home. Despite these interventions parent and community involvement in the schooling system remains a challenge. In order to achieve quality teaching and learning in schools and to improve performance of the schooling system as a whole there has to be more parent and community involvement. Providing a good education for learners is not the responsibility of the government alone, parents and communities need to take responsibility especially for factors outside the control of the immediate school environment.\nWhat needs to be done?\nThe education system needs more parents who are willing make time to attend SGB and parent meetings. Activities such as volunteering to clean up the schools yard, painting walls, fixing broken windows and ceilings and proving locally available skills which can be used to support teachers and learners can go a long way in improving the morale and image of the school. When communities get involved in school related activities they tend to understand the importance of why their children should attend school, they also take more ownership of the school and will go to great lengths to protect “their” schools against criminality and community protests.\nAs the end year exams begin, parents and communities are encouraged to support learners and local schools to improve education outcomes. Parents have to realise that when learners perform, it is not only the school that benefits but the community as whole. At the end of the day it is the responsibility of the community to raise these children.\nOn behalf of Khaya Tyatya", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T20:04:40.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
