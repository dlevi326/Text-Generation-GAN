By Michael Hart 09/17/15 \nThe Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching will use XanEdu 's cloud-based mobile content customization and delivery platform to distribute its developmental math programs to more instructors. \nOfficials at both Carnegie and XanEdu say using the platform will allow more instructors to customize content and deliver the foundation's Statway and Quantway courses to more students. Carnegie began offering the mathematics \"pathways\" in 2010 when it initiated a network of faculty members, researchers, designers, students and content experts to create the new system to help students with developmental math. \nStatway focuses on statistics, data analysis and casual reasoning while Quantway explores quantitative reasoning. \n\"Statway and Quantway have already helped thousands of students at over 50 institutions across the country,\" said Community College Pathways Executive Director Karon Klipple. \"Now, as we aim to bring this opportunity to tens and hundreds of thousands more students, we were seeking a highly professional partner that understands the higher education space.\" About the Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T06:26:28.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
