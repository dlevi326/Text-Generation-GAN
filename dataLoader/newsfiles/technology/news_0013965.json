He had held direct and indirect interest of 16.38-million shares as of March 2014, according to the previous year’s publication. The difference between the two holdings is valued at about R20.4bn at current prices.\nMr Bekker stepped down as CEO in April 2014 to take a year-long break before becoming chairman earlier this year. Under his leadership, the newspaper publisher grew into the biggest emerging market media company, owning Africa’s largest pay-TV network and stakes in Hong Kong-based Tencent Holdings and Mail.ru Group of Russia.\nNaspers has complied with disclosure rules as Bekker didn’t hold a position at the company when he exercised his options, according to Meloy Horn, Naspers’ head of investor relations. The company had no obligation to issue a stock exchange announcement, she said in an e-mailed response to questions.\n\"He remains a top 20 shareholder in the company,\" Ms Horn said. \"Upon retiring as CEO last year, Koos exercised these options and raised cash.\"\nMr Bekker, 62, said in an e-mailed response that a local media report had failed to distinguish between options and shares, declining to comment further.\nJohannesburg’s Talk702 reported on Thursday that Mr Bekker had exercised share options.\nShares of Naspers declined 0.4% to R1,739 at 10.16am.\nMr Bekker had 11.7-million vested share options in March 2014, disclosed in the annual report as a direct interest, according to Ms Horn.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:34:05.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
