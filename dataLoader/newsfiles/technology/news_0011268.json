Classic Shell displays limited settings by default and the first thing you need to do is check the \"show all settings\" box at the top to display them all. This adds numerous tabs to the program, among them \"Windows 10 Settings\" which you need to click on to proceed. There you find listed the \"customize taskbar\" preference. Enable it, and switch to transparent as the main look for the taskbar. Once you have made the change, modify the taskbar opacity value and set it to 0 (meaning fully transparent). When you are done, click ok to apply the changes. \nThe taskbar should become transparent right away so that only its icons are displayed. You may play around with the opacity level, or switch it to glass or opaque to see how they look like. The taskbar color setting does nothing if you have set it to be transparent with an opacity of 0. \nClosing Words \nI think this looks pretty nice, especially if backed up by a nice wallpaper that is set to fit on the screen. \nThis is different from the transparency setting that you find under Personalization in the Windows 10 Settings. While you can set Start, taskbar, and Action center to transparent, it won't make it fully transparent if you enable that option there. \nClassic Shell does that and since it provides lots of other features that you may find useful, you may want to give it a try if you have not done so already. Summary Classic Shell supports 100% transparent taskbars now on Windows 10 Author Martin Brinkmann Description Find out how to make the taskbar in Windows 10 transparent with an opacity level of 0 so that only icons and interface elements are shown.
