That demonstrates how producers are making more efforts to cut back supply following the downturn in prices.\n\"The incipient decline of production in the US in particular will herald in a long-term and fundamental bottoming out process on the oil market,\" analysts at Commerzbank wrote in a report.\nBrent crude, the global oil benchmark, rose 1.5 per cent to $US48.97 a barrel on London's ICE Futures exchange. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures were trading up 1.7 per cent at $US45.42 a barrel.\nThe oil rig count -- a rough proxy for activity in the industry -- is closely watched by market participants, given the importance of US supply to global oil balances. The global glut of crude, which drove prices off a cliff last year, was largely fueled by the booming US shale industry.\nLast week, the US oil-rig count fell by eight to 644, Baker Hughes said. There are about 60 per cent fewer rigs working since a peak of 1,609 reached last October.\nThe fall in the rig count has translated into a decrease in US oil output. According to official data, US production peaked in April at more than 9.6 million barrels a day -- a multidecade high -- and has fallen to below 9.2 million barrels a day since then.\n\"The low oil prices are taking their toll, the main shale oil producing regions in particular likely to suffer lasting damage,\" Commerzbank said. The bank estimates that the decrease in US production will pick up pace in the near future as oil producers find it difficult to finance their operations in the current weak environment.\nDespite signs of falling supply, prices remain stuck in their recent ranges, with Brent struggling to break through the psychologically important $US50 level.\nWhile US output has decreased, other major suppliers around the globe, including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, have kept pumping oil at a high pace in a bid to gain market share.\nOil is also dependent on developments in the financial markets with the recent turmoil in China, the world's second largest oil consumer, casting a shadow over the prospects for a demand-led recovery.\n\"If there is any hope for price floor and recovery from the current levels, it has to be on the back of stronger demand and macroeconomic environment,\" analysts at broker Marex Spectron, said in a note.\nNymex reformulated gasoline blendstock -- the benchmark gasoline contract -- rose 1.4 per cent to $US1.51 a gallon. ICE gasoil changed hands at $US465 a metric ton, up $US1.75 from the previous settlement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:12:47.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
