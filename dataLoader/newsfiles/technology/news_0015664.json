Understanding the options is the first step to selecting the ideal Internet connection for a company's needs. T1 and cable Internet are two popular choices.\nMost likely everyone is familiar with cable Internet, but the nuances of T1 may be eluding. Here’s what everyone needs to know about T1.\nT1 lines are reserved circuits that work over copper or fiber optic cables. Anyone can lease a dedicated T1 line. A T1 line plugs into the network’s router and has 24 channels. Each channel is capable of a maximum speed of 64Kbs. That means everyone can expect T1 bandwidth ( http://t1closer.net/ ) to carry data at 1.5 Mbps (upload and download). A T3 line is faster, at about 43 megabits per second.\nA significant advantage of T1 Internet over cable is its reliability and stable source of bandwidth. In fact, T1 Internet is often accompanied by a service level agreement (SLA) that guarantees performance levels, and “up times” of 99.9 percent. Because T1 works through a dedicated circuit, there won’t be competition with other Internet customers for bandwidth like with cable. Everyone will have total access to bandwidth, and that means speed a business can count on.\nRegardless of what cable Internet speed you sign up for with a cable provider, the Internet speed realized will depend on the usage of the neighbors. That’s because unlike T1 where everyone enjoys a dedicated line, with cable, bandwidth is shared with other users in a community. Cable also has a reputation for being less dependable than T1. These are two potential drawbacks to cable, but there are many benefits to cable Internet as well.\nPrice is a significant one. The cost of cable Internet ranges from about $30 to $100 per month depending on a number of factors (speed being the most important one). Even at the high-end, that’s much less than anyone will pay for T1 bandwidth ( http://voicet1.com/ ), which starts at about $250 per month and can be as much as $1200 per month. Many cable Internet providers have developed bundles to meet the unique needs of small business, and bundling cable Internet with other services, like phone, can reduce everyone's bill further, plus streamline bill paying.\nAbout Solveforce T1 Bandwidth\nT1prices.org is managed by SolveForce, a T1 Bandwidth ( http://t1prices.org/ ) Agency that offers its consulting services in the Ohio Region and has been providing business solutions since 2004.
