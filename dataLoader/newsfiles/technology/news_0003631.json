According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, dozens of African-American employees who were discriminated against because of criminal background checks, would be given job opportunities at the companyâ€™s plant in Greer, South Carolina where the lawsuit originated. When a new contractor took over the company, BMW ordered a new round of criminal background checks and fired anyone with a criminal record from any year. Of the 88 workers who were fired as a result of the new background checks, 70 were African-American, some of whom had been with the company for more than a decade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T09:40:01.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
