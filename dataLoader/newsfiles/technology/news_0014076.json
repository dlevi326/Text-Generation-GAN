DISH is actively working to reach a deal before the contract expires. We have offered a contract extension to TEGNA, including a retroactive 'true up' when new rates are agreed upon, to keep the channels available to customers in the event that we are unable to reach a deal by the deadline,\" explained Warren Schlichting, DISH senior vice president of programming. \"Since we offered to retroactively true them up when new rates were agreed upon, TEGNA has nothing to lose and consumers have everything to gain from an extension of our existing contract that would allow negotiations to continue.\" \nTEGNA was singularly unimpressed with the offer. It has so far declined to make any comment on the ongoing negotiations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T14:45:07.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
