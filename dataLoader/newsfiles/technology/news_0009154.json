AeroTurbine to use Amber Road for partner screening The global aviation company has more than 20,000 partners and decided it needed to upgrade its restricted party screening process to reflect a much more complex regulatory environment. By Eric Johnson | Tuesday, September 22, 2015 The global aviation company AeroTurbine will begin using the global trade management solutions provider Amber Road to automate its restricted party screening process, the software provider said Tuesday. AeroTurbine specializes in supply chain management solutions, the sale and lease of aftermarket commercial engines, aircraft and parts, technical advisory services and aircraft maintenance to its global customers. The company has 20,000 business partners globally, including customers, suppliers, maintenance repair and overhaul organizations (MROs), and freight forwarders. “The international compliance environment has become exponentially more complex in recent years, and it was time to align our screening processes,” said Amanda Cutler, AeroTurbine’s chief legal officer. Cutler said the company plans to use Amber Road’s software-as-a-service restricted party screening solution to perform batch uploads of partners to be screened. The solutions offers “a single point of access to comprehensive information in the event of a hit, and automatically monitors all our business partners against changes in any of the lists. We will be better protected, with less effort.” The scalable nature of the solution will allow AeroTurbine the option to activate additional trade management functionality available through Amber Road’s Export On-Demand solution, which encompasses the restricted party screening solution. The Export On-Demand solution is already in use at AeroTurbine’s parent company, AerCap.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T04:33:10.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
