Often these comments that we see relate to what we have read on news outlets such as News24.\nOf course it is quite refreshing to hear what people have to say. Sometimes we go through the comments section on Facebook just to see people's reactions to particular issues. News24 however, is not Facebook.\nThis news agency has been fantastic with delivering news that are important to people from different walks of life. But even if we broadly look at news on TV, people are not given a platform to response to the broadcaster or the news reader. In many cases, they consult their social networks to vent out whatever they hold within them. Therefore, News24's decision to remove the comments section is viable. I have actually found myself looking forward to read the comments section that the news. I guess one of the reasons why I would do that is because people's comments are often far more interesting. But sometimes they are discriminatory, bigot and are actually evil in nature. I think we often underestimate the power of our words.\nWith that being said, I want to argue that News24 is not Facebook or twitter. It is not a platform for sharing our opinions or reacting to information. Those kind of platforms are already there. Take Facebook for example. Over the years, they have monitored what people have been posting and commenting since their inception. As a result, Facebook has changed immensely and it has options that enable people to report on things they feel offended by.\nNews24 does not have that capacity. Instead of the News Editor focusing on what is being published, he's no compelled to also look at what people are saying about the agency's publications. Of which is not fair.\nIf one looks at the comments section on News24, people talk all sorts of rubbish. And some have been very racist, especially with what has been going on in terms of transformation in South Africa. People can comment on the news we get from News24 on other platforms as they already exist.\nThe decision to remove the comments section is therefore sensible and is probably the best decision made in this regard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T12:07:49.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
