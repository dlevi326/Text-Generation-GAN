The UK-based 3D printing bureau will be returning to the leading industry event to exhibit its Machining and Fabrication of plastics for the first time. \nBringing over 40 years of experience including 12 years in the 3D printing industry, IPF provides extensive prototyping capabilities to a range of customers with its in-house technologies. The service provider has a long-standing close relationship with additive manufacturing leader Stratasys and currently holds the largest overall capacity of Polyjet 3D printers in the UK. \nAt this years show, IPF will demonstrate what can be achieved using its range of Polyjet and FDM technology, including the Stratasys Connex3, multi-material 3D Printer. This innovative Polyjet technology creates brilliantly coloured prototypes with a range of multi-material components including; Rigid and flexible, clear and durable. IPF has access to thousands of colour variations including lifelike colours, and a wide range of shore hardnesses. \nNew to the stand at TCT will be a range of 3D printed prototypes in IPF’s newest FDM material options, Ultem and Nylon 12. Ultem is a thermoplastic material ideal for aerospace, automotive and military applications and can be used in the production of end-use parts. Nylon 12 can be used to create advanced prototypes and custom tooling for applications that demand superior fatigue resistance, particularly in the manufacture of jigs, fixtures, factory tooling and functional prototypes. \nVisit IPF on stand F19 at the TCT Show + Personalize 2015 which takes place on 30 th September – 1 st October, at NEC, Birmingham.
