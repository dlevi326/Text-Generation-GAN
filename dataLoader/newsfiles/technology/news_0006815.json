This marks the seventh region to approve the Company’s core patent, as Europe joins the U.S., Russia, China, Canada, Japan, and Hong Kong. \nThe patent concerns methods in optimizing LED (light emitting diode) lighting for plants as well as to make working processes more efficient in greenhouse environments of the future. Heliospectra’s core technology involves systems for quality control and light optimization in greenhouses based on the different qualities of plants. One result is that the appearance, color and taste of the final product can be influenced. Produce can be grown with greater quality yet with lower energy consumption and a simple adaptation of optimum lighting for different types of greenhouses in different environments. This innovation provides growers with a tool for creating new opportunities to offer a broader and better selection of produce available much closer to their markets. \nWhat makes Heliospectra technology unique is that based on Internet of Things ( IoT ) technology, it combines sensors – which monitor the condition of plants and how they use the light – with state-of-the-art software that controls the lighting. This complete biofeedback system is protected by a portfolio of patents and patents pending. \nHeliospectra’s premier product is its patented, energy-efficient LX60 Series LED system. The LX60 is the most sophisticated, modular LED lamp available for commercial and R&D grow operations worldwide. The LX60 is wi-fi enabled, allowing for online monitoring, scheduling and control. Among other features, external sensors and software can be added to the system. \nAbout Heliospectra AB \nHeliospectra AB ( OTCQB: HLSPY , FIRSTNORTH: HELIO) (www.heliospectra.com) specializes in intelligent lighting technology for plant research and greenhouse cultivation. The Company’s lighting system provides an effective and durable technology for cultivating greenhouse and indoor plants by combining several different groups of versatile light emitting diodes (LEDs) with optics, remote sensing techniques, and a robust heat dissipation solution. This proprietary setup gives growers the ability to control the intensity and wavelengths of the light emitted, creating a spectrum specifically adjusted to different plant species and growth stages to better facilitate photosynthesis. The complete, highly-engineered lamp produces crops that look better, taste better, and have a longer shelf-life than those grown under HID lamps. The technology not only reduces energy consumption by up to 50%, but also helps stimulate growth characteristics and improve plant quality. Other benefits include reduced light pollution, lower mercury use due to the avoidance of traditional HID/HPS bulbs, and less HVAC investment and monthly expense requirements. \nHeliospectra products are based on in-depth knowledge in plant physiology and photosynthesis along with a unique way to utilize modern LED technology. After six years of development in Sweden, the company has now begun to expand into the international market. The company has raised more than $ 18 million in capital and has received more than $2.6 million through academic scholarships and grants. It has also received numerous awards for its forward thinking technology.
