(Source: Lantus/Wikimedia Commons) \n(RNN) - Countries that have invested heavily in educational technology in classrooms have not seen measurable returns in test scores, according to a global study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \nThough some OECD countries have invested heavily in technology, a study by the organization shows that information and communication technologies have not led to improved performances in reading, mathematics or science. \nThe study, which took measures to account for social background and student demographics, showed that students who used computers at school “very frequently” performed much worse than students who used them moderately. \nHowever, those students who used computers moderately at school did “tend to have somewhat better learning outcomes than students who use computers rarely.” \nAndreas Schleicher, the OECD’s director for education and skills, said that effectively integrating technology was the key to unlocking its potential in a classroom setting. \n“Technology is the only way to dramatically expand access to knowledge,” he said. “To deliver on the promises technology holds, countries need to invest more effectively and ensure that teachers are at the forefront of designing and implementing this change.” \nSchleicher told BBC that the findings of the report should not discourage technology use. Instead, he said the study should inspire the quest for more effective approaches. As far as socioeconomic data is concerned, Schleicher told BBC that the divide socioeconomic divide between students is not “narrowed by technology” but “perhaps even amplified.” \nIn the study, the gap between disadvantaged and advantaged students in digital reading was comparable to the gaps between students in traditional reading tests. The report concludes that improving equity in education is the first necessary step for bridging the gap between students and creating equal opportunity, not introducing technology. \nIn a test of digital reading, the same school systems that performed well in a 2012 print-reading test scored highest. According to the study, the results suggest “that many of the skills essential for online navigation can also be taught and learned using standard, analogue reading techniques.” \nAccording to the OECD’s data, some of the best-performing education systems allowed less access to technology - and the internet in particular - in the classroom. \nStudents in schools in China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan all spent less time online during school hours, and, subsequently, performed better in testing. \nSouth Korea, Japan and China additionally ranked in the lowest percentage of students using information or communication technologies at school. \nThe study concedes that the use of computers does not seem to be the ultimate deciding factor in a students’ success, but countries that invested heavily in educational technology did not see measurable advancement. \nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
