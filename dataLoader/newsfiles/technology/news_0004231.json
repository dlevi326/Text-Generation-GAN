This technology can compensate for the mistakes every driver makes because the systems are always on alert, monitoring the road ahead and never getting tired or distracted.\" \nLund said several studies including one from the institute shows the auto-braking technology can reduce insurance injury claims by as much as 35 percent. \nThe announcement did not include a specific timetable for deployment of the new systems. Transportation officials said they would be urging the other carmakers to join the pledge to make the technology standard as soon as possible. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T00:35:41.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
