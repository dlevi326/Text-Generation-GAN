The most commonly reported privacy failures are: Lack of training or poor training Data breach/leakage Not performing a risk assessment \nHowever, the survey also identified some bright spots. More than 9 in 10 organizations have assigned someone to be accountable for privacy, and the primary positions given this responsibility are CISOs and chief privacy officers (CPOs) who report directly to the CEO. Additionally, the majority (76 percent) of organizations provide privacy awareness training to staff. \n“Organizations with effective privacy programs understand that these programs begin with a system of governance and management, and are supported by a team with defined privacy responsibilities,” said Yves Le Roux, chair of ISACA’s Privacy Working Group, principal consultant of CA Technologies. \nFor full results, visit www.isaca.org/2015-privacy-survey-report . \nISACA will use the survey data to help create additional privacy guidance, including a set of guiding principles in 2016. \nISACA \nISACA ® (isaca.org) helps global professionals lead, adapt and assure trust in an evolving digital world by offering innovative knowledge, standards, networking, credentialing and career development.
