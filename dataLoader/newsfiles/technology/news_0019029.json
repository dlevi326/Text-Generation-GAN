It doesn't expect to change the way it gives guidance.\nAmazon, a strong contender in the cloud computing market, broke out financial details of its surging Amazon Web Services business for the first time in April.\nIntel announced the new Client Computing Group earlier this year, which would cover chips for desktops, smartphones and other mobile devices. Last year the company said it would disclose numbers for its budding Internet of Things business, which deals with connecting devices to the Internet.\nMicrosoft shares closed little changed at US$43.44 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. They have slipped 7 percent this year, compared with a 10 percent fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index .\n(Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-09-30T12:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T07:32:03.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
