Financial terms were not disclosed.\nUntil recently, whole genome sequencing - which maps all of an individual's 20,500 genes - was prohibitively expensive, costing about $20,000 just five years ago. As of last year, the average cost of whole genome sequencing fell to $1,500.\nWhole exome sequencing costs range from $400 to $1,500, plus extra charges for analyzing the results.\nFor insurance company Discovery, exome sequencing will be offered through a behavioral wellness program that provides clients with tools and incentives to make lifestyle changes to help them stay healthy.\nDiscovery clients who choose exome screening will receive a comprehensive report detailing their risks for specific diseases and potential strategies to modify those risks. Discovery will provide the reports to clients through a network of physicians and genetic counselors.\nVenter's company, which is based in San Diego, will receive de-identified data from participating Discovery clients, which it will use to build its library of genetic and health information. Such data is becoming highly prized by pharmaceutical companies as a faster means of drug research.\nLast January, Human Longevity signed a multiyear deal to sequence and analyze tens of thousands of genomes for Roche Holding's ( ROG.VX ) Genentech unit in an effort aimed at identifying new drug targets and biomarkers.\n(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:20:20.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
