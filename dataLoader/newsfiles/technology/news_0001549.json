(NYSE:PGND), today announced enhancements to its Transparency Solution, a comprehensive program designed to deliver objective and reliable measures of provider performance to health care consumers. \nThe Transparency Solution’s new features include a smart algorithm with built-in alerts that screen comments to detect personal health information (PHI). The enhancement also offers clients the ability easily search, sort, filter and remove inappropriate content such as patient names, contact information or obscenities, while preserving the integrity of the overall comment. Press Ganey expects this will significantly reduce the client’s manual comment review process. \nAdditional features of Press Ganey’s transparency algorithm include: Ready-made data file that allows organizations to easily post physician star ratings and comment data online with flexibility for in-house use or in collaboration with third-party provider directory vendors. Additional “Safeguards” to help ensure every patient rating is counted when calculating physician scores for clients’ web sites and that comments are not unfairly manipulated or omitted (exceptions for PHI/inappropriate content). Comment archive that enables organizations to view previously exported or excluded comments. \n“Thorough review of all patient experience data is an integral element to a successful transparency program,” said Patty Riskind, Chief Client Experience Officer at Press Ganey. “To provide true transparency, Press Ganey advocates that all patient comments are posted, which requires careful screening to remove only PHI and inappropriate content. We believe the new features of our Transparency Solution and Seal of Integrity demonstrate our commitment to helping organizations provide an objective review of the provider experience, increase physician accountability and drive performance improvement.” \nIn addition to introducing new program enhancements, Press Ganey will continue to deliver on its transparency initiative by awarding its Seal of Integrity to those organizations that meet rigorous standards for including every survey result and patient comment. Press Ganey believes this certification willassure providers, physicians and patients that all data are objectively represented. \nFor more information, please visit Press Ganey’s website . \nAbout Press Ganey \nPress Ganey Holdings (NYSE: PGND) is a leading provider of patient experience measurement, performance analytics and strategic advisory solutions for health care organizations across the continuum of care.
