The court also invited Mas, who supports the region's independence, for questioning on October 15.\nMas had wanted to hold an official referendum on Catalonia's independence on November 9, but it was blocked by Spain's Constitutional Court. Instead, he organised a non-binding vote. It was also declared illegal by the judges, but it was held anyway.\nProsecutors accused Mas of failing to follow a court order, abuse of office and improper use of government money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T22:04:33.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
