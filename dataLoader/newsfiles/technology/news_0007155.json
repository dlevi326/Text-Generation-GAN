The authors found that current conservation prioritizations do not correspond to their projected estimates of climate sensitivities. \nThe authors suggest that these results demonstrate the need to include climate sensitives into current conservation planning and to develop adaptive management strategies that accommodate shrinking and shifting geographic ranges. \n\"We were shocked to find that half of the bird species in North America are threatened with climate disruption,\" says Gary Langham, Chief Scientist at National Audubon. \"Knowing which species are most vulnerable allows us to monitor them carefully, ask new questions, and take action to help avert the worst impacts for birds and people.\" \nThe study was published in PLOS ONE by Gary Langham and colleagues from the National Audubon Society .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:41:55.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
