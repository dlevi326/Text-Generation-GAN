But its significance as a breakthrough model that is pushing the boundaries of both performance and fuel-efficiency is dramatic.\" \nThe four-wheel drive P85D, which is a modified version of the Tesla S sedan, will cost upwards of $125,000 with typical equipment, Consumer Reports noted. \nBut the group said the breakthroughs suggest positive things for the sector, with Tesla due to introduce its Model X crossover in 2016, followed in 2018 by a \"more attainable compact sedan,\" the Model 3, estimated to start at about $35,000. \nConsumer Reports gave the P85D a 100/100 rating, topping the 99/100 rating of the Tesla S two years ago. \nRechtin said the vehicle \"initially scored 103 in the Consumer Reports' Ratings system, which by definition doesn't go past 100... so we had to make changes to our scoring to account for it.\" \nThe new vehicle was impressive in energy efficiency, safety and performance, the group found. \n\"The P85D is brutally quick, with instant acceleration,\" Rechtin wrote, noting that it could reach 60 miles (100 kilometers) per hour in 3.5 seconds. \n\"The car's thrust is forceful and immediate. Its near-instant g-forces can otherwise be achieved only by leaping off a building-literally. \nThe acceleration \"makes it frighteningly eerie in its silent velocity. It's so explosively quick that Tesla has created an 'insane' driving mode.\" \nTesla shares jumped eight percent in midday trade to $243.01, extending the spectacular market performance of the carmaker, which produces only a small number of coveted vehicles. \nEarlier this month, Tesla reported a quarter loss of $184 million as the electric carmaker geared up for expansion. \nTesla plans to invest about $1.5 billion this year to expand production capacity, construct its huge \"Gigafactory\" for batteries and expand its network of charging stations. \nTesla is also gearing up for a new project to adapt car batteries to store power in homes and businesses. \njld-rl/sst", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:02:40.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
