Yes police! Make that “only” police 'cause you gotta be a cop to cop a built-in touchscreen this big. Currently, Dodge offers law enforcement types a piddling 5-inch dashboard touchscreen that hardly takes the place of conventionally mounted front-seat laptop computers. An in-dash touchscreen saves space and improves both visibility and functionality. The latter is laptop-quality due to an ethernet cable connecting the screen to an actual laptop stowed safely away in the Charger Pursuit's trunk. As mentioned, the jumbo touchscreen is only available to police fleet buyers of the new Charger Pursuit. The boys (and girls) in blue also get to check a V8 engine, all-wheel drive, and a steering column transmission shifter in addition to the usual PD goodies like spotlights, light bars, sirens and stain-resistant rear seat upholstery. Non-police types can only gaze on in envy, at least until sometime in the farther future when today's rock star cop cars hit the resale market as beaten-down paddy-wagons. Don't hold your breath: police-issue or not, high-tech tools may not have what it takes to survive years of heavy-duty use at the hands of today's trained crimefighters. FCA takes police fleet sales very seriously, as do all the major automakers, and competition is stiff. In 2014 alone, police forces across the country purchased over 10,000 specially-equipped Dodge Charger Pursuit squad cars. Thanks to the new 12.1-inch Uconnect touchscreen, that number will likely rise.
