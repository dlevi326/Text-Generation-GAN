From models wearing Google Glass in Diane von Furstenberg's New York Fashion Week show in 2012 , to Diesel Black Gold developing bespoke versions of Samsung's Gear S smartwatch for its own NYFW show last year, designers are increasingly looking for ways to incorporate high-tech elements into their collections. \nNow British designer Henry Holland has teamed up with Visa Europe to combine fashion, wearable technology and payments for the first time. At his London Fashion Week show on 19 September , he demonstrated how a tiny NFC chip embedded in a ring – similar to those used in contacless debit cards – could be used to purchase items directly from the runway. \nSpecially designed rings in the shape of bugs were allocated to 10 VIPs at the show, including models Alexa Chung and Daisy Lowe. The rings contained NFC chips and were pre-loaded with £500 credit. At the end of the show, the VIPs were able to walk up to one of three models and touch their ring to a giant brooch in the shape of a leaf, in order to purchase one of the items they were wearing. The brooch lit up to show that the transaction had been made. \nAbove: Alexa Chung buys a striped crop top durectly from the catwalk \n\"A really big thing for me was making the tech invisible, especially if I’m incorporating it into something as important as my show. From my point of view it was really about creating two items – the ring and the brooch – that were really desirable pieces that people would want to wear themselves, but just happened to have those capabilities,\" Mr Holland told The Telegraph . \nThe NFC devices were designed to fit in with the overall \"Urban Safari\" theme of the show, which was inspired by Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , and featured patchwork safari jackets, leopard prints and feathered shoes, as well as bug and leaf accessories. \nAbove: Insect designs figured prominently in House of Holland's Spring/Summer collection \n\"The brooches appear throughout the collection in different forms, and the enamel bugs also appear as earrings and on zip pulls. Some of them are NFC-enabled and others aren’t, so as you watch the show, you don't to realise which are the NFC elements. I think that's a really great approach, because it makes people understand a bit more how fashion and tech can come together.\" \nHouse of Holland worked with Visa Europe's innovation hub, Visa Europe Collab , to develop the technology as part of a 100-day \"sprint\". The NFC brooches were linked to virtualised payment terminals via Bluetooth Smart technology, allowing Visa to process the transactions in the background as the show went on. \nAccording to Jon Downing, innovation partner for emerging payments at Visa Europe Collab, the idea was to develop a proof-of-concept that could pave the way for new retail experiences in the future. \nAbove: Insect rings with embedded NFC technology \n\"We believe we’ve come up with a vision for the future of how payments could work which really gives some excitement and connection between somebody who’s trying to buy a product with the product they’re trying to buy,\" he said. \n\"What we’re demonstrating here is this real-time experience of seeing an item you love, going up and connecting with that item. Through choosing, you have actually made the purchase, and then it will actually be given to you at the event.\" \nHe added that, one day, a similar process could be used to allow people to buy items in high-end fashion boutiques. The rings could also be linked direcly to people's bank accounts, rather than having to be pre-loaded with cash. \nHowever, for now, the aim is to see how people respond to the concept, and to start testing some of the newer, more advanced technologies that could help scale it up in the future. \nAbove: Henry Holland backstage at London Fashion Week \n\"This season, the real focus for Fashion Weeks around the world is about making sure that they incorporate a consumer experience, because the explosion of social media means that fashion shows are no longer a closed event,\" said Mr Holland. \n\"The minute the first look goes out, everybody on Instagram can see it, and everybody on Instagram wants it, so somebody needs to work out how we get that product out there at the same time.\" \nWhen House of Holland launched its menswear collection earlier this year, the entire collection was available for sale the moment the show started – a response to what Mr Holland described as the \"see now, want now, buy now\" culture.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T16:00:36.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
