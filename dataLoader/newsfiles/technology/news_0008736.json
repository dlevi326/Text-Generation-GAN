The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) however, just published new editions of two standards for power distribution and transmission—areas critical to public safety and business continuity. \nBy way of context, the Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) is published in several parts. Part I is the safety standard for electrical installations. Part II is a collection of several hundred individual standards for the evaluation of electrical equipment used in installations as well as consumer, commercial and industrial products. (Part I requires electrical products to be approved to a Part II standard). \nPart III is a collection of standards for power distribution and transmission systems. Part IV is a set of objective-based standards that may be used in certain industrial or institutional installations. Part VI establishes standards for the electrical inspection of existing residential buildings. \nThe two new editions of Part III standards pertain to electrical protection, safety and design criteria for both overhead and underground systems for distribution and transmission. \n“The Canadian Electrical Code Part III specifies minimum requirements for electricity supply and telecommunication systems in support of public safety and reliability of service,” said John O’Neill, senior project manager for electrical standards with CSA Group. \n“The CEC III consists of a collection of nine standards dealing with the design and construction of power and communication lines, electrical stations and electrical coordination between different types of systems, such as between power and communication systems or power systems and pipelines.” \nReferenced by manufacturers The new editions of two key standards published in 2015, “Overhead Systems” and “Underground Systems,” cover power and communication lines and deal with issues such as clearances and separations, strength of poles and towers, and loading conditions including the impact of weather, O’Neill added. \n“These standards are referenced by electricity distribution and transmission utilities, telecommunication carriers, railways, engineering consultants, electrical safety regulators, and manufacturers across Canada.” \nCEC Part I is perhaps more well known to Canadians, as it covers electrical installations and is very ‘relatable’ to consumers. Houses need to have electrical components installed, and electricians need to adhere to Part I in their installation practices. CEC Part I is adopted and enforced by provincial and territorial electrical safety regulators. \nPart III is less commonly known among the general public, but without safe overhead and underground systems in place, consumers and businesses would not get the electricity they need and public safety would be at risk. \nThe new C22.3 No.7 Underground Systems standard helps ensure the safety and protection of people, services and property by specifying minimum design requirements for underground electricity supply and communication systems. \nThe latest edition of the standard includes several major changes and updates including revised definitions, new clauses, and reference materials dealing with line of sight at intersections and supply cable bonding techniques. \nThe new edition of C22.3 No.1 Overhead Systems standard helps ensure the safety and protection of people, services and property by specifying minimum design requirements for overhead electricity supply and communication systems. \nTo learn more about the standards, visit: www.csagroup.org \nCSA Group works with businesses, organizations and code authorities all around the world to help create a safer, more sustainable world for people and for business.
