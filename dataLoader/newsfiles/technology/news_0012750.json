Hola plans to use the latest funds to expand its engineering and product teams over the next 12 months to 200 employees from 75 as it enters the market after several years of development.\nThe network will be available in the fourth quarter after 12 video publishers participated in a pilot programme.\nHola has raised $30 million to date.\nThis is Orange's first investment in Israel since the French telecoms group and Israeli mobile phone operator Partner Communications agreed terms to end their licensing deal following a public row in Israel. Orange said at the time it was still committed to Israel.
