The new company, 3Dom USA , brought together a decade of 3D printing experience and over 40 years of polymer and process expertise. Together the two brands intend to build a strong global presence in the 3D printing market. \n3Dom Europe has seen particular success with the sale of its flagship filament Biome3D. Made from plant starches, Biome3D is a biodegradable thermoplastic that combines easy processing and a superior print finish, while offering much higher print speeds. Plant-based plastics are already a popular choice for 3D printing because they are much easier to work with during processing, are food safe and virtually odour-free. \n“We are determined to strengthen our key partnerships and extend our range in order to achieve greater interest and success”, explains Ciaran McMenamin, Director at 3Dom Europe. \n3Dom Europe has also announced a new reseller agreement with UK-based 3DFilaPrint for the sale of Biome 3D. \nTim Kay, Owner of 3DFilaPrint commented: “With so many filaments coming to market from all corners of the globe it is refreshing to see a premium, environmentally and affordable desktop printing filament such as Biome3D, in a range of beautiful vibrant colours.” \n3Dom Europe will be exhibiting at TCT Show + Personalize 2015 on 30 th September to 1 st October 2015 at the NEC, Birmingham on stand C36.
