Again — you get to control the whole team in this mode. The only problem is it is sometimes hard to find a match because it is not as popular as other online games. \nI cannot attest for two players because I lack friends with motivation to play rugby league on the Xbox. Why wouldn’t you pick the best player in the NRL for career. Source: \nCareer mode is diverse and allows you to play through the grades as a rookie or play as one of the games biggest stars (I selected Reynolds). \nWhen playing these modes, you only control the one player, which is kind of weird. \nIt is all about being a team player and injecting yourself at the right time of the game by calling for the ball. \nIf you call for the ball too much, or are not in position for defence you can cost your team greatly. \nWhile it makes for an authentic career experience, I am not sure if you would want to clock up the hours just controlling one player. \nBut career mode also allows you to be the coach, meaning you control player movements and the money. \nThis is probably the best option in career mode because you not only get to channel your inner Des Hasler, but when game day arrives, you control the whole team. \nAlso included in the game is a player crafting system, which allows you to create an avatar of yourself so you can run alongside your NRL heroes. \nAll in all, the game is heaps of fun, although it may not be for everyone. \nIf you love sports-based games, sure you will love it. \nIf you think rugby league football is the greatest game of them all, you will think it’s the greatest game in the world. \nHowever, if you don’t love sport games or rugby league, it wouldn’t come highly recommended. \nWhile it has vast improvements from its predecessors, it’s still not the tidiest game ever created. \nBut, all things considered I am pretty happy with the result.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T06:59:37.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
