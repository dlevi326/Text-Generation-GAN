It is a robot that shows a range of emotions and has an adaptive personality that changes as you play with it. \nOnce the companion app is downloaded to your phone, the classic Star Wars theme song “ushers you into an innovative connected play experience, merging the digital world with a self-aware droid”. \nThe new Star Wars movie brings back original 1977 cast members Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. \nExcitement is building for its release, and DStv now has a dedicated Star Wars channel. \nReuters/The Star", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T11:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T08:27:07.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
