Designed to celebrate Pope Francis’ upcoming visit to the U.S. from September 22-27, 2015, the Popemoji keyboard features 52 emoji and 14 GIFs of Pope Francis and is available now for free in the Apple® iTunes® App Store and Google™ Play Store. Swyft Media Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Monotype Imaging Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: TYPE). \nCommissioned as a part of a “Good is Winning” initiative by global Catholic network Aleteia.org, the keyboard features various emoji of Pope Francis doing things like heading a soccer ball, taking selfies with the crowd and visiting the Liberty Bell, United Nations and Washington Monument. \n“Emoji are so ingrained in digital and social language, particularly among young people, that it was natural to make them an element of our digital effort to support Pope Francis’ visit to the U.S. Besides, the Pope has a great sense of humor, is totally approachable and dedicated to engaging people where they communicate,” said Kathleen Hessert, founder of Sports Media Challenge, which is overseeing the digital aspect of Aleteia.org’s effort. “By engaging millennials, we’ll enable new conversations throughout Pope Francis’ visit to the U.S., with the goal of keeping that community involved in a dialogue over the long term. Swyft Media is a leader in this space and its successes in these mediums with cool and creative branded content made them a natural partner for us in this once-in-a-lifetime project.” \nPope Francis is scheduled to touch down in the U.S. on September 22, 2015, and visit Washington D.C., New York City and Philadelphia during his five-day trip. The PopeIsHope Digital Street Team, assembled by Aleteia.org, will capture the spirit of how Pope Francis interacts with the crowds in each city and will use digital storytelling to inspire young people to be a part of the “Good is Winning” movement – before, during, and after the Pope departs from the U.S. – by highlighting acts of courage, dignity, kindness, and mercy in every day life. \n“We understand what kind of content millennials and young consumers want, and more importantly want to share, and we’re very excited that Swyft Media’s technology is at the center of one of the biggest events of the year in the U.S.,” said Evan Wray, co-founder and vice president at Swyft Media. “What better way to bring such a monumental event to the digital generation than through emoji that capture the personality and sentiment of such an important figure. Pope Francis is a larger-than-life individual and the stickiness and viral effect of this campaign should be off the charts.” \nSwyft Emoji Keyboards help brands and advertisers create a fun, non-intrusive and emotional connection with consumers by allowing them to take their favorite character, brand, sports team or icon with them wherever they go. Whether consumers are using iMessage, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, LINE, WeChat or any other number of messaging apps, they now have the power to share content from their favorite branded emoji keyboard. \nAbout Swyft Media \nSwyft Media helps brands and advertisers become a part of the world’s largest conversation by creating and distributing branded content that consumers want, love and share with friends across a wide variety of mobile apps.
