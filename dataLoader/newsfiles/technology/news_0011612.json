The reach around the world is up to 140 regions, including exclusive access within China.

For a small annual membership cost, artists and labels can upload and distribute an unlimited amount of projects. “We are anticipating the digital revolution in the same light as giants like Netflix, and one of our own outlets Spotify.” Says Co-Founder Javan Mershad, “The current and future music landscape revolves around content. Consumers have never had as much connection to their favorite artists, and want as many songs as they can get their hands on. We’re excited to be able to support that.”\nMondoTunes.com strives to be a “one stop shop” for working musicians. With the re-launch, come new services to their clients. Their latest innovation, MondoTunes Artist Promotions (M.A.P), offers a unique opportunity to artists who desire more exposure. Co-Founder Steve Norris explains further, “With M.A.P, we wanted to create a solution for musicians who frankly can’t find the time to devote to successful promoting. Writing, recording, touring, and in some cases still holding a steady job to get the bills paid is a challenge in and of itself. We understand first hand how difficult it can be to have sole responsibility for your career, so we want to help artists stay focused on what they do best; Making great music!” One of the main components of the program features a marketing expert from the MondoTunes staff dedicated to building artists brand awareness, while growing a fan base through social media and various online press publications.\nThe company highlights their value proposition through comprehensive competitive cost analysis charts. Legacy MondoTunes artists enjoy enhanced royalty reporting and a one-year grace period maintaining existing content on retailer sites worldwide without fees.
