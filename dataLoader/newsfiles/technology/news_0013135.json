Brave YouTuber Zach Straley has run a dunking test so you don't have to. \n\nIn a video posted online on Friday both of the 2015 iPhones spend an hour underwater with no adverse effects. The camera, 3D Touch, the Home button and everything else still appear to work just fine. \n\nStraley later confirmed on Twitter that the Lightning port and the headphone socket are still operating as normal as well. It appears the two handsets are more waterproof than anyone realised. \n\nDon't try this at home \n\nOf course without any official word from Apple we can't recommend you try this at home -- just because these handsets still work doesn't mean yours are going to. You dunk your own phone at your own risk. \n\nThis could be the first evidence of the waterproofing technology Apple patented back in March: It uses a thin hydrophobic coating to keep all of the internal circuitry working as normal. It's hard to know for sure until the manufacturer confirms or denies it. \n\nThe Apple Watch has also been shown standing up to water surprisingly well. It seems Apple's 2015 gadgets are designed to resist a decent amount of splashing and submerging, even if the company isn't shouting about it.\n\nApple iPhone 6S, 6S Plus: 10 things to know of 11 Apple's new iPhones are here. The tech giant unveiled the two updated iPhones -- iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus -- at an event in San Franciscoâ€™s mega Bill Graham Civic auditorium. Talking about the new smartphones, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, \"They look familiar, but we have changed everything about these iPhones.\"\n\nOne of the key new features of the new iPhones is the new touch capability called 3D Touch which allows the screen to sense multiple types of pressure.\n\nHere are 10 things you need to know about Apple's latest iPhones. Most smartphone users are accustomed to 'multi-touch' -- the ability for phones to recognize touches from multiple fingers, enabling such capabilities as pinching to zoom. With new iPhones, Apple brings in 3D Touch.\n\nPressing down hard on the new iPhones will launch additional capabilities. For example, you can get quick access to tasks such as taking a selfie or getting directions home. From a message, 3D Touch will give you a preview of a web link without launching the browser.\n\nSimilarly, press for a few seconds on a document icon, and a preview pops out. Press on an address in an email, and a map opens up. On some video apps, the pressure determines how quickly you forward or rewind. After being stuck with an 8MP camera sensor since iPhone 4S, the iPhone range has finally received a substantial megapixel upgrade. iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus sport a 12MP rear camera, with 50% more focus pixels to ensure faster autofocus.\n\nApple says that the new iPhones' camera will deliver more detailed photos than ever before. It can also capture panorama shots in 63MP resolution and capture videos in 4K (movie hall quality) resolution. The selfie camera has also got an upgrade this year, jumping from 1.2MP in iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to 5MP in iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.\n\nThough it is not backed by a front-facing LED flash, Apple has used a technology called Retina Flash to deliver brighter selfies. This feature increases the brightness of the screen by three times, which Apple claims is comparable to that of its rear dual-LED flash.\n\nThe front camera also gets an upgrade. It'll be 5MP FaceTime HD camera that uses the phone's Retina display for a flash for \"detailed selfies.\" Apple claims that the new capabilities will now let the display light up 3-times brighter for a flash that's comparable to that of the TrueTone flash on the back.\n\nApple has also debuted a feature called Live Photos in the camera app, which will capture a 1.5-second video before and after you click the shutter in order to create animated GIFs. The new iPhone 6S Plus will also come in a rose gold colour, as well as the standard silver, gold, and space gray hues.
