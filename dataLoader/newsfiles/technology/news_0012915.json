The 2 x 8 mm flat units provide a 75% volume reduction compared to a standard 8 mm GDT. \n\nThe 2-electrode devices come in five versions with 90 to 420 V DC sparkover. They are rated for 10,000 A rms for 8/20 μs for greater than ten operations. The GDTs operate over -55° to +85°C, are RoHS compliant, and have three mounting options.
