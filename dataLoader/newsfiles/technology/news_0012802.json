While it uses Aruba Networks' products for its hands-on learning labs, the curriculum \"is taught in a vendor-agnostic fashion,\" according to information on the company's site. \nAruba has expanded the program to a include a four-semester curriculum leading to the Aruba Certified Mobility Expert (ACMX) exam. During the two-year program, students have the opportunity to earn five different certifications. \nAruba Mobility Academy course topics include: Wi-Fi fundamentals; Enterprise Wi-Fi troubleshooting and access control; and Designing and integrating Wi-Fi networks. \n\"The new courses will give our students both a general and broad exposure to wireless networking, as well as valuable hands-on experience with Aruba solutions like ClearPass for network security and AirWave for network management,\" said John Mowry, associate professor at the Community College of Rhode Island , in a prepared statement. \"We need to be sure our students receive the most current coursework and training relative to changes in the networking industry and integrating the Aruba Mobility Academy content helps us accomplish this.\" \nAruba Networks is planning further expansion of the Mobility Academy with the addition of new hands-on training opportunities and is currently piloting a program that takes students on field trips to customer sites. \nFurther information about the Aruba Mobility Academy can be found on the Aruba Networks site.
