But its significance as a breakthrough model that is pushing the boundaries of both performance and fuel-efficiency is dramatic.\"\nThe four-wheel drive P85D, which is a modified version of the Tesla S sedan, will cost upwards of $US125,000 ($A174,447) with typical equipment, Consumer Reports noted.\nBut the group said the breakthroughs suggest positive things for the sector, with Tesla due to introduce its Model X crossover in 2016, followed in 2018 by a \"more attainable compact sedan,\" the Model 3, estimated to start at about $US35,000.\nConsumer Reports gave the P85D a 100/100 rating, topping the 99/100 rating of the Tesla S two years ago.\nRechtin said the vehicle \"initially scored 103 in the Consumer Reports' Ratings system, which by definition doesn't go past 100... so we had to make changes to our scoring to account for it\".\nTesla shares jumped eight per cent in US midday trade to $US243.01, extending the spectacular market performance of the carmaker, which produces only a small number of coveted vehicles.\nEarlier in August, Tesla reported a quarter loss of $US184 million ($A256.79 million) as the electric carmaker geared up for expansion.\nTesla plans to invest about $US1.5 billion this year to expand production capacity, construct its huge \"Gigafactory\" for batteries and expand its network of charging stations.\nTesla is also gearing up for a new project to adapt car batteries to store power in homes and businesses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:29:02.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
