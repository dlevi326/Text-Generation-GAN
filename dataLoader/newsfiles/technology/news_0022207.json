In childhood, g irls tend to speak earlier and with more complexity than boys do, and boys born with high levels of testosterone in their blood are more likely to have speech delays.\nThat’s left scientists hunting for the reasons why: Is it socialization, or differences in a so-called “ language protein ” in the brain, or in how the body processes testosterone?", "external_links": ["http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/256666.php", "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-neurosexism-feeds-stereotypes-about-mens-and-womens-brains", "http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/do-women-talk-more-than-men/", "http://www.livescience.com/36114-baby-boys-testosterone-language-skills.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17615349"], "published": "2015-09-01T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:44:20.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
