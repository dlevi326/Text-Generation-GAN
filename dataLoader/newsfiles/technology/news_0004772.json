Android Pay works with all NFC-enabled Android devices running Android OS 4.4 (KitKat) or higher. Android Pay will be available for download on Google Play in the next few days and will come preinstalled on new NFC-enabled Android phones from major carriers. \nWith Android Pay, the customer's card number is never stored on the physical device and is never shared with the merchant when purchases are made at the point of sale. Instead of using the customer's credit or debit card number, a virtual account number along with a dynamic, transaction specific security code is used to process payments. \nWith Android Pay, PNC Bank debit and credit cards transactions are still protected by PNC Security Assurance. \nMore than 1 million locations will accept Android Pay. \nPNC Bank, National Association, is a member of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC is one of the largest diversified financial services institutions in the United States, organized around its customers and communities for strong relationships and local delivery of retail and business banking; residential mortgage banking; specialized services for corporations and government entities, including corporate banking, real estate finance and asset-based lending; wealth management and asset management.
