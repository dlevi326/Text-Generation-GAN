For example, when taken next to a keyboard, in bed, watching TV, on the sidewalk, in the car or while filling gas. \n\"This is an example of a new class of research studies that have become possible due to the massive adoption of smartphones,\" Gill added. \nIn addition to cutting out some bad habits, the authors feel that the app can also prevent \"metabolic jetlag\" - when differences in day-to-day or weekday/weekend meal times cause metabolic organs to become out of sync with the body's overall circadian rhythms. \nThe app could also be a powerful tool for personalised medicine. \nFor example, the pictures revealed that nearly two-thirds of participants took some kind of nutritional supplement or vitamins, but the time at which they took these pills varied from day to day. \nThe same held true for medication. \nIn addition, the data revealed cultural food practices, such as people's' consumption of coffee and milk in the morning, alcohol in the evening, and tea throughout the day. \nAlso, yogurt was a morning food, sandwiches and burgers were primarily reserved for lunchtime while vegetables and ice cream were saved for the evening. \nPhotos of chocolate and candy were recorded from pretty much 10 a.m. Onward. \nPanda now hopes to test the benefits of time-restricted feeding under different conditions of sleep, activity and disease. \nDownload the Gadgets 360 app for Android and iOS to stay up to date with the latest tech news, product reviews, and exclusive deals on the popular mobiles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T17:57:18.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
