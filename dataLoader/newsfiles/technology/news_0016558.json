Setauket, NY\nThe project managers of the newly completed Riverwalk Pointe at Mangrove Bay apartment complex were faced with a wet job site and suddenly expanded construction plans. The PENETRON team provided an effective concrete waterproofing plan that also helped keep the project on schedule.\nLocated near the Intercoastal Waterway, the Riverwalk Pointe at Mangrove Bay is a luxury apartment complex in Jupiter, Florida. The development features two four-story buildings with a total of 104 residential units, ranging in size from about 900 square feet (84 m2) for a single-bedroom unit to over 1,300 square feet (120 m2) for the three-bedroom units. The project included an underground parking garage, clubhouse, fitness center, and pool with a deck area.\nThe construction site was located next to a river and the Intercoastal Waterway, which resulted in water level issues. Flooding of the job site was common, especially during the rainy season. The contractor specified the complete PENETRON crystalline waterproofing system for all below-grade structures, as well as the pool and deck area.\n“One of the foundation slabs of the two buildings was already in place, and newly updated plans called for an extension to that slab and an overall larger footprint for the project,” explains Christopher Chen, Director of The PENETRON Group. “We worked closely with the architect, the contractor and the owner to quickly provide a waterproofing solution that was both cost effective and efficient.”\nPENETRON ADMIX in soluble bags was added to treat about 2,500 cubic yards (1,910 m3) of concrete, PENEBAR PRIMER and PENEBAR SW-55 waterstop were used to seal all below-grade concrete joints, and PENECRETE MORTAR was applied to all cracks and tie-holes.\nThe PENETRON Group is a leading manufacturer of specialty construction products for concrete waterproofing, concrete repairs and floor preparation systems. The Group operates through a global network, offering support to the design and construction community through its regional offices, representatives and distribution channels.\nFor more information on PENETRON waterproofing solutions, please visit penetron(dot)com or Facebook(dot)com/ThePenetronGroup, email CRDept(at)penetron(dot)com, or contact the Corporate Relations Department at 631-941-9700.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12944918.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.penetron.com/products#penecrete-mortar", "http://www.penetron.com/products#penebar-primer", "http://www.penetron.com/products#penebar-sw-55", "http://www.penetron.com/the-penetron-system", "http://www.penetron.com/products#penetron-admix", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12944918.htm"], "published": "2015-09-08T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:57:21.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
