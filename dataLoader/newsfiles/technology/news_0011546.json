These and other insights are from Deloitte’s 2015 Global Venture Capital Confidence Survey . You can download a copy here (PDF, no opt-in, 70 pp.). Deloitte has also produced and made available infographics of the key findings here (PDF, no opt-in, 4 pp.). Deloitte & Touche LLP and the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) collaborated on the eleventh annual survey, which was conducted in May & June of this year. The study assesses investor confidence in the global venture capital environment, market factors shaping industries and investments on specific geographies and industry sectors. Please see page 4 of the study for a description of the methodology.Key take-aways include the following: Global venture capital investors are most confident in cloud computing (4.18). Investors were asked to rate their confidence level in each sector. Confidence levels were measured on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 representing the most confidence. Basis points indicate year-over-year changes. Mobile (4.05), Internet of Things (3.95) and enterprise software (3.82) are the top four sectors venture capitalists are the most confident in today. Biopharmaceuticals are experiencing the greatest increase in venture capital confidence today. Please the the graphic below for additional details. The United States (4.17), Israel (3.90) and Canada (3.60) dominate venture capital investors' confidence while emerging markets including Brazil continues to fall. U.S. technology hubs including Silicon Valley/San Francisco, New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Chicago continue to retain and reinforce global venture capital investor confidence. The following graphic illustrates global venture capital investor's confidence by nation. Silicon Valley/San Francisco (4.28), New York (3.86) and Boston (3.77) are the top three U.S. metros global venture capital investors have the greatest confidence in. Los Angeles (3.43) and Chicago (3.22) are the fourth and fifth most trusted U.S. metros that venture capitalists have confidence in. $15.2B was invested by global venture capital investors in Silicon Valley/San Francisco according to the Deloitte study. The following graphic compares venture capitalist confidence levels and venture capital investment dollars received in 2015 through Q2. Immigration reform (61%) and patent demand reform (36%) are the top two initiatives U.S.-based venture capitalists want addressed by policy leaders. For non-U.S. venture capitalists, tax incentives/credits (50%), infrastructure and job creation (both 41%) are the top two initiatives they would like to see public policy leaders take on in their home country. Cloud computing continues across all sectors as the area global venture capital investors have the greatest confidence in. Confidence in biopharmaceuticals grew the fastest of any sector measured by the survey between 2014 and 2015, and this is the first year Deloitte is tracking investor confidence in the Internet of Things (IoT). A sector comparison is provided below.
