(OTC - VOIS), has received excellent reviews from the sales of NeuroSync - the world's smallest Brain-Computer-Interface! The BCI device is now being sold through three online platforms, including www.Amazon.com , www.TheNeuroSync.com and www.MindSolutionsCorp.com . Positive reviews and testimonials are posted throughout the internet on sites such as www.YouTube.com . \nAttractive advertisements for NeuroSync are popping up throughout the internet on high traffic sites like Facebook, Google and others and driving sales for the newly-released product. The Company is in the process of producing a commercial quality video for NeuroSync, to be used for advertising on television as well as throughout the internet. Management did not accept the initial production draft provided and is taking an extra two weeks to ensure a high quality production is completed. The video will be provided to shareholders through a press release once complete. \nThe Management of Mind Solutions has been invited to meet with a larger company interested in the possibility of licensing the NeuroSync design. The Company is open to discussions with larger, well-known companies provided it brings value to the shareholders. \nNeuroSync is the world's smallest Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI ), which allows the user to control actions via applications on smart phones and computers through the power of thought. Using a single dry sensor, the device is the most user-friendly on the market. Worn on the ear like a Bluetooth cellular device, NeuroSync receives electrical signals produced by the brain through the inner ear canal. These signals are then sent to the user's smart phone or computer to control up to 2 separate actions. There are approximately 100 Apps currently on the market that are compatible with NeuroSync. Mind Solutions plans to begin developing additional Apps for NeuroSync in the near future and create a Thought-Controlled Apps store to sell through. \nInvestor Relations - Casey Burt 888-461-3932 \ninvestor@MindSolutionsCorp.com \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neurosync-receives-excellent-reviews-300147905.html \nSOURCE Mind Solutions, Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T20:37:24.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
