New Democracy swiftly conceded defeat.\nA Syriza source said the party would turn once again to the small right-wing Independent Greeks party to form a coalition, restoring the alliance that first brought Tsipras to power nine months ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T22:23:31.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
