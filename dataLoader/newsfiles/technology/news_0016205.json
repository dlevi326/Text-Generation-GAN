( www.distrix.com ), a developer of software-defined network (SDN) middleware for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for government, energy, manufacturing, utilities, transportation, healthcare and other applications, today announced it has hired a new President, Dennis G. Defensor. Mr. Defensor, who has over 20 years executive management experience in both government contracts and commercial markets, will be based in Washington, DC. \n\"The government's rapidly growing use of sensors, the massive amount of data that sensors generate, and use of big data analytics require the deployment of private industrial networks that can bridge today's non-integrated Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology networks (OT). Distrix, a middleware overlay, enables government agencies to deliver cloud-based or private industrial network solutions today using their current IT network infrastructure,\" said Dennis Defensor. \nThe integration of the formerly disparate Information Technologies (the digital realm) and Operational Technologies (the physical realm) will result in much greater operatioal efficiency, inter-organizational collaboration, strategic decision-making, mission support and technological innovation. This will affect every facet of the various DOD and civilian agencies. For example, Navy ships are essentially floating SCADA systems. GSA ( News - Alert ) is already using IIoT technology to build automation information in some government buildings for lighting, elevators, energy consumption, chillers and boilers. \nDistrix adds significant operational network functionality to current IT networks. Among others, it bridges information technology networks and operational technology networks, provides intelligence from the edge to the core of the networks, provides resiliency and continuity to deliver high-availability networks, enhances network scalability and management, and improves security. Distrix virtualizes basic network functions which improves management and scalability. \nDistrix can connect to various layers of the network such as the driver of the physical port, RS-232, RS-485, TCP, UDP ( News - Alert ), Modbus, HTTP, Internal Control Systems (ICS) like SCADA, and will later support OPC, BACnet and other protocols. It is an inherently secure network because it is a virtual and logical network abstracted from the physical network. For example, it closes many SCADA vulnerabilities. Distrix runs on low-cost, COTS hardware on a blade or in a virtual machine (VM) as an embeddable software platform. \nAbout Distrix Networks Ltd. \nDistrix' middleware technology evolved from the company's initial work in autonomous mobile vehicles (partially funded by DARPA), unmanned aerial vehicles and resilient networks. The company has successfully implemented their secure, resilient and intelligent IIoT networks with telecommunications and power grid customers. Distrix HQ is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The new Distrix Networks office in Washington, DC can be reached at 703-409-8136 or by email at dennis.defensor@distrix.com . To learn more about Distrix go to www.distrix.com .
