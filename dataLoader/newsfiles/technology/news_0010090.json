NYT News Service | 05 September 2015, 10:00 AM IST Share OAKLAND (CALIFORNIA): More than a decade before diversity became a hot issue in Silicon Valley , Jason Young came home on winter break from Harvard to discover that his family was being evicted. Having grown up in a single-parent home with an absent father who was frequently incarcerated, Young, 33, can identify with other young black men he now calls \"hidden geniuses\" -- the promising male teenagers who grow up in challenging circumstances mere miles away , but light-years apart, from Silicon Valley's tech money machine.That experience led Young to found the Hidden Genius Project two years ago. The programme immerses high school men of colour in coding, web and app design, team building and other skills intended to give them a leg up in the tech economy. Young says he focused on young men because similar groups existed for young women, and because young males face particular challenges in school and their communities.His project is one of a multitude of grass-roots efforts that have sprung up recently to address one of Silicon Valley's most acute diversity problems the scarcity of African-Ameri cans in the tech industry.\"We are helping these yo ung men to understand who they are and what they're ca pable of,\" said Young, who runs his education technology start-up, MindBlown Labs in the same Oakland building as Hidden Genius Project \"We're giving them a pathway and putting them on it.\" Silicon Valley has been engulfed in a diversity debate for more than a year, in part because data released by giant tech companies like Google, Facebook and others showed how overwhelmingly tilted the population of tech workers is to white males. The data highlighted that the low number of AfricanAmerican tech workers is particularly acute, worse than even the dearth of women and Hispanics in the industry .Google revealed that its tech work force was 1% black, compared with 60% white. Yahoo disclosed in July that AfricanAmericans made up 1% percent of its tech workers while Hispanics were 3%. In a report last month, Apple said it had made progress increasing diversity in hiring in the last year, though African-Americans remained the smallest fraction of its tech work force at 7%, compared with 53% white, 25% Asian and 8% Hispanic; the rest were undeclared, multiple or other.According to the United States Census Bureau, African-Americans and Hispa nics have been consistently underrepresented in science, technology , engineering and mathematics (STEM) occupations. In 2011, blacks represented 11% of the total work force but only 6% of STEM workers.Hispanics were 15% of the total work force and 7% of STEM workers.\"A lot of African-Americans want to grow up to be LeBron James, Jay Z or Barack Obama,\" said Van Jones, CNN political commentator and founder of #YesWeCode, a yearold program that has raised $3 million to connect young adults in Oakland to apprenticeships in tech companies. \"They dont hear about David Drummond at Google, who is at the centre of one of the biggest companies in the world.\" (Drummond is a senior vice president and Google's chief legal officer.) The idea with all of the new efforts, Jones said, is to create a generation of black entrepreneurial \"uploaders\" -those who create profit-making apps instead of simply downloading them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T13:05:13.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
