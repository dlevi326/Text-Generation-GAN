Paul Rovere Share on twitter by John Stensholt Perth-based AFL fans have snapped up 10,000 corporate hospitality tickets for the upcoming grand final, even though the West Coast Eagles and Fremantle are not guaranteed to qualify.\nAFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan told a Telstra conference in Melbourne on Tuesday that the league sold all of its 14,000 expensive corporate hospitality tickets for the grand final on October 3, with 10,000 bought by Perth fans.\nThe Eagles and Fremantle will both host preliminary finals this weekend, against North Melbourne and Hawthorn, respectively, and could move onto the grand final for what would be the first ever meeting of the Perth teams in the season-decider at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nMr McLachlan said demand for tickets from Perth fans had seen the AFL sell out of its grand final corporate hospitality packages, which cost hundreds of dollars each, before the finals series had even begun earlier in September.\nMr McLachlan also said AFL sponsor Virgin Australia had moved about 6000 extra seats onto the Perth-Melbourne route for grand final week, which Qantas had pledged to match.\n\"The Western Australian thing [of having two Perth teams in the grand final] would be massive and great for our game,\" Mr McLachlan said. \"But the issue is the logistics. If we have two Perth teams each team will get about 15,000 tickets so we will have to move 30,000 Western Australians over here.\"\nâ€‹ West Coast spokesman Gary Stocks doubted the airlines could cope with demand if both the Eagles and the Dockers make it to the grand final. \"I'm not sure there will be enough planes,\" he said.\nAirlines cash in Many WA fans have booked flights without knowing if their teams will play in the grand final to avoid hefty prices. A one-way ticket from Perth to Melbourne the day before the grand final (October 2) has reached $1430 on Qantas and $1379 on Virgin, who are charging similar amounts for the return journey on October 4.\nBoth airlines have been accused of ripping WA footy fans off by charging more to fly to overseas destinations than to Melbourne, even though customers would be on the same plane that stops for a layover in the Victorian capital.\nMr McLachlan's presentation to the Telstra Vantage conference alongside Telstra chief executive Andy Penn revealed the AFL's revenue for 2015 was projected to be a record $458 million, compared with $446 million last year, which makes the league the biggest sport in the country. \"Our vision is to be unassailably the number one sports and entertainment option in Australia ... clearly and undisputedly beyond reach,\" he said.\nThe presentation said the AFL and Telstra had attracted more than 170,000 subscribers to its mobile streaming service, for which customers pay $89 per year to access live matches to handsets and tablets. The AFL websites get about 5 million unique visitors per week and there have been about 3.8 million downloads of official AFL apps.\nMr McLachlan also said the AFL is working with Telstra to develop a huge new database that would contain information about all of the sport's participants and fans. \"Technology is critical to us, it is central to where we are going. We are working very hard to build a profile ... of all the potential people that we need to talk to.\"\nTelstra's Mr Penn backed new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's vision that increases the importance of science and innovation to the country's future.\n\"Can I say it is fantastic to have a government talking about technology and talking about innovation, because I truly believe those are the things that are going to make a difference to Australia and our economy and business being a success in the future,\" Mr Penn said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-09-22T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:17:20.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
