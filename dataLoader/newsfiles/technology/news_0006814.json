Now 3D Systems has launched a new 3DIY application that aims to reinvent textile design, pattern making and fashion with 3D printing. \nFabricate is an app that gives designers, independent retailers and hobbyists the ability to personalise their creations with 3D Systems’ flagship Cube desktop 3D printer. \nFabricate is the first application of its kind for the fashion industry bringing customisation through matching and mixing colourful filaments with fabrics for both the professional and home users. 3D Systems .textile files in different patterns and shapes are printed on special fabric which can be sewn onto clothing and accessories for a customised, modernist look revealing new layers of expression. \n“Fabricate is a celebration of 3D technology and fashion fusion, a completely new way of accessorising that is accessible to everyone,” said Annie Shaw Creative Director, 3DS. “3D Tech-Style printing lets fashion happen easily, enabling the creation of truly stunning attire. I can’t wait to see how people use this technology to push the boundaries of fashion.” × Expand 3D Systems. \nFabricate comes in three different printed .textile designs that are exclusively available on Cubify.com representing three unique sewing projects. Each month 3DS plans to release a new set of .textile designs and projects and will also partner with various fashion designers who are at the forefront of mixing 3D technology with tradition. \nFabricate packs and projects are available for immediate purchase on Cubify.com .
