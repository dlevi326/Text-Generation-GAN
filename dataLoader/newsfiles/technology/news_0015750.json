Mobile data will contribute nearly 20% of the total revenues, driven by the increasing number of LTE users who are expected to result in the increased data usage, as mobile broadband prices continues to be relatively cheaper as compared to fixed broadband, owing to regulatory intervention. The ongoing auction of the 800MHz/2600MHz spectrum auction would further improve LTE coverage in the country, offering operators the opportunity to provide high-speed broadband Internet services and growth in the mobile broadband usage will particularly be driven from the rural areas. The presence of 6 major operators and more than 20 MVNOs has intensified the existing competition amongst the telcos, thereby resulting in pricing pressure on the telcos. Service bundling and multi-screen among DTH and cable operators among DTH and cable operators will be the key focus areas by pay-TV operators in Poland.\nAVAIL SAMPLE REPORT @ New report shares details about the Poland: The 800MHz/2600MHz 4G Spectrum Auctions and the National Broadband Plan Will Fuel Data Services Growth\nKey Findings\n• Poland is the second largest telecom services market in the Central and Eastern Europe region, after Russia, with estimated revenue of US$8.7bn, or 1.7% of nominal GDP in 2015.\n• Pyramid Research expects telecom service revenue to decline from Zl 33.5bn ($8.7bn) in 2015 to Zl 30.7bn ($10.0bn) in 2020 (-1.7% CAGR in Zl terms) as price competition will remain intense and the adoption of fixed/mobile convergent services will increase pressure on total market revenue.\n• The revenue mix will change as the government (through its national broadband plan) and leading operators (Orange, Play, Polkomtel, T-Mobile and Netia) invest in high-speed fixed and mobile networks to capture an increasing demand for Internet services.
