Families look over Debbie Haas's first grade classroom in the new Lothian Elementary School. (By Joshua McKerrow / Staff) Elementary Schools Technology standards change quickly in county schools \nDeborah Haas, a first grade teacher at Lothian Elementary School, can use a microphone to deliver lessons through a speaker in the classroom ceiling. \nLast month, Lothian elementary opened its replacement building equipped with the latest technology, said Alex Szachnowicz, chief operating officer for county schools. \n\"You won't find chalkboards in this building,\" Szachnowicz said. 8 \nAs technology plays a growing role in education, new buildings have some advantages over older ones. While some classrooms unveil high-tech teaching tools this fall, some older classrooms still have video cassette recorders, a relic that became a household appliance in the 1980s, alongside newer technology. \n\nSzachnowicz said classrooms in new buildings all have interactive smartboards, projectors and document cameras, which project texts and objects onto screens and smartboards. \nWhile older buildings have some of these tools, it is not a classroom standard, said Szachnowicz. \nThe school system of about 81,000 students has 28,000 desktop computers, 15,410 chromebooks, 7,500 laptops and 2,994 interactive smartboards, among other devices such as tablets and iPads, according to school officials. \nPatricia Nalley, the vice president of the school board, said technology standards change quickly. \nShe said when Davidsonville elementary school opened in 2002, the television sets, desktops and laptops were among the latest technology. \nAnd now, classrooms in new buildings don't need televisions, Nalley said. \nIn Haas' classroom, the smartboard is connected to a computer and an overhead projector and a computer. \nStudents use their fingers to move shapes around on the smartboard for interactive lesson plans. \nHaas said having the projector on the ceiling close to the board meant students won't be able to cast shadows and get distracted during lessons. \n\"Because they're 6-years-old,\" Haas said. \"They're not focusing if they're shadow casting.\" \nShe said the class microphone helps students with hearing issues. \nBut one of the oldest schools in the county, Edgewater Elementary School, doesn't have overhead speakers in the classrooms. \nAnd without central air, the loud hum of the air conditioning unit makes it hard for students to hear the lesson, said principal Kellie Schell-Ramey. \nAlthough some Edgewater classrooms still have VCRs hanging below boxy televisions and chalkboards, many of its classroom have smartboards. \nSchool officials say they retrofit technology into older buildings when they can. \nJacob Bjebrknes, a former Lothian Elementary school student, said he wishes he could go to Lothian Elementary School for a week, to see what it's like to learn in a new building. \nJacob, 11, is going to sixth grade at Southern Middle School. \nHe attended class in crowded halls and portable classrooms in the last two years at Southern Middle School as the new elementary school was being built. \nLucy Moore, 10, started fifth grade at the new Lothian Elementary this fall and is excited about the new library, which has 12 desktops, two smartboards and two high-tech cameras that can project textbooks onto screens. \nLucy attended the opening day tour of the school with her parents Steve and Katie, and her siblings, Niko, 8, Sophia and Micah, 6. \nAfter the standing room only ribbon-cutting event at the Lothian auditorium, parents and students flooded the halls to visit their new classrooms. \n\"Smell the paint,\" Steve Moore said to his family as they walked through the freshly painted light yellow halls. \n\"It blows my mind how much the times have changed since I was in elementary school,\" her mother Katie said. \nKatie remembered the dry erase boards and gigant projectors in her elementary school class. \nLucy carried a Whole Foods bag and a Taylor Swift bag of school supplies into her classroom. \nA slip of paper on her desk invited her to follow @Lothian5thGrade on Twitter and to #StayInTheLoop. \n@ChuangCapGaz Copyright Â© 2015, Capital Gazette , a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Privacy Policy Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T05:42:29.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
