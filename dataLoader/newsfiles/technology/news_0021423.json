Formation of organic thin-film transistors through room-temperature printing June 23, 2014 \nJapanese researchers have established a process for forming organic thin-film transistors (TFTs), conducting the entire printing process at room temperature under ambient atmospheric conditions. Inkjet-printed liquid metal could bring wearable tech, soft robotics April 7, 2015 \nNew research shows how inkjet-printing technology can be used to mass-produce electronic circuits made of liquid-metal alloys for \"soft robots\" and flexible electronics. Durable, washable and high-performance conductive textiles May 19, 2015 \nIn a new method for preparing electrically conductive textiles, the textile surface is modified with a negatively charged polyelectrolyte poly(methacrylic acid sodium salt) (PMANa) or poly(acrylic acid sodium salt) (PAANa) ... Syntactic foam sandwich fills hunger for lightweight yet strong materials July 16, 2015 \nA team of researchers reports success in pioneering tests of a layered material with a lightweight metal matrix syntactic foam core that holds significant potential for automobiles, trains, ships, and other applications requiring ... Electrical circuit made of gel can repair itself August 25, 2015 \n(Phys.org)â€”Scientists have fabricated a flexible electrical circuit that, when cut into two pieces, can repair itself and fully restore its original conductivity. The circuit is made of a new gel that possesses a combination ... Recommended for you Researchers create super-stretchable metallic conductors for flexible electronics September 8, 2015 \nWashington State University researchers have discovered how to stretch metal films used in flexible electronics to twice their size without breaking. New model predicts the force required to tie simple knots September 8, 2015 \nGot rope? Then try this experiment: Cross both ends, left over right, then bring the left end under and out, as if tying a pair of shoelaces. If you repeat this sequence, you get what's called a \"granny\" knot. If, instead, ... Analysis of textured surfaces could lead to more efficient, less dangerous power plants September 8, 2015 \nThe boiling of water is at the heart of many industrial processes, from the operation of electric power plants to chemical processing and desalination. But the details of what happens on a hot surface as water boils have ... Realization of the building block of a Hund's metal September 8, 2015 \nUnderstanding the physical mechanism for high temperature superconductors is a key step toward a room temperature superconductor. One characteristic aspect of these materials is the simultaneous presence of charges which ... Study points way toward 'filming' molecule-light interactions September 8, 2015 \nA new study from UNL physicists could inform the future production of 3-D movies starring light-driven molecular reactions that already play leading roles in photosynthesis, vision and many state-of-the-art technologies. Researchers use laser to levitate, glowing nanodiamonds in vacuum September 7, 2015 \nResearchers have, for the first time, levitated individual nanodiamonds in vacuum.
