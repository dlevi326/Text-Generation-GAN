LiquidText was developed to solve all the major problems found in both: navigation, annotation, locating source materials, showing relationships between passages, note-taking and the ability to organize disparate content into visual proximity for synthesis and analysis. \nThis was accomplished through the use of a patented combination of interactions, visualizations and user gestures that let the user squeeze a document to compare distant pages, find context instantly, and pull important content off the document into a scrolling window where it can be viewed, organized, analyzed and linked. Together, this creates an experience of maximized, personalized digestion and comprehension. \nThe result: reading and digesting digital text--whether contracts, analyst reports, or textbooks--becomes easy, effective, and enjoyable. -- Click to View Demo Here \nOriginally conceived by Founder and CEO, Craig Tashman, as the subject of his 2012 doctoral thesis at Georgia Tech, Craig and his teams spent four years studying where the reading process falls short for professionals, and how to make it better, publishing several peer-reviewed papers at the prestigious ACM SIGCHI Conferences on the subject along the way. The success of this early research and the desire to solve these problems for the millions of professional readers, from executives to college students, led to the ultimate creation of LiquidText. \n\"To date, the active reading of digital content - the kind of detailed, in-depth reading and note-taking required by professionals and students - has been painful to do on digital devices, leading 80% of professionals to want to print materials out just to read them,\" said Tashman. \"Kindle, Acrobat and others have tried to solve this problem, but short of being able to simply bookmark pages, look up the definition of a word or flag certain passages, the ability to comprehensively organize and visualize selected content in a real and useful fashion has remained elusive. We created LiquidText so readers could do all this efficiently, effectively and completely painlessly.\" \n\"Honestly, this is the most revolutionary program to come along in a long time,\" said Robert Siegle, Director and Professor at Virginia Tech. \nThe LiquidText iOS app is free and available for immediate download in the Apple Store. \nAbout LiquidText LiquidText is a privately held company based in New York City. LiquidText turns static digital documents into flexible and malleable ones, enabling users to annotate, highlight, except, connect and compare text right on the screen for maximum reading comprehension. \nMedia Contact:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T14:07:47.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
