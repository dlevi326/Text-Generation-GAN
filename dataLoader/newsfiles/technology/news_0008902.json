They argue that the Senate report, written by Democratic staff and opposed by Republicans, significantly distorted reality.\nThe staff of Senator Dianne Feinstein, the intelligence committee chairperson, says the book has numerous inaccuracies. The result is a thick stew of charges and counter charges that have been characteristic of the torture debate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T03:44:07.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
