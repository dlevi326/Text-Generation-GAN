The distinguished event, which took place at the Gansevoort Park Avenue Penthouse, featured a keynote address from two-time World Cup winner and three-time gold medalist, Christie Rampone. Canon EXPO, the once-every-five-year event which will be held later this year in Paris and Tokyo as well, brings together Canon customers from around the world and exemplifies Canon's commitment to expanding the future of technology. As a bookend to the monumental New York gathering for some of the esteemed guests, Canon Solutions America, in conjunction with Canon EXPO, hosted over 200 customers to thank them for their trust in the company and valued partnerships. What followed was a truly special moment for all guests. Coming off a stunning year that included winning the Women's World Cup, Captain Christie Rampone of the U.S. Women's National Team spoke to the engaged audience on what it means to be a champion, earning success, and how to provide leadership day in and day out. Rampone, who at 40 became the oldest woman to ever play in a FIFA Women's World Cup, touched on the intangibles that have made her a two-time World Cup Champion and three-time Olympic gold medalist. \"It was great to share my experiences with such an engaged and excited audience,\" said Rampone. \"Talking with Canon Solutions America's executives and employees, along with their great customers, was a joy. I'm glad to have been a part of such a big night for the company.\" As the lights dimmed on a spirited night for Canon Solutions America, a feeling of appreciation emanated throughout the Gansevoort as customers bid adieu to their hosts. Coming together to celebrate and showcase Canon and its customers was only made possible through the commitment of customers and partners who continue to work with the organization. Canon Solutions America's Customer Appreciation Event was an extension of that theme, and proved once more that the company is always committed to acknowledging what is so much more than just business. \"Without our great customers, events like this would not be possible,\" said Toyo Kuwamura, president and CEO, Canon Solutions America. \"It was an exciting and memorable evening that was made possible by our customers, partners, and leading industry analysts.
