This light contains a single 100 watt halogen bulb which produces a light beam approximately 800’ long by 65’ wide. The bulb is paired with a precision aluminum reflector and borosilicate hardened glass lens to produce a powerful 800 lumen light beam. This spotlight is built for durability and comfort with an impact resistant housing and an ergonomically designed five inch polycarbonate handle that matches the contours of your hand. The light head is mounted to the handle with a hinge that allows the head to be adjusted vertically. The 5.5 inch diameter lamp and reflector assembly is protected by a borosilicate hardened glass lens that is sealed against water and dust to provide an IP67 weatherproof protection. A toggle switch located on the side of the handle provides easy on/off operation. This spotlight features a sixteen foot straight cord that is terminated in an optional trailer plug. Plug options include, a 4-pin flat connector, a 4-pin round connector, a 6-pin round connector, a 7-pin round connector, and a 7-pin flat connector. This unit is ideal for utility work and hunting as well as military, security, and law enforcement use and any application that requires an extremely durable and effective light source.\n“Featuring a 2-pin deutsch quick disconnect, other power cords may be purchased to power the light from a cigarette plug, battery clamps, or ring terminals,” said Rob Bresnahan with Larsonelectronics.com. “This feature adds to the versatility of this light allowing it to be powered by any 12 or 24 volt power source.”\nLarson Electronics carries an extensive line of explosion proof LED lights, LED work lights, light towers, intrinsically safe LED lights, portable work lights and industrial grade LED area lights.
