You betcha, and here’s why. This wasn’t an ordinary Fed meeting. That's something to which Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Wealth Management, can testify. He told The Guardian, “We did a call for our clients and had 300 people on the line, and I can’t remember even doing a call of this kind for a regularly scheduled Fed meeting before.\" He said he felt compelled to do so because the meeting was seen as such a turning point in the Fed’s policymaking. Critics say the statement from the Fed was not only \"dovish,\" but also murky and lacked transparency, lending even more uncertainty to the market. The market responded first by rallying--then by dropping once again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:12:07.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
