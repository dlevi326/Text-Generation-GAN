I personally have not made a comment in years as the space is littered with jerks and racists, but that does not mean it cannot be fixed.\nInstead of cancelling it for everyone, use a system that will bring back a space where people can share ideas and thoughts about current affairs and politics using technology.\nFirstly, if you want to comment, then you need to register with your details that will need to be confirmed by email and sms. Once you have been vetted then you will be able to comment. News24 could even add an ID verification in this process should they feel the need. You may also only comment using your full name.\nSecondly, every time that you comment, it will not be uploaded until you verify the comment via email. In other words you are sent a verification email which you will then have to click on. This will instantly record your IP address of the device that you replied from.\nWhat these two steps will achieve is to make people personally responsible for the comments that they make. It will also mean that should people engage in hate speech they could be traced. It will make racists think twice before they engage in hate speech.\nNow there are obvious ways around this, using subnet masking and fake identities, but the ignorant trolls that have messed up the comment space probably struggle to dress themselves, so only a few half wits will dupe the system-and when they do- you ban them so that they have to start the whole process again. They will eventually get bored and move on.\nRather find a solution to the problem than ruin it for everyone.\nNews24 will find that once they implement a system like this, the decent commentators will return and it will be a place to share ideas and not be the cesspit that it currently is.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:06:57.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
