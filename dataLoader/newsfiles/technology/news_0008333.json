With several new cases cropping up every week, epidemiologists had to work frantically to track the skeins of the virus as they threaded from one person to another.\nCowley was there to help. By sequencing Ebola genomes from newly diagnosed patients, she could help her colleagues chart the source of new infections . Ebola mutates at a fairly constant rate, so if two people have identical strains, it's likely that one infected the other, or at least that they are nearby links on the same transmission chain. By tying fresh cases to existing clusters, Cowley could help local health workers to nail down the routes through which the virus was spreading—and develop effective strategies for stopping it.\nSpeed was essential and, until recently, out of the question. Even last year, the only way to carry out such work was to send samples of Ebola's genetic material to specialist labs with expensive sequencing machines, which took weeks or months to spit out the results. But by the time Cowley arrived, she could do that work herself in an ersatz desktop laboratory within 48 hours, thanks to a revolutionary sequencer called the MinION .", "external_links": ["https://vimeo.com/138102183", "http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-24-june-2015", "https://www.nanoporetech.com/products-services/minion-mki"], "published": "2015-09-16T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:35:30.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
