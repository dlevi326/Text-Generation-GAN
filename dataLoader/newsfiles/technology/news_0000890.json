Hoeft is a registered architect in New York, and a member of the American Institute of Architects, U.S. Green Building Council, National Fire Protection Association, Women Presidents’ Organization Syracuse chapter, and the Leadership Greater Syracuse class of 2012. Hoeft earned her degree in Architecture from Syracuse University. Most recently, VIP Architecture has earned WBE (Women Business Enterprise) certification with New York State for architectural and construction management services. This WBE certification in construction management further enhances VIP Architecture’s abilities for leveraging the fully integrated benefits that its sister company VIP Structures offers.\nThe quality of a project team, how they communicate with the client organization, and their ability to seamlessly work together are key factors that determine the difference between project success and failure. Projects that separate the design and construction management teams, pull the building process apart at critical junctures. This can cost the project going over budget and over deadlines.\n“Our integrated services allow organizations and projects to access the size, resources, and 40 years of expertise throughout VIP,” said Hoeft, principal and managing manager of VIP Architecture. “Now, these organizations can also meet WBE funding requirements through VIP Architecture and have access to VIP’s integrated services – which is unique in this industry.”\nVIP’s LEED®-accredited architects design to meet not only the architectural and aesthetic needs of clients, but constructability, scheduling and budgetary requirements as well. The firm has developed expertise in the entire building process and in a wide variety of project types, resulting in a vast portfolio of commercial, academic, industrial, medical and retail space.\nBy using VIP Architecture to get the best service, and to meet any WBE funding requirements, organizations will also have access to VIP’s other services. This integrated design-build approach combines architectural design, engineering, construction and development to deliver superior quality and consistent value for clients: four disciplines, one point of contact.\nWorking with this integrated team saves time and money, Hoeft says. “VIP’s comprehensive process provides clients with a complete plan, a guaranteed price, and an approved project.”\nVIP’s team includes over one hundred architectural, engineering, construction and development professionals, and is still growing. While VIP performs the majority of all work with its own crews, the firm continues its strong relationships with other subcontractors as needed, and often serves as a subcontractor to other firms due to its areas of expertise.\nVIP is a national Design-Build organization headquartered in Syracuse, NY. VIP has nearly 40 years of professional experience in architecture, construction and development, as well as in-house engineering and property management expertise for commercial, industrial and institutional clients.
