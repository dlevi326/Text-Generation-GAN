Providing a full range of services to private clients and business organisations, the firm offers a friendly and supportive service from its team of astute solicitors. \nThe firm will be implementing a ready-to-go Personal Injury Case Management system , serving to improve transparency and efficiency, whilst providing fee earners with a consistent approach to matter management. Additionally, Eclipse’s integration with the MoJ’s Claims Portals will ensure the process of submitting claims is much quicker, allowing fee earners to manage all submissions entirely through the Proclaim desktop. \nFurther to this, Thomson Snell & Passmore will take advantage of Proclaim’s integration with the incumbent Envision legal accounting solution, providing the firm with a ‘one view’ approach to financial management and enabling further analysis of overall productivity and efficiency throughout the Personal Injury and Clinical Negligence departments. \nAnthony Graham, Head of Information Systems at Thomson Snell & Passmore comments: \n\"As an extremely well-established practice, we aim to continually develop our services, not only to meet the needs of the dynamic legal sector, but also to meet the needs of our clients. After conducting research into the market, we found Proclaim to be a fantastic solution, ensuring total flexibility and therefore enabling us to offer the most efficient and flexible service to our clients – something that is key to our longevity within the legal profession.” \nShare:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T12:12:02.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
