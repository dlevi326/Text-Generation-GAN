Outside was an untamed wilderness, weeds and brambles that were taller than us, thicker than our legs, a football field of bamboo, trees growing out of roofs and walls, felt like they were in a story where time stood still, as a guest, not as the potential buyers.\nWith skype, the gopro and many pictures, we were able to have a family meeting after arriving home from the trip, and see if this was really a possibility, and even with all the down sides of the Chateau, that drive way and the first time you see this grand old lady, made up for it all, a hundred times over, we couldn't help but fall in love, madly in love really. So the offer was given, and the adventure of a lifetime begun….", "external_links": ["https://chateaulemung.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/11178326_1684797611756322_1114041912106568549_n.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-04T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:10:38.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
