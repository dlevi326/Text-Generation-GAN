Japan represents Netflix’s debut in Asia, and the young, fast-growing region that is home to two-thirds of the world’s population is a top priority for any business with global ambitions. But Japan is an idiosyncratic market and one more mature than most of the region. House of Cards has long been available on multiple platforms while Orange is the New Black could struggle to find an audience in law-abiding Japan. There hasn’t been a U.S. drama that has become a mainstream hit here since the early seasons of 24, and unless Netflix can deliver a show that captures audiences on that level, it faces an uphill task to make its mark in the Japanese market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T22:46:24.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
