It allows drivers to pay for parking with their smartphones using Parkmobile’s mobile applications for iPhone, Android, Windows, Amazon, and Blackberry phones. The Parkmobile service is being offered at approximately 1,300 on-street metered spaces throughout the city.\n“We are excited about the city’s partnership with Parkmobile to offer a pay-by-phone parking meter app for downtown patrons,” said Assistant City Manager Mike Collett. “The app is easy to use and will provide users the flexibility to use their smart phone to pay for meter time and extend time remotely, if necessary.”\nParkmobile’s mobile payment system is very simple to use. Customers may register online at www.parkmobile.com or download the mobile app in their phone’s app store. Once registered, they may use the mobile app, internet, or a toll free number to pay for parking. After setting up their account, customers can immediately start using the system with their registered mobile phone.\nEnforcement officers will be able to see that a motorist has paid with Parkmobile using a wireless handheld device, so customers should not worry if the meter does not change. Mobile app users may also choose to receive alerts and reminders 15 minutes prior to expiration of their parking session. Parkers will be able to extend their parking time for one additional increment after their initial time. Time limits on meters still apply and Parkmobile will not allow users to purchase more time than allotted by the meters.\nDowntown Partners Executive Director Ragen Cote said, \"A pay-by-phone meter app is an excellent option for parking convenience in Downtown Sioux City. Being able to use your phone for those times when you are out of change is something downtown visitors and businesses have been requesting for some time. We are excited to be a part of this project and look forward to working with Parkmobile.\"\n\"Parkmobile is thrilled to launch our mobile payment parking service in Sioux City,” said Jon Ziglar, CEO of Parkmobile, LLC. “Our service provides customers with an enhanced parking experience by eliminating the need to use a card or coins at the meter, making paying easier and more efficient than ever.”\nAbout Parkmobile\nParkmobile, LLC is the leading provider of on-demand and prepaid mobile payments for on- and off-street parking. Their services are used in more than 1,400 locations in the U.S. by millions of registered users.\nFor more information please visit www.parkmobile.com , facebook.com/Parkmobile , or on Twitter @Parkmobile.\nParkmobile Contact:\nTina Dyer\n770-818-9036\n770 818 9039 (fax)\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
