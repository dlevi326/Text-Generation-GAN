The Viper 4 series of Patriot memory was originally launched in January of 2015 and included 16GB and 32GB quad kits that ran at speeds of 2400MHz to 3000MHz pulling 1.2-1.35 volts. Patriot continues to expand their trademark line of memory designed with gamers, content creators and overclockers in mind by adding 8GB (2x4GB) and 16GB (2x8GB) dual kits with speeds ranging from 2400MHz to a top speed of 3400MHz to their Viper 4 line of memory.\nDesigned with a high performance custom heat shield structured to withstand the most taxing PC environments and provide continuous stable performance, the Patriot Viper 4 3400MHz dual kit (2x4GB) clocks in with 16-18-18-36 timings and pulls 1.35V of power.
