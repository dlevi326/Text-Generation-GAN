Picture: REUTERS Related articles Nigerian firms ease access to labour market for unemployed youths New start-ups want to become the ‘African Netflix’ Africa can lead the way in mobile MEXICO, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey — the so-called Mint economies — are fertile breeding grounds for talented young people who might have considered, or already have, careers in large national or global companies.\nHowever, instead of being tempted by what many consider safer careers, members of these countries’ millennial generation — those born since the early 1980s — seem to be determined to set up their own businesses.\nNigeria-born Rolake Akinkugbe is one example. Given her expertise in Africa’s energy sector, she could have picked jobs in Nairobi, Dakar, Johannesburg or Cairo, or stayed on in London, where she had spent the better part of 17 years studying and working.\nMoving back to Lagos last year, however, was a chance for her to test her feeling that her country is \"a land of opportunity\". Last month, Akinkugbe officially added a \"side-gig\" to her day job as head of energy and natural resources at investment bank FBN Capital — by founding what she says is sub-Saharan Africa’s first \"curated off-grid energy investment platform\".\nInstead of giving up her work for FBN Capital — sourcing and structuring funding for Nigerian energy firms — she is taking her knowledge of the commercial and strategic aspects of the sector and applying this to fill a gap.\nThe 35-year-old worked as the head of energy, oil and gas research at pan-African lender Ecobank before she was hired by FBN to lead the bank’s relationships with firms working in energy and natural resources.\nHaving seen the obstacles that established companies and start-ups alike often face when seeking funding to grow, Akinkugbe says her \"pan-African incubator\" will link promising sustainable energy projects with the investments they need to get off the ground.\nThe incubator is called InaTidé, which means \"light has come\" in the Yoruba language, which is widely spoken in south-west Nigeria. It will source financial and technical expertise for small, off-the-grid renewable energy projects across the continent.\nAkinkugbe says the priority is to provide funding to entrepreneurs with commercially viable ideas.\n\"A lot of these guys will tell you that’s the main reason their ideas are not able to be implemented. I’m going to be leveraging my network of investors to tap funding for projects (that many) off-grid entrepreneurs are running.\"\nAkinkugbe says an entrepreneurial spirit can be found across Nigeria.\n\"The time will come (to) make that decision to be a full-on entrepreneur, but I’m not yet at that point. I think you could speak to almost any Nigerian today, and they would tell you that they have one side gig or the other that they’re pursuing.\"\nShe believes this approach is partly because \"of the recognition that our society has a lot of problems that require solutions. \"We’re people who like to debate, we’re constantly talking about why things don’t work.\"\nShe adds that at some point, individuals have to consider if there is something they can do to take responsibility to find a solution to make things work better.\nThere are more than enough problems for Nigeria, which is dependent on crude for revenue and has been hit hard by the oil price crash and investor uncertainty about the economic plans of the new president, Muhammadu Buhari.\nAkinkugbe says the \"go-getter attitude\" among Nigerians \"now mixes with opportunity\" in terms of sheer demographics.\n\"If you come up with a product today and you sell it to 1-million Nigerians, you’ve made some pretty decent money,\" she says.\nInvestors and the government are interested in building a local entrepreneurial class that, with the right policies and funding, could itself be an engine for growth.\nHer advice for young entrepreneurs is to develop a personal brand and be consistent and diligent in their area of expertise to gain respect.\n© The Financial Times Limited 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:33:17.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
