(PRG) announces the PRG RH+A ReNEW(TM) Take & Try DIY Demo Program. This program lets users request a ReNEW LED Retrofit Assembly be sent to them to try for a two week period. This program allows them to work with this innovative LED light engine unit and to really get a feel for the ReNEW's ease of use, the cost savings, efficiency of the unit, and all of the features and benefits of the ReNEW. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150910/265571 \nThe ReNEW LED Retrofit Assembly is an LED light engine designed to work with the lens tube and shutter assembly of the Electronic Theatre Controls (ETC速) Source Four速 ellipsoidal. By swapping out the tungsten light source and reflector assembly of the Source Four with the ReNEW, users can cut their energy and HVAC costs by 67% while producing more output than that of a 575W HPL lamp. The ReNEW produces over 8,200 lumens of output, comparable to a Source Four ellipsoidal with a 575-watt HPL tungsten lamp, while drawing just 190-watts. \nThe unit works with all ETC Source Four lens tubes and all accessories. Two fixed color temperatures are available--ReNEW Tungsten with a 3,000K color temperature; and ReNEW Daylight with a 5,700K color temperature. The ReNEW can be operated with one, two, or three channels of DMX control or operated in standalone operation without DMX. \nWith the ReNEW LED Retrofit Assembly, customers can replace their 575W HPL tungsten lamps and take advantage of these benefits: -- A 67% reduction in power and HVAC consumption -- With no relamping needed, it significantly reduces maintenance costs -- Output that exceeds the output of a 575W tungsten HPL lamp -- Takes less than 60 seconds to swap out to an LED light engine -- DMX or standalone operation -- Keep all of your existing Source Four lens tubes and accessories -- Cost effective price without sacrificing output \nTo get started, just follow this link: http://www.prg.com/take-and-try or head over to the ReNEW page on the PRG website ( www.prg.com/renew .) Fill out the request for demonstration information and choose their preferred dealer. Along with the ReNEW LED Retrofit Assembly, we send a ReNEW quick start guide along with a demo kit with a gobo and a step by step shoot-out guide. After the trial period, they can return the unit or buy it from their local dealer. \nWith ReNEW, you don't have to sacrifice output when switching from a tungsten to an LED source. ReNEW your rig; don't replace it. \nFor more information about PRG, please go to: www.prg.com . \nSource Four速 and ETC速 are Registered Trademarks of Electronic Theatre Controls, Inc. \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/learn-more-about-the-prg-renew-led-retrofit-assembly-300141469.html \nSOURCE Production Resource Group", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:51:56.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
