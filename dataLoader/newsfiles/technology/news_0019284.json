He described him as the main person in the bombing but did not directly say he is suspected of actually planting the bomb.\nPrayuth said officials knew from their investigation that people involved in the bombing were about to flee the country and had traced the man to Aranyaprathet district in Sa Kaeo, a major crossing point to Cambodia.\nThe prime minister described the man as a piece in a jigsaw puzzle that would connect various parts of the case, which included a bombing the day after the shrine blast that exploded harmlessly in the river next to a busy Bangkok pier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:11:15.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
