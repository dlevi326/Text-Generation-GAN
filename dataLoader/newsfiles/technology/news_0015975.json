For sure the trolls are interrogating your every word, but we will survive, because my online opinion gave me the opportunity to express the silent voice from within. I may not be the intellectual with a publication on every corner, but my keyboard allowed me press all its buttons. So for my final News24 chapter, please consider my message:\nThere are on-going attempts by various individuals and organizations to forge a transition of governance of South Africa to Socialism. These entities (in the form of political parties, civic organizations and individuals) have continued attempts to inspire instability in the country with the ultimate aim of effecting a regime change agenda.\nI wish not to persecute, but merely state the facts:\nAn operational centre has been established by NUMSA/UF, and it will operate under the Political Centre – headed by top NUMSA/UFofficials.\nZwelinzima Vavi has been appointed at the head of the Operational Centre and the budget for his salary and office (including his staff) has been allocated.\nThe budget which will fund operations of the Operational Centre has been allocated – including the structure which will handle intelligence collection operations headed by Former South African Intelligence Minister, Ronnie Kasrils.\nNUMSA General Secretary, Irvin Jim, and Vavi are sourcing funding abroad. On 07 January 2015, a secret meeting was held at the Institute for Policy Studies offices in Washington – USA, to solicit funding and support from international sponsors, including software contractor Thoughtworks– which has “interests” in socio-political mattersof developing countries.\nWe, as the concerned workers, cannot be used by certain individuals for regime change strategies. If people want to change the current political regime in South Africa, they must do so using constitutional and legal means in the form of an electoral process. As concerned workers, we are not party to naïve and illegal strategies which these leaders want to employ. We will continue to expose them, whether under COSATU, NUMSA or the United Front.\nAs concerned workers, we also appeal to former Minister of Intelligence, Ronnie Kasrils, to refrain from engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing the country and to note that his underground work, locally and internationally, is known.\nMy final farewell and appreciation of opinion freedom", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T11:23:09.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
