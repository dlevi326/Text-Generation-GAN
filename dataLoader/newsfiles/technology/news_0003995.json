Secure does not mean unbreakable, it just means that iOS has currently the highest cost and complexity of vulnerability exploitation and here is where the million dollar iOS 9 bug bounty comes into play.\" \nZerodium says it rewards independent researchers for discovering new software vulnerabilities. It then analyses the security data to help corporate and government agency clients to beef up their online defences. \n\"The strength of iOS is essentially based on layers of security that are individually vulnerable but extremely effective together. It is nevertheless to possible to attack each of these elements, which is a fairly long and costly process,\" Bekrar told AFP. \nSeveral researchers had expressed interest in the bounty, said the Zerodium boss. \nApple had not been consulted about the bounty, he added. Apple, which launched iOS 9 on September 16, was not immediately available to comment. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T21:42:34.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
