More Yahoo’s options for Alibaba stake \nMatthew Prince, chief executive, said Cloudflare had focused on attracting large strategic investors that could help it in areas where it wanted to expand — China, mobile and large enterprises — and on preparing to go public some time from 2017. Cloudflare hopes that Microsoft will help it sell to large companies. \n“We were very flattered and honoured that a number of very large investors were interested,” he said. Fidelity led the fundraising round. \nCloudflare’s alliance with Baidu is designed to help speed web traffic across the so-called “Great Firewall”, which filters the internet into and out of China. An unusual structure called a virtual joint venture means Cloudflare does not operate within the country. \nMr Prince said Cloudflare had been at break even to slightly profitable on a GAAP basis over the past 18 months, with 75 per cent gross margin. He would not comment on Cloudflare’s valuation. \n“We continue to grow revenue at a rate that mirrors some of the best software-as-a-service companies like Workday and Salesforce,” he said. \nInvestment from venture capitalists and larger funds has been pouring into cyber security companies in the hope that they will sell more products to those increasingly worried about cyber attacks . FT Series \nCyber insecurity \nDevastating cyber attacks are on the rise, putting vast amounts of personal and business data at risk. FT examines how banks, companies and governments are trying to mount a concerted fightback against the hackers \nAfter high-profile data breaches at companies such as Sony Pictures and Ashley Madison, cyber security groups say boards are becoming more worried about the possibility of being crippled by an attack, and are prepared to spend more on security. \nHowever, some cyber security experts have warned that not every security technology company has an answer to the complex problem and some may be overvalued. \nOrion Hindawi, co-founder of Tanium, which raised $120m at a $3.5bn valuation this month, said at the time that venture capitalists were becoming “more disciplined” about who they were funding, recognising that some start-ups “didn’t do anything but spend a lot of money on sales and marketing”. \nMr Prince said the company had always taken a valuation lower than “the most aggressive” so that it could partner with the right investors and build a “healthy, sustainable business”.
