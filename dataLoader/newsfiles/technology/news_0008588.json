The Pakistani forces said they killed 13 of the attackers but it was unclear how many were involved in the assault.\nThe attack was a major blow for Pakistan's military, which stepped up operations against the militants following a horrific Taliban attack last December at a Peshawar school that killed 150 people, mostly children.\nThe attackers first stormed the guard room of the Badaber base, established in 1960s as an air force facility but mostly used as a residential place for air force employees and officers from Peshawar, according to air force officials.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T16:14:07.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
