The project will focus on developing numerical and analytical modelling of vibro-acoustics to quantitatively estimate noise radiation from axial flux motors. The project will involve close collaboration with a local company manufacturing electrical machines, YASA Motors, both to confirm the theoretical results and suggest new approaches to the management of noise and vibration. It is co-funded by YASA Motors and Oxford Brookes University. \nApplicants should have a good degree in mechanical engineering or a related field with exceptional background in mechanical vibrations, materials engineering and numerical modelling, especially dynamic analysis using Finite Element Method. \nThe Department of Mechanical Engineering and Mathematical Sciences of Oxford Brookes is a leading department providing education in the fields of motorsports and automotive engineering with an excellent track record of working with local industry in their endeavour of technical excellence. YASA Motors is a pioneer in the research and development of axial flux motors for uses ranging from automotive to power generation. YASA Motors are used to power the vehicle that holds the World Land Speed Record for electric vehicles. The company needs to continue to develop electrical machines that have world beating efficiencies and power to weight ratios. This project will keep the company at the leading edge of machine technology. More information on YASA Motors can be found at www.yasamotors.com . \nThis project will be supervised by Dr Anand Thite, Dr James Broughton and Dr Neil Fellows from Oxford Brookes University and Dr David Simkin from YASA Motors. \nThe Scholarship provides a stipend of £14,000 (with no inflation increase) and pays for Home/EU University fees. International students will themselves need to fund the difference between the International and Home/EU fees which for the 2015/16 academic year is £9888, and which may change incrementally in future years. \nIf you would like to apply you should request an application pack from the Faculty Research Support Office via the email address: tde-research-pgr@brookes.ac.uk , quoting ‘YASA PhD scholarship’. \nDeadline: The closing date for providing fully complete applications is 17:00 on Monday 16 November 2015 Share this PhD", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T17:49:10.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
