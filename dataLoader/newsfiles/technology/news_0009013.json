(See below for the full list) \nThe company had not previously disclosed which apps had been affected, although many had been identified by third parties. \nApple said on Sunday it was cleaning up its App Store after several cybersecurity firms reported that unknown hackers had embedded a malware, dubbed XcodeGhost, in hundreds, possibly thousands, of Chinese apps. \n“We have no information to suggest that the malware has been used to do anything malicious,” Apple said in its XcodeGhost Q&A Web page on Thursday. \nOther infected apps include Baidu’s Baidu Music app, a music app from Internet portal NetEase and the 58 Classified-Job, Used Cars, Rent app. \nTencent Holdings owns WeChat. \nThis is the first reported case of large number of malicious software programs making their way past Apple's stringent app review process. \nCyber security firm FireEye said earlier this week that the security breach was much bigger than previously thought, affecting more than 4,000 apps on the App Store, compared with the earlier estimate of 39. \nPrior to this attack, a total of just five malicious apps had ever been found in the App Store, according to cyber security firm Palo Alto Networks Inc. \nApple said on Thursday it was working with developers to get the apps back on the App Store and was blocking new apps that contained the malware. \nThe company also said some of the affected apps could be fixed through updates. \nThe hackers targeted the App Store using a counterfeit version of Xcode “toolkit”, Apple's app-building software. \nMany Chinese app developers downloaded the tainted software kit instead of the original one because of the slow download speeds from Apple's official servers located overseas. \nApple said it was working to make Xcode faster for Chinese developers to download. – Reuters \nThe top 25 apps:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T07:07:28.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
