Cox Foundation announced today a $288,500 grant to EveryoneOn. The grant will fund an innovative pilot program providing 1,500 tablet computers, preloaded with premium educational content, to families in Georgia who are enrolling in Cox Communications' Connect2Compete discounted internet service program. \nEveryoneOn is a national nonprofit working to eliminate the digital divide by making high-speed, low-cost Internet service, computers and free digital literacy courses accessible to all unconnected Americans. Connect2Compete (C2C) is EveryoneOn's flagship program offered in partnership with Internet service providers and available to K-12 students and their families who qualify for the National School Lunch Program. \n\"More than half of the families who have enrolled in the Connect2Compete program have seen improved grades for children in the home,\" said Alex Taylor, Executive Vice President of Cox Enterprises and a trustee of the James M. Cox Foundation. \"We are proud to extend our support of EveryoneOn through this grant, providing families with increased access to the tools necessary to compete in today's digital world.\" \nThe initiative funded by the James M. Cox Foundation combines low-cost internet service with affordable hardware. The tablets will come with pre-loaded, best-in-class educational content from Read Right from the Start, Discovery Education and ABCMouse.com and will be available to eligible families at a deeply discounted price of $30. \nEligibility for the pilot program will be expanded to include families with children enrolled in Head Start and Early Head Start programs. \n\"There are three key barriers to broadband adoption: affordability, access to hardware and understanding the relevancy to one's education and economic prospects,\" said Zach Leverenz, founder and CEO of EveryoneOn. \"Cox continues to be a strong leader of these three pillars through innovative internet adoption programs, and is helping us make great strides toward narrowing the digital divide.\" \nThe grant was announced at a ceremony at the Museum of Arts and Sciences, before an audience of business and community leaders. \n\"Over the past two years the Bibb County School District has worked diligently to modernize its technology infrastructure and to provide students and staff with access to cutting edge technology in our classrooms,\" said Bibb County School District Superintendent Dr. Curtis Jones , Jr. \"We are excited that this new program will help reinforce what is taught in school by helping to make technology in the home a reality for 1,500 deserving Middle Georgia families.\" \nCox was a founding partner of Connect2Compete , and the program is modeled after a broadband adoption program the company launched in California in 1999. Since 2012, Cox has connected more than 100,000 low-income Americans to the internet through the Connect2Compete program. \nFor more information about the devices, please visit www.everyoneon.org . \nAbout The James M.
