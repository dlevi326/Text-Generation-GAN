The company’s assessment will focus on ways to reduce business risks and costs, while promoting productivity. The assessment, valued at $199, will run through September 30, 2015. “If we hadn’t already discussed the security and compliance risks of continued use of expired operating systems or any other outdated business software, then during September we will talk to our existing clients about getting their business software updated to protect important information and data,” said Rich O’Keefe, president, Your Tech Team. “Our assessment focuses on the risks that can lead to loss of data, poorly performing systems and decreased productivity across the board, and how migrating to new versions of operating systems will reduce costs and greatly improve business efficiency.”\nAlready, much time has passed since Microsoft ended all levels of support for Windows XP and Server 2003. Those businesses that have chosen to remain with these systems and don't upgrade to a newer supported version, face exposing business data, financial records and network stability to detrimental risks, including cyberattacks.\nWithout critical security updates, PCs become vulnerable to harmful viruses, spyware and other malicious software which can steal or damage business data and information. Antivirus software is no longer able to fully protect businesses from using unsupported Windows, and hacking attacks or malware intrusion is a greater possibility. Credit card industries (PCI) and government regulations (HIPAA) require security patching and protections on computers that house records and personal data. A security audit failure or loss of client or patient data results in hefty financial fees and penalties. When unsecure systems are compromised, malicious software takes control of computers causing slower work flow, unreliable performance and system crashes. The end result is significant downtime and low productivity. Third-party software vendors are likely to be unable to help with operational support for their products without businesses also having an updated and supported version. Likely, vendors won’t accept the responsibility of problems that might develop if businesses continue to use unsupported and unsecured software.
