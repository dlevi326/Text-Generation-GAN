It's not just about privacy or respect for the laws of other countries, but how a law passed in 1986 — before email, instant messaging and social media — should now be applied in a digital world where communications and technologies continue to evolve,\" said Newman.\nIf American companies can't protect customer privacy for information stores elsewhere, the concern is that foreign companies that can make a privacy promise and stay outside the jurisdiction of U.S. law enforcement could take business away from them.\n1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1EVq1bq TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EVq1bq&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/08/USATODAY/usatsports/ap_microsoft_mover_70369726.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1EVq1bq", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/adfec0678da49bb96878f0cae11af19a9e2078f0/c=128-0-896-576&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/08/USATODAY/usatsports/ap_microsoft_mover_70369726.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EVq1bq&text=Microsoft%20argues%20email%20stored%20in%20Ireland%20not%20subject%20to%20search%20warrant&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33d97f8a03d5ea06baca0f7a30eca34c8bd87643/r=500x281/local/-/media/2015/09/08/USATODAY/usatsports/ap_microsoft_mover_70369726.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-09T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:19:49.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
