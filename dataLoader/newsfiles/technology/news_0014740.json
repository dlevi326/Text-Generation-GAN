It automatically tests different combinations of those locations and sizes and displays the winning combinations that earn the publisher the most revenue more frequently. \n\"The existing tools and plugins for ad location testing are amazingly simplistic in their approach,\" says Dwayne Lafleur, Founder & CEO of Ezoic. \"For example, each ad on a page affects the performance of other ads. Existing tools test and measure each ad separately as though there is nothing else on the page. It's terrible and it's costing publishers hundreds of millions of dollars each year and making the experience worse for visitors. Ezoic Lite uses multivariate testing and machine learning to account for this interaction effect and user behavior to find the best combinations.\" \nWith Ezoic Lite, publishers can quickly and easily create many ad units, each with multiple ad sizes to test, and place them all on their site. Ezoic Lite shows the appropriate number of ads on a page, tests different combinations, and learns what works best for each page, device and visitor. \n\"The lack of proper tools to help publishers find the best ad locations is shocking. To be effective, tools need to take in to account a large number of factors that influence the performance of ad locations - including the device type and screen size, traffic sources, details of the visitor and the type of content on a page. Ezoic Lite does all the heavy lifting for you - and best of all - it's available for free for everyone to use today.
