Taking place in a remote underwater research facility, it plays on fears of the deep sea, of drowning and darkness and the disturbing alien lifeforms that dwell down there – all a welcome change from the mansions and asylums that tend to haunt horror titles. But the sea is rarely a threat – the ocean floor is often just a beautiful corridor between the underwater bases in which you experience more traditional horror gaming fare: ie running away from monsters. The thing is, this game is horrifying enough without them.\nSoma is essentially an existential nightmare about personal identity. “Soma” is Greek for “body”, as in “psychosomatic”, but the question Soma asks is whether identity can continue through psychology alone.\n\nEarly in the game, the player character comes across a robot that’s convinced it’s human, specifically that it’s the person whose memories occupy its robotic brain. Whether or not you believe that psychological continuity ensures personal identity, to progress you have to disable the robot, potentially killing a person who’s aware of your actions. As in The Swapper, in which you solve puzzles by creating clones of your character that you then kill, the interactivity makes this philosophical exploration far more impactful than the same topic considered in a book or a film.\nIf at times the point is hammered home a little too strongly by Simon, the protagonist, wondering aloud to himself or to guide Catherine, the personality of the characters makes up for it. Simon’s reactions are admirably authentic, sometimes overwhelmed but mostly determined and with a sense of humour that might sound inappropriate but seems a realistic survival mechanism. Catherine is rational, reassuring, but with her own interests beyond those of the player character. Their relationship threads through the story and holds it together in a way that pure environmental storytelling might not.\nThat said, the world of Soma is absolutely full of detail. Each underwater base tells a different part of the story. Interaction with some objects will trigger audio clips of past conversations, a standard for exploratory games that’s actually given a reasonable explanation in this one. But you also get a lot of information just by looking around, from big scenes like a bloody corpse with a drill in its hand to smaller touches like a game of hangman with the answer “quantum mechanics”.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest There are plenty of notes and log entries to read, and an explorative player can piece together a surprising amount of detail given that in many horror stories fear comes from the unknown Photograph: Frictional \nImportant items need to be discovered and collected, but there’s also a third way to interact with the world. Like Amnesia: Dark Descent, Soma is a tactile game. You don’t click to open a door but click and hold then drag the mouse to push or pull. Finding a voice recorder feels like more of an achievement, the audio clip more of a narrative reward, when you physically yanked open a drawer to see it. This system is also used to solve puzzles, as you pick up and drag a cable to plug it in elsewhere, or throw something heavy at a window to shatter it.\n\nThe detailed environments and methods of interaction make Soma feel at times like a “walking simulator”, but progress from area to area is much more involved than in the likes of Gone Home or Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture. While some tasks are familiar, like moving a battery from socket to socket to open doors (a process obviously designed to allow the time needed for the concurrent conversation between Catherine and Simon), others are unique. At one point, Simon has to do some programming, enabling and disabling components of a program without enough memory for all of them when each relies on the inclusion of others.\nSometimes it’s unclear what exactly you’re supposed to do next, but you can’t stray too far off course and a bit of wandering around will eventually lead you to the necessary action. Occasional confusion is an acceptable trade off for the welcome variety in your tasks, which reinforces the strength of the narrative and maintains interest throughout the 10 or so hours of play.\nNaturally, the end goal is to escape, but what stands in your way is the game’s one slightly disappointing adherence to horror norms. The monsters. Each new area is inhabited by a roving unkillable beastie so you must perform each task while staying hidden. \nFrictional Games has a history with this kind of horror, and on a basic level it works: crouching in a corner while a mutated silhouette in the doorway scans the shadows is tense. But the first time a monster gets you, the effect is immediately lessened. One hit won’t kill; instead, the player character will awaken in the same spot with a limp and a blur to his vision that makes the world look like it’s been RGB split in After Effects. If you’re hit again before you can heal you’ll die. Disturbingly, you heal through interaction with flesh-like orifices scattered around the environment. Initially, you just have to touch them but with time, you need to insert a finger, then a fist, prompting violent contractions. Some players will find this much more disturbing than the monsters.\nWhile it’s a shock the first time something rushes towards you and the screen goes black, the fear soon gives way to frustration. More frustrating though is the fact that these monster jump scares seem so unnecessary – it’s as if the developer threw them in after worrying that they were deviating too far from horror game conventions. There’s a narrative explanation for their presence, but its resolution is unsatisfactory. The tension would have been increased if their existence remained hinted at for most of the adventure, rather than resorting to regimented sections of hide and seek.\nWith such interesting interactions above and beyond the continual exploration and discovery, these monster sections just feel totally unnecessary. Worse than that, their existence makes other parts of the game seem duller: because you have to carry out tasks in a rush before you’re spotted and repeat them if you’re hit, those evocative environments are often reduced to mere mazes.\n\nSoma tells an affective tale and carries the horror genre a few steps forward. Had Frictional shown the courage to shake off tradition entirely, it could have carried it further still.\nFrictional; PC(version tested)/PS4; £23; Pegi: 16+", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T16:54:41.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
