(Photo: Elizabeth Weise)\n20 CONNECT 101 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE REDMOND, Wash. — The head of China's office of Cyberspace Administration likened the U.S. and China to two men in a boat during a storm.\nIn an ancient Chinese legend, the men realized that only by ceasing to quarrel and instead working together were they able to stabilize the craft and land safely on dry land, said Lu Wei, director of the Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization, China's top cyber policy making body\n\"In today's world, the boat of the Internet carries more than two men, it carries more than the United States and China,\" Lu said. \"It carries several billion people.\"\nHe spoke at the eighth annual U.S.-China Internet Industry Forum, which was held at Microsoft's conference center on its campus in Redmond, Wash. Microsoft hosted, but did not sponsor, the event.\nLu reiterated a long-standing Chinese line, that both nations are the victims of cyber hackers and cybercriminals.\nThe United States' stance is that China is behind many cyber-related thefts of commercial trade secrets at U.S. companies.\nUSA TODAY\nCyerbsecurity, human rights top Obama-Xi visit\nGeorge Kurtz, CEO of Crowdstrike, an Irvine, Calif.-based computer security company, said his staff can tell is a high degree of certainty when they're dealing with attackers from China.\nThe hackers work business hours in China's time zone, take off the week of Chinese New Year and target intellectual property the Chinese are known to be deficient in, he said.\nFor example, Crowdstrike works with companies in the oil and gas industry. It learned there were three Chinese deficiencies in that realm — seismic technology used to map and find oil reserves, deep water drilling below 300 meters, and technology used to clean up oil spills.\n\"Well, that's what they started to steal,\" he said.\nPresident Obama recently alluded to the possibility of economic sanctions against China should such intellectual property attacks continue.\nOn Tuesday, however, White House spokesman Ben Rhodes said the administration wouldn't impose economic sanctions against China over cyber attacks before Xi arrives in Washington, D.C., on Thursday.\nSome in the cybersecurity world feel that sanctions are critical to getting things to change.\nIn the realm of intellectual property theft, without sanctions \"the Chinese are just going to laugh at us. They don't care about words, they care about actions,\" said Richard Bejtlich, a security analyst at the computer-security company FireEye, and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\nIn a speech Tuesday night in Seattle, President Xi Jinping said \"the Chinese government will not engage in commercial theft or encourage or support such theft by anyone,\" and that such attacks are crimes that \"must be punished in accordance with the law and relevant international treaties.\"\n\"China is ready to set up a high-level, joint dialog mechanism with the United States on fighting cybercrime,\" Xi said.\nThere is an expectation that during Xi's visit to Washington, he and Obama will announce an agreement \"on principals governing the use of cyberattacks against critical infrastructure, such as utility plants,\" said data privacy expert Fred Cate, a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law.\nAlthough the proposed agreement is \"narrow and unlikely to have much immediate effect,\" it is \"a significant improvement over the U.S. administration's prior approach of 'naming and shaming' the Chinese publicly,\" Cate said.\nLu reiterated that, saying the two nations must work together \"to reach our destination, which is the happiness of all mankind.\"\nHe called for a new pattern of relationship between the two great powers, based more on confidence \"to avoid strategic misinterpretation.\"\nLu said his nation is a vital market for tech companies in the United States, calling it \"a blessed land for U.S. companies,\" with more than 600 million of China citizens online.\n\"A lot of U.S. enterprises have enjoyed more profits from the Chinese market than the profits they get from the U.S. market,\" Lu said.\nDifferences must be resolved through cooperation. \"We are on the same boat and no body should even think about pushing anyone off the boat,\" he said.\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Elizabeth Weise on Twitter: @eweise.\n20 CONNECT 101 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 3 //usat.ly/1KvJtuJ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1KvJtuJ", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d4bdce3289de07efad2ecc83f933bf386ede20eb/c=0-221-2837-1824&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635785405153735751-AP-OBAMA-G7-63108982-1-.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KvJtuJ&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2015/09/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635786229139619351-forum-photo.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635786229139619351-forum-photo.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d206d7dc2d214bf5a65d2d605cee210e2b9a9c4f/c=4-0-3260-2448&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635786229139619351-forum-photo.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KvJtuJ&text=China%3A%20On%20cybersecurity%2C%20U.S.%20must%20not%20rock%20the%20boat&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-09-24T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T03:41:13.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
