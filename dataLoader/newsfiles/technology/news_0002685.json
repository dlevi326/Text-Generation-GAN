These ‘dev kits’ include programming code libraries and comprehensive, step-by-step instructions to securely connect and integrate these platforms with the Cloud-based deviceWISE IoT Platform – making it easy for developers to exchange data between devices and web-based and mobile apps, manage data plans, perform remote firmware updates and execute all other essential IoT functions. \nThe developer kits are an integral part of Telit’s deviceWISE Ready program, promoting the creation of end-to-end IoT solutions, from IoT prototyping to wide-scale commercial deployments. “deviceWISE Ready” promotes interoperability between third party devices and the deviceWISE IoT Platform, thus reducing the risk, time-to-market, complexity and cost of IoT deployments. A comprehensive certification process assures customers that products have been engineered and tested for simple, quick, and reliable integration with the deviceWISE IoT Platform. \nDevelopers are now able to download the deviceWISE Developer Kits and also access a free trial of the deviceWISE IoT Platform . Additional kits will be added on demand and developers are encouraged to contribute their libraries for new platforms. Individuals and organizations can also accelerate their IoT projects by using the deviceWISE Asset Gateway, which features superior edge-intelligence logic and has already been embedded on a wide variety of full-featured industrial-grade IoT gateways from product partners . \n“Telit recognizes that the maker community is the creative and dynamic core of the IoT developer community that plays a critical role in accelerating broad adoption of the IoT,” said John Keever, CTO Telit IoT Platforms. “We offer extensive developer resources and support, hardware and software, developer kits and free trials to get started.” \nTelit will feature live demonstrations of numerous deviceWISE Ready developer kits on the company’s exhibit, booth 5032, at CTIA 2015. \nAbout Telit \nTelit (AIM: TCM), is the global leader in Internet of Things (IoT) enablement. The company offers the industry’s broadest portfolio of integrated products and services for end-to-end IoT deployments – including cellular communication modules in all technologies, GNSS, short-to-long range wireless modules, IoT connectivity plans and IoT platform services.
