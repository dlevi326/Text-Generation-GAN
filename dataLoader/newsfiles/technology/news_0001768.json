(NASDAQ: AXGN), a leader in developing and marketing innovative surgical solutions for peripheral nerve injuries, today announced its participation in the 2015 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) 97th Annual Meeting taking place at Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington D. C. AxoGen will exhibit its proprietary portfolio of peripheral nerve repair products including Avance® Nerve Graft, AxoGuard® Nerve Connector and AxoGuard® Nerve Protector, at Booth #244 from October 1-3, 2015. “Trigeminal nerve injuries can have a devastating impact on patient quality of life. Patients with trigeminal nerve injuries may suffer from pain, discomfort and loss of sensation in the mouth,” says Erick DeVinney, AxoGen’s Vice President of Clinical and Translational Sciences. “AxoGen is committed to raising awareness on the repair options for these nerve injuries and to supporting educational efforts for surgeons actively treating or referring patients with nerve injuries. We are pleased to be able to support the AAOMS with educational materials both during the exhibit and other activities throughout the conference.”\nAbout the Trigeminal Nerve\nThe trigeminal nerve is a peripheral nerve responsible for sensation in the mouth and taste. A common cause of damage to the trigeminal nerve is the extraction of third molars (wisdom teeth) and injury caused by the placement of dental implants. The trigeminal nerve can also be injured due to certain jaw alignment and tumor removal surgeries as well as by trauma to the face.\nAbout AxoGen, Inc.\nAxoGen (NASDAQ: AXGN) is a leading medical technology company dedicated to peripheral nerve repair.
