Could not subscribe, try again later SWNS One expensive mother: The Apple-1 \nOne of the very first ever computers hand-built by Apple is set to fetch more than £330,000 when it goes to auction this month - 500 TIMES its original value. \nThe Apple-1 was in the first batch of 50 computers for Apple’s first client, the Byte Shop, and was hand-made in a garage by pioneering Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. \nThe 1976 motherboard was bought by a man who traded it in at a computer shop in Florida after using it just once or twice, and it has sat on a shelf ever since. \nOwner Tom Romkey dusted it off after he spotted a similar gadget - in worse condition - sell at auction for a world record £563,904 last year. \nAnd when experts took a look they were amazed to discover the computer - which originally cost just $666 - was fully functional and the best preserved version ever seen. Reuters Pioneers: Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak \nIt is set to go under the hammer in Bonhams in New York later this month with a conservative estimate of £330,000 (or $500,000). \nAuctioneer Cassandra Hatton, Bonhams’ director of History of Science and Technology, said: “This is from the first batch of 50 because they received an order from the Byte Shop who put inventory numbers on them with a security pen. \n“It’s astonishing it has survived. \n“When you are dealing with Apple-1 computers there are three things you want to see; the security pen number, that it’s operational and the condition. \n“This one is working and we have a video of it in operation, and if the condition of the one we sold last year was eight out of ten, this one is 9.7 or even ten out of ten. \n“Most were bought by hobbyists so you see their physical record, the scratches, and many were recycled into Apple 2s. SWNS Under hammer: The 1976 motherboard \n“But this was only used once because the owner hated it. \n“He asked Tom Romkey to trade it in. \n“It was probably the worst financial transaction in history. \n“The owner had built a box for it and Tom put it on the shelf and it was quickly obsolete and he just had it sitting there until he saw last year’s sale. \n“He called me the next day and flew in. \n“Usually things in a superior condition sell for more so it could break the record, but we don’t really know how big the market is so we’ve got the same estimate as we had last year.” \nThe pre-assembled computer is just a motherboard that required the owner to provide a screen, keyboard and casing. Getty Apple founder: Steve Jobs \nIt was first demonstrated by Steve Wozniak at a computer fair in California, and with his high-school friend Steve Jobs, they obtained their first order of 50. \nThe order - which this version was part of - was built in Jobs’ garage in just 30 days, and eventually 200 were made. \nThis computer was brought to the Personal Computer Store in Florida in the early 1980s, where owner Tom Romkey accepted it as a trade in. \nBut it quickly became obsolete and was kept by him on a shelf, untouched until he saw the record sale at Bonhams in October last year. \nHe called Bonhams and hopped on a plane to New York with his precious piece of circuitry, and it goes under the hammer on September 21. \nOnly 66 surviving authentic Apple-1’s are currently listed on the official Apple 1 Registry. \nCorey Cohen, Apple-1 expert and member of the Board of Directors for Mid-Atlantic Retro Computing Hobbyists Museum said: “It’s in incredible condition. \n“It’s nearly 40 years old, next year. \n“It’s one of the best condition Apple-1s we’ve ever seen - not just at auction, but at any physical place at all.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T01:32:55.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
