Bloomberg NBN have chosen a French company, Arianespace , to get the satellite to its orbit position, which is just over one-tenth of the way to the moon. The French are more expensive than the Russians but also more reliable. The Ariane 5-type rocket the NBN is using – not dissimilar to an intercontinental ballistic missile but with civilian cargo where the nuclear warhead used to be – has experienced 67 successful launches in a row.\nBut things could go wrong. And what happens if it does?\nThe NBN's so-called \"long-term satellite service\" plan is what Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull once described when he was shadow communications minister as the \"Rolls Royce\" option.\nThe NBN's 6.4 tonne \"Sky Muster\" satellite during the construction phase. Supplied Which is to say it is very expensive. Chosen by the former Labor government, Sky Muster is just one part of the overall long-term system. A second satellite will be launched in the first half of 2016, and 10 ground stations are needed for support; the total price will be about $2 billion. This means the cost of connecting about 3 per cent of the population to the NBN accounts for almost 10 per cent of the total $45 billion-$56 billion budget - people in urban areas are subsidising their remote counterparts.\n#SkyMuster in launch configuration before moving to French Guiana. #nbn #satellite This is one cool machine @sslmda pic.twitter.com/HYhRf7cmmr\n— karina keisler (@karinakeisler) August 26, 2015\nSo if there is problem with the launch or the complicated deployment of the satellite into its pre-arranged \"slot\" in space where it will orbit the earth at speeds of up 11,000 kilometres an hour it will be costly. Particularly, when most rocket operators including Arianespace get paid regardless of the success of the mission (they argue they cannot afford to cover the risk of a failure themselves).\nHowever, taxpayers will be covered by one of the larger and more complicated insurance policies the government holds. Signed with multiple underwriters (the exposure is too big for one insurer to manage) and organised by insurance brokers Marsh , the policy should ensure that the NBN is not out of pocket if anything goes wrong.\nThe policy covers any launch failure and certain mishaps and problems for 12 months once Sky Muster is in space. Insurance is a critical part of this expensive project. Little wonder a representative from Marsh's Singapore office will be joining the NBN officials watching the launch from Cayenne.\nBut the real cost of any launch failure is time. Under the current oversubscribed interim satellite service used by people in remote areas, which relies on spare capacity from private operators such as Optus, download limits are severely limited. Once you use up your allocations, speeds are diabolically slow. \"The state of broadband in regional Australia at the moment is absolutely woeful,\" NFF general manager of rural affairs and agribusiness Charlie Thomas recently told The Australian Financial Review .\nIf Sky Muster were to explode, people in remote areas would have to rely on the interim service until the second satellite was launched, which could be eight months away. Satellites take years to construct and launch so a second satellite would not be orbiting the earth until at least 2019. This is a problem given many experts predict demand for broadband will be so strong that the NBN will struggle to meet this demand with the two it plans to launch.\nSlow broadband in rural and remote areas is a political problem for the government too. In recent months, Turnbull has sold Sky Muster as an answer to the bush's problems.\nAs embarrassing as an explosion off the coast of French Guiana on Thursday morning would be, the cost can be recovered. It's the delay in providing acceptable broadband to 600,000 Australians that will be the problem for the new prime minister.\n* The reporter travelled to Cayenne as a guest of the NBN.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/SkyMuster?src=hash", "http://t.co/HYhRf7cmmr", "https://twitter.com/sslmda", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/satellite?src=hash", "http://australia.marsh.com/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/NKRT2BRN2HM", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/nbn?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/karinakeisler/status/636485338299396097", "http://www.arianespace.com/index/index.asp"], "published": "2015-09-30T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:17:39.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
