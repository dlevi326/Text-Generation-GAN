They are big and they are a little intimidating,” said Hugo Swart, senior product development manager with Qualcomm. “So what we have done is put all technology required for a drone on a very small board, using a Snapdragon mobile chip. With this board, we plan to support customers that will bring to market small, flying cameras, and make it much more user friendly.”\nCalifornia Inc. business newsletter Sign up for our business newsletter for the week's top business headlines from the editors of The San Diego Union-Tribune and the LA Times.

Snapdragon Flight is expected to power flying cameras drones that would retail for about $300, said Swart.\nYuneec, a Hong Kong developer of consumer and professional drones, will be the first company to release a drone based on the Snapdragon Flight platform in 2016, according to Qualcomm. Yuneec recently raised $60 million in venture capital, with Qualcomm rival Intel leading the funding round.\nKeeping with the flying camera theme, Snapdragon Flight supports ultra-high-definition 4K for video and still photography.\n“Drones are enabling a broad range of applications such as aerial photography, the ultimate selfie accessory and sports filming, so the ability to shoot in 4K is a must-have feature,” said Raj Talluri, senior vice president of product development.\nIt has Snapdragon 801 processors to power its applications. Other features include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS, as well as display technologies that enable wireless streaming. That allows users to see on their smartphones what the drone camera is filming in flight, said Swart.\nIt also enables additional, downward-facing cameras and software that are designed to help stabilize the drone by recognizing a spot on the ground.\nIn a demonstration Thursday, a Qualcomm technician pointed a leaf blower at a prototype, small flying camera drone powered by Snapdragon Flight to simulate wind. When the leaf blower was lowered, the drone returned to the location that its stabilization cameras recognized as its original hover point.\n“If you buy a small drone, it is very difficult to operate because it only uses a few sensors to try to make it stable,” said Swart. “The technology we are putting in adds cameras to make a drone hold on a position. That makes it much more user friendly.”\nMike Freeman   More from Mike Freeman ViaSat looks to offer in-flight Wi-Fi to Boeing customers Qualcomm cuts 1,314 jobs in San Diego San Diego's HouseCall raises $6 million", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:13:01.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
