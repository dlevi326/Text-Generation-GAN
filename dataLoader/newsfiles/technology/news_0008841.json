Sreenivasan, dean and president of the NYU School of Engineering. \"It is an important validation of our success in developing the School of Engineering as a vibrant and rigorous institution of higher education.\" \nThe accreditation is valid through 2021 and includes all engineering degree programs at NYU Abu Dhabi. \nBased in Brooklyn, New York , the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering educates more than 5,100 baccalaureate, graduate, and doctoral students in engineering, applied sciences, and technology management. Its three academic focal areas are civil and urban engineering, digital information technology, and health and wellness. Its digital and compuer game design program has been recognized by The Princeton Review. \nKnown throughout New York City for its startup incubators, the school integrates entrepreneurship and innovation throughout its academics and culture. Every first-year undergraduate student is introduced to noted inventors and the communication and entrepreneurial skills they will need to advocate for their own inventions through the Innovation and Technology Forum. Student clubs, maker spaces, contests, internship opportunities at the incubators, and faculty entrepreneur-mentors add to the atmosphere that drives ideas from the laboratories to the wider world. \nLong committed to cultural and economic diversity, the NYU School of Engineering educates many Pell Grant-eligible students and those who are the first in their families to attend college. It has been recognized by PayScale and a recent Brookings Institution study , among others, for graduating baccalaureate students who go on to earn some of the highest salaries in any fieldâ€”one indicator of the value of its academic rigor. \nThe NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering dates to 1854, when the NYU School of Civil Engineering and Architecture as well as the Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute (widely known as Brooklyn Poly) were founded. Their successor institutions merged in January 2014 to create a comprehensive school of education and research in engineering and applied sciences, rooted in a tradition of invention, innovation and entrepreneurship. In addition to programs at its main campus in downtown Brooklyn , it is closely connected to engineering programs in NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai, and it operates business incubators in downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn .
