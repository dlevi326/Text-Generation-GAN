But effective immediately, beIN Media Group will assume full control of all of its channels in the Asian market. The company believes that by taking full control it can now fully implement its market strategy in the region in terms of production, expanded programming and content. \nbeIN's recently acquired exclusive TV rights to Spain's La Liga, so that matches featuring the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid and Lionel Messi's Barcelona will now be available in-country on its fully acquired channels in Asia. \nCommenting on the news, beIN Media Group chairman and CEO Nasser Al Khelaifi said: \"Our priority is to continue expanding our reach in Asia. Our latest Australian acquisition has been very successful. Our intention is to continue in building a solid network of countries in the Asia Pacific region and deliver world-class content and stellar sports programming in markets with high growth potential.\" \nAdded MP & Silva CEO Marco Auletta: \"We are very proud of what we have achieved. This JV has shown the unique capability and expertise of MP & Silva in pioneering a new way of media rights distribution in Southeast Asian markets. It has successfully created more competition in the region for the benefit of both rights holders and fans.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T11:15:54.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
