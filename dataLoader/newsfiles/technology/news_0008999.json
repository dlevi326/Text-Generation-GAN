Crafted by leading industrial designer Yves Behar, Jawbone's new UP activity trackers feature slim and stylish designs that allow for 24/7 wear and can be easily accessorized with jewelry or watches on the wrist. \nUP2, previously only offered in Black Diamond and Light Grey Hex with classic flat straps, is now available in 6 stunning new colors, 5 of which feature an all-new design with two lightweight thin straps - giving the slim tracker an even more fashionable and unique look and feel. The selection of new colors for UP2 include Turquoise Circle, Oat Spectrum, Gunmetal Hex, Orchid Circle and Black Diamond with the new lightweight thin straps, along with Violet Circle with the classic flat strap. \nUP3, Jawbone's advanced multi-sensor tracker, is now available in 4 additional colors, including Indigo Twist, Ruby Cross, Sand Twist and Teal Cross, in addition to the previously available colors, Black Twist and Silver Cross. \nFeature Updates for UP2(TM), UP3(TM) & UP4(TM) \nA free over-the-air firmware update through the UP App will be released today to UP2, UP3 and UP4 users, enabling new features including, Automatic Sleep Detection and Passive Heart Rate monitoring. \nWith this new update, UP2, UP3 and UP4 users no longer need to tap the band to enter and exit sleep mode. The UP band now automatically detects when the user has fallen asleep at night and when they wake up in the morning. The system will continue to recognize and track detailed sleep stages, with UP3 and UP4 still capturing REM, Light and Deep sleep. \nThe feature update today also adds Passive Heart Rate tracking to Jawbone's multi-sensor trackers, UP3 and UP4, which previously only measured Resting Heart Rate and heart rate throughout the night. While Resting Heart Rate is one of the best indicators of overall heart health, the addition of Passive Heart Rate throughout the day gives users a more complete picture of their heart health. \nPassive Heart Rate is taken periodically throughout the day when the user is still, and provides unique insight into how daily influences and choices such as diet, caffeine, stressful meetings, and other stimuli can affect heart rate and overall heart health. As UP captures a user's Passive Heart Rate over time, Smart Coach will have a more complete picture of the user's overall health and patterns, providing more tailored and customized advice based on the user's baseline heart rate measurements. \nThese new features were extensively tested in an open beta trial over the past month and have been widely welcomed by the UP community as a significant enhancement to the overall user experience. \nAvailable September 8 \nThe UP2 tracker by Jawbone is available in 6 new colors, 5 of which include an all-new strap design, for $99.99 on Jawbone.com and Amazon beginning today. -- UP2 Violet Circle Classic Strap -- UP2 Orchid Circle Lightweight Thin Straps -- UP2 Turquoise Circle Lightweight Thin Straps -- UP2 Oat Spectrum Lightweight Thin Straps -- UP2 Gunmetal Hex Lightweight Thin Straps -- UP2 Black Diamond Lightweight Thin Straps \nThe new UP2 with lightweight thin straps will also be available on BestBuy.com and Target.com starting today with availability in Best Buy, Target and Apple stores coming in the following weeks. \nThe UP3 tracker by Jawbone is available for in 4 new colors for $179.99 on Jawbone.com beginning today.
