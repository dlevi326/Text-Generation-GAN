And we're pretty sure we're going to see at least one new iPhone next week, unless Apple completely bucks tradition. \nBut the rumour mill is looking pretty good on the appearance of an iPhone 6S and an iPhone 6S Plus, which would be in keeping with Apple's standard product cycle. \nSo what will we see on the new iPhone? The biggest main feature addition that analysts and tech reporters expect is Force Touch. That's right, just in time for the big Star Wars push, Apple is adding the force to its iPhone. \nForce Touch is a feature that's already on the Apple Watch and the newest MacBook – it's a sort of right-click for touch-sensitive screens, or the long press on Android devices. Pushing down more vigorously on a touchscreen or, in the case of the MacBook, touchpad, brings up other options, which in turn can expand the options Apple users have to interact with their apps. \nThe new iPhones are expected to be a little thicker to accommodate this technology, according to a post from MacRumors. There's also speculation, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, that the next iPhone will also have rose gold color option similar to what we've seen on the Apple Watch. Unlike the super-expensive rose gold watch, however, the pinkish phone is expected to be made of aluminum. \nThe new phone is also expected to have an upgraded camera. According to 9 t0 5 Mac's Mark Gurman, the new phones will have a 12 MP camera that shoots in 4K, as well as a flash for selfies. (Because we all know there's nothing worse than a dim selfie.) \nOverall, the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are expected to be a minor upgrade for 6 and 6 Plus users, though possibly more attractive to those still rocking the iPhone 5S or earlier models. \nAs for non-phone news, the expectation is that Apple is also going to show off a new Apple TV set-top box, giving the product its first major upgrade in several years. The new box is expected to launch without Apple's expected TV service, which reports indicate is still hung up in negotiations. A new report from Variety indicates that Apple itself may also be looking into producing original content. \nStill, we're unlikely to hear much, if anything, about that next week. Gurman, who's a very reliable source for Apple news, has reported that the new box could cost in the neighborhood of $200 (R2,700) – far more than the $99 of the previous Apple TV, which Apple had discounted even further to $69. \nThe new Apple TV is expected to have some new features to explain the price, including built-in support for the Siri voice assistant and a revamped remote. The remote, Gurman reports, could possibly include a more traditional remote sensor, so that you can use it to control older devices as well as Bluetooth-enabled gadgets. – Washington Post For more tech news follow @IOLScitech on Twitter Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T12:39:35.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
