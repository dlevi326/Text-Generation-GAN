The dating app is misnamed – excuse me, dating? What quaint and mouldy concept is that? Are you saying you actually want to get to know someone before sleeping with them? Tinder is a shagging app, a hook-up app; a game-changer in the arcane rituals of courting that’s revolutionising the western world. It’s geared towards the sex-for-sex’s-sake habits of the predatory male and yet women are flocking to it. But aren’t we females devaluing ourselves in the process? The app is massively morphing the rules of courtship with increased pressure on women to succumb, sexually, after the first meeting. What bleak world is this?\nRuth Ostrow: Online dating still works\nTinder is fast. Brutal. Too easy, sexually. It’s about instant results in an instant world where everything is at our fingertips to consume, quick. The swiping motion – left to reject a stranger’s picture, right to accept a hook-up – feels like a natural consequence of this selfie-obsessed world. Yet, like air-conditioning thermostats set too low in offices, the swiping motion seems to me to have been set up by men, for men. It’s dating that’s all about prowling, discarding, hitting on, rejecting, gaming. But real, fragile lives are involved (thank God you only know if you’ve been accepted, never how many rejections you’ve had). Research shows men outnumber women two to one on the site, and are three times more likely to swipe right. The brushing motion is bleeding into advertising too – so, let’s see, products to buy/women to sleep with – what’s the difference?\nBettina Arndt: The disappearing female libido\nAs a woman looking for a lasting relationship, how to make Tinder work? Set your boundaries. Stick to them. Have your radar on alert for what, exactly, a potential suitor wants from the situation – and what he really, really doesn’t. Because the last thing many users are after is something enduring. And if you truly desire a multifarious sexual life of instant gratification with no consequences and no follow-up, well, go for it. But as a woman, can you sustain it? I can’t think of a single girlfriend who’s really, deep down, desired that.\nThe app appeals to brains wired on the gaming culture. It’s all about hits and competitiveness, and moving on fast. Tinder itself defends its operations, saying the No.1 reason people use its services is for “dating”. But to me it’s the app equivalent of wolf-whistling on the street – giving a woman the come-on and then having her accept the call. But it’s reducing her to a dispiriting commodity; a moment of sexual gratification before the next Tinder conquest is found. There’s even a profoundly depressing name among male users for the Tinder women: a Tinderella. Right, so come midnight, the ball’s over and what follows is deflation and rejection all over again. Yet a fair few single 20-somethings I know see it as a normal part of their world: have smartphone, do Tinder.\nI’d hate to go through the early years of sexual exploration in this Tinder age. Every one-night stand during my uni years was bleak, and reductive, and achingly lonely. It’s female biology to want to feel we have a chance at turning the tables, to kick off something sustaining, nurturing; it’s male biology to want to spread the seed. So step right in there, Tinder. Yet Justin Garcia at the Kinsey Institute in the US says we’re sailing into uncharted territory with the app. “It’s changing so much about the way we act both romantically and sexually… it’s unprecedented from an evolutionary standpoint.” I think it’ll fall out of favour eventually; for women, there are already signs of Tinder-fatigue. Because the best sex is sacred – a deeply moving spiritual act – and this only devalues it.
