Roland DG , the UK’s leading provider of dental milling devices, today announced the release of its first 4-axis wet mill, the DWX-4W, together with its latest 5-axis dry mill, the DWX-51D for the production of dental prosthetics. \nPreviewed earlier this year, Roland DG’s DWX-4W wet mill is designed for milling glass ceramics and composite resins, popular with both dentists and patients for producing aesthetically superior crowns, inlays, onlays, and veneers. \nPeter Kettle, 3D Business Development Manager, commented: “Roland DG’s two-machine system now enables our customers to perform both dry and wet milling without having to compromise performance in their attempt to multi-task. Our solution allows each mill to specialise in its intended function, ensuring optimum results while saving time, effort and money.” \nThe DWX-4W also features a high-performance Jaeger DentaDrive spindle that operates at speeds of up to 60,000 RPM for precision milling and unmatched reliability. Furthermore, a multi-pin clamp lets you mill up to three different pin-type materials simultaneously, while a 4-station ATC automatically changes grinding burs as needed without interrupting production. × Expand \nThe DWX-51D is equipped with a 10-station automatic tool changer (ATC), a new C-clamp with torque wrench for easier loading of materials, and an expanded Virtual Machine Panel (VPanel) with built-in maintenance routine. The machine offers a vast range of product capabilities with unparalleled speed and precision, including the ability to produce copings, crowns, full bridges and abutments and other prosthetics from zirconia, wax, PMMA, composite resin and PEEK. \nTo ensure a high-quality output every time, the DWX-51D includes an improved airflow system, which boosts vacuum performance and prevents dust from building up in the milling area. \nThe DWX-51D is the perfect choice for those looking to run the machine overnight as the 10-station ATC enables multiple tooling options to allow unattended operation from start to finish. In addition to this, for optimum convenience, a colour-coded light informs the technician of the machine’s operational status. \nThe combination of the new DWX-4W wet mill with an existing dry mill, such as the latest DWX-51D, provides significant advantages over single machines to enable users to process different materials, simultaneously and without a changeover.
