Supplied Share on twitter by John Davidson I've been spanking my gadget quite a lot lately.\nAs a professional consumer technology reviewer, who ordinarily has to treat his gadgets with kid gloves so they can be returned to their manufacturer in mint condition, I have to say it's pretty satisfying. A quick slap here, and smack there, it works a treat to relieve frustration.\nAnd I'm not talking about a gentle smack, either. I'm talking about a good hard wallop, or even a double-wallop, which Logitech refers to as a \"double tap\" but which isn't. It's much harder than a tap and, at the same time, nowhere near as violent as shooting someone in the head, twice.\nI mention Logitech because it's Logitech's new gadget I've been spanking, so hard that my hand hurts as I'm writing this. The new version of its brilliant UE Boom Bluetooth speaker is out, you see, and has a new feature called \"gesture control\" that lets you pause and skip tracks just by picking the speaker up and making certain gestures on it.\nBut just as \"tap\" is too mild a word, so too is \"gesture\". It's not a gesture. It's a whack. A thump. You have to pick the thing up and hit it hard, which is how you would want it both because it's fun and, if you didn't have to hit it hard, you'd be accidentally pausing and skipping tracks all over the place.\nThough I fear all this exciting violence has got me ahead of myself. For those of you who missed out out on the original UE Boom, one of our favourite devices of 2013, I should explain it's a Bluetooth speaker you pair with your mobile phone, so you can play music much louder than with just the phone itself.\nMuch, much louder. With the original we were pretty gobsmacked by the sound you could get from something barely bigger than a 600-millilitre water bottle. (Indeed, it was was designed to be the size of a water bottle, so you could carry it as easily.) \"How on earth did they manage to get something so big into something so small?\" I wrote at the time.\nWell I'm gobsmacked again that the UE Boom 2, as the new version is known, is much louder than the original. We linked a UE Boom and a UE Boom 2 together (a feature I'll get into in a moment) and with both turned up to full volume, could barely tell the original was even turned on. Not only is the new one louder, it's a lot bassier, too. Not as bassy as UE's MegaBoom, nor as Bose's SoundLink III (another terrific Bluetooth speaker), but a distinct improvement on the original.\n Perfect by the pool The Boom was Australia's best-selling Bluetooth speaker, and even though the Boom 2 is more expensive ($249 versus $199) we can't see why this one won't be a bestseller, too. It's great.\nAnd it's not just the sound that has been improved. Logitech says the Bluetooth range of the Boom 2 is double that of the Boom – which in our tests proved about right – and the waterproofing has gone from the merely splash-proof IPX4 to the full IPX7, which means it can be submerged in a metre of water for up to an hour. It still being rather chilly, we haven't tested the Boom 2 by the pool, but that IPX7 rating should make all the difference. You could listen to it by the pool and not worry about it falling in.\nAnd better yet, you could listen to it by the pool, have your phone hidden a safe 30 metres away, and not have to worry about crap music coming on, either.\nThis is where the spanking comes in oh so handy.\nWith the original UE Boom, all you could control from the speaker itself was whether it was turned on and the volume. But with the Boom 2, you can pick it up and hit the top of it if you want to pause the music, or hit it twice if you want to skip to the next track. The wallop/gesture simply activates the standard Bluetooth music control features, meaning it should work with just about any phone. You don't even need to install the UE Boom app.\nThough, if you do install the app on your Android, iOS phone or tablet, you get a couple of other features. As with the original, you can use the app to connect two Boom 2s – or an old Boom with a Boom 2, or even a Boom 2 with a MegaBoom – and have them double up either as a stereo pair or as L/R speakers if they're in separate rooms.\nLogitech has even announced an \"X-up\" feature that will let you daisy-chain more than two Booms, the idea being if you're having a party, you can get your friends to bring their UE Booms, too, to make a big, ad hoc sound system. That feature is due later this year.\nIn the meantime, you'll have to excuse me. Nicki Minaj has just come up on my Pandora radio station, and I have go hit something. Her music isn't safe for work.\nLogitech Boom 2\nLikes: Super convenient, great for road trips, good sound considering the size\nDislikes: You have to hit it so hard your hand will hurt.\nPrice: $249\nTwitter @DLLabs", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs"], "published": "2015-09-24T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:33:31.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
