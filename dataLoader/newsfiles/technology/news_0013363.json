Apple is holding an event in San Francisco on Wednesday. As always, a number of leaks have been reported during the last few months, which indicates what the new iPhones will be all about. But these rumours will be validated only at the time of the announcement. \nLast year, Apple announced two variants - iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The company is expected to continue with the two models this year as well and is looking at the past launch sequence - these could be incremental updates and might be called as the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. \nHere are the top notable changes that the new iPhones are likely to have. 3D Force Touch: The 3D Force Touch is expected to make it to the new iPhones. This is a new, improved version of the Force Touch where the phone will understand the difference between tap, press and a deeper press. This will give app developers an option to add various features to their apps. \nDisplay: According to a report published by Bloomberg, there won't be any change in the display size this year. Apple will continue with the 4.7-inch and a 5.5-inch screen size as on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus . \nCamera: Apple doesn't believe in the megapixel count game and yet the company always had the best camera optics on their iPhones. Until now, the company had an 8MP camera on the last few generations of the iPhone but the new iPhones will have a 12 MP camera. It will also support 4k video capture and will have a 5MP selfie camera. A few reports are suggesting that there will be an upgraded image signal processor which will be a part of A9 chipset. \nRAM: Ditching 1GB RAM, this time Apple is expected to have a 2GB RAM in the new iPhones. However, Apple never talks about the RAM part at the launch event and this will be clarified at the later dates only. \nImproved LTE: This year's Apple iPhones will have improved LTE support from a new Qualcomm-made LTE chipset. \nColour: This year, we are likely to witness yet another addition to the colour palette. According to the reports quoting KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the new iPhones will be available in rose gold colour. Apple will also use a new grade of aluminium material to avoid any bendgate issues that cropped up with last year. \nWhile the highlight of the event will the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, Apple might also talk about the iPad Mini 4, iPad Pro and the next generation of Apple TV. \nThe keynote begins at 10 PM Pacific time, which will be 10:30 PM IST on Wednesday, September 9 in India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T11:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:07:23.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
