Covered in garbage and shrinking in size, all thanks to Earth.\nScientists noticed cracks in the lunar crust years ago, but it wasn't until recently that they figured out what was going on. Turns out “tidal forces of the Earth pulling on the moon, while small, generated enough stress to break the moon’s crust in the observed pattern,” as The New York Times reported this week. (The findings were reported in Geology in July.)\nThis isn’t so surprising. The gravitational pull of the tides does more than just buckle the moon’s observable crust, after all. Yesterday I wrote about the frequent deep-moonquakes that are caused by Earth’s tides. \nThe bigger question, when it comes to seismic activity on our lunar neighbor, is what’s causing the bigger moonquakes—ones that aren’t linked to the tides. Scientists know that they happen but still can't say exactly how, or where they originate.\nMore Notes From The Atlantic Orbital View: The Gaping Maw of Mir 1:59 PM ET What We're Following This Afternoon 12:24 PM ET A Baby Panda Gets A Name 11:59 AM ET The Obscure-Seeming ExIm Bank Furore Is a Window Into the... 11:47 AM ET An Inconvenient Truth for VW 11:39 AM ET Notes Home Most Popular On The Atlantic Mike Blake / Damir Sagolj / Reuters / alessandro0770 / Shutterstock / Zak Bickel / The Atlantic The Thucydides Trap: Are the U.S. and China Headed for War?

In a promotional video , Smith said that instead of making a “big pop song” he wanted to have listeners say, “That’s Bond, that sounds like a Bond theme.’” Accordingly, there has perhaps never been a more defiantly retro title song in the history of the franchise, which is saying something. In fact, “Writing’s on the Wall” hearkens to a time before “Goldfinger,” before Bond on screen, or at least to a tradition that has run parallel to the Bond sonic universe: that of music without rock-and-roll influence, music where no one craves propulsion, rhythm, or groove.\n\r \r Continue Reading Greg Kahn The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration Ta-Nehisi Coates American politicians are now eager to disown a failed criminal-justice system that’s left the U.S. with the largest incarcerated population in the world.

He was born in 1927 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but raised mostly in New York City. When Moynihan was 10 years old, his father, John, left the family, plunging it into poverty. Moynihan’s mother, Margaret, remarried, had another child, divorced, moved to Indiana to stay with relatives, then returned to New York, where she worked as a nurse.
