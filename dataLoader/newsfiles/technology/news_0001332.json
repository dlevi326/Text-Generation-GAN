So if you find a restaurant using the Yelp App, Now Tags can automatically prompt you to make a restaurant booking using the Tables app, or suggest you access your favourite taxi app.\nThe new Android app drawer takes note not only of the apps you use, but also the time of day and location you use them. So if you regularly use a transport app in the morning, it will show as one of the first apps in your app drawer when you are nearby.\nBoth new Nexus phones use Google’s new Marshmallow operating system and both feature the new USB Type-C ports. These ports allow for fast data transfers and also for fast charging devices. Both have fingerprint readers that Google calls Nexus Imprint on the back of the phones that showcase Google’s new in-built fingerprint scanning support.\nIn the US both devices are fairly inexpensive but the falling Australian dollar means even relatively cheap phones will cost a lot more. There are no official local prices yet, however, prices did appear briefly overnight on Google Store in Australia before being removed.\nThe Nexus 5X, made by LG, was $659 and the Nexus 6P, made by Huawei, was $899.

The Nexus 6P features a 5.7-inch display the same size as on Samsung’s phablet sized Galaxy Note 5 and Edge+ smartphones, and a tad bigger than iPhone 6 Plus.\nThe display is a wide form of Quad HD (WQHD) and sharp with 518 pixels per inch resolution, and it features high resolution 12 and 8 megapixel cameras. It has laser assisted focusing and a burst mode you access by pressing down on the camera button. Eight megapixels is particularly large resolution for a front-facing, or selfies, camera.

Picture AP. Source: AP\nThe Pixel C tablet has a 2560x1800 pixel, 10.2 inch display, with an unusual aspect ratio of 1:square root of 2. Google says this aspect ratio lets the tablet be comfortably viewed in portrait and landscape with the soft keyboard open.\nIt has an Nvidea Tegra X1 chip set with a Maxwell desktop-type graphics processor and 3GB of memory, and will run Android Marshmallow.\nI tested the keyboard and it offered a reasonable amount of travel. A few key have been removed to allow for a larger key size, but Google says they are the least used symbol keys and are available on the soft keyboard.\nThe keyboard attaches magnetically to the tablet both when closed and opened. It can be attached at any angle between 100 and 135 degrees.\nThe keyboard charges inductively from the tablet. The keyboard also offers two months of daily activity without charging.\nChris Griffith travelled to San Francisco courtesy of Huawei.\nBattle of the smartphones", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/30/1227550/052406-f6e7ebd8-66eb-11e5-a694-a01135d43b99.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/30/1227550/053573-ee7e2eda-66eb-11e5-a694-a01135d43b99.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/30/1227550/052379-06d670a0-66ec-11e5-a694-a01135d43b99.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:27:55.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
