London man Emlyn Pearce is sick of British emigrants. Not immigrants: emigrants. Source: Facebook \nA LONDON-based writer has unleashed a fiery rant about migration on social media and the internet is going wild over it. \nAs the world continues to debate the current refugee crisis in Europe, British man Emlyn Pearce, who is originally from Johannesburg, South Africa, decided to share his own views in an epic Facebook rant that has been shared more than 22,500 times and is trending on Twitter. \nRather than complain about refugees and immigrants in the UK and elsewhere, Pearce hilariously rails against British emigration to other parts of the world. \n“Emigration is out of control in this country,” said, urging the UK to secure its borders “before the situation gets any worse”. \n“You can’t walk down a street in Jamaica or Hong Kong or India without hearing someone speaking English, and in Canada and Australia we have even introduced our own legal system, decimated local communities and installed our own head of state! DISGUSTING!” he proclaimed. \n“English has now been imposed as the official language of 57 sovereign countries! FIFTY SEVEN!!! What the hell? Who do we think we are?!” Emlyn Pearce’s hilarious post has been shared more than 22,500 times. Source: Facebook \n“And the government is doing nothing: any British person can just pack their bags and go and live anywhere in the world at ANY TIME and nobody in the British government will do anything to stop them.” \nHe continued: “If I wanted to, I could just get on a plane to Germany tomorrow, get a job in their booming economy and live there for the rest of my life! My parents could up and retire to Spain or Portugal at a moment’s notice! Why should we have that right? It’s political correctness gone mad!” \nHe also shared some shocking figures: a whopping 1.3 million people of British descent live in Australia, another 761,000 in Spain and even 7100 in Kuwait. \n“We need to close our borders immediately before the situation gets even worse for everyone else,” he warned. \n“We are sleepwalking into a nightmare where a third of the world will be overrun by the British! AGAIN!” \nPearce told BuzzFeed his sassy post was inspired by the current refugee crisis and his own South African background. \n“I thought it was time to remind people that this migration thing goes both ways,” he said. \nAnd it has certainly attracted huge support on social media. This guy is right! Emigration is out of control!! https://t.co/Aqwy7Q8qvW — Panti Bliss (@PantiBliss) September 8, 2015 @emlynpearce sir your facebook status was absolutely amazing, total respect for you and everything you said! #refugeeswelcome — Anna Banana (@_annabananaxox) September 8, 2015 Described as 'the best Facebook ever' and I have to agree. Thank you @emlynpearce #awesome https://t.co/ztn3fmXuwO — Anna Springbett (@annaspringbett) September 8, 2015 @emlynpearce you Sir are bloody marvellous! Nothing like wit to put a very serious matter into perspective. You win! #refugeeswelcome — Stephen R Sullivan (@Stevey_Casanova) September 8, 2015 @emlynpearce quite frankly sir, you are a national treasure.  #refugeswelcome — HartBoy. (Bennie) (@ItsHartBoy) September 8, 2015 \nPearce said the most moving messages came from immigrants or their children, and that he didn’t like to dwell on negative reactions. \n“I understand that people are afraid of other cultures, or terrorism, or ‘scroungers’; I think those people need to be given the space they need to change their minds,” he told BuzzFeed. \n“Right now, there are new gifts on their way across Europe towards our country. “New ideas, new talents, new viewpoints, new heroes for our children to emulate — and we need to grab as many of them as we can before the Germans do.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:45:46.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
