While Mercury, Venus, and all the gas giants present incredibly hostile conditions from our perspective, in many ways Mars doesn't appear so different from Earth.[caption id=\"attachment_354\" align=\"\" width=\"1280\"] Image credit: NASA, via http://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/extreme/quickfacts/.[/caption]Sure, it's smaller, lower in gravity and has a much thinner, more tenuous atmosphere. It doesn't have liquid water on its surface, and seems -- to the best of our knowledge -- to be devoid of life. We cannot breathe its air, and it doesn't have a magnetic field to shield us from the cancer-causing radiation that cosmic rays and the Sun constantly bombard all of interplanetary space with. But it has a lot of things in common with our world, too, including a temperature range common to what we find near our polar regions, a roughly 24-hour day, polar ice caps, and an axial tilt nearly identical to our own.From the landers and rovers we've sent down, we've found a world whose terrain doesn't appear to be so different from that of the great deserts we see here on Earth.[caption id=\"attachment_355\" align=\"\" width=\"1399\"] Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS.[/caption]But there's a big difference between Earth and the next \"most Earth-like planet\" in our Solar System. In particular, if our goal is to have humans colonizing the red planet, there are some major obstacles we'll need to overcome. We're not quite ready to talk about terraforming Mars, since that's at least a many centuries-long project, but simply to land humans there with a fighting chance to survive. In no particular order, here are the hurdles we'll need to clear that we have not already figured out tested, workable solutions for:\nA way to successfully launch heavy payloads from Earth to Mars, t Enough shielding to prevent catastrophic disease from the cosmic-and-solar radiation that our magnetic field and atmosphere normally shield us from on Earth during the long journey to (and once we've landed on) Mars, t A way to navigate through the Martian atmosphere down to the surface without either burning up or moving too fast by time you reach it, t A successful gentle landing for any sensitive (i.e., human-containing) payloads, t An enclosed, habitable environment that is sufficiently isolated from the lethal Martian outsides, and t Enough resources to self-sustain (or continuously resupply) the living creatures whoâ€™ve gone. Let's go through each of these, just to see where we are now and what we'd need to accomplish in order to solve these puzzles.[caption id=\"attachment_356\" align=\"\" width=\"1720\"] Image credit: NASA / MSFC, via https://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=4051.[/caption]We're no stranger to launching heavy things into space, but there's a big difference between sending up a Jeep-sized rover, like Mars Curiosity, and sending human beings plus all the equipment they'd need to survive. The Saturn V rocket , which launched the Apollo astronauts to the Moon, was able to launch about 300,000 lbs. into low-Earth orbit (and a little less than half that to the Moon), but it took a rocket of 6.5 million lbs. (with a per-launch cost of $3.2 billion in today's dollars) to make it happen. We could make this happen once again, but right now, the heaviest payload that's ever gone to Mars is less than 10% what a Saturn V could've taken. [caption id=\"attachment_357\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Image credit: European Space Agency / Space Situational Awareness.[/caption]Radiation is a big, scary deal. The lifetime limit that most space agencies (including NASA, ESA and the RSA) allow for an astronaut is about 1 Sievert, which doesn't sound so bad until you realize that normal radiation doses are measured in units of micro Sieverts. Being beyond the protection of Earth's van Allen belts leads to a radiation dose of just under 2 milliSieverts per day ; it's normally about a seven month journey to Mars. Spending time on the surface of Mars (as opposed to in interplanetary space) helps a little; you'd get about 132 milliSieverts of radiation per year. In order to reduce your radiation dose to what you'd have on Earth, you'd need to have a protective layer of about 5 meters (16 feet) of dirt atop you. So it's doable, but it's not so easy.[caption id=\"attachment_358\" align=\"\" width=\"1067\"] Image credit: NASA / JPL-Caltech / MSL, via http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/timeline/edl/.[/caption]Navigating through the martian atmosphere is tough, but landing a heavy payload softly on Mars is truly a herculean task. These two points actually work against each other: the more you shield yourself from high speed with things like parachutes, the faster and more off-course the martian winds will take you! Every spacecraft we've ever tried to land on Mars has come with a tremendous risk; more than half have failed to land and deploy successfully, and these two factors are the prime reasons why.[caption id=\"attachment_359\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Image credit: SpaceX.[/caption]The Curiosity rover was a tremendous success, but even that was only 900 lbs. To land a payload ten times as heavy as that would require the development of technology never before seen, and would be incredibly risky. Having a human on board to fire thrusters might help, but Mars has very fast winds -- exceeding 100 km/hr near the surface -- that are going to make this one of the more challenging tasks.[caption id=\"attachment_360\" align=\"\" width=\"1798\"] Image credit: The University of Arizona, via http://www.portal.environment.arizona.edu/events/1439.[/caption]How are we going to have a closed, self-sustaining \"biosphere\" on Mars? We tried to build something akin to this on Earth in the late 1990s -- Biosphere 2 -- and it was a colossal failure. Not only did the humans inside fail to grow enough food to feed themselves, and not only did they need to be resupplied from the outside just for basic survival needs, but it was not isolated from the exterior environment at all! They began with eight different species of ants inside, but by time a few months had passed, they were all gone, as the native ant species to the Arizona desert had made it inside , and had out-competed all the other ants, wiping their colonies out. If ants can get in, then whatever we bring can get out, and creating a stable, air-tight atmosphere inside is an absolute must. This is an obstacle we do not yet know how to overcome.[caption id=\"attachment_361\" align=\"\" width=\"1788\"] Image credit: NASA / Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.[/caption]And finally, until (or unless) we do figure out how to have a self-sustaining environment on Mars, we're going to need to resupply the humans there frequently. This means sending food, water, and other resources/supplies necessary for humans to survive. The windows for this are again small -- Mars and Earth are only at good positions for a resupply every 780 days -- meaning we will need large payloads to land safely and softly on Mars, and we'll need them to land in precision, accessible locations.There's nothing we couldn't do with current technology, but it takes research, manpower, time, and consistent investment to make it happen. Most estimates are that $50-to-$150 billion over a 10-year timespan would mean a human presence on Mars within a decade, but that funding needs to be reserved explicitly for this mission and nothing else . It cannot be threatened, it cannot be delayed, and it cannot be inconsistent. If we do that, we can make it to Mars. And if not... even a story like The Martian will be closer to fiction than science for the rest of our lives, unless we all band together and make that investment.", "external_links": ["http://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/extreme/quickfacts/.", "http://www.portal.environment.arizona.edu/events/1439.", "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6136/1080.abstract%20", "https://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=4051.", "http://www.mars-one.com/faq/health-and-ethics/how-much-radiation-will-the-settlers-be-exposed-to", "http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/timeline/edl/.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V", "http://b2science.org/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00EMXBDMA"], "published": "2015-09-21T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T17:06:15.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
