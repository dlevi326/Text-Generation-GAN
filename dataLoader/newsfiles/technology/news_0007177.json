Almost the whole sales team, as well as colleagues from the service team, were present at the German exhibition. In order to draw attention to your B-detection products, Airsense's colleague Mr Pagel of 'miprolab' also joined. \nAirsense displayed the GDA-X, the LSID, a PEN, an EDU and AT, as well as information about 'miprolab'. In one week, about 120 interested parties visited the Airsense and 'miprolab' stand. \nOrganising the exhibition well in advance ensured a meet-up with many international and national customers, such as Brazilian customers and delegates from Korea and Japan, who the company has kept in contact with for a long time. \nAirsense is especially proud about the introduction of the GDA-P. This project was completed in close collaboration with existing and new customers to create a new-generation of detectors for military use. Even laboratories and the chemical industry are interested in this new detector.
