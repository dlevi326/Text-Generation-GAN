The company struggled to expand sales, cutting the price to 99 cents three months after its debut from $199.99 with a carrier contract. Amazon also took a $170 million inventory charge in October due mostly to the failed phone, which contributed to its worst quarterly net loss in more than a decade and sent the company’s stock tumbling.\nIt wasn’t clear whether Amazon had any plans to introduce a new version of the Fire phone. Dozens of engineers who worked on the smartphone were laid off recently, the Wall Street Journal reported last month.\nThe disappearance of Fire phones from Amazon and AT&T stores happened the same week that Apple Inc. took the wraps off the latest version of its iPhone, which generated $31.4 billion in revenue in the latest quarter.\nUnlocked brand-new Fire phones were selling on EBay’s online marketplace for about $130 on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T00:15:41.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
