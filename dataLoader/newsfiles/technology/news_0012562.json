Users can look around in any direction using their mouse as the video is playing. \n\nSamsung said its new virtual reality headset will be 22% lighter and cost $99, half the price of its previous model. The Gear VR, which requires users to insert the latest version of a Samsung smartphone into the headset, will ship in November. \n\nNetflix content is available to be viewed in Oculus or Samsung headsets starting September 24, while Hulu said it would also bring its app to the Oculus platform where users can stream 2D content as well as an original virtual reality short film called \"The Big One,'' from YouTube star Freddie Wong's RocketJump production company. A Hulu launch date wasn't announced. \n\nMeanwhile, Oculus said it would begin a certification program so consumers can look for a sticker that will identify which computers support its Oculus Rift headset, which is due to come out early next year. Asus, Dell and Alienware will have certified models that cost less than $1,000.
