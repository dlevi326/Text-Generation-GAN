WANdisco is a Gold level member of Oracle PartnerNetwork. \nWANdisco's support of Oracle Big Data Appliance reflects the ongoing adoption of Hadoop by enterprise customers that want to use Hadoop in production environments to capture and analyze large volumes of unstructured data. Customers are concluding that for Big Data to be used for mission-critical applications, it has to be continuously available over a wide area network. That is what WANdisco Fusion enables with Oracle Big Data Appliance. With WANdisco Fusion's patented active-active replication, servers and clusters are fully readable and writeable at LAN-speed, continuously in sync and able to recover automatically from each other after planned or unplanned downtime, without distance limitations. There are no passive read-only backup servers and clusters that are only utilized when the primary active cluster goes offline. As a result, WANdisco Fusion helps Oracle Big Data Appliance customers maximize use of their hardware. 1 \nOracle Big Data Appliance Optimized is part of the Oracle Exastack Optimized program which allows partners, such as WANdisco, to leverage OPN enablement resources and dedicated lab environments to help develop, test and tune their applications on Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle SuperCluster, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine, Oracle Database Appliance and Oracle Big Data Appliance engineered systems. Oracle Big Data Appliance is an engineered system that delivers comprehensive and secure big data capabilities and is integrated, optimized, and tuned to shorten deployment times and reduce cost and risk. \nBy achieving Oracle Big Data Appliance Optimized status, Oracle recognizes WANdisco for developing, testing and tuning WANdisco Fusion on Oracle Big Data Appliance. This accomplishment is a testament to WANdisco and their ability to deliver the extreme performance and reliability customers require. \n\"Oracle Big Data Appliance Optimized status furthers a great relationship with Oracle.
