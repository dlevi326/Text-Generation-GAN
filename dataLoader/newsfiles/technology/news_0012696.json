Those skills are in short supply nationwide, and an approaching spike in the numbers of feds eligible for retirement threatens to widen the government’s existing cybersecurity skills gap. \nSome observers say one of the mistakes that undermined OPM was putting cybsersecurity in the hands of program office employees who did not have the relevant background. \n“Soft skills”— though Malone said he is no fan of the dismissive connotations of that adjective — unlock “the real magic of leadership”: attracting the right talent, encouraging them to give their best and retaining them. \n“If you create the right environment, the tech skill will come,” Malone said. “The only way we’re going to get the technical talent — and the only way they’ll stay — is if leaders make them want to stay. Otherwise, you’re going to lose them to IBM, lose them to Apple.” \nKnow the risks \nGregory Wilshusen, director of information security issues at the Government Accountability Office, said agency heads need to have a core understanding of what kinds of sensitive information their agency collects, how it’s protected, the damage that would be done if the information is compromised, and who controls and interacts with the agency’s systems in the cloud. \n“Just because you start to migrate systems to the cloud doesn’t mean you’re absolved of responsibility,” he said. \nIn the future, it shouldn’t be a requirement that agency heads have deep IT knowledge. If they do, “that would be a bonus but not the determining factor,” Wilshusen added. \nSo would OPM have done a better job of detecting and responding to the breaches if a tech-savvy leader had been in charge? \nWilliams said yes, adding that someone who understood the risks would have immediately cut off KeyPoint Government Solutions’ system access when it became clear that the contractor had been hacked. \nBut Malone said the leader’s role is to foster an open environment, not necessarily understand all the technology. In such an environment, an agency employee who had a solution to the problem would have felt comfortable bringing it up, he added. \nWilshusen said the public administrators and lawyers who currently lead agencies are probably capable of picking up the tech knowledge they need as they work, and they’re likely doing so now. \n“I would imagine there’s a lot more on-the-job training after what happened to Secretary Archuleta,” he said.
