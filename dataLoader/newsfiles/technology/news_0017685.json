The program led by Innovative Oncology Business Solutions, Inc. (IOBS), was created by Dr. Barbara McAneny, CEO of New Mexico Cancer Center, through a grant from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. The $19.8 M grant awarded in 2012 provided funds to develop programs across various cancer centers in several states that allowed cancer centers to extend their hours and provide same day visits through a triage system that routed patients to the optimal site of care, instead of patients having to visit an emergency room. The result has been a dramatic decrease in the cost of cancer treatment for federally covered patients. \nThe journal article, \"Community Oncology Medical Homes: Physician-Driven Change to Improve Patient Care and Reduce Costs\" describes the COME HOME model and implementation timeline, profile use of key services, and report patient satisfaction. \n\"We selected NantHealth as a strategic partner based on the COME HOME program critical reliance on information technology solutions that facilitate the sharing of near-real-time clinical information to support both triage and clinical protocols,\" said Dr. McAneny. \"NantHealth developed custom interface solutions that allowed our multiple medical practices to use a range of different electronic health records (EHRs) and practice management systems. Enabled through NantHealth's innovation solutions, oncologists at our centers across the country are now able to organize all aspets of their patients' medical needs and provide a continuity of care, leading to a higher quality of medical care, as well as a more efficient and cost-effective form of medical care.\" \n\"We are pleased that our healthcare clinical and financial operating system (NantOS) enabled COME HOME oncologists with real time data showing how their patient's clinical care compared to national standards and provided up-to-date information on the latest clinical treatment options, enabling more effective treatment to be delivered in the most cost effective manner possible,\" said Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, executive chairman and founder of NantHealth. \nAbout Innovative Oncology Business Solutions \nInnovative Oncology Business Solutions, Inc. (IOBS) is a for-profit corporation that was created for the purpose of administering the CMMI grant and providing the distinct organizational structure necessary to oversee and manage the COME HOME project. In 2012, IOBS received a $19.8 million grant to develop and test a new Community Oncology Medical Home (COME HOME) model, the purpose of which is to demonstrate that community oncology practices can provide a medical home for oncology patients in a manner that produces improved outcomes, enhanced patient care experiences and costs savings. The company expects to realize significant cost savings by shifting patients out of the Emergency Departments and inpatient facilities and into our physician office practices as much as possible, as well as through the utilization of standardized triage, diagnostic and therapeutic pathways. \nAbout NantHealth \nNantHealth, a member of the NantWorks ecosystem of companies, is a healthcare transformational cloud-based IT company converging science and technology through a single integrated clinical platform, to provide actionable health information at the point of care, in the time of need, anywhere, anytime.
