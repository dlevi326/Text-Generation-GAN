The strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies had a significant impact on results in the quarter. Total Revenues were $8.4 billion, down 2% in U.S. dollars but up 7% in constant currency. Cloud plus On-Premise Software Revenues were $6.5 billion, down 2% in U.S. dollars and up 6% in constant currency. Total Cloud Revenues were $611 million, up 29% in U.S. dollars and up 34% in constant currency. Cloud software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) revenues were $451 million, up 34% in U.S. dollars and up 38% in constant currency. Cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) revenues were $160 million, up 16% in U.S. dollars and up 23% in constant currency. Total On-Premise Software Revenues were $5.8 billion, down 4% in U.S. dollars but up 4% in constant currency. Total Hardware Revenues were $1.1 billion, down 3% in U.S. dollars but up 6% in constant currency. Total Services Revenues were $862 million, up 1% in U.S. dollars and up 10% in constant currency. \nOperating Income was $2.7 billion and Operating Margin was 31%. Non-GAAP Operating Income was $3.5 billion and non-GAAP Operating Margin was 41%. Net Income was $1.7 billion while non-GAAP Net Income was $2.3 billion. Earnings Per Share was $0.40, while non-GAAP Earnings Per Share was $0.53. Without the impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening compared to foreign currencies, Oracle's reported Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP Earnings Per Share would have been 6 cents higher. \nShort-term deferred revenues were $9.1 billion, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 10% in constant currency compared with a year ago. Operating cash flow on a trailing twelve-month basis was $13.5 billion. \n\"Our traditional on-premise software business plus our new cloud business grew at a combined rate of 6% in constant currency,\" said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. \"This growth is being driven by new SaaS and PaaS annual recurring cloud subscription contracts which almost tripled in the quarter. As our cloud business scales-up, we plan to double our SaaS and PaaS cloud margins over the next two years -- starting from 40% this just completed Q1, to approximately 60% this coming Q4, and then on up to 80% two years from now. Rapidly growing cloud revenue combined with a doubling of cloud margins will have a huge impact on EPS growth going forward.\" \n\"In Q1 SaaS and PaaS revenue was up 38% in constant currency -- in Q4 that revenue growth rate will be over 60%,\" said Oracle CEO, Mark Hurd. \"That cloud revenue growth rate is being driven by a year-over-year bookings growth rate of over 150% in Q1. Our increasing revenue growth rate is in sharp contrast to our primary cloud competitor's revenue growth rates which are on their way down.\" \n\"We are still on target to book between $1.5 and $2.0 billion of new SaaS and PaaS business this fiscal year,\" said Oracle Executive Chairman and CTO Larry Ellison. \"That means Oracle would sell between 50% more and double the amount of new cloud business than salesforce.com plans to sell in their current fiscal year. Oracle is the world's second largest SaaS and PaaS company, but we are rapidly closing in on number one.\" \nThe Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 14, 2015, with a payment date of October 28, 2015. \nQ1 Fiscal 2016 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast \nOracle will hold a conference call and webcast today to discuss these results at 2:00 p.m. Pacific.

Many factors could affect our current expectations and our actual results, and could cause actual results to differ materially. We presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations: (1) Economic, geopolitical and market conditions, including the continued slow economic recovery in Europe, parts of the U.S. and other parts of the world, can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price. (2) We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to such factors as delays or size reductions in transactions, fewer large transactions in a particular quarter, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for contracts. (3) Our cloud computing strategy, including our Cloud SaaS, PaaS, Infrastructure as a Service and Database as a Service offerings, may not be successful. (4) If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, or to enhance and improve our products and support services in a timely manner or to position and/or price our products and services to meet market demand, customers may not buy new software licenses, cloud software subscriptions or hardware systems products or purchase or renew support contracts. (5) Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results, including risks relating to foreign currency gains and losses. (6) If the security measures for our software, hardware, services or Oracle Cloud offerings are compromised or subject to a successful cyber-attack, or if such offerings contain significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors, we may experience reputational harm, legal claims and financial exposure. (7) We have an active acquisition program and our acquisitions may not be successful, may involve unanticipated costs or other integration issues or may disrupt our existing operations. A detailed discussion of these factors and other risks that affect our business is contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, particularly under the heading \"Risk Factors.\" Copies of these filings are available online from the SEC or by contacting Oracle Corporation's Investor Relations Department at (650) 506-4073 or by clicking on SEC Filings on Oracle's Investor Relations website at http://www.oracle.com/investor .

We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

(2) We compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the exchange rates in effect on May 31, 2015 and 2014 for the fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 constant currency growth rate calculations presented, respectively, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods.
