The firm moved to reassure die-hard fans that it would continue to develop and enhance BlackBerry 10, the next version of which is due to drop in March 2016. \nChen said the release meant BlackBerry was making good on its ambition to transition into a software “powerhouse”. \nAt the start of September 2015, the ailing Canadian phone-maker – which was once the go-to standard for enterprise mobility – forked out more than $400m to acquire mobile security solutions supplier Good Technology, extending its reach into mobile device management . \nIt also integrated Samsung’s Knox and Android plaftorms with BlackBerry Secure Connect Plus in version 12.2 of BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES), released over the summer . \nAlongside the announcement of its first Android device, BlackBerry unveiled its second quarter results, revealing GAAP revenues of $490m and net income of $51m. \nIt shipped 800,000 smartphones during the three months to 29 August 2015, with an average selling price of $240. Software and services sales at BlackBerry accounted for $71m or 15% of total revenues, up 19% year-on-year. \n“I am confident in our strategy and continued progress, highlighted by our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year double digit growth in software licensing revenue and sixth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow,” said Chen in a statement. \n“To expand our leadership in cross-platform software and services, we are investing strategically and organically through new products and services based on the BES platform, and through acquisitions such as AtHoc and Good.” CW+ Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.
