The new color and design elements introduced on the TCx TM Display and TCxWave TM enable this cohesiveness, and the high-performing smaller footprint and energy-efficient design ensures that the new TCx700 and TCx300 systems are equally functional from the largest retail setting to the smallest pop-up shop. \n“Toshiba is proud of our continued investment in our industry-leading portfolio of retail-hardened POS systems,” said Gregg Margosian, CTO, Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions. “We value design and performance, and feel that the redesign of these key systems will deliver on our lasting commitment to help our clients provide an exceptional retail experience.” \nThe new design goes way beyond aesthetics and is based upon advanced Intel® processor technology which offers superior performance and low power consumption. The new platforms offer retailers 30-40% performance improvement over previous SurePOS models and features either the Intel ® Celeron ™ or Intel® Core TM i3 processor in the TCx700 or TCx300, and an Intel Core TM i5 processor configuration. Additional options include various SurePorts, non-volatile RAM for 4690 OS support, and extra RS232 ports for both the TCx700 and TCx300 . \n“Intel is pleased with our long-standing technology relationship with Toshiba,” said Alec Gefrides, Director, Internet of Things Group, Intel Corporation. “By working closely together, we are able to enhance performance, scalability, and enable advanced features in Toshiba POS systems for retailers around the world.” \nThe new products are generally available in September 2015. \nAdditionally, full coverage on many of the operating platforms will help deliver investment protection to retailers, including: Toshiba 4690 OS, V6.5 Enhanced (coming in 1H2016) Microsoft Windows POSReady 2009 and POSReady 7 Microsoft Windows 7 Professional, or Ultimate Microsoft Windows 8.1 Professional Microsoft Windows Embedded 8.1 Industry Microsoft Windows 10 Professional (coming in 1H2016) SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Server SP3 and Desktop SP3 (coming in 1H2016) \nLearn more about the new TCx700 and TCx300 at toshibacommerce.com/products \nAbout Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions \nToshiba Global Commerce Solutions is retail’s first choice for integrated in-store solutions and is a global market share leader in retail store technology.
