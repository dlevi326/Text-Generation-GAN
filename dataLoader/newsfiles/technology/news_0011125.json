As part of the £50m project, the team also installed 11 new switches and crossings, enabling trains to move from one track to another. The new lower track has created the additional headroom needed for the overhead lines that will power the new fleet of electric trains to run underneath, while simultaneously preserving Bath’s historic architecture.Spread over five separate sites, the preparation work in Bath was the largest track project Network Rail has carried out to date and the biggest on the Western route for 40 years, culminating in the line re-opening to passengers, on time, on September 1.\nThis stunning time-lapse footage shows the scale of the project and the level of work involved across the various sites, including the iconic Box Tunnel and the picturesque Sydney Gardens.\nSeparate time-lapse footage is also available for the key sites including Box Tunnel, Bathampton Junction, Sydney Gardens and Dundas Aqueduct.Andy Haynes, Network Rail’s project director for the west of England, said: “We always knew this was going to be a complex project given the historic architecture and infrastructure we were working around, but I’m pleased to say all work was completed on time.\n“Now this preparation work has been carried out, we will be able to install the overhead line equipment that will be used to power the new electric trains. These trains will provide passengers with more seats and faster journeys, while significantly reducing noise and pollution for those who live close to the railway line.”\nSource:-Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T03:36:26.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
