This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150916005209/en/ \nScheduled for rollout in October, Talent in Khorus will complement existing features that allow CEOs and leaders to align employees on common priorities and gather weekly performance insight. The new Talent component comes as many top companies, including Deloitte, Accenture, Microsoft, and GE, are fundamentally rethinking how they handle employee reviews. \n“Traditional performance management is on its way out because it is not tied directly to business results,” said Khorus CEO Joel Trammell. “Everyone’s fed up with time-wasting bureaucratic processes. We built Talent in Khorus to help CEOs, executive teams, and HR leaders easily assess their talent pool, and feel confident that all employees are getting frequent, relevant feedback without demotivating them or wasting their time.” \nFeatures of the new Talent component of Khorus include: Quarterly assessments and simple deployment. Employee assessments in Khorus work on a 90-day cadence, ending the long “feedback deserts” of standard annual or semi-annual reviews. Assessment forms are easy to share, review and approve within the app, rapidly documenting the whole process without hassle. Assessments tied to performance against goals. Since all employees own a set of quarterly goals in Khorus, assessments begin with relevant background rather than arbitrary ratings and unassisted recall. This keeps assessments centered on how the employee performed against tangible goals and what they can do next quarter to keep improving. The Talent Dashboard. Each assessment includes a confidential rating of the employee’s (1) current performance and (2) leadership potential, viewable only by the manager and anyone up the management chain. The CEO, HR, and department heads can see these ratings mapped across the company and teams in the Talent Dashboard. This at-a-glance view gives them unprecedented insight on the relationship between talent and business performance, and a view of the company’s leadership pipeline. \nAbout Khorus \nKhorus provides an enterprise leadership platform for driving performance, managing talent, and building culture. Khorus gives CEOs and leadership teams a single platform, accessible via web or mobile, to set company priorities each quarter and cascade supporting goals throughout the organization; gather weekly, company-wide forecasts on likely outcomes; identify and grow top performers; and ensure that performance reviews are consistent and on time.
