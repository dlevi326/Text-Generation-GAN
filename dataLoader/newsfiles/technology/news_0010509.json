He will detail how GoodData utilizes this model in building and managing its analytics delivery platform on behalf of thousands of organizations to improve business relationships, increase customer stickiness and even create new revenue streams from data products. \n\"Cloud has created the opportunity for lightning-speed change,\" said Harmer. \"However, as traditional production cycles are swapped out for bi-weekly, daily and even hourly updates, security must also evolve to ensure we reduce the prevalence of data breaches that continue to increase in size and frequency.\" \nHarmer joined GoodData from SuccessFactors, an SAP company, where he served as VP security and cloud privacy officer. He is CISSP, CISM and CIPP certified and at SuccessFactors, he built and ran their Security, Privacy and Compliance programs. Prior to SuccessFactors, Harmer managed security and infrastructure for the Ontario Government, Manulife Financial, Critical Path and DocSpace. \nDataWeek 2015 is one of the largest data innovation events in the Bay area for the third year running, where thousands of engineers and executives converge to discuss the role of data + API innovation on business, technology, and society.
