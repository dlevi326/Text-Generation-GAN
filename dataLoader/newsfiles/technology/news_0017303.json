Strongest part of the hurricane appears in red. Credit: NRL/NASA/NOAA \nHurricane Jimena is on a downward spiral and is expected to continue weakening. NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite flew over Hurricane Jimena and saw the strongest thunderstorms were on its southern and northeastern sides. Jimena is expected to bring rough surf to the Hawaiian Islands over the weekend of Sept. 5 and 6. \nThe Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite or VIIRS instrument aboard the satellite provided infrared data of the storm that showed the coldest cloud top temperatures, which indicate the strongest thunderstorms were in Jimena's northern quadrant. Cloud top temperatures there were as cold as -80 Celsius (-112 Fahrenheit) indicating strong storms with the potential for heavy rainfall. \nNOAA's Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) said that water vapor imagery strongly suggests that very dry is being drawn into the system which will diminish the development of thunderstorms. In addition, CPHC noted that the outflow (air at the top of the storm being pushed to the fringes of the hurricane from the center) was \"showing some restrictions in the western quadrant.\" In the VIIRS image, the western quadrant lacked strong thunderstorms. \nVIIRS is a scanning radiometer that collects visible and infrared imagery and \"radiometric\" measurements. Basically it means that VIIRS data is used to measure cloud and aerosol properties, ocean color, and ocean and land surface temperatures. \nOn September 4, 2015, Jimena was far to the northwest of Hawaii. At 11 a.m. EDT (5 a.m. HST/1500 UTC) Jimena's center was located near latitude 19.7 north and longitude 145.1 west. That's about 650 miles (1,045 km) east of Hilo, Hawaii and 835 miles (1,345 km) east of Honolulu. \nDespite the distance from Hawaii, the CPHC expects rough surf to continue affecting Hawaii. CPHC said \"large and powerful long-period swells generated by Hurricane Jimena will produce hazardous and potentially damaging surf in the main Hawaiian islands through this weekend (Sept. 5 and 6), primarily along east facing shores. \nMaximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 kph) and gradual weakening is expected. The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 millibars. Jimena was moving toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 kph) and is expected to move to the north-northwest. For updated forecasts visit NOAA's Central Pacific Hurricane Center at: http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc . \nThe CPHC noted that by Monday and Tuesday, Sept. 7 and 8, an elongated area of high pressure in the middle-atmosphere situated north of Jimena is forecast to strengthen. As a result, it will likely push the storm in a westward direction. CPHC forecasts steady weakening over the next several days and by Sept. 9, expect Jimena to be a depression. Suomi NPP satellite sees rapidly intensifying Hurricane Jimena August 28, 2015 \nNASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite flew over Hurricane Jimena in the Eastern Pacific and saw the strongest thunderstorms building up quickly, especially in the northern quadrant of the storm.
