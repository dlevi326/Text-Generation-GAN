On toast\nRe Why Stephen Harper Is Toast (Sept. 10): In 1968, Lyndon Johnson supposedly responded to Walter Cronkite’s prime time declaration that the Vietnam War was “mired in a stalemate” by saying, “If I’ve lost Cronkite, I’ve lost Middle America.”\nIn 2015, if Stephen Harper has lost Margaret Wente, he’s lost centre-right Canada.\nDaniel J. Christie, Port Hope, Ont.\nMostly, I agree with Margaret Wente’s views. Not this time: I will vote for Stephen Harper’s party because I vote on certain principles, and not on the flavour of the month.\nLots of people I know don’t want more economic migrants flooding our country. They are even uncertain about the number of carefully vetted immigrants that Mr. Harper is proposing. They see their grandchildren being out of work in the future, too many people chasing too few jobs.\nThe media is in full-throttle election mode; this is a glorious topic for them. I don’t agree with the NDP policies; the thought of a Liberal Leader with no experience in matters that count, actually being at the helm, is alarming.\nThe Conservatives have served us well in some difficult times. Mr. Harper says what he means. Since his government was first elected, the media has been biased in its criticism of him.\nKate Housley, Fonthill, Ont.\nI know which side my toast is buttered on – and it’s a rare day that it’s the same side as Margaret Wente’s. Who knew Ms. Wente and I would find common ground in toast? Must be one of those “unknown unknowns.”\nPhilip Nguyen, Edmonton\nMargaret Wente is a little too quick serving up Stephen Harper as toast. She may need a slice of it herself – to wipe the egg off her face after the election. When Canadians are behind that screen, marking their ballots, with no one to judge them but themselves, let’s see what they really think about the refugee issue.\nFrank Rogers, Halifax\nRefugees in Canada\nStephen Harper’s recent pledge, if re-elected, to resettle an additional 10,000 Syrian refugees comes with a caveat (Fast-Tracking Measures All From The Past – Sept. 10). Preference will be given for religious minority groups: In other words, in a country predominately Muslim (90 per cent), Canada will cherry pick the Christians? What gives? Is Mr. Harper scared of Muslims?\nJodine Ducs, treasurer, Central Okanagan Refugee Committee\nIn your Folio (Refugee Crisis, Sept. 10), you show that about 46 per cent of the refugees are working age (18 to 59) and most of the rest are under 18. It may take a few years for them to find jobs and housing, but consider how they will then contribute by supporting our health care and old age systems. They will pay taxes, shop for household goods, clothing, food and services – in other words, expand our economy. We must help them, not only because it’s the right thing to do but also because it will benefit all of us.\nBonnie Hanke, Collingwood, Ont.\nFighting in Syria\nRe Ending Syria’s Civil War Is Now The World’s Business (Sept. 10): The only way to end the fighting is peace talks, without preconditions, among all parties prepared to talk. The Assad regime has said it will talk, but NATO allies are adamant that Bashar al-Assad can play no part in any future government. This is prolonging the war, possibly indefinitely.\nWhy would he agree to talks if he is told he cannot play any part in a future government? It would be like putting handcuffs on his own wrists to be led away to a war crimes tribunal in The Hague.\nWhile Islamic State will never talk peace, a deal can likely be reached with the regime, followed by co-ordinated action against IS.\nThe NATO countries involved in Syria/Iraq have no realistic war aims. While defeating both Assad and IS forces may be an aspiration, there is no real prospect of it ever being achieved. Even if by some miracle it were, who would form Syria’s new government?\nWilliam Reed, Victoria\n‘Let’? Get real\nRe Be A Rebel. Let Your Kids Walk To School (editorial, Sept. 10): “Let them walk” is as out of touch with reality as “Let them eat cake.” There is no “let” about it, walking to school must be arranged.\nSome families may have the luxury of one parent at home, and yes, they should walk.\nBut families with two working parents have a tight schedule in the mornings. Most jobs start early, long before school begins, and you can’t leave a six-year-old home alone at 7:30 so she can walk to school at 8:30. Daycare, and getting to and from daycare, is vital. Not every family has a grandparent or nanny available.\nThen there are team practices, music lessons, and preschool siblings to consider.\nThe parents I know do their very best to raise their children, earn a living, and make a home.\nIf they have to drive their kids to school to make it all happen, then fine.\nAnne Hopkinson, Victoria\nGrown, not caged\nI applaud McDonald’s for taking a step to improve animal welfare by gradually shifting to cage-free eggs (McDonald’s To Shift To Cage-Free Eggs – Report on Business, Sept. 10). But even so-called “humane” “free-range” farms are often not a big step up and can still involve significant cruelty.\nConsumers concerned about animal welfare should also aim to reduce the amount of eggs and other animal products they eat.\nLuckily, it’s never been easier with vegan products widely available and great websites like chooseveg.com with tips for meal ideas and menu planning that is truly cruelty-free.\nBarbi Lazarus, Toronto\nFacing facts …\nDonald Trump mocked the physical appearance of fellow Republican U.S. presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, saying: “Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that?” (Trump Slights Rival Carly Fiorina’s Looks: ‘Look At That Face’ – Sept. 10).\nWe all understand that The Donald is not noted for his grasp of history, much less so of Canada’s, but he might be well served to have reflected upon the famous Conservative attack ad in the ill-fated Kim Campbell campaign in the 1993 federal election. “The Face” ads with the tagline “Is this a Prime Minister?” were widely perceived to make fun of Jean Chrétien’s facial paralysis.\nMind you, Mr. Chrétien, a skilled street fighter in the rough and tumble of politics, knew enough to rise above the hurtfulness of the ad to recognize when he had been lobbed a beach ball over home plate, when he dolefully remarked in a media scrum, “Ever since I was a little kid, they have made fun of the face that God gave me.” The Tories never had a chance.\nAs for the suggestion, “Look at that face,” you can’t blame others, when observing Mr. Trump, to reply, “Look at that ass.”\nRoss Howey, Toronto\n Topics: Stephen Harper New Democratic Party Comments A A", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:22:31.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
