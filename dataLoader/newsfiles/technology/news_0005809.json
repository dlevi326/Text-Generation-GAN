Historically the Company has had operating losses, negative cash flows from operations, and working capital deficiencies.”\nIt continued, “Whether, and when, the Company can attain profitability and positive cash flows from operations is uncertain. The Company is also uncertain whether it can obtain financing to complete the rollout of its business plan. These uncertainties cast significant doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”\nThe lack of capital wasn’t news to Park City, which had partnered with Leavitt Partners in the venture, who were eventually willing to give up 75% of the partnership for just $100,000.\nPark City had lingered for a long period before finally taking up the controlling interest of the company, presumably because it would force consolidation (and revelation) of its financial statements.\nThe HJ & Associates audit is the result of that consolidation.\nCertainly the $197.1m market cap company has the ability to finance ReposiTrak for an extended period while it finds an audience. The company boasted 3,000 supplier connections as of a few days ago.\nHJ & Associates says, “The Company will need to raise capital in order to fund its operations.”\nPark City Group stock dropped to $9 from $10.95 in after-hours trading.\nTags: TECHNOLOGY SOFTWARE - APPLICATION", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T04:40:41.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
