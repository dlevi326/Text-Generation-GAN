The company selected NewVoiceMedia's ContactWorld for Sales solution because of its seamless integration with Salesforce, flexibility, scalability and detailed reporting, in order to improve efficiencies in outbound calling operations. The company founders also wanted to work with suppliers who share their philosophy of industry disruption. \nThe technology is used by three sales teams at Prospa: new customer acquisitions, customer retention and channel partners, yet offers the company a single solution for insight into its entire business. Each month, reps make around 8,000 outbound calls and receive 2,000 inbound calls, although the company expects these numbers to increase significantly. With 'click-to-dial', staff can make calls directly from within Salesforce -- delivering significant efficiency improvements while reducing dialing errors. Customer records are then automatically updated, meaning there is a complete history of interactions, and follow-up activities can be easily created so that no lead is lost. Furthermore, inbound calls are dynamically routed to the right account manager based on the information about the caller held in Salesforce. This means that customers and prospects know that when they call, they will be connected with the person who knows most about their account. \nWith its true cloud environment, NewVoiceMedia offers Prospa a flexible platform for growth and staff can log into the same system from wherever they are, needing only a phone and internet connection, meaning they can work from multiple locations. The platform offers sales managers a real-time window into the entire operation, so reps can be easily managed, and customizable, rich reports allow the company to expose where improvement opportunities exist. Call recording also gives a meaningful insight into performance. \nBeau Bertoli, Founder and joint CEO of Prospa, comments, \"When we saw what NewVoiceMedia's technology did, we were very excited by it and the company fits perfectly with our philosophy of being pioneers in business. We are disrupting financial services and NewVoiceMedia is doing the same in cloud customer contact technology. We've got complete confidence that our business can continue to grow rapidly and that NewVoiceMedia will support us on that journey.\" \nJonathan Gale, CEO of NewVoiceMedia, adds, \"It's great to see the benefits Prospa has experienced with our technology. As ContactWorld for Sales is completely flexible and scalable, it will help the company grow from 10,000 to 100,000 calls over the next couple of years, while increasing conversion rates and continuing to improve business efficiencies.\" \nFor further information, download the case study at www.newvoicemedia.com \nSalesforce, Salesforce1, AppExchange and others are among the trademarks of salesforce.com, inc. \nAbout NewVoiceMedia \nNewVoiceMedia powers customer connections that transform businesses globally.
