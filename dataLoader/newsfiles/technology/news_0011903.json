(Photo: AP Photo/Richard Drew)\n48 CONNECT 83 TWEET 17 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE CUPERTINO, Calif. — Apple is teaming with Cisco Systems to sell more iPhones and iPads to corporate customers.\nThe Silicon Valley companies on Monday announced an alliance aimed at helping Apple's mobile devices communicate more effectively on corporate networks where Cisco gear is widely used. Cisco will also help Apple develop ways for iPhones to interact more smoothly with workers' office phones. The Wall Street Journal first reported the partnership.\nApple CEO Tim Cook and Cisco Chairman John Chambers told the Journal the partnership, which was 10 months in the making, will be explained in detail to thousands of Cisco sales representatives at a gathering in Las Vegas on Monday.\nFinancial terms of the deal weren't disclosed.\nThe collaboration is Apple's latest push to put its products in front of corporate customers. Last year, Apple teamed up with IBM to build and sell business applications for the iPhone and iPad.\nUSA TODAY\nFirst Take: Tech's odd couple have common interests\nApple rival Google also has been expanding its push into the corporate market.\nOne impetus is a slowdown in iPad sales, which have declined six straight quarters. Revenue from iPads has plummeted 24% in the nine months, ended June 27. Worldwide smartphone sales, meanwhile, have saturated, resulting in the slowest rate of growth since 2013, according to market researcher Gartner.\nLarge business sites have traditionally been a ticklish task for Apple. During the PC era, Apple struggled to win a slice of what is now a $2 trillion market for corporate technology spending. This could change, albeit slowly, as businesses seek to use smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices to make workers more productive.\nManaging so many devices can be tricky, however. One of the byproducts of the Apple-Cisco partnership will be the creation of a so-called “fast lane” for iOS devices that prioritizes wireless and Web connections of critical business applications, the companies said.\nContributing: Associated Press.\nWow!
