In a no-cost contract, CE Broker will track continuing education (CE) hours for all chemical dependency counselors and prevention specialists and provide a platform for the board's CE audits.\nCE Broker has been the official continuing education tracking system for the Florida Department of Health with its 33 boards & 1 million licensees since 2004. CE Broker has had a big year in 2015, culminating partnerships with many different state boards. Over 1.2 million licensees will use CE Broker to report CE hours by the end of Summer 2015.\nCurrently, healthcare professionals are randomly audited every two years and must prove they met their mandated hours. Those selected must find and mail in all course certificates, and board staff sorts through the paperwork to compare completions to each individual's requirements. If they did not fulfill their hours, there is a potential for fines and additional required coursework. The board partnered with CE Broker to clarify requirements for licensees and to simplify continuing education audits.\n\"CE Broker is dedicated to simplifying the impact of regulation on healthcare professionals,\" says CE Brian Solano, \"and we have achieved this over the last ten years in Florida. Our expertise in the industry has been a big factor in other state boards wanting to partner with us.\"\nCE Broker offers free iPhone and Android apps that licensees use to see their requirements, check their CE Compliance status and report continuing education hours.\nThe OCDP Board also benefits from this partnership with CE Broker. It can conduct electronic audits for any who do not post their hours at a fraction of the cost to the current process. With CE Broker, licensees are held accountable for their professional development while at the same time receiving assistance that makes meeting their requirements a whole lot easier.\nCE Broker also employs a full-time help desk available via phone, live chat, and email to help licensees fulfill their hours on time, and all of this is provided at no-cost to the State. The company funds their operations by offering voluntary subscription services to healthcare employers & licensees\n\"Like how Turbo Tax and H&R Block have simplified filing taxes for millions of people each year, we are doing the same thing for continuing education,\" says Solano. \"You can choose to do your taxes on your own, but why do that when there are so many great inexpensive services out there that make it easier?\"\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12969071.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12969071.htm"], "published": "2015-09-25T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T12:04:19.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
