The nation's central bank has devalued its currency to spur flagging exports. And Chinese factory activity has fallen to its lowest level in six years.\nBut none of that matters.\nEven with its economic \"slowdown,\" the Chinese economy will grow at least twice as fast as America's this year. By 2030, an estimated 326 million Chinese will enter the middle class. That's more than the entire population of the United States. And it's the key reason U.S. companies are rushing to crack the Chinese market.\nBut success in China has proven elusive for even the shrewdest Western firms. Only by responding to the unique demands of Chinese consumers and availing the knowledge, insights and authority of local partners can Western businesses avoid the failure of their predecessors — and gain a secure foothold in the world's second-largest economy.\nHome Depot learned the danger of ignoring the tastes of China's consumers the hard way. The firm opened 12 American-style warehouse stores in 2006. But it overestimated China's willingness to embrace the \"do-it-yourself\" culture that underpins demand for home-improvement products.\nLackluster sales forced Home Depot to close its Chinese warehouses in 2012 and redirect its efforts towards specialty stores tailored to local tastes. The failed expansion cost the company $160 million.\nApple, by contrast, has enjoyed stunning success in China. That's thanks largely to booming sales of the large-screen iPhone 6 Plus. According to Shaun Rein, an analyst with Shanghai-based China Market Research Group, in China \"[m]ost people don't have TVs in their homes here, and the young Chinese use their mobile phones for everything . . . [s]o having that big screen was critically important.\"\nCatering to Chinese consumers has paid off for Apple, which recorded 112% year-over-year revenue growth in China during the most recent quarter. The iPhone 6 Plus version accounts for nearly half of new iPhone 6 models sold in China — compared to just a quarter of those sold in the United States.\nMy own company, mobile-gaming firm Kabam, has similarly focused on meeting the demands of Chinese consumers. One-quarter of our staff, including two of our co-founders, is based in China. Most of them are Chinese citizens.\nUSA TODAY\nChina should be a Silicon Valley obsession\nThis cultural fluency is enabling us to \"hyper-culturalize\" games. For instance, we've incorporated storylines and environments that draw on Chinese cultural references and we have added game play that is more commonly found in Chinese games. We also recognize Chinese players' greater tolerance for different levels of service between paying and non-paying gamers — and so we include more extensive \"pay to win\" levels and features.\nOur understanding of Chinese consumers' preferences, rather than force-feeding them the same products that work in the West, helped us attract a $120 million investment from one of China's largest companies, e-commerce giant Alibaba.\nAdapting to cultural norms often requires trusting local partners with important decisions.\nStarbucks has heeded that lesson well. China is one of the company's fastest-growing markets, with some 1,500 stores in 90 cities.\nTo adapt to each of China's regions, Starbucks joined forces with a number of local firms, including Beijing Mei Da coffee and Maxim's Caterers in Hong Kong. Starbucks trusted its partners' first-hand knowledge of China's different regional cultures, and introduced diversified menu choices accordingly.\nGroupon, by contrast, stands out as an example of what not to do. The online-deal website failed to take advantage of its Chinese e-commerce partner Tencent's pre-existing user base, knowledge of local consumer habits, and experienced staff.\nGroupon instead ran its Chinese business like an American offshoot. The company imported its own Western staff and tried to seize an outsized portion of the revenue its deals generated for vendors. Groupon even refused to pay attention to warnings that mass emails wouldn't be effective marketing tools in China — as they had been in other countries.\nAfter three years of high employee dissatisfaction and little success gaining market share, Groupon pulled out of China in 2014.\nAs China's middle class continues to swell, its market will become ever-more attractive to American businesses. U.S. firms can succeed in China, but not without understanding Chinese consumers and investing authentically in local partners.\nKevin Chou is CEO of Kabam.\n12 CONNECT 59 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT //usat.ly/1KA57hr TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1KA57hr", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/abf7fc9e077790e137c6a86512b8396963a5a375/c=0-302-3264-2146&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/09/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635778217190767095-GTY-484536690.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eb55ae87358a53bf28f9034c2bbaf51587a68b5c/c=0-0-319-240&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787986342410737-Chou.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787986342410737-Chou.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787986342410737-Chou.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KA57hr&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KA57hr&text=Avoid%20its%20pitfalls%20and%20China%20is%20land%20of%20opportunity%20&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-09-26T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T02:56:53.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
