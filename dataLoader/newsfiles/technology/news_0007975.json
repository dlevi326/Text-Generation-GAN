It declined further comment beyond the filing Tuesday. \nMayer has said the plan is intended to give Yahoo shareholders an equivalent stake in the new spinoff company without any added tax liability. \nWhile the IRS declined to make a ruling, Yahoo said the agency indicated \"it had not concluded that the proposed spin-off transaction was taxable and therefore was not ruling adversely on the request.\" Yahoo said its attorneys have advised that the agency's position doesn't change their opinion that the deal isn't taxable. \nShares in Yahoo Inc. fell about $1.24, or 4 percent, to $26.99 in after-hours trading after the regulatory filing was made public.
