Within seconds, more staff entered Whitehurst's office while others checked on Pointer to assure he was safe and unharmed, The Jonesboro Sun reported . \nThe test had been a success. Staff and administrators had been properly notified via text messages and responded as directed. The RAVE panic button mobile application mandated by Arkansas lawmakers for all school districts had achieved its goal for this exercise, described by Whitehurst to the JPS Board of Directors during its regular monthly meeting last Tuesday. \nAccording to Sun archives, the mobile app is free to school personnel because of Act 950 of 2015, which required all public schools in Arkansas to implement a panic button alert system by Sept. 1. \nIt also requires each school district to create an online facility profile for each campus and the district central office. That profile includes annotated floor plans of each building, campus layouts and contacts list for each school. \nThe Jonesboro Public Schools District is among many in the state working to train and familiarize staff and administration with the new security measure. Whitehurst said the process is going as planned, with training sessions and demonstrations conducted throughout the district. \nThere are different layers of notifications within the RAVE app, varying from a minor injury requiring attention from a school nurse to a hostile situation. The key is how the app simultaneously sends automated notifications to members of the various groups for each category while also connecting the person initiating the appropriate measure with local emergency services if required. \n\"Almost instantly, the moment you hit the button the texts are sent,\" Whitehurst said. \nSecurity directors or school resource officers require staff members of each district to complete a form with their personal contact information. The groups of responders are then created for various levels of security based on location and ability to perform certain tasks, such as CPR. \nThe Nettleton Public Schools District was the first to be armed with the RAVE app, according to the RAVE Mobile Safety Web site. The company provided feedback from NPS Superintendent James Dunivan, given his district's status as a pilot participant in the statewide implementation. \n\"The earlier you can notify authorities about problems, and the quicker they can respond, the better it is for everyone,\" Dunivan is quoted as saying on the RAVE Web page. \"The legislation initiated this and we got in there and found out what company was going to provide this service and they agreed to let us be one of the pilot schools.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:00:30.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
