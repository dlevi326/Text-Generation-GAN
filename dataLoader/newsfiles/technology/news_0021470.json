However, some recent published reports say the mobile wallet may not debut until at least 2016. In addition to Apple Pay, CurrentC will be competing with the soon-to-be launched Samsung Pay. \nWhile CurrentC promises to save retailers on interchange, the costs of operating the network and fighting fraud will result in higher costs than interchange, Carr said. \nHe added that another issue with interchange is that some processors inflate the interchange fees, dues and assessments without notifying merchants. According to a Heartland article distributed at the conference, a car dealer chose a processor who appeared to offer the lowest fees, but closer examination showed that interchange fees were being falsely inflated and he was paying more than three times what the contract stated, a 250 percent markup. \n“We need to end junk fees,” Carr said. “The deceptive practice of falsely inflating pass-through interchange fees not only constitutes unfair and illegal competition, it also costs even the smallest merchants hundreds, or sometimes even thousands of their hard-earned dollars each year, without their awareness.” Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T21:35:13.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
