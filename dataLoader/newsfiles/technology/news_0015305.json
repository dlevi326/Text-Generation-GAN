Collaborators in the DesignHub include Texas Instruments, GaN Systems, Accelerated Designs, Octopart, and Seeed. The DesignHub shaves hours off design time and ensures maximal reusability by making it easy to search, find, and download computer-aided design (CAD) building blocks, such as PCB footprints and schematic symbols, from leading component manufacturers and providers. All building blocks export to major design tools, including Cadence OrCad/Allegro, Altium, Eagle, Mentor PADS, KiCad, and Pulsonix.\nTo provide transparency into quality, SnapEDA runs a diagnostic check on each CAD file to catch common manufacturing issues – such as silkscreen-to-copper overlaps, or poorly defined centroids – before they result in costly errors. Additionally a rating system lets engineers approve or flag parts.\nThe DesignHub was created in response to frequent requests among SnapEDA users for more manufacturer-provided or vetted CAD content to aid in the design of their printed circuit boards (PCBs).\nCollaborators in the DesignHub are also popular among design engineers: Texas Instruments is a leading semiconductor company, and the most searched manufacturer on SnapEDA; GaN Systems is at the forefront of Gallium Nitride transistor technology; Accelerated Designs is a large library creator for the EDA industry; and Octopart and Seeed’s curated parts lists are increasingly common ways of selecting components.\nDesignHub collaborators further commented:\n“What makes SnapEDA special is their ability to export popular Texas Instruments part libraries into different EDA tools that hardware designers use every day. This helps them find and bring TI parts into their designs faster,” said Mark Easley, TI LaunchPad Applications Engineer.\n“Gallium nitride power transistors have moved into the mainstream of adoption as designers dramatically reduce the size, weight and cost of their AC-DC, DC-DC and DC-AC power conversion systems. We are working with SnapEDA to provide designers with speedier access to data on our family of high performance power transistors” said Girvan Patterson, President, GaN Systems. “On-line downloads of design data in file formats compatible with industry standard computer simulation software are critical for GaN Systems’ customers.”\n“As one of the driving forces behind the DesignHub parts library, we feel it is a great way to provide the industry with PCB footprint and symbol data that is also vetted by the community. This reduces the chance for costly errors and reduces the time-to-market on new PCB designs. As the creators of the vendor-neutral BXL format, we also believe in giving engineers flexibility to work in whatever CAD tool is required for a design,” said Frank Frank, President of Accelerated Designs\n\"The Common Parts Library lets makers and hardware startups move quickly by providing a list of commonly used and widely available components for connected device applications. We're thrilled that SnapEDA has joined the effort by providing symbols and footprints for those parts to help get them into PCB designs quickly,” said Sam Wurzel, CEO of Octopart.\n“The open parts library is a collection of the most commonly used components. This library will save time on components sourcing and shorten lead-times on the manufacturing side. We are grateful that SnapEDA has opened all the CAD files to different EDA tools, which will definitely benefit the whole community,” said Eric Pan, CEO of Seeed.\nThe DesignHub can be explored at http://www.snapeda.com/libraries/ .\nAbout Texas Instruments\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (TI) is a global semiconductor design and manufacturing company that develops analog ICs and embedded processors.
