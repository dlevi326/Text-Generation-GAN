Estate agent Rachael Roberts says she was bullied by her employer because she was removed as a friend on the social networking site.\nAustralia's Fair Work Commission heard the case, and ruled that Ms Roberts had been discriminated against by her Tasmania-based employer.\nShe had been unfriended by Lisa Bird, the wife of the agency's boss - who also worked at the firm.\nThe tribunal found that the move showed a \"lack of emotional maturity\" and was \"indicative of unreasonable behaviour\".\nThe commission's deputy president Nicole Wells said: \"Mrs Bird took the first opportunity to draw a line under the relationship with Ms Roberts when she removed her as a friend on Facebook as she did not like Ms Roberts and would prefer not to have to deal with her.\"\nThe dispute with senior management began when Ms Roberts complained that her properties were not being displayed fairly in the office's front window.\nShe was later diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was deemed unfit to work by a psychologist until the dispute had been resolved.\nThe tribunal said that Mrs Bird's behaviour - which included calling Ms Roberts a \"naughty little schoolgirl running to the teacher\" - posed a risk to the employee's health and safety.\nThe tribunal is unable to award compensation, and instead can only oblige the employer and employee to meet to resolve the situation.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:48:48.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
