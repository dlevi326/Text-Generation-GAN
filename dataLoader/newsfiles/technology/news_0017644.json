As their study says, finding liquid water on the Martian surface is important for understanding the potential for life.Why look for liquid water? The answer to that question is only obvious if you assume extraterrestrial biochemistry is the same as here on Earth, where H 2 0 is vital to all living things. And yet ' follow the water ' is the strategy that researchers and space agencies such as NASA use to search for alien life. Why is that? Couldn't other combinations of elements work just as well as two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen? Here's a short explainer on what makes water so special. 1. Water is a powerful solvent Many materials can be dissolved in water, producing solutions that carry substances around a cell or body, including nutrients and waste products of metabolism. Water provides a liquid medium for 'diffusion' – the movement of molecules down a concentration gradient (from high to low) – and is the main component of blood and other fluids that transport molecules such as oxygen between animal tissues. To serve as a solvent, H 2 O must obviously be in the liquid state: solid ice would lock molecules in place within a crystal-like arrangement, whereas a gas can't bring molecules together for the chemical reactions that drive life's processes. 2. Water makes biochemistry easy Several of water's physical properties are down to its unique chemical structure: the three atoms don't occur in a straight line (H-O-H), but with a bent geometry. And like a bar magnet, each water molecule has poles with a (slight) electric charge, or 'dipole', as the electrons orbiting atoms aren't distributed evenly around H2O. This enables an interaction called a hydrogen bond that can occur between the positively-charged hydrogen of one H 2 O molecule and the negatively-charged oxygen from another. Hydrogen bonding means water forms a three-dimensional network in which its atoms can participate in reactions with dissolved proteins and other biological molecules. Philip Ball, author of H 2 O: A Biography of Water , calls water 'biophilic' (or 'life-loving'). Although technically an inorganic substance, H 2 O can itself be considered a biomolecule.[caption id=\"attachment_2568\" align=\"\" width=\"960\"] Hydrogen bonds (1) between water molecules (Image CC BY-SA 3.0: Wikimedia)[/caption] 3. Water resists being heated A large amount of energy is needed to raise the temperature of H20. This thermal property is the 'specific heat capacity': the quantity of energy per unit mass (Joules per gram) required to increase a substance's temperature by 1º Celsius. Thanks to its extensive network of hydrogen bonds, water has a relatively high specific heat capacity, at 4.18 J/g°C. By comparison, the stable crystal structure of sodium and chlorine atoms in salt (NaCl) is 0.864 J/g°C. One consequence of a high specific heat capacity is that it takes loads of energy to cause a liquid to evaporate, so water helps buffer the inside of a cell or body against external fluctuation in environmental temperature. 4. Water expands when cooled Related to its ability to resist heating, water remains liquid over a broad temperature range. As everyone knows, H 2 O freezes at 0ºC (32°F) and boils at 100°C (212°F). And if you add a salt to interrupt water's hydrogen bonds, forming brine – as thought to occur on Mars – then its freezing point can drop below zero. Unlike most liquids, frozen water also expands because the bonds between H 2 O molecules occupy more space in a solid, lowering its density. Instead of sinking, ice floats on the surface of liquid water and continuously melts under the Sun's rays. Virtually all life on Earth is ultimately powered by solar radiation following photosynthesis, and extraterrestrials might also exploit the free energy provided by their nearest star. 5. Water molecules stick together If there's life on Mars, people suspect that it will be small, single-celled microbes. But on other planets – including Earth – H 2 O's polar properties can be useful for large, multicellular organisms. Hydrogen bonding causes water molecules to stick to one another – forming droplets through cohesion, for example – while adhesion can attract molecules towards a surface. One way this is exploited in nature is through the capillary action that pulls liquid up the narrow stem of a plant.Water is only vital to life as we know it . If conditions on a moon or planet aren't ideal to forming H 2 O, it's possible that aliens could evolve alternative biochemistries. Substances like ammonia (NH 3 ) might serve as a non-aqueous solvent, for example (but there are problems like a narrow liquid range). The unique properties of H2O mean that NASA's 'follow the water' strategy for finding extraterrestrial life is very sensible. This is why distant worlds that are predicted to carry liquid water are said to fall within a 'habitable zone' that's just right for life, or 'Goldilocks zone' – an region that includes Mars.", "external_links": ["http://www.astrobio.net/interview/water-the-molecule-of-life/", "http://mars.nasa.gov/programmissions/overview/", "http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2546.html"], "published": "2015-10-01T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:06:34.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
