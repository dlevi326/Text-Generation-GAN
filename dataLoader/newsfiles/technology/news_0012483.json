In an interview with ETCIO.com he speaks on the enterprise IT trends and the need for enterprises to invest in Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine to Machine (M2M) technologies. What are the trends that are shaping IT adoption from an enterprise perspective? As a development services company, how are you trying to bank on the trends? In the last three to four years we have observed that non-traditional IT companies are working with us to develop products that they can use for themselves. Some examples here include brick and mortar retailers, agri-business etc. in other words, companies that were not associated with software development are now beginning to catch the trend. Every business realizes that they need to become a software business. The whole digital transformation or disruption is driving enterprises to focus more and more in creating software to match pace with the outside world and how it communicates.For example, we have been working with some of the traditional automotive companies on the dealership of the future. In the physical world of brick and mortar automotive dealership, they need first-rate metrics and statistics in real-time about their products on the similar lines of online e-commerce players.We have made investments in reference architectures, and we have reusable components that are available for free to customers in areas like IoT that is really crucial for omnichannel retail, in vehicle entertainment software for automotive etc. Q] IoT and M2M have the power to transform the way we live and work, creating both opportunities and challenges for companies, governments and consumers across every industry. Your views. There is a distinction between IoT and M2M. In IoT, the intelligence must reside in the network or in the device itself. It's this \"intelligence\" to make context aware real-time decisions that imputes meaning to the data supplied by the sensors, and decides how to act on it, whereas M2M doesn't include that kind of analytics.People who have power in an organization are the ones who are generating revenue today for their business. Many think that any change in their revenue model or any future investment in revenue generating activities is essentially a threat to their current steps.Successful companies have reached ahead of competition because of their business or technology strategy. Companies cannot afford to be complacent and if they have a mindset of not investing in new technologies their businesses will be threatened. So it is extremely important for business leaders who generate today's revenue to invest in future technologies like IoT and M2M. Q] Can you share some examples of innovation being delivered out of India to companies? In terms of IoT we have done some work in the online education space using machine learning algorithms. We are doing a lot on analytics based software in our Noida facility, and also working with one of the leading telco in India on their initiative of connected car that is delivered out of our Nagpur unit. In the connected vehicle space, we are doing some real- time machine learning and analytics out of our Bengaluru facility. Q] How are you combining your design and innovation capabilities to your core technology R&D offering, to help enterprises bring innovation to their customers? There has never been a better time to develop powerful real-time, analytically enabled solutions. This makes it a very exciting time to be in the product development services business. Over 50 percent of the Fortune 500 companies that existed in the year 2000 are no longer there in the list. One needs to be a customer centric and software centric in today's business to survive or take the risk of being eliminated.With the digital disruption many market leaders are experiencing threat from newer entrants or from fast paced digital movers. Customers now expect advanced technology and design elegance in the same package.We have design subsidiary called Method where we help customers start with a blank blackboard and where they can come up with their own ideas. In a way we help solve business challenges through design thinking and create inspired products, services and brand experiences that engage customers. We partner with them to design, develop, architect and implement the idea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T12:11:47.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
