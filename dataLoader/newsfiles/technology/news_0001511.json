The company also announced the immediate availability of deviceConnect™ Release 6.0, supporting iOS 9 and Android 6 devices. \n“With this release, our customers are equipped to continue to work with the latest operating systems from Google and Apple,” said Donald Addington, President and CEO of Mobile Labs, the market-leading provider of mobile device clouds that improve mobile app quality and speed app delivery. “This release expands the role deviceConnect plays in mobile app development, testing, and support.” \ndeviceBridge is a separately-priced extension to deviceConnect that offers industry-first support for mobile app developers who wish to use cloud-based real mobile devices with tools like Xcode for app checkout and debugging. deviceBridge also expands deviceConnect’s universe of mobile app test automation to include using cloud-based devices with open source test frameworks such as Appium and Calabash. This brings all the remote access, management, scheduling, and DevOps benefits of deviceConnect to these new uses. \n“deviceBridge represents a complete re-thinking of how mobile device clouds can improve quality in all phases of mobile app development, testing, and support,” said Addington. “Through deviceBridge, developers will find new freedom and improved velocity by having a wide range of cloud-based devices at their fingertips for coding, checking, and debugging.” \ndeviceBridge acts as a “virtual USB cable” that allows users who normally use local, USB-attached mobile devices to instead instantly select, view, and use remote real devices from a deviceConnect cloud. A cloud-resident device may be viewed and manipulated in a browser window on the user’s desktop and can be directly used by Xcode and, in a later release, Android Developer Studio. iTunes, for example, can use cloud-based devices as if they were locally plugged. \ndeviceBridge also supports leading open-source mobile testing frameworks that ordinarily use USB-attached devices, such as Appium and Calabash. For example, Appium servers can use any cloud device without changes to scripts or to Appium itself. \nRather than rewrite open-source components or create elaborate translation layers, deviceBridge represents advanced thinking about how a device cloud can serve as the heart of the mobile development infrastructure. \n“Leading open-source tools for testing mobile devices, mobile apps, and mobile web are critical to many enterprises who build high-quality, agile mobile teams,” said Addington. “deviceConnect with deviceBridge now leads the industry by supporting an unprecedented number of open-source tools. But we also believe the full impact of a device cloud on app quality, development efficiency, and DevOps requires developers be first-class citizens of the device cloud as well, and deviceBridge makes that possible.” \nRelease 6 of deviceConnect supporting iOS 9 and Android 6 devices and deviceBridge for iOS devices is available immediately, with a version of deviceBridge for Android Developer Studio and Android devices expected in a future release. \nAbout Mobile Labs \nMobile Labs provides enterprise-grade, next generation testing tools for mobile app testing, mobile device testing and mobile website testing.
