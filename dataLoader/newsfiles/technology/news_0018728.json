At the core of its vision for the connected home of the future sits the SmartThings Hub. SmartThings for a smarter home? \nThe fruit of a $200m (£131m) acquisition in 2014 , SmartThings facilities cross-platform communication between network-connected household devices. Announced at IFA 2015 is a new SmartThings Hub and sensors, along with an upgraded mobile app that can converse with and control a range of devices for home automation. \nSamsung Chief Marketing Officer Dr WP Hong pledged that by 2020 each its devices will be IoT-enabled, but SmartThings works with non-Samsung devices too from the likes of Bose, Sonos, Yale, Osram and Honeywell, as well as with popular IoT standards such as Z-Wave and ZigBee. \"Human-centric approach\" \nOf course, the real challenge is n0t to connect these devices to one another — trivial for a firm with Samsung's engineering muscle — instead it is to find reasons compelling enough for consumers to wish them connected in the first place. \nThe internet-connected fridge has often been pilloried as the epitome of future-home pointlessness; until manufacturers find a way to demonstrate tangible benefits of an interconnected home it, and other connected appliances (such as the internet-ready dual-doored washing machine also announced by Samsung in Berlin), are unlikely to succeed. Samsung SmartThings (Samsung) \nSamsung does recognise this challenge. Chief Mmarketing officer Dr WP Hong spoke boldly of his firm's \"human-centric approach\" and an IoT strategy \"not driven by technology, but by people's expectations\". \"It has to be an IoT for you\", he continued. Challenges \nCommenting on the Samsung announcements Adam Simon, global managing director of retail for industry analysts CONTEXT, was optimistic for Samsung's IoT strategy. In a survey of households across UK, France and Germany he reported \"nearly half expect to be living in a smart home within the next 3-5 years\". \nSome countries appear even more forward-thinking than others. \"A quarter of German consumers envisage this becoming a reality within the next 12 months\" revealed Mr Simon. \nNevertheless, analysts also recognise the challenges that firms like Samsung face: \"We are still at the early stages of this market, with new devices, new routes-to-market, new partners and new competitors emerging\". \nThe Samsung SmartThings starter kit bundle will cost £199 when it goes on sale in the UK later this month and includes the SmartThings Hub, Power Outlet, Motion Sensor, Presence Sensor and Multi Sensor to monitor doors and windows.
