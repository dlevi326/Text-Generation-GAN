The new version, dated March 2015, replaces that issued in October 2013. It provides practical guidance on managing the health and safety risks associated with excavation work, and applies to all types of excavation work, including bulk excavations more than 1.5 metres deep, trenches, shafts and tunnels. Changes are minimal, one word only to correct an error. The sentence in section 4.1 on page 14 now reads: “Mechanical plant, vehicles, storage of materials (including excavated material) or any other heavy loads should not be located in the ‘zone of influence’ of an excavation unless the ground support system installed has been designed by a competent person, for example a geotechnical engineer, to carry such loads.” In the 2013 edition it read: “Mechanical plant, vehicles, storage of materials (including excavated material) or any other heavy loads should not be located in the ‘zone of influence’ of an excavation. The ground support system installed has been designed by a competent person, for example a geotechnical engineer, to carry such loads.” However, as it stands the code has no legal status. It is up to individual states and territories to adopt it. In January 2014, when we reported on the status of the October 2013 version of the code, no state or territory had adopted it. The situation as not improved much.- The ACT has only a ‘guidance note’ dating from May 2011.- NSW is up with the times its code dated July 2015 is - The Northern Territory’s July 2104 Code of Practice for Construction Work makes reference to a Code of Practice: Excavation Work, but we were unable to locate it.- The Queensland Excavation Code of Practice 2013 is based on the 2012 version of the Worksafe Australia code.- The South Australian Code is based on the latest March 2015 edition of the Worksafe Australia code.- The Tasmanian code is also long in the tooth, it dates from December 2012.- We were unable to find anything on the Worksafe Victoria web site other than a Trenching & Excavation Checklist For Builders And Building Trades Contractors dating from 2005.- The WA cod e dates from 2005.
