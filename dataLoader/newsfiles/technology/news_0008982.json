But the company hasn't budged on its position on online viewing -- one it's been touting for many years. \nInstead of focusing on offline viewing features, Netflix ( NFLX , Tech30 ) says it wants to improve the \"streaming experience,\" according to Anne Marie Squeo, a company spokeswoman. \n\"With Internet speeds climbing and Wi-Fi available in more and more places, the ability to stream live wherever you are will make downloading less relevant over time,\" Squeo told CNNMoney in an email. \nHunt told Gizmodo that giving customers the option of offline viewing might even \"paralyze\" indecisive people. \nCiting the book 'Paradox of Choice',\" Hunt said that, in Netflix's experience, adding choice scares customers away. For example, Netflix once tried letting people rate movies and shows with half stars, he explained, and the number of total ratings submitted dropped 11%. \nEven so, if demand for offline viewing is high, and more streaming services offer the feature, Netflix may be pressured to offer the option eventually.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:25:38.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
