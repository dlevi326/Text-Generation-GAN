The Times ’s website relies upon estimates “provided by the Violations Documentation Center and are as of September 9, 2015.” This non-governmental organization claims to use a three-stage process for gathering and documenting information from within Syria, and verifying its accuracy to the best extent possible. The VDC notes that it strives for “conveying the truth as it is on the condition that those data and information are being regularly reviewed, checked and revised.”\nRelated Story Which Deaths Matter?\nThese fatality estimates should therefore be viewed with an understanding of the inherent difficulties of reporting from within Syria, and the conscious or unconscious biases often found within NGOs. The VDC categorization and numbers conflict significantly with those published by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a human-rights NGO based in London—as you can see from the comparison below. Even the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights decided to stop providing public estimates of casualties in January 2014, because it could no longer guarantee that the source material for its estimates was accurate.\nMicah Zenko / Council on Foreign Relations / VDC / SOHR Nevertheless, the Times’ s presentation of the VDC data is illuminating for policy discussions about whether and how to intervene militarily in Syria. Consistent with earlier analyses , most people who have tragically lost their lives in Syria are not civilians, but rather active combatants. This is worth bearing in mind when U.S. senators repeat the inaccurate statement that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has “massacred” 200,000 of his own people. The Syrian security forces under Assad’s authority have perpetrated an untold number of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and as the head of state he must be held accountable by a post-conflict special tribunal for Syria. However, those advocating the use of force to protect civilians should recognize that there first must be an end to the fighting between the combatants, within which civilians have suffered and died on a tremendous scale.", "external_links": ["http://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2014/04/01/syria-civil-war-total-fatalities/", "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/09/14/world/middleeast/syria-war-deaths.html", "http://www.vdc-sy.info/index.php/en/about", "http://world.time.com/2014/01/07/un-to-stop-updating-syria-death-toll/"], "published": "2015-09-16T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:38:48.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
