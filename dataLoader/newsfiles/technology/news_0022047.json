Advances in automation, genomic testing, and the increased use of point-of-care testing will drive further shifts in where and when testing takes place. Next-generation systems will capture information at each stage of the healthcare continuum to enable unprecedented flexibility and clinical validity. \nThe Advent of Laboratory Business Management Systems \n\"Labs will inevitably need to move from a support service to a business that helps drive better healthcare outcomes,\" said Wilkinson. \"The next generation of informatics solutins are designed to manage the lab as an agile, knowledge-driven business in an increasingly interconnected world. Today's laboratory information management systems fall short of what labs need. We are raising the bar by introducing the world's first laboratory business management system, or LBMS, which will help customers transform from a reactive testing and results service to a proactive healthcare partner.\" \nAn LBMS will enable laboratories to work differently. Not only will they communicate lab results electronically, but they will also identify their derivation, including workflows, equipment, and personnel involved, regardless of where they are located. \nConnected care models and shared electronic health records will also see laboratory professionals become more directly involved in patient care. With a continuous view of the patient's condition, lab professionals will extend their services into hospital wards and other settings. \nAn LBMS will provide the following new capabilities: Distributed sample processing: Samples may be collected in one location, processed at another, analysed at a third, and digitally referred to yet another location for a second opinion. Accountability and process improvement : Complete visibility and control over the testing process - including which tests are running at a profit and which ones at a loss - will enable greater accountability and allow laboratories to continually improve processes and optimise distributed workflows and resources. Efficiency through automation: Standard operating procedures with full auditability will not only support distribution of workflows across multiple sites, but also drive further automation by decreasing the percentage of tests requiring manual intervention. Patient-centric care: Support for connected care models will put patients at the centre of the testing process with a contiguous pathology patient record, integrated within the electronic health record, including all test data - including point-of-care test results. Quality assurance: Lab professionals will extend quality assurance outside of the laboratory using asset management functionality for equipment data, with maintenance events viewed and analysed alongside patient test results. \nBe part of the conversation at #BeyondLIMS .
