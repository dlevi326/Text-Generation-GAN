Source: Instagram\nAnd in true New York form, nobody lent a hand.\n“I would always yell, ‘My hammy’ [when I was getting up], and no one ever helped me.”\nThe actor says he learned how to do the splits in at school in Year 10, and he’s documented himself “splitting” repeatedly online, ripping his boxers the first time he gave it a go at home.\nThank the flexible gods, this isn’t his last foray.\n“The next time you see a Logan Paul split video on the internet, it’s going to be bigger, bolder and better, so yes I do have plans.”\nJust don’t expect any help from New Yorkers if you get stuck, Logan.\nThis article originally appeared on The New York Post .\nOriginally published as 42 million views for doing the splits Increase Text Size Decrease Text Size Print Email Share Add to Digg Add to del.icio.us Add to Facebook Add to Kwoff Add to Myspace Add to Newsvine What are these?
