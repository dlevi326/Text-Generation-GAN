His body is a rolling ball while his head stays upright while staying attached to the spinning body below.\nThe droid you’ve been looking for ... a replica of the BB-8 droid that will feature in Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens.

Star Wars producer Kathleen Kennedy says Sphero, which has a range of app-controlled robots including the ball Sphero , was “the company that helps us discover the technology” of making a working BB-8 droid for the Star Wars movie launch.\nSphero has been teasing the release of its BB-8 droid for weeks with a cut-out image on its website promising “this is the droid you’ve been looking for”.\nIan Bernstein , co-founder of the Colorado-based robotics company, said the deal to produce the BB-8 came as a result of a 10-minute meeting with Disney head Bob Iger during a Disney tech starter project.\nBeep beep ... BB-8 features in the new Star Wars film The Force Awakens, along with Daisy Ridley. Source: Instagram\nBernstein said at the meeting, which happened during the early days of shooting of the new film which is out 17 December, Iger pulled out his iPhone and began showing images from the set of the movie.\n“Then he gets to this picture of BB-8 and says ‘this kind of looks like your stuff’,” Bernstein said.\nBernstein and fellow Sphero co-founder Adam Wilson went from that meeting and, based on just a few seconds of seeing an image, immediately starting working out in CAD software how they could create a real-life BB-8. Using a 3D printer, they were able to go back to Disney the next day with a working model.\nLike the original Sphero, BB-8 can be controlled with an iOS or Android app.\nBut being a Star Wars robot, BB-8 has extra features, including a hologram feature in the app so that if you look at your smartphone you can see the palm-sized robot project a 3D message.\nIf you’ve ever wanted to recreate the famous “help me Obi-Wan Kanobi, you’re my only hope” message, this is your chance.\nThe head of the robot attaches to the body with magnets. The head generally sits on top of the droid, but steer BB-8 under low furniture and the head will slide down the body of the robot as the droid keeps moving.\nEye spy ...

Source: News Corp Australia\nWhile the smart features of the app-controlled robot are what are set to make this a hot seller this Christmas, Bernstein said the hardest part of making it was ensuring the look of the toy was identical to the droid in the movie.\n“It’s cool to be involved with Star Wars . BB-8 is going to be huge,” Bernstein said.\n“They told us when they were first talking to us a year ago they didn’t think you could actually make a real one.\n“In the movie it was all puppeteered. To be able to bring BB-8 to life was awesome.”\n* Sphero’s BB-8 is on sale now from retailers including JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman for $249.95. www.sphero.com\n Buy your own Star Wars BB-8 droid ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/this-is-the-droid-youve-been-looking-for-sphero-launches-app-controlled-star-wars-vii-bb-8-droid/story-fni0byb5-1227510529229?sv=2a9f480a4f3dd5212dcb36d515ff3c46&h=Buy+your+own+Star+Wars+BB-8+droid", "http://www.starwars.com/the-force-awakens/", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/this-is-the-droid-youve-been-looking-for-sphero-launches-app-controlled-star-wars-vii-bb-8-droid/story-fni0byb5-1227510529229?sv=2a9f480a4f3dd5212dcb36d515ff3c46", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/03/1227510/529659-86c8167a-51c9-11e5-8ffe-a0d4079a7abb.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/04/1227512/042406-c54248fa-5276-11e5-a3d5-9b39810bf08c.jpg", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/this-is-the-droid-youve-been-looking-for-sphero-launches-app-controlled-star-wars-vii-bb-8-droid/story-fni0byb5-1227510529229?sv=2a9f480a4f3dd5212dcb36d515ff3c46&title=Buy+your+own+Star+Wars+BB-8+droid", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/03/1227510/529633-a4d149ac-51c9-11e5-8ffe-a0d4079a7abb.jpg", "http://www.sphero.com/", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Buy+your+own+Star+Wars+BB-8+droid&c=THIS+is+the+droid+you%26%238217%3Bve+been+looking+for.+Sphero+robotics+has+launched+BB-8%2C+the+Star+Wars+VII+robot+you+can+control+with+a+smartphone+or+tablet.&u=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/this-is-the-droid-youve-been-looking-for-sphero-launches-app-controlled-star-wars-vii-bb-8-droid/story-fni0byb5-1227510529229?sv=2a9f480a4f3dd5212dcb36d515ff3c46", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/this-is-the-droid-youve-been-looking-for-sphero-launches-app-controlled-star-wars-vii-bb-8-droid/story-fni0byb5-1227510529229?sv=2a9f480a4f3dd5212dcb36d515ff3c46&title=Buy+your+own+Star+Wars+BB-8+droid", "https://twitter.com/arobodude", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/this-is-the-droid-youve-been-looking-for-sphero-launches-app-controlled-star-wars-vii-bb-8-droid/story-e6frfrnr-1227510529229", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/this-is-the-droid-youve-been-looking-for-sphero-launches-app-controlled-star-wars-vii-bb-8-droid/story-fni0byb5-1227510529229?sv=2a9f480a4f3dd5212dcb36d515ff3c46"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-07T10:41:46.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
