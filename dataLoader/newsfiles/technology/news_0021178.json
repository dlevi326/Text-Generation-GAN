All passengers booked on Seaborne Airlines will be offered the opportunity to re-book their flights into Guadeloupe, or on existing schedule service to Fort-de-France, Martinique at no expense. The islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique have regular ferry service to Dominica.\n“We are devastated to learn of the loss of life and sustained damage that has occurred in Dominica as a result of Tropical Storm Erika,” said Gary Foss, CEO of Seaborne Airlines, “Our company and our employees are making all efforts to help travelers, relief workers, and the citizenry of Dominica at this time.”\nDuring the next several weeks, Seaborne will operate up to three times daily service between San Juan Luis Munoz Marin International Airport and Point-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe. Seaborne will continue to maintain three times weekly service from San Juan to Fort-de-France, Martinique, which also has regularly scheduled ferry service to Dominica. In San Juan, passengers can connect to other Seaborne flights in the Caribbean, and partner airlines Air Europa, American, Delta, JetBlue, and United. Passengers will be able to connect to 33 destinations in the Americas and Europe in tandem with these carriers.
