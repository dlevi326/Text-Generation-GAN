Monitoring of packaging materials and effluents \nDTS provides monitoring of packaging materials, water and effluents. \nThe company has been ISO: 17025 accredited since 1961 and works by forming partnerships to become an integral part of clients' business and supply chain through analytical and assurance services. Microbiological testing \nUsing high levels of automation and rapid technology, DTS offers analysis for food pathogens such as salmonella, E coli, Listeria, STEC, Vibrio and Staphylococcus. \nDTS's microbiological services include the analysis of organisms that affect shelf life performance for perishable foods and bacterial identification. Physical testing for food products \nSensory evaluations for taints, storage trials, head space analysis and photo microscopy services are available, as well as particle/mesh size, viscosity measurements, product functionality tests and foreign body identification. \nDTS can conduct tests using Brookfield viscometers, sieve shakers, optical photo microscopes, freeze dryers, platform and high shear mixers, sample homogenisers, stomachers, centrifuges, and pH/conductivity meters. \nTests can be conducted for appearance, bulk density, brix, colour, dispersibility, extraneous matter, flavour, odour, foreign matter, heat stability and insoluble matter. \nThe company also measures melting point, mesh size, scorched particles, sediment, specific gravity, solubility, solids, water activity, refractive index, density and viscosity. Food allergen detection \nDTS uses ELISA technology to discover food allergens in raw materials, environmental swabs, material in production and end products. \nThe company quantifies peanut, hazelnut, almond, soy, sesame, milk (lactoglobulin and casein), egg, crustaceans and gluten proteins. \nCustomised training, risk assessment and profiling is available to provide staff with the knowledge and tools to manage food allergens in a production environment. GMO testing \nRepresenting the Genescan brand in GMO technology, the DTS GMO laboratory is accredited to ISO: 17025 standards for the detection of genetically modified organisms. \nUsing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, analysts can detect the presence of genetically modified material at very low levels. \nQualitative and quantitative GMO testing is provided for raw materials and processed foodstuffs for the Australasian and South East Asia regions. \nDTS's GMO services can test for all commercialised GMO plants in the world. Standard screening tests can detect more than 90% of GMO plant varieties in the marketplace. Chemistry and nutrition testing \nOne of the major global trends driving innovation across the food industry is the relationship between health, wellness and nutrition. DTS uses its state-of-the-art chemistry centre to meet the needs of the food industry and retailers. \nChemistry and nutrition testing offered by DTS includes FODMAPs, protein and fats, including saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, trans and omega fats. \nTesting is available for moisture, ash, vitamins, minerals, residue testing, dietary fibre and novel fibres such as resistant maltodextrin, inulin and polydextrose. Food forensics and milk analytical services \nDTS specialises in forensic microscopy and food forensics, and are supported by an experienced in-house team and equipment assets with access to FTIT and SEM. \nThe company addresses the key cause of product recalls, including allergen and microbial contamination, as well as non-compliant labelling. \nOther areas of expertise include assisting clients in consulting, on-site troubleshooting, risk profiling, review and reporting to help protect brands. \nDTS improve the quality of milk from farms through herd testing, raw milk quality, calibration samples and detection of common mastitis producing organisms through RtPCR. \nAll testing services are approved by DAFF, National Heart Foundation Tick and FODMAP. About DTS \nDairy Technical Services was founded in 1954 to provide microbiological and chemical test results for export products to Europe. \nThe organisation has grown for more than 60 years to become DTS Food Laboratories. \nDTS are excited to be part of food safety and assurance excellence, supporting the industry and helping to provide healthy food for local and international markets.
