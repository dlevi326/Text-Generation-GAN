SSAMCAST launched in June to give students access to high quality learning resources without the price tag of traditional tutoring services and supplemental education. Partnering with UC Berkeley students, SSAMCAST created free college preparatory courses in SAT Writing, Reading, Math, AP Calculus, Chemistry, and many more. Using the lightboard technology, teachers can face their students while they write their lecture notes on the board. SSAMCAST engineers have applied 3D modeling to render unique, dynamic, and interactive online content called “learning lens” courses. These courses add another layer of depth and understanding into the course material by helping students to grasp difficult concepts and easily visualize shapes, diagrams, and structures.\nSSAMCAST also includes a series of interviews in which the current college students share their experiences and give first-hand advice to incoming freshmen. These CollegeTalk interviews are dedicated to preparing high school students for their higher education.\nWhether you are a student, parent, teacher, or just someone willing to learn– please take the time to visit http://www.ssamcast.com to see how Teracle is changing the face of eLearning.
