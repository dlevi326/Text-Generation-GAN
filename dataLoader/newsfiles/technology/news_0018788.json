Students enrolled in the programme - a joint venture between Murdoch University Reel Cinemas and Nikon - were divided into two groups one of children in 8 to 12 age group and the other of children aged 13 to 18. UAE offers a unique setting Rahim noted that Dubai - and the UAE in general - offers a unique atmosphere to create films which might be difficult in other parts of the region. \"The great thing about Dubai and the UAE is that it's a great combination of a beautiful landscape and a very unique climate with the fact that the UAE is thankfully a very stable place\" he said. \"The government is also very pro-media and wants to encourage people. Filmmakers and producers benefit from that. In other parts of the world that are very beautiful filmmakers aren't allowed to go because of political turmoil\" he added. Chairman of the Dubai Film and TV Commission Jamal Al Sharif said that the availability of such courses bodes well for the future of the UAE's expanding film industry. \"We are seeing an increasing number of filmmaking courses across Dubai and the wider region as a result of a growing appetite particularly among young people to create short films\" he said. \"We are delighted to be partnering with this excellent initiative which will not only promote young talent and creativity but will give the next generation of UAE filmmakers access to mentorship as well as various aspects of the industry from a young age.\" Rahim said he believes the governments of Dubai and the other emirates are working hard to nurture local film talent. \"I think they really want future filmmakers to be the next big thing\" he said. \"The UAE is really good at promoting arts. They have the foresight to see that as a very important element in their future. They are making the right moves.\" \"I see some very talented and famous names coming from the UAE in the future\" he added. Among those mentoring the budding filmmakers is Taimur Rahim a Dubai-based freelancer with over 10 years of experience in the TV industry. Rahim explained that students are being taught the intricacies of production from script to screen. \"For the first two weeks of the course the students learned theory. In other words they learned how to frame actors how to make a storyboard and how to write a script properly according to professional contemporary film industry standards. \"During the next two weeks they were doing practical work. Essentially during the third week they filmed their work learned how to operate Nikon HD cameras and as well as different parts of filmmaking such as shutter speed and sound management\" he said. \"They also learned how to deal with actors and be effective directors and work as a team.\" In the fourth week now under way the students are learning editing techniques at Murdoch facilities in Academic City. \"By the end of it they'll know which part of filmmaking they like and can venture into it in the future\" Rahim said. An eclectic bunch Rahim also noted that the students brought their unique upbringings and backgrounds to life on screen. \"They're a very eclectic bunch. Some are from Middle East some are European and some are from India or Pakistan\" he said. \"They bring their own aesthetics into their work as a lot of them are looking at the film industry from their own native countries for guidance.\" Among the participants is 11-year old Zaara Ali who said she has learned skills that she hopes to use during a future career in the film industry. \"There are many things that I like about the course. One of them is the actual filming. It's so much fun learning how to film people around you and the way they teach me the different camera angles and different stages of filming\" she said. \"It's something that I wouldn't have learned on my own so I'm really glad I joined this.\" Another student Zainab 11 said she foresees a future in the film industry. \"I want to go to film school and would like to become a director\" she said. \"I want to make dramas comedies stuff like that. I've learned a lot (on the course) and it's really helpful for my future.\" Bernd Debusmann Jr. Originally from Mexico City I've been in Dubai since January 2015.
