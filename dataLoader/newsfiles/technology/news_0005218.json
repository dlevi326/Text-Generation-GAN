We interviewed Koji Toyoshima, chief engineer of the company, about how the company will compete with Europe-based automakers in terms of hybrid systems. \nQ: European makers are competing with Toyota by releasing plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) and vehicles equipped with a low-cost 48V-compatible mild hybrid system. \nToyoshima: The strength of Toyota's hybrid system lies in its two-motor system, which has been continuously used since the release of the first model of the Prius in 1997. The two-motor system has a high efficiency. We have accumulated wisdom and ideas for about 20 years. We will differentiate our vehicles from others in a way that other companies cannot imitate. \nEuropean companies are announcing PHEVs one after the other but do not have much experience with hybrid vehicles (HEVs). PHEVs are developed by adding a plug-in function to an HEV. It is not easy to skip to a PHEV. But we respect their challenges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T08:34:08.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
