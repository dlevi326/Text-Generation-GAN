Love you Bust @brooklynbeckham.\" \nPrior to the word 'Buster', he had the famous '99' inking, which he dedicated to wife Victoria to mark the year they got married and welcomed their son Brooklyn. \nLast month, he unveiled on Instagram a new piece of body art featured the words 'Pretty Lady', which was dedicated to his daughter Harper. \nThe tattoo was written above his current 'Harper' ink near his neck.
