The Manhattan Beach, California-based chain, which operates about 900 stores globally, has launched an e-commerce site that links its customer experience across channels. \nUsing the Demandware Commerce Cloud enterprise cloud platform as a base, the new e-commerce site is fully mobile-optimized. In addition, True Religion leveraged Commerce Cloud’s open platform APIs to deliver an “endless aisle” solution in stores. This provides store associates with a tool to fulfill orders in True Religion’s brick-and-mortar stores from other stores or back-end inventory, helping to avoid lost sales and customer dissatisfaction. \n“Demandware is a key component of True Religion’s omnichannel retailing strategy,” said John Hazen, VP of omnichannel commerce and digital innovation at True Religion. “Our customers are very loyal so it was important that the new True Religion site be able to extend our brand to customers wherever they may be. And when they come to a True Religion store, the Demandware endless aisle solution empowers our great associates to deliver truly exceptional service that continually delights our customers.” \nFor a retailer like True Religion, which has a somewhat limited and denim-heavy product assortment, making sure customers can get the items they want, when and where they want them, is of paramount importance. True Religion has less opportunity for incidental, cross- or upsales than some other retailers. Its new omnichannel strategy that brings e-commerce to wherever the customer is, including the store, is a smart move toward maximizing sales and customer satisfaction.
