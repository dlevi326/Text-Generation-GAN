We are pleased to add these Connect America Fund resources to continue bringing high-speed Internet services to more Tennesseans.\" \nUnderstanding that broadband deployment in some remote areas is not economically viable, in late 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) modernized its Universal Service program, which accrues through charges on telephone customer bills, to support networks capable of providing broadband and voice services. \nIt created the Connect America Fund (CAF) to expand broadband in rural areas where market forces and economics do not support expansion. \nAT&T has elected to participate in the second phase of the CAF program in Tennessee, committing to deploy broadband to more than 81,000 rural homes and businesses in rural areas that the FCC has targeted after studying broadband availability. AT&T Tennessee will receive more than $26 million annually over the next six years, to help meet this commitment in the State. Other carriers in Tennessee have also committed to expand rural broadband through the CAF program, resulting in a combined total of more than $29 million annually for each of the next six years. \n\"Connectivity to broadband is essential in today's economy, and this additional deployment of high-speed Internet in rural areas will make communities across the state more attractive to future investment,\" said Amy New, Assistant Commissioner for Rural Development with the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development. \nAs part of this deployment, AT&T will deliver broadband at speeds of at least 10 Megabits per second (Mbps) for downloads and 1 Mbps for uploads. \nAbout AT&T \nAT&T Inc.
