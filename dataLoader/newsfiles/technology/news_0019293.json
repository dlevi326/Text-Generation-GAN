The innovative travel website set the industry standard for inventive on-line booking in its first year servicing travelers to Iceland. The WebAward competition, initiated in 1997, is the premier award recognition program for web developers, judged by independent experts from around the world who review websites in 96 industries.\nTripCreator’s CEO and co-founder Hilmar Halldorsson said today upon receiving the news, “The unique premise of TripCreator is to enable visitors to Iceland to book their entire itinerary in just moments, without the hassle of opening page after page of hotel, car rental, and location websites.” He added, “We are very pleased to learn that the Web Marketing Association – along with our many satisfied customers – agrees with us!”\nContent manager and co-founder Olafur Hilmarsson concurs. “We wanted tourists to find the planning process as delightful as their vacation,” he said. “With TripCreator, there is no need to jump around from site to site, vendor to vendor, or search for discounted services,” adding, “TripCreator does it all.”\nTripCreator’s best-price guarantee and 24/7 assistance ensures that travelers can book their entire itinerary with complete confidence – from car rental to hotel and individual excursions – at their own speed, on their own budget, and in an easy-to-plan format.\nIn a hurry? Fill-in the travel dates and number of people, select a budget (low-average-high), indicate an activity preference (mellow-standard-busy), and TripCreator will do the rest. Travelers can take the suggested itinerary as-is, add or subtract attractions or hotels, and within moments their trip is booked.\nWith its beautiful photography and intuitive format, planning a family holiday, a weekend escape, or the adventure of a lifetime is fun, quick and easy with TripCreator.\nAdditional information is available at TripCreator.com, the award-winning booking site created just for – and about – Iceland.\nMEDIA CONTACT:\nLella Erludóttir, marketing and communication\nlella(at)tripcreator(dot)com\nMobile: +354-868-1223\nhttps://tripcreator.com", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly90cmlwY3JlYXRvci5jb20="], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:26:57.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
