While the accommodations that students receive depend on their disabilities, Student Disability Services can provide students who are registered with their office with software that records and transcribes notes, read textbooks and emails, take photos of the board during lectures and insert them into their notes and more. The software, which includes Kurzweil 3000, Dragon, Sonocent and AudioNote, is available for free to students registered with their office and they can use it throughout internships and into their careers, said Coordinator of Adaptive Technology Colleen Hanna. They just finished introducing new software to students and hosted a workshop on technology on Friday, Sept. \" target=\"_blank\"> \nTechnology has made classes at Central Michigan University more accessible for on-campus students with disabilities, but work is still being done to make improvements. \nAccessibility for students with disabilities is being updated by offering software to make classes easier to navigate, new buildings being added to campus that are more accessible, and the Accessibility and Advisory Council providing resources to make on-campus events more accessible. \nMost learning accommodations in classrooms can be taken care of with software, said Lynne L’Hommedieu, director of Student Disability Services. \nAccommodations students receive depend on their disabilities, but students registered with Student Disability Services can have access to the new software for free. \nThe software was introduced to students in a workshop on Friday, Sept. 25. \nOther than recording and transcribing notes, the software can read textbooks and emails, take photos of the board during lectures and insert photos into notes. It includes Kurzweil 3000, Dragon, Sonocent and AudioNote, and can be utilized throughout internships and as students pursue their careers, said Coordinator of Adaptive Technology Colleen Hanna. \nThe student note takers offered through Student Disability Office attend classes and take notes for students with disabilities. However, L’Hommedieu said she hopes the number of student note takers will decrease dramatically within the next couple years and be replaced by their technology that records and transcribes lectures. \nStudent note takers attend classes and take notes for students with disabilities, but they are hard to find, especially for upper level classes, she said. \n“More and more, we’re going to keep moving in that direction (of technology) because it allows students to operate independently (like) any other student, and not depend on another person,” she said. \nFreeland senior Dakota Burch, who is visually impaired, uses Kurzweil to scan books. He can't see well enough to read, so he uses a screen reader. \n“(Technology) makes the assignments more accessible so we don’t have to ask for help all the time or have people read it to us,” he said. “It just (allows) us to be able to enjoy college without thinking of it like, ‘oh, I can’t do this; why can’t I do this?’ and stressing us out.” \nThe office of Student Disability Services offers various accommodations, with the most popular one being extended time and a quiet space for tests. \n“I think for the most part, CMU has come a long way in terms of striving for accessibility,” said Beth Kennedy, American Sign Language instructor and co-chair of the Accessibility and Disability Advisory Council. \nShe said some buildings on campus are older and not as accessible, while newer buildings have shown more positive changes. \n“I also think that in terms of accessibility of historical buildings and older things, it’s not just an issue at CMU, but around the world, so it’s exciting to see more and more new construction,” she said. \nThe Accessibility and Disability Advisory Council, which has almost 40 members from various departments and offices on campus, hopes to make on-campus events more accessible. \n“One of our goals I’m most excited about is that we have some funds we’re allotting in the ADAC budget, which is small, where people who are having an event on campus can contact us if they have a need to make an event accessible,” Kennedy said. “If they’re not able to afford interpreters or there’s been a community request for something they don’t have, (people running the event) can contact us and we can try to help with that.” \nShe said making events accessible for as many people as possible is important, but can be a barrier because of people’s budgets. They’ve already had some requests for interpreters this year. If ADAC can’t provide the funding, she said, their intention is to help people look for other partners to ensure accessibility at events. \n“Accessibility is something that can benefit lots of people, so the more we all rally around that, I think the world will be a more accessible place for everyone,” Kennedy said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T12:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T02:12:13.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
