This where we can see Huawei Honor 7i and Lenovo Zuk Z1 take the center stage to satisfy the ever-hungry crowd. - Advertisement - \nBoth of them take a different approach and probably target more than selfie-lovers. Surely you want an all-rounder smartphone that can cater to your other needs, especially for browsing, multi-tasking and to be able to last you for more than a day on battery. \nFor Honor 7i, they follow the same route that Oppo introduces by having a 13MP rotating camera. This way, you will be able to take excellent pictures that are normally reserved for the primary camera. The secondary camera usually gets the short end of the stick, but not with this smartphone. \nAs for the Zuk Z1, with a 13MP-8MP setup; you can expect great looking pictures from both the primary as well as the secondary camera. \nNow, that we’ve cleared the air on what each of their respective camera setup, let’s take a closer look at both of them. Starting with the Honor 7i, it has a slightly thinner body and lighter as well. It comes with a body measurement of 141.6 x 71.2 x 7.8 mm (5.57 x 2.80 x 0.31 in) and weighs just 160 g (5.64 oz), which is awesome indeed. Then there’s the fingerprint sensor that makes it even better as you can use it to unlock the device and for more serious stuff like authorizing payment as part of the biometric system. \nMeanwhile on the Zuk Z1, it has a body of 155.7 x 77.3 x 8.9 mm (6.13 x 3.04 x 0.35 in) and weighing in at 175 g (6.17 oz). There’s also the fingerprint sensor available as well which is normally found on the flagship and high-end models. \nBy having a thinner and lighter body, the Honor 7i takes the nod here. Both of them are equipped with a fingerprint sensor that is interesting indeed. \nScreen-wise, the Honor 7i is sporting a 5.2-inch Full HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~424 ppi pixel density. Compare that to the Zuk Z1, which has a bigger screen at 5.5-inch Full HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~401 ppi pixel density. \nThere’s no denying the fact that you can do more with a larger screen, and that’s where the Zuk Z1 nudges ahead here. But of course, not everyone will agree that larger equals better; so the choice is yours. \nNow let’s check out what’s under the hood for both of them. Inside the Honor 7i, is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising Quad-core 1.7 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53 and Adreno 405 graphics. There are two variants available, with 2GB memory tied with 16GB storage and 3GB memory with 32GB storage. \nMeanwhile on the Zuk Z1, there’s the Qualcomm MSM8974AC Snapdragon 801 chipset, Quad-core 2.5 GHz Krait 400 processor, Adreno 330 graphics, and 3GB RAM. Somehow it feels like a mismatch without having an octa-core processor powering it up. The rest of it is great. \nBetter chipset and better graphics make the Honor 7i the winner here, but you won’t feel that much of a difference when running your favorite apps and games. Both of them have more than enough firepower to chew everything that gets thrown its way. - Advertisement - \nNow we’ve come to the best part about the Honor 7i, which is the rotating camera. Featuring a 13 Megapixel camera with 4208 x 3120 pixels, autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama, you can rotate its lens at many angles until it is facing you and becomes just like a secondary camera. Produced by Sony, the camera has an f/2.0 aperture and a 28mm wide-angle lens, and is also covered in sapphire crystal which makes it scratch-resistant. If you still remember that it has the fingerprint sensor, it is conveniently placed at the side instead of the back of the device as usual; and this could also double up to snap a photo. \nThe Zuk Z1 falls slightly behind on the camera department here with its 13MP-8MP setup. The 13 Megapixel primary camera comes with 4160 x 3120 pixels, autofocus, optical image stabilization, dual-LED flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, and panorama. \nNow let’s take a look at the storage for both devices. As mentioned earlier, there are 2 variants available on the Honor 7i, with 16GB and 32GB as your choice. If that’s not enough, then you can further expand it via the microSD slot which can take in a maximum of 128GB. But in case you do so, you will then have to sacrifice the 2 nd sim slot. \nMeanwhile on the Zuk Z1, there would be more than enough with its built-in 64GB of internal storage. But herein lays the drawback as you can’t further expand it since it does not have a microSD slot. \nAnd depends on which way you look at it, if you prefer to play safe; then you should go with the Honor 7i. But if you do so and utilizes the expansion slot; you will lose out on the 2 nd sim slot. \nIn terms of battery, the Honor 7i is powered by a non-removable Li-Po 3100 mAh battery that should have no issues supplying enough juice to it for at least a day or two in between charging. \nBut it loses out to the Zuk Z1 huge non-removable Li-Po 4100 mAh. There should be no problem powering it up for 2-3 days depending on your usage. \nOn the software side of things, the latest Android Lollipop 5.1 accompanies the Honor 7i together with Emotion UI 3.1. \nThe Zuk Z1 will also be powered by Android Lollipop 5.1 but with Cyanogen Mod 12.1 at the helm. There will be no excess baggage which means no unnecessary pre-installed apps and games. It should be as light as possible and no intrusive background process as well. You are in control of basically everything and is not for everyone, though. You might even have to micro-manage a lot of things. \nFinally, you should know that both the Honor 7i and Zuk Z1 do have dual sim capability and 4G LTE functionality as well. This would add more value to both devices. - Advertisement - \nPutting them side-by-side, the Honor 7i might win on the looks and camera department but when it comes to the serious stuff; the Zuk Z1 wins hands downs. \nHuawei Honor 7i is currently available in China for approximately $299 for the 16GB model. It is available in black, white and gold. \nThe Lenovo Zuk Z1 is expected to be released first in China sometime in October 2015 and is currently available for pre-orders at $279 USD. For the record, there have been more than 2 million pre-orders that is a sign of good things to come for it. It would be available in White and Dark Gray.
