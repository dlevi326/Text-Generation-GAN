But analysts say it can work because Star Wars is such a popular franchise.\nLeaked images of action figures of characters that have not even hit the big screen are only fueling demand, says Steve Pasierb , CEO of the Toy Industry Association .\n“It’s pretty rare, but in the age of social media, you can get those characters out and create buzz around these things in ways that you couldn’t in the past,” Pasierb said. “There’s something easy to tap into, which is the Star Wars mystique, which is some 30 years old.”\nIndustry analysts at PiperJaffrey say they expect $3 billion worth of Star Wars merchandise will be sold this year and that sales next year could be even larger.\nEven in a non-movie year, Star Wars merchandise has consistently sold well — $2 billion annually around the world, according to Pasierb. So it’s not so far-fetched that Disney will exceed that in the publicity-blitz filled weeks ahead of premiere of the first Star Wars movie since 2005.\nToy makers both big and small geared up for a big rush on Friday. They expect another wave as holiday shopping begins and the movie’s Dec. 18 release date draws closer.\nHasbro Inc. , which has been making Star Wars toys for more than 30 years, planned to unveil more than 100 items Friday.\nThe toy maker’s offerings include Furbacca, a Chewbacca version of its Furby toy, and several versions of lightsabers.\nSphero, one of the first members of Disney’s Techstars program for startups, created a $150 mini version of the BB-8 droid featured in the new movie.\nBB-8 is kind of like an updated version of R2-D2. It’s a giant rolling sphere, with a traditional droid head that somehow manages to stay on top. The mini version created by Sphero moves much the same way.\nOfficially unveiled Thursday, the BB-8 had generated significant buzz by Friday morning. Other toys include Legendary Yoda, a 16-inch version of the Jedi Master that boasts lifelike movements and voice recognition. It’s yours for $180.\nRetailers also did their best to cash in on the “Force Friday” frenzy. Target, Walmart and Toys R Us all had many of their stores open and held special events when the toys went on sale at 12:01 a.m. Friday. Star Wars toys were also prominently displayed on their retail websites.", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-04T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T11:28:13.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
