To switch back to the conventional still image, just tap the icon again and you’re gold. \nThe front-facing FaceTime camera maintains its megapixel count at 5MP, but what’s interesting is that you can now take selfies in the dark. The iPhone 6 utilises the display as a flash and in true Apple fashion, gives it a new name - Retina Flash. iPhone 6s: 3D Touch \nWhat’s known as Force Touch on the Macbooks and Apple Watch is now called 3D Touch on the iPhone 6S. \nAnd this is the epitome of a slight change creating a very different user experience. Just like we’ve been conditioned to swipe and pinch out, we’re on the cusp of being mentally reconfigured to apply pressure to every display from here on out with the new generation of iPhones. Elissa Loi 3D Touch is a big part of the iPhone 6s - it can detect different levels of pressure \nCatchily called Peek and Pop (now these new terms we can handle for our near capacity Apple section of the brain), these two actions are the result of 3D Touch. \nEssentially, you Peek before you Pop when you apply pressure on content within native apps like Email and Messages. If someone sends you a URL in a text, press on it to Peek into a preview, a little window opening within Messages itself. \nAnd if you like what you see, just press a little harder to Pop yourself right into Safari. \nAside from allowing you to preview content before you decide to take further action, 3D Touch gives you shortcuts within your iPhone 6s. \nJust think of it as the right click on your mouse. If you press a little harder on 3D Touch-enabled apps, a list of three to four Quick Actions will pop right up. 3D Touching your Music app will let you play Beats 1 or play a recently played song while doing that on a third party app like Instagram will bring up the option to quickly post a photo. \nIt might take you some time to wrap your brain around 3D Touch. Elissa Loi Video and games look great on the iPhone 6s screen \nFor example, we found ourselves just tapping and holding on an app, triggering massive app seizure also known as the option to move them around and we had to hit the Home button to start over. \nBut as with all things Apple, your knowledge of multi-touch will grow to accommodate 3D Touch soon enough and you won't be able to stop 3D Touching everything. \nYou can also choose to deactivate 3D Touch or adjust its sensitivity if you so desire. iPhone 6s: Conclusion Reuters Phil Schiller, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing at Apple Inc, speaks about the 4K video capability for the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus \nEverything checks out well on paper. And what's probably the best loved feature on the iPhone - the camera - gets interesting upgrades. \nIf you're packing an iPhone 6, changing up for a 6s might not make sense. But if you have an iPhone 5s or earlier, the iPhone 6s is worth checking out, especially since 3D Touch will probably get more and more use case scenarios. \nElissa Loi writes for Stuff.tv , where you can find all the latest gadget news, reviews and features.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:00:07.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
