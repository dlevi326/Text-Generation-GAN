In Axel Springer's earlier investment, Business Insider was valued at about $200 million, said the Recode report, written by its media reporter, Peter Kafka. Kafka says he is a shareholder of Business Insider.\nIn 2013, Business Insider generated about $20 million in revenue. But it had grown 70% last year, the Recode report noted.\nTo maintain their influence on growing, buzz-generating digital content sites, large publishers and media giants have been investing in the emerging sector in recent months. In August, Comcast's NBCUniversal invested $200 million into BuzzFeed, valuing the news-and-entertainment site at about $1.5 billion. A week earlier, it also invested $200 million into Vox Media, which owns Recode, sports blog network SB Nation and Vox.com.\nIn March, Walt Disney Co. paid $500 million to buy YouTube network Maker Studios, with a condition to pay more if some growth targets are met.\nAxel Springer, which owns German national newspapers Die Welt and Bild, has been in an acquisitive mood . Britain's Pearson had been in talks to sell the Financial Times to Axel Springer before selling the paper to Japanese media group Nikkei for $1.3 billion.\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1FcY7YF TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/261632ae8231b8ebd9329c0d0899651c9bef8e85/c=247-0-4009-2826&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/11/24//1385337869000-XXX-Henry-Blodget-Executive-Edition-rd223-.jpg", "http://recode.net/2015/09/21/axel-springer-wants-to-buy-business-insider-for-around-560-million/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/521cd80a4fb9f1f1edf37d025629b379daee5bba/r=500x332/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/11/24/1385337869000-XXX-Henry-Blodget-Executive-Edition-rd223-.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1FcY7YF", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FcY7YF&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/USATODAY/test/2013/11/24//1385337869000-XXX-Henry-Blodget-Executive-Edition-rd223-.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FcY7YF&text=Report%3A%20Axel%20Springer%20in%20talks%20to%20buy%20Business%20Insider%20for%20%24560M&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-09-22T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:57:21.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
