These technologies are majorly used for examining the back of the eye in patients who have cloudy ocular conditions such as corneal clouding, vitreous hemorrhage and cataract. Currently, the market for ophthalmic ultrasound systems is considerably promising and profitable due to the increase usage of ophthalmic ultrasound systems along with escalating incidence rates of ocular diseases the market is expected to grow substantially.Browse the full Ophthalmic Ultrasound Systems Market report at http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/ophthalmic-ultrasound-systems-market.htmlThe major technologies and types of ophthalmic ultrasound systems are as follows: A-Scan systems Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM) PachymetersBased on the type of modalities the market for ophthalmic ultrasound systems can be segmented as follows: Portable Hand held On platform systemsIn terms of regional distribution, North America followed by Europe account for the largest market share of ophthalmic ultrasound systems market due to the high usage and adoption rate of ultrasound imaging technologies in diagnostic centers and hospitals. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 20.5 million people in the U.S. of age 40 years and over are suffering from cataract in one or both eyes and around 6.1 million people have had their lens removed surgically. Moreover, the organization predicts that the number of people suffering from cataract would increase to nearly 30.1 million by 2020.In addition, other regions such as Asia Pacific, Latin America as well as Middle East, are expected to be the potential markets in the near future. Due to the high adoption rate of advanced ultrasound imaging systems and exponentially growing healthcare industry, these regions are expected to be the potential market in the near future.Get the free sample report at http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=b&rep_id=6583Globally, the overall ophthalmic ultrasound systems market is witnessing a substantial pressure and rapid development. Moreover, high demands for advanced radiation free ophthalmic imaging technologies; and rising incidence of ophthalmologic disorders are contributing to the growth of the overall ophthalmic ultrasound systems market. In addition, increasing incidence of eye disorders such as cataract, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are expected to amplify the demand for ophthalmic ultrasound systems across the globe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2010, cataract was responsible for 51% of world blindness. Moreover, advantage of these ophthalmic ultrasound systems such as capability to provide in-depth real-time images of components of eyes is driving the growth of the overall ophthalmic ultrasound systems market. Furthermore, huge application scope of the advance ophthalmic ultrasound systems, operator and patient safety as well as patient comfort are also some factors that are driving the growth of this market. However, market-restraining factors such as high installation and development cost coupled with stringent regulatory policies might impede the growth of the ophthalmic ultrasound systems market. At present, the global ophthalmic ultrasound systems market is highly fragmented and competitive owing to the presence of many established as well as emerging players in the ophthalmic ultrasound systems market. The market is expected to witness a significantly high growth rate due to the increasing usage of ophthalmic imaging technologies and diagnostic testing services in the field of ophthalmology and healthcare industry. Major companies operating in the field of ophthalmic ultrasound systems market are Ellex Medical Lasers Ltd., Optikon 2000 S.p.A., Optos plc, Quantel Medical, Reichert, Inc., Sonomed Escalon and others.Read more interesting reports of Technology amd Media Markets at http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/technology-market-reports-8.html About the Author Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company, providing global business information reports and services.
