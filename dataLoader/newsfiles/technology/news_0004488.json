The board will encompass top security industry talent across the globe with particular areas of expertise in cyber-physical systems. The ASRB researchers will perform ongoing security tests and audits intended to codify best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products to benefit the automobile industry and drivers. Intel also published the first version of its automotive cybersecurity best practices white paper, which the company will continue to update based on ASRB findings. \nGartner predicts that “by 2020, the number of connected passenger vehicles on the road in use will be about 150 million; 60% to 75% of them will be capable of consuming, creating and sharing Web-based data.” 1 The transition to a more connected world is exciting and requires that cybersecurity be addressed. \n“We can, and must, raise the bar against cyberattacks in automobiles,” said Chris Young, senior vice president and general manager of Intel Security. “With the help of the ASRB, Intel can establish security best practices and encourage that cybersecurity is an essential ingredient in the design of every connected car. Few things are more personal than our safety while on the road, making the ASRB the right idea at the right time.” \nIntel will provide the ASRB with its automotive advanced development platforms on which to conduct research. Findings will then be published publicly as part of an ongoing process. To motivate the ASRB researchers, Intel will award a new car 2 to the member who provides the most significant and impactful cybersecurity contribution that can be implemented on Intel’s automotive platform. All details related to the Intel development platform and areas of security audit focus will be provided at the inaugural ASRB meet-up next month. Interested security professionals wishing to request participation can find out more information at www.intel.com/automotive/asrb . \nThe new Intel white paper “Automotive Security Best Practices: Recommendations for Security and Privacy in the Era of the Next-Generation Car,” analyzes risks associated with the next generation of connected automobiles and provides specific security recommendations for the automotive industry. Intel is inviting industry experts to comment on the white paper and will publish revisions based upon feedback and ASRB findings.
