The vendor portal allows vendors to directly submit bills to their customers and access information on payment status. Anybill users can invite their vendors to sign up directly through Anybill, giving vendors more efficient bill submission and visibility into the status of their submitted bills. Anybill clients already use the solution to review bills, route them through their approval process, and process payment. Now, their vendors can directly submit bills, check on the status of submitted bills, and view bill history in the vendor portal.\nPreviously, vendor’s bill submission options were limited to mail and email. Now, vendors will be able to directly submit their bills through the vendor portal. Uploaded bills are immediately routed for approval according to the organization’s workflow.\nOnce the bill is submitted, vendors will be able to check on the bill’s status – from approval routing to payment – and access all bill history with the customer.\n“The vendor portal is going to be very beneficial for Anybill users who want to give their vendors greater visibility into their process and the ability to directly upload bills,” said Sander Mueller, Chief Strategy Officer at Anybill. “The goal here is to empower vendors to check on the status of their bills and to reduce inquiries, which can be time-consuming and frustrating for everyone. It can also increase the efficiency of the payment process as there are less steps – just submit the bill right to the customer online and it’s automatically routed to their approvers.”\nAnybill users can invite their vendors to join the vendor portal directly from their Anybill system.\nFor more information on Anybill and its solutions, visit http://www.anybill.com/\nAbout Anybill, Inc.\nFounded in 2001, Anybill provides end-to-end accounts payable automation and tax payment services for small to medium enterprises (SME), as well as some of the world's largest corporations and organizations, encompassing a variety of industries.
