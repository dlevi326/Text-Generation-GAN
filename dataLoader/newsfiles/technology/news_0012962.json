Picture: REUTERS Related articles Zuma urges youth to make own jobs Small businesses ‘stifled by procurement corruption’, says minister SMEs access to finance improves, survey finds YOUTH in sub-Saharan Africa are among the most entrepreneurial in the world, but a lack of infrastructure and appropriate policy support stops them from making a meaningful and sustained contribution to the economy.\nWith 200-million people between the ages of 15 and 24, Africa is the youngest continent on the globe. It also has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in the world — a potentially lethal combination.\nMuch has been said and written about the \"youth bulge\", but what should not be underestimated is the ability of these millions of young Africans to empower themselves and their communities economically.\nNew research from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) shows that many of them — in some countries more than half — are taking matters into their own hands and starting their own ventures.\nThe GEM African Youth Report researched the attitudes and situations of young entrepreneurs aged 18 to 34 in nine sub-Saharan African countries over three years. It shows that many young people are able to empower themselves by creating their own jobs.\nBy studying the behaviours, attitudes and circumstances of 20,000 young entrepreneurs in Angola, Zambia, Ghana, Malawi, Namibia, SA, Uganda, Nigeria and Botswana, GEM has ascertained that there is certainly will, ambition and no fear of hard work. What is missing, however, is government support and infrastructure to foster and grow these businesses.\nSA has the highest unemployment rate and the lowest level of entrepreneurship. Just 13% of youth are engaged in their own business, whereas in Uganda, Zambia and Nigeria more than half are doing so.\nSA is also the only country where youth are using the internet for business. This is a key point as the internet can greatly expand market reach, but just 16% of the region’s youth entrepreneurs make use of it.\nHardly surprising then that the survey found that two-thirds of youth businesses had no customers living outside the business owner’s home country.\nAround 46% of high-growth businesses had no clients outside their borders, while just 27% of high-and 23% of medium-growth businesses had 25% or more export-generated sales.\n...\nANOTHER concern is the slow uptake in new technology. Most businesses are using five-to 10-year-old technology, or none at all.\nWomen, especially, are found in low-end, no-technology entrepreneurship with little to no growth potential.\nA glimmer of hope is SA, where young women make up the largest percentage of the youth entrepreneur sector using the internet as their market place.\nIn the main, however, GEM research indicates that young women are most likely to operate from home and are often hampered by limited reach, trading largely to family and community members.\nLack of technology, coupled with lack of education and/or appropriate business skills, limits these entrepreneurs to survival mode, never entering a growth phase.\nGEM research has consistently found a strong correlation between the level of education of an entrepreneur and the growth potential of his or her business. It indicates that 65% of low-growth business operators have a primary school education, while 80% of the leadership in high-growth businesses have secondary and tertiary education.\nThe bad news is that 25% of youth in sub-Saharan Africa have less than primary school education and 55% have not completed secondary school, which puts them at a disadvantage from the start.\nAnother significant limiting factor is capital. African youth entrepreneurs start on the back foot, with no credit history or assets to satisfy bank regulations, and the vast majority use their own funds or get help from family.\nGEM data reveals young men generally have greater access to banks and financial institutions than do women, but even then, the percentage is not high.\nThe best performing country in this regard was Angola, where 35.6% of young men reported that they used official financing. Malawi reported the lowest use with just 1% of men using banks or other institutions to finance their venture.\nWhat all of these facts and figures add up to is that, while there is no lack of entrepreneurial initiative among African youth, most of these businesses can financially support only the owner and never go on to generate much-needed jobs for others.\nAnd without significant innovation and job creation, their efforts will never make a sufficient impact on the wider economy.\n...\nCOMPARED with youth in other regions of the world, youth in sub-Saharan Africa lead the pack: 52% express an intention to start a business and 28% are running their own businesses.\nIn the European Culture Countries, the lowest-performing region, only 19% of youth express entrepreneurial intentions and only 8% are actually engaged in entrepreneurial activity.\nYet the majority of youth entrepreneurs create employment for the business owner. Uganda has the highest regional rate of entrepreneurial activity, with 56% of the youth involved in starting or running their own business, but 63.8% of these businesses do not create more than one job (for the owner) and just 34% create between one to five jobs.\nThis is partly because many businesses are selling undifferentiated products and services in over-traded markets, making it difficult to generate a profit or lead to viable business creativity over the longer term.\nIn the GEM study, 68% of entrepreneurs polled said their product or service was not new to some or all of their customers and some 64% of youth businesses are concentrated in the hospitality and retail sectors.\nThere is an urgent need for more support for young entrepreneurs from governments, as well as the corporate and education sectors, to ensure sector and business growth for young entrepreneurs, particularly of high-growth businesses, which create a disproportionate number of jobs within an economy.\nA startling finding of this new research is that while many government initiatives exist, most entrepreneurs are unaware of them.\nGovernments must work harder to get knowledge of these programmes out into the public sphere and target existing and potential young entrepreneurs.\n...\nANGOLA stands out for having a third of both male and female youth entrepreneurs using government-funded business support. This may contribute to Angola having the highest rate of job creation, despite average levels of youth entrepreneurship (26%).\nThe study found that 78% of youth businesses there have created between one and five jobs and youth are 3.9 times more likely to have businesses offering 20 or more jobs.\nEarlier GEM reports also show non-financial support as a strong driver of business performance and capability for young entrepreneurs.\nProgrammes encouraging mentorship, training and networking opportunities need to be fostered and grown across the continent.\nMore targeted entrepreneurship training at school and post-school level is also required to boost both entrepreneurial intention and capabilities. An encouraging sign is that new research from the Association of African Business Schools shows a definite trend towards more post-school training across the continent designed to support entrepreneurs.\nBut despite these positive signs, the research paints a gloomy picture for youth entrepreneurs in the region. Inattention and inaction put entrepreneurs at the starting line but never at the finish.\nWith the right support, Africa’s youth bulge could be converted into its greatest asset.\nWithout support, it is a ticking time bomb that threatens to destabilise the entire region.\n• Herrington is executive director of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:24:08.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
