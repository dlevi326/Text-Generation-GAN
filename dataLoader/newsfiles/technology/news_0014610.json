Lockr enables Drupal websites to effortlessly protect API keys (Mailchimp, FedEx, Amazon S3, etc.) and encryption keys offsite, allowing the website to meet security best practices.\nLaunching exclusively on Pantheon, the leading Website Management Platform, Lockr is available at no cost for developers, and once a site releases into production, pricing starts at just $30 per month. With plans ranging from Personal to Enterprise, Lockr can easily scale based on a website’s size and needs. For businesses who need to meet specific compliance requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA, FISMA, etc.), Lockr can provide a dedicated FIPS 140-2 compliant key manager.\n“We are proud to launch Lockr exclusively to Pantheon’s customers,” said Chris Teitzel, Founder & CEO, Cellar Door Media. “Now their customers can effortlessly deploy an enterprise level key management service at an extremely affordable cost.”\nTo take security one level higher, Lockr does not allow keys to be copied and used by developers outside the hosting platform. This can be especially important to development teams distributed across the globe. Additionally, Lockr allows site owners to store 2 versions of the same key, one for development and one for production, to prevent accidental API connections and data decryption in non-production environments.\n“Pantheon holds platform security as a top priority,” said David Strauss, CTO & Co-Founder, Pantheon. “With Lockr available exclusively to our customers, sites can now manage keys according to industry best practices and have an extra layer of security throughout the entire development lifecycle.”\nLockr is the first managed key service for Drupal.\nAbout Cellar Door Media\nCellar Door Media is a development and consulting company focused on creating solutions for clients leveraging their expertise in mobile and web development to not only solve issues as they arise, but to be a long term strategic partner.
