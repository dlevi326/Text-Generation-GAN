The Astrosat has the ability to observe celestial bodies like distant stars and cosmic X-Ray sources in different wavelengths simultaneously.\nThe scientists of the Indian Space Research Organization ISRO are giving the launch vehicle PSLV-C30 final touches for its 31st flight tomorrow.\nAlong with Astrosat, four identical nano-satellites of Spire Global Inc., the US, a micro-satellite from Indonesia and a nano-satellite of the University of Toronto, Canada are also set to take off.\nWithin 22 minutes 33 seconds of ignition of the PSLV, it would lob Astrosat in its 650 km orbit, followed by the smaller payloads. The science research mission Astrosat with five years of intended operational life would serve as a space observatory.\n 28, 2015 8:30 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:43:55.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
