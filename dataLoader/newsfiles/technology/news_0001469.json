NASA picks Pluto spacecraft New Horizons' latest destination \nNASA also released a new, sharper image of Pluto's largest moon Charon that shows a web of fractured plains over large areas of its surface. NASA also released a new, sharper image of Pluto's largest moon Charon that shows a web of fractured plains over large areas of its surface. ( NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute) \nBetter images of Pluto's moons Charon, Nix and Hydra will be released Friday. \nOn July 14, New Horizons became the first spacecraft to make a close flyby of Pluto and its moons. At that time, it sent back a small number of stunning images that have already changed scientists views of the dwarf planet . \nThe spacecraft then took a break from sending images to concentrate on providing data from its particle, solar wind and space dust instruments. Pluto's plains and mountains revealed in latest images \nAmong the mysteries in the latest closeups are large areas with irregular, broken mountains similar to those seen on Jupiter's icy moon Europa . \n\"The randomly jumbled mountains might be huge blocks of hard water ice floating within a vast, denser, softer deposit of frozen nitrogen within the region informally named Sputnik Planum,\" suggested Jeff Moore, who leads the New Horizons Geology, Geophysics and Imaging team, in a statement. \nCloseups near Pluto's equator show dark craters that appear to represent some of the dwarf planet's most ancient terrain. Dunes would be 'completely wild' \nNearby are smooth, white plains, along with fine, dark, parallel stripes that look like they could be wind-blown dunes. \n\"Seeing dunes on Pluto — if that is what they are — would be completely wild, because Pluto's atmosphere today is so thin,\" said William B. McKinnon, deputy lead of the New Horizons Geology, Geophysics and Imaging team. \"Either Pluto had a thicker atmosphere in the past, or some process we haven't figured out is at work. It's a head-scratcher.\" A 350-kilometre-wide view of Pluto includes dark, ancient heavily cratered terrain; bright, smooth geologically young terrain; assembled masses of mountains; and an enigmatic field of dark, aligned ridges that resemble dunes. The smallest visible features are 800 metres in size. (NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute) \nWhile the atmosphere may be thin, Pluto's atmospheric haze appears to have more layers than scientists expected, NASA says. \nThe haze also creates a \"bonus\" twilight that illuminates details of some of the terrain on Pluto's night side that would otherwise be completely shrouded in darkness, said John Spencer, another deputy lead of the Geology, Geophysics and Imaging team. Pluto’satmospheric haze produces a twilight that allows the sensitive cameras on New Horizons to see details in nighttime regions that would otherwise be invisible. The right-hand version of the image has been brightened to bring out faint details beyond Pluto’s terminator - the line separating day and night.
