The stamp of approval designates that the software offers the functionality that enables eligible providers and hospitals to meet Stage 1 and Stage 2 Meaningful Use requirements, qualifying these organizations to receive payments under the ongoing EHR (electronic health record) adoption program. \n\"This certification from Drummond is a testament to the robust capabilities of DataMotion Direct,\" said Bob Bales , chief executive officer at DataMotion. \"With it, DataMotion is one of the few HISPs to be both accredited and certified by the ONC. Furthermore, organizations replacing their HISP would not have to re-certify their EHR if they select DataMotion Direct, which makes it a natural choice for secure communications in healthcare, future-proofing operations and maintaining compliance.\" \nDataMotion is a leading email encryption and health information service provider (HISP). The company's success in healthcare comes from the flexibility of its interoperable, cloud-based secure data exchange platform. Agnostic in nature, the DataMotion platform is able to integrate its secure delivery solutions with a wide range of clinical connections and workflows. This includes DataMotion Direct 6.1 which allows healthcare providers, patients and health systems to send and receive protected health information (PHI) using the Direct Secure Messaging protocol that meets Meaningful Use requirements, and complies with HIPAA and enhances health information exchange. \nTo earn the certification, DataMotion Direct was tested to be in accordance with applicable standards and certification criteria put forth by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). \nWith more than a dozen years of testing experience across various industries, Drummond Group brings a high level of technical expertise to this process. Its healthcare experience also runs deep, having certified hundreds of EHRs since becoming an ACB in 2010. In addition, Drummond Group acts as a certification authority in the Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances (EPCS) and Controlled Substance Ordering Systems (CSOS) initiatives. \nDrummond roup also offers a variety of programs that can make the testing process more palatable. For example, Drummond Group offers a Framework Document that helps software developers focus on specific 2014 edition criteria, clinical quality measures and testing options; an optional Wave Testing Approach that enables vendors to incrementally test for various certification criteria in phases, instead of all at once; and a Pre-Test Assessment Tool to gauge testing readiness. \nDataMotion Direct 6.1, which met the requirements for ONC-HIT EHR Compliance, is a cloud-based Direct Secure Messaging service which allows healthcare providers to send and receive Protected Health Information (PHI) with other Direct address holders to meet MU2 requirements, comply with HIPAA, and enhance health information exchange. \n\"The government's program is maturing and, therefore, becoming more demanding, as it is positioning itself to enable healthcare providers to truly transform how care is delivered. As a result, software developers are being challenged to develop systems with advanced patient engagement, data transfer and interoperability functionality,\" said Rik Drummond , CEO, Drummond Group Inc. \"Our experience testing complex software in a variety of industries makes it possible for us to bring the sophisticated testing and certification services that the healthcare industry now needs to reach these ambitious goals.\" \nCertification DetailsThis EHR Module is 2014 Edition compliant and has been certified by an ONCACB in accordance with the applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
