German candy maker Katjes is testing out a 3D printer for gummy candies called \"The Magic Candy Factory.\" It's a nifty device, but the coolest part is that the gummy candies are custom-designed by each patron through an iPad app. Katjes hopes to bring this device to family locations around the globe, so keep your fingers crossed that someday you'll be able to craft your very own custom gummy (that you'll then pop into your mouth and never see again).\nVideo games currently in production might experience some fairly serious repercussions if a looming union strike is approved. Voice actors in gaming want a cut of highly profitable games, and they're currently voting with the rest of their union (SAG-AFTRA) to decide whether or not to take the issue to a strike.

NASA-JPL is currently working on an interesting little rover called \"Hedgehog,\" which is controlled by flywheels that start and stop in precise ways to move the little cube around, even over rough terrain. Our favorite move? The \"tornado spin\" the rover can do to hop out of a small hole or pit.\nThis content is rated TV-MA, and is for viewers 18 years or older. Are you of age?
