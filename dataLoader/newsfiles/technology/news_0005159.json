Materials stocks are up 9.6 percent, and information technology shares and consumer discretionary stocks are up 5.8 percent.\nDefensive sectors, by contrast, which hold their own even amid economic weakness, have risen by much less. Consumer staples have gained 1.6 percent since the trough and lost 2.2 percent this month. While healthcare stocks are up 4.1 percent since the trough, they are down 1.9 percent this month.\nThe outperformance of cyclical stocks is unusual given that Asia's sluggish growth, earnings downgrades and weak consumer demand would typically prompt investors to dump them in favour of defensive shares.\nThat was indeed exactly what they did until late August. Materials stocks plunged 30 percent from an April peak to an August trough, and consumer discretionary shares fell 21 percent, while healthcare companies sank 13.6 percent and consumer staples dropped 8 percent.\nHowever, that aggressive selling has made cyclical stocks so cheap they now appear to be good value, said Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors in Hong Kong.\n\"Cyclicals have been beaten up and the market is pricing them like they're never going to turn,\" Crabb said. \"That's why they're now turning.\"\nInformation technology and healthcare stocks are trading at around three times book value, while cyclicals are at half or less, Thomson Reuters DataStream data shows.\nThe gap, while narrowing, remains near levels seen during the 2008 global financial crisis, according to Credit Suisse.\nThis is despite cyclicals offering returns on equity at or above what defensive stocks offer, DataStream shows. ( bit.ly/1iswG2n ).\nThat's a shift from the usual pattern of equities bottoming 1 to 1-1/2 years before an improvement in fundamentals.\nIn 2008, returns from cyclical stocks were 8.4 percent less than defensives, Credit Suisse data show.\nCrabb, who is shifting cash directly into cyclical sectors - skipping the typical move into defensives first - sees selective opportunities in large low-cost mining companies, Korean automakers and some Chinese financials.\nManishi Raychaudhuri, Asia-Pacific equity strategist at BNP Paribas, said that an across-the-board recovery was unlikely, however.\nFor instance, while software and service providers, particularly in India, appear robust, hardware and component manufacturers are facing increased competition and falling demand. BNP has reduced exposure to the latter, he said.\nAberdeen Asset Management is also selectively buying cyclical stocks.\n\"In a contrarian sense, it's a good time to be thinking about these things,\" said Managing Director Hugh Young in Singapore.\nCompanies such as Australian miner Rio Tinto \"still make a decent amount of money, even with their key commodity having collapsed,\" he said.\nNot everyone is seduced by the valuations, however.\nCyclical stocks, such as materials, shipbuilding, mining and metals, \"have been plagued by excess investment/capacity,\" Peter Sartori, head of Asian equities at Nikko Asset Management in Singapore, said.\n\"We are not surprised to see these sectors catch a bid,\" he said, but added \"we don't feel compelled to invest in these sectors currently.\"\n(Reporting by Nichola Saminather and Abhishek Vishnoi; Editing by Nachum Kaplan and Jacqueline Wong)", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1iswG2n"], "published": "2015-09-22T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T10:10:23.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
