GoGuardian for Teachers™ is a Chromebook-based application that allows teachers to maximize the benefits of digital learning in their classrooms. Chromebooks are the #1 selling device for use in K-12 education. \nAs schools across the nation move toward 1:1 programs—named for their mission to give each student his or her own device for classwork and homework—parents and educators are looking for tangible improvements in learning outcomes. Educators and legislators have invested attention and resources into 1:1 programs, citing their potential to close the achievement gap and improve education outcomes for all students. The execution of 1:1 programs determines whether they will have the intended impact, which makes the incorporation of devices into classrooms paramount to the success of these 1:1 programs. \nGoGuardian for Teachers allows teachers to better understand and control the way Chromebooks are used in their classrooms. From a user-friendly portal, teachers are able keep students focused on lessons and resources, direct students to new tabs, and close off-topic tabs on one or multiple devices with the click of a mouse. GoGuardian for Teachers aids classroom focus and communication between teachers and students, increasing the value of other in-class software without interfering with their use. \nFeatures include: Screen Viewer — live stream of students’ screens in a single window Activity Timeline — real-time and historic insight into when, where, and how students are using devices Tab Control — instantly send one or more students to a specific website in a new tab Attention Mode — close tabs, darken screens, or lock devices for “eyes up front” focus \n“We want to help students access as much of the Internet as they need to learn without being exposed to distracting or inappropriate content,” said Aza Steel, Co-founder and CEO. “With GoGuardian for Teachers, teachers can guide how students use devices in their classrooms, which helps them spend more time focused on teaching, and less time chasing distractions.” Prior to today’s launch, GoGuardian implemented a rigorous beta testing and customer feedback program from over 130 school districts managing 100,000 devices. Feedback from launch customers has been overwhelmingly positive. \nTeachers cited “the ability to track student progress” and “turn classwork assignments into realtime learning experiences.” Teachers also said the insights GoGuardian for Teachers provides creates an “interactive, continuous learning and feedback dynamic,” facilitating “better communication and guidance” between educators and students. \n“GoGuardian for Teachers is just what I needed to help teach my students how to use their Chromebooks responsibly in my classroom... It allowed me the ability to offer students individualized feedback as they worked in class,” said Maria Bouletmis, a teacher with Coventry Public Schools in Rhode Island. “I was able to give helpful hints if I noticed student going in the wrong direction on an assignment... I was also able to provide praise for successful completion or effort during a task. As I used this great tool in my classroom, the GoGuardian team offered amazing technical support! I am so happy my district decided to subscribe to GoGuardian, and I am excited to continue to use it in my classroom!” \nDustin Hardin, the IT Administrator for New Caney Independent School District in Texas, said, “GoGuardian for Teachers is the tool we are missing for our 1:1. Having a simple and easy-to-use way to manage the devices empowers every teacher to not be as scared of the technology in the students' hands.” \nAbout GoGuardian \nFounded in California in 2014, GoGuardian is transforming the way schools use technology. GoGuardian’s first product, GoGuardian for Administrators, provides schools with the most advanced student safety and device management tools available.
