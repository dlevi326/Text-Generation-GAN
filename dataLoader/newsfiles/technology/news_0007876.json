When black ... A century of human impact on Arctic climate indicated by new models, historic aerosol data September 12, 2013 \nThe Arctic is the most rapidly warming region of the globe, but warming has not been uniform and the drivers behind this warming not fully understood even during the 20th century. Ice cores store atmospheric bubbles from a million years ago May 12, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—A team of researchers with members from Princeton University, the University of Maine and Oregon State University has found that greenhouse gasses a million years ago, were only slightly higher than they were ... Could changes in Arctic precipitation slow ice sheet loss and temper sea level rise? September 9, 2015 \nIn the Arctic, sea ice is melting and leaving larger sections of ocean exposed to air and sun. This phenomenon could fuel increased evaporation, leading eventually to more precipitation in far-north latitudes. Melting Arctic sea ice accelerates methane emissions September 17, 2015 \nMethane emissions from Arctic tundra increase when sea ice melts, according to a new study from Lund University in Sweden. This connection has been suspected before, but has lacked strong evidence until now. Emissions from melting permafrost could cost $43 trillion September 21, 2015 \nIncreased greenhouse gas emissions from the release of carbon dioxide and methane contained in the Arctic permafrost could result in $43 trillion in additional economic damage by the end of the next century, according to ... Recommended for you Ice sample from Greenland and Russia provide clues to past and future climate change September 28, 2015 \nScientists at the University of Birmingham have discovered evidence of carbonaceous aerosols - organic dust - transported from Asia and deposited in the Arctic over the last 450 years, according to research published today ... Global warming: Are trees going on strike? September 23, 2015 \nTrees, crucial absorbers of climate-harming carbon dioxide gas, may finally be balking at an ever-earlier spring season brought on by global warming, researchers said Wednesday. Researchers reveal when global warming first appeared September 22, 2015 \nThe indications of climate change are all around us today but now researchers have revealed for the first time when and where the first clear signs of global warming appeared in the temperature record and where those signals ... UAF model used to estimate Antarctic ice sheet melting September 24, 2015 \nTo see how burning up the Earth's available fossil fuels might affect the Antarctic ice sheet, scientists turned to a computer program developed at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute. The ice would disappear, ... Tiny plankton can play a major role in CO2 storage in the oceans September 24, 2015 \nTiny zooplankton animals, each no bigger than a grain of rice, may be playing a huge part in regulating climate change, research involving the University of Strathclyde has found. A quarter of fish sold at markets contain man-made debris September 25, 2015 \nRoughly a quarter of the fish sampled from fish markets in California and Indonesia contained man-made debris—plastic or fibrous material—in their guts, according to a study from the University of California, Davis, and ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:20:23.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
