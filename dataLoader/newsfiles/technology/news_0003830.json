People in China often try to download apps and tools from alternate websites and servers -- but sometimes face bitter consequences for doing so. \nTencent, which makes WeChat, said in a blog post that it has fixed the problem, and customers should upgrade to the latest version of the WeChat app in case they had downloaded the version that contained the malware. \nThe company said it does not believe the hackers were able to steal customers' information or money, though it continues to investigate the impact of the attack. \nAmong the other impacted apps were Didi Chuxing, which is the leading taxi-hailing service in China. Popular train-ticket purchasing app Railway 12306 and China Unicom Mobile Office were also infected by malware.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T15:39:20.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
