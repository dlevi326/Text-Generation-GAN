On Wednesday, Apple finally revealed what it’s been working on .\nSo did Apple crack it? Not yet. The new $150 Apple TV suffers from the same Achilles’ Heel as all the other Internet-streaming boxes and services: It doesn’t offer access to all the video that you really want to watch . And it doesn’t free us from the tyranny of the monthly cable subscription.\nBut the new Apple TV lays the groundwork for a big shift in how the average American buys entertainment and uses the TV, through apps. And with new hardware and software, Apple is now positioned perhaps better than any other electronics company to finally crack TV. That is, so long as the new Apple TV app store follows the same more-or-less open path as the iPhone’s.\nI tested the new Apple TV, which goes on sale in October, in a demo living room Apple set up for journalists after today’s announcements. Like prior models, the new device relies entirely on the Internet to get video content—there’s no cable or antenna connection, or any input for devices such as Blu-ray players. The biggest hardware change is a slim, touch-friendly remote control that lets you easily swipe through and click on menus. Right above buttons for play and pause, there’s a dedicated one for Siri, Apple’s voice-activated assistant.\nApple TV overcomes some of the frustrations we have with traditional TVs and cable boxes. Live channels force you to tune into shows according to their schedule (or at least remember to record them). In a Web world where you expect instant access to the good stuff, this old model makes less and less sense. Apple TV, following in the footsteps of Roku and Google’s Chromecast, replaces channels with apps.\nBut Apple TV isn’t just a big screen of apps. Press the Siri button and say “show me some comedy,” and list of comedy movies displays on the screen. (Unlike on the iPhone, Siri doesn’t speak on Apple TV.) Tap on one of the movies, and it pulls up an info screen, and gives you the option to start watching it from Apple’s iTunes store or another service you may already pay for, like Hulu. This works for the names of TV shows, actors and directors, too.\nVoice is key to making it easy to operate a large screen without a separate keyboard, and speaking is much easier than chicken pecking every letter on an on-screen keyboard. Apple isn’t the first to do employ voice— Amazon’s Fire TV , Android TV and certain smart TV’s already do it—but Siri appears more capable. She understands context, so I could refine my earlier search for comedy with, “only the ones with the Muppets.” Siri can also perform other commands, like showing the weather.\nI just wish Siri had gone further. “Siri, what should I watch right now?” isn’t a question she can help with. (She says to visit Apple.com for suggestions. Huh?) She can’t make recommendations based on your tastes, not even based on past iTunes video purchases and rentals. That’s a miss.\nApple smartly included the ability search across apps. The old cable subscription may be annoying, but so far watching TV from the Internet actually makes things more complicated—competing services offer a patchwork of shows, so who can remember which one lets you binge on “Betwitched”? Apple’s universal search promises to finally sort that out for us, like Roku’s boxes and TVs—not to mention TiVo, the granddaddy of set-top boxes—have done for a few years now .\nOf course, with apps, the Apple TV is no longer just about video—this thing can run games, and shopping apps and sports services. I watched it seamlessly play “Guitar Hero” (clearly, I wasn’t playing) and display live baseball updates. I’m not certain I want to shop on a site like Gilt on a big screen, but I like the experimentation. Apple TV is one of the most sophisticated TV computers I’ve seen, and third-party developers who already write apps for Apple devices can finally get in on it. That’s Apple’s real potential advantage over even the established niche players, like Roku and Amazon.\nWhat’s missing from this magical box is content. Oh yeah, that little thing. There were no new stars among the assortment of video services Apple showed on Wednesday: The old Apple TV already has Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Showtime. Where was Amazon? What about one of those upstart live-TV cable-replacement services like Sling TV (not to be confused with the Sling Box)? Gosh, I didn’t even see YouTube on the home screen.\nFor the first time, Apple did make public its developer’s kit for Apple TV, so I have hopes for all of that and more. But if Apple TV remains an exclusive club for content partners that don’t threaten Apple’s own media business, people will start noticing the holes.\nMy Journal colleagues have reported Apple is working on a live TV Internet streaming service of its own that would help us more fully escape the clutches of a cable subscription . But it was mum on such plans today. The Apple TV can only become the future of TV when it’s a gateway to everything, and I mean everything, we want to watch.\nWrite to Geoffrey A.
