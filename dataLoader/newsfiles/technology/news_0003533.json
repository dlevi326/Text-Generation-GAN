Boral, Atlas Iron, Metcash and CSR were among the only big names to do so, with the banks leading the declines after they rose 3.5 per cent yesterday.\n“What the banks giveth, they can taketh away,” IG market analyst Angus Nicholson said.\n“[Yesterday’s] bounce looks like it may have been short-covering related.”\nMr Nicholson said Wall Street’s lead had set the tone, a slight improvement in the unemployment rate mid-session – 6.2 per cent from 6.3 per cent -- had left investors “non-plussed” and the energy sector had fallen as the excitement of Woodside Petroleum’s Oil Search bid faded, albeit not completely.\n“The prospects for further merger and acquisition activity still linger however, as Oil Search reportedly met with ExxonMobil this week – its partner in the PNG LNG Project – with many speculating that a competing offer may be forthcoming,” he said.\n“This did not seem to buoy Oil Search’s share price … [and] recent chatter about asset sales from Santos also failed to support its shares today.”\nElsewhere in economic news on Thursday, CoreLogic RP Data found real housing rents fell 0.4 per cent for August across Australia’s capitals -- for a record low annual rate of 0.7 per cent -- while the Australian dollar took some heart from the labour force figures and headed back towards US70c. Looking forward, tomorrow the Bureau of Statistics will release lending finance figures, which includes housing, personal, business and lease loans.
