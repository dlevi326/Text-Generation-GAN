The storm will not abate until a just distribution of the fruits of the earth enables man everywhere to live in dignity and human decency”. This famous dictum of the late Martin Luther King Jr has become a beacon of hope to the marginalised black population in South Africa. The question therefore arises as to whether transformation should be colour-blind? Indeed transformation cannot not be colour-blind in South Africa because such a point departure presumes a parity between the black and white South Africans, which obviously is not the case.\nThe objective of transformation is the establishment of a society characterised by the equality of the national groups, by a proper racial balance or representativity throughout all its sectors, classes and status orders. Societies that are characterised by racial defined wealth disparities are not likely to be socially and politically stable. It was no surprise when the South African government pushed for the inclusion of affirmative action in the South African Constitution. This process seeks to achieve a more plausible outcome which is to accelerate the deracialisation of the South African economy and fast-track the re-entry of historically marginalised communities into the main stream of the economy. Given our history, and what life in South Africa was like under apartheid, this is a clear commitment to transform our society.\nTransformation cannot be colour-blind until we reach such a point where people have equal status in society. In order to undo the damage of past and continuing inequalities we need to pay attention to the foundations of our society and the ways in which this continues to shape our present. We cannot change a phenomenon if we deny its existence. But we have not reached the point where race is irrelevant or where being colour blind is a virtue. At this moment being very aware of one’s colour is an important element in building the society enshrined in the constitution.\nBuilding non-racialism is one of the values of South Africa’s democratic constitution. But it is not something that will be realised overnight, and what it means to build non-racialism may change under different conditions. It requires recognition and awareness that race remains both a social construction and part of the fundamental structural design of our society. It demands an awareness and sensitivity to the experiences of different sections of the population, particularly those who have suffered and continue to experience racism and resultant inequalities.\nWe need to develop ways to unpack differences, and become more cognisant of what may be required of us to build a society in which all people feel valued, respected, and safe. However, in achieving this society we cannot give a blind eye to the fact that colour blind is a not a viable solution at this very moment in South Africa where people of colour are suffering as a result of the past. But the end is reconciliation, the end is redemption, the end is the creation of the beloved and united community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:05:45.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
