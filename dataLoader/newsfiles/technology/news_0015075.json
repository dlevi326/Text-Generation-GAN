Manufacturers say they are comfortable with the systems and that customer feedback has been positive, if limited. “Driver distraction is a huge concern for us, and we really believe that H.U.D. is a great way to keep people looking in the right direction,” said Gary Robinson, manager of product planning for Honda’s Acura division. He said Honda was planning to add the displays to a broader range of models in the future. Audi, part of the Volkswagen Group, plans to offer the displays in its coming A4 sedan and A5 coupe and the new Q7 S.U.V. Photo BMW's head-up display from a 2013 video.

And you don’t need to refocus back onto the road.” Extensive research into the displays and their effects in the real world is being conducted by the Germany-based Continental AG, which manufacturers tires and automotive electronics. The company, which supplies head-up display components for automakers including BMW, Renault and Mercedes, said it was already developing the next generation of display systems. Those systems, called “augmented reality” displays, add a layer of information, making the displays more dynamic. For example, the display sees a vehicle ahead and places a halo light beneath it, which changes colors as the car comes closer to it. These new systems are expected to arrive in some models in 2017, a Continental spokeswoman said. Suppliers like Continental are well aware of the risk of information overload. Guido Meier-Arendt, principal technical expert for Continental, added, “It’s like the salt in the soup. It’s a must-have, but you have to be careful how much you use.” Even as automakers begin to include the systems, they are not actively marketing head-up displays as a safety feature. But Bart Herring, general manager of product management for Mercedes-Benz USA, said that advances like the augmented reality display could have significant safety merits. “For our lane departure warning system, you now get a vibration in the steering wheel and a message in the instrument cluster,” he said. With the new systems, he said, “that message is actually laid out onto the road as red arrows, giving you guidance to move over.” Some drivers see the head-up display as the answer to a question that no one’s asking. According to a J.D. Power study released in August, 33 percent of more than 4,000 new-car owners recently surveyed said they “never use” the displays in their vehicles. Respondents said they didn’t find the technology useful and that the feature “came as part of a package on my current vehicle and I did not want it.” At Biener Audi, Mr. Cardenas said that potential customers rarely inquired about head-up display availability, “although some are familiar with it.” Is the lack of a display ever a deal-breaker? “Uh, no,” he said, smiling. “If it would be, then those people aren’t buying cars anyway.” Ms. Wahnscaff of Continental, however, is confident that consumers will embrace the idea over time “as more manufacturers bring it to market, in all ranges of vehicles. Drivers will expect they’ll be able to get the information they need, without looking down.” Mr. Undavia, a cardiologist who lives in Manhattan, has been using the system in his commutes between home and work on Long Island. “I’ve been using the display daily, for the speedometer and navigation, and it doesn’t come across as an interference; it’s fairly unobtrusive,” he said. “It’s a nice little perk. But I still look down at the odometer.” Loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:06:59.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
