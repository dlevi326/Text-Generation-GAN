The struggle was apparently over the availability of CAT in their areas. Bantham and Ngobeni each hold the commanding positions in Pietermaritzburg's two clusters.\nNow, provincial commissioner Mmamonnye Ngobeni, who is also Lucas Ngobeni's wife, has said the project should continue to address the high rate of crime in police precincts within the Umgungundlovu district.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T04:03:40.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
