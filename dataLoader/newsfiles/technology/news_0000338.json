Unfortunately, in California, your email, text messages, and other digital information still aren't protected from warrantless searches. \n4 out of 5 of California voters support requiring a warrant for digital surveillance. \n“Californians want police to get a warrant before accessing private emails, text messages, and tracking cell phones. They want to see a change that makes sure their privacy is properly protected.” —Nicole A. Ozer \nIf you agree, add your voice ! When should cops get a warrant?* Before accessing your internet use and what you do online - 82% YES - Latinos (93%) showed the strongest support followed by people ages 18-29 (90%) then African Americans (88%). Before accessing your email - 82% YES Before tracking your cell phone and how you use it - 79% YES - Asians (95%) showed the strongest support followed by African Americans (93%) then people ages 50-64 (82%) and men (82%). Before accessing your text messages - 77% YES \nWhile government demands for consumer data are on an exponential rise, it's clear that we need to update privacy protections for the modern digital age.
