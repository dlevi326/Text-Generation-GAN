These relay technologies are continuing to evolve, adding new features and capabilities such as sub-second monitoring and data collection that are allowing utilities unprecedented insight into changing grid conditions. Click to tweet: According to a recent report from Navigant Research, global revenue from smart grid protective relay systems is expected to total $73 billion from 2015 to 2024. \n“Almost all of the previous generation of protective relays on the grid today are nearing the end of their useful life and are failing,” says James McCray, senior research analyst with Navigant Research. “These technologies are now considered obsolete, and the markets associated with them are expected to collapse over the next 5 years; this is opening up opportunities for utilities to make much-needed upgrades.” \nThe stability of T&D networks has become highly visible in the political landscape in recent years due to the effect outages can have on economic development and growth, according to the report. This increased focus is expected to spur increased demand for ADVPRs as a means of ensuring the reliability and resiliency of the grid. \nThe report, Smart Grid Protective Relays , analyzes the global market for ADVPRs, with a focus on four classes of technologies: mechanical, solid-state, and digital protective relays and integrated digital protection systems. The study provides an analysis of the market issues, including market drivers and barriers, as well as regional trends and opportunities, associated with digital protective relay technologies. Global market forecasts for revenue, segmented by ADVPR technology and region, extend through 2024. The report also examines the key technologies related to digital protective relays, as well as the competitive landscape.
