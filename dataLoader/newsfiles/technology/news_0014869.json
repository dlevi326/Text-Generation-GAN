In a statement issued this week, WHO said the polio strain responsible for the new outbreak is derived from the vaccine.\nPolio is a potentially fatal water-borne disease that mostly strikes children under 5. For every child that is paralyzed, there may be up to 200 others infected.\nThe oral polio vaccine used in the eradication campaign contains a live form of polio virus. When children are vaccinated, they excrete the weakened virus. In areas with poor sanitation, the virus can survive and in very rare instances, mutate into a new form capable of sparking outbreaks, particularly in a population that hasn't been vaccinated.\nWHO said the risk of polio spreading further is \"deemed high\" and blamed the outbreak on low vaccination rates in Guinea, which is still battling Ebola.\nLast week, WHO announced a similar polio outbreak in Ukraine, also caused by a mutated strain from the vaccine.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-08T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:33:26.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
