The latter has already piloted it in select trains.\nThe company looks to deploy SF boxes in compartments and Wi-Fi hotspots of Ozone Wi-Fi Networks in stations, so that people can connect to Wi-Fi, download movies and videos on the SF app at zero data cost in just a few minutes. Once installed, the application seamlessly switches the content fetching from Wi-Fi Internet to Wi-Fi Intranet and caching or storing it in local boxes.\nSpeedFetch is based on the concept of micro-caching, which means an SF Box, placed inside the train coach, will have content locally stored, with no internet requirement. When the train enters a station, new content present in the station will enter the train SF box, over the Wi-Fi connection freshly established.\nSpeedFetch application has the capability of working in both online as well as offline modes. While a user is travelling on the train without internet access, he or she can access curated SpeedFetch content at zero data within the Wi-Fi Intranet. In an area with internet access, users can access both curated content as well as other internet services.\nAccording to Dipank Sharma, founder and chairman at SF, Rs 13.6 crore ($2 million) has been invested so far for developing the solution, which took two years to build.\n\"Since all the content has been locally assembled on the SF boxes, users will not need internet to download entertainment content while on trains. Hence, weak networks do not become a hindrance for travellers while accessing videos or movies. SF has a location-specific content management system in place that changes content according to geographic tastes,\" said Bobby Sarin, founder and CEO of Ozone Network.\nStudies have shown that on an average, 80% of the users are accessing social networks or watching movies/short clips while they are on the move. As smartphone penetration grows in India, mobile accounts for about 65% of internet traffic, according to a May report by Mary Meeker, a renowned venture capitalist and former securities analyst who works on internet and new technologies.\nIndian Railways covers a distance of about 65,000 km and has 7,112 railway stations. In 2013-14, it served 8.3 billion passengers.\nDelhi-based SF was launched in March and has about 18,000 active users with about 30% app retention.\n\nCurrently, Speed Fetch offers its solution through its app wherein users can download videos at 5G speeds and zero data costs at select places across India, including Chennai, New Delhi and Mumbai, using Ozone Wi-Fi.\nGoing forward, SF plans to expand to about 5,000 locations by next year. A user with the app installed detects the Ozone Wi-Fi location, connects to it, selects from a list of content options available on Speed Fetch app, including a three-hour-long high definition movies and games in a few minutes.\n\nSpeedFetch currently has about 10,000 hours of video and audio in various genres. A user can access by paying only for the content, and not for data. It will also have a repository of 1,000 high definition games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:22:08.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
