These chapters include the latest methods for predicting not only local heat transfer coefficients but also pressure drops. \nContaining authored books and thorough state-of-the-art reviews on many basic and special topics, such as numerical modeling of two-phase heat transfer and adiabatic bubbly and slug flows, the unified annular flow boiling model, flow pattern maps, condensation and boiling theories, new emerging topics, etc., this reference set will be of great interest to researchers, academics and students alike. \nThe first volume of the first set is Modeling of Gas Liquid Flow in Pipes, authored by Yehuda Taitel and Dvora Barnea who address basic definitions of two-phase flow parameters, hydrodynamic models based on flow patterns, flow pattern transition, the two fluid model, drift flux model, flow in parallel pipes, flooding and flow reversal. \nThe second volume of the first set, Condensation Heat Transfer authored by Srinivas Garimella and Brian M Fronks introduces condensation heat transfer, deals with direct-contact condensation, dropwise condensation, external film condensation, internal flow condensation, mini- and microchannel condensation, condensation of mixtures with condensable and non-condensable constituents, and enhancement of condensation heat transfer. \nThe third volume of the first set, Flow Boiling in Macro and Microchannels authored by John R Thome and Andrea Cioncolini introduces two-phase flow and boiling in channels, as well as two-phase flow pattern maps for macro- and micro-channels. The volume will also deal with other topics like void fraction, entrained liquid fraction in annular two-phase flow, two-phase pressure drop, forced convective boiling, critical heat flux in convective boiling, and unified modeling suite for annular flow. \nThe fourth volume of the first set, Special Topics in Pool and Flow Boiling, comprises special topics on pool and flow boiling and is authored by ME Poniewski, S Ho?ejowska, R Kaniowski, B Maciejewska, R Pastuszko, M Piasecka and TM Wójcik. It will deal with enhanced pool boiling heat transfer on novel combined micro-structured surfaces, hysteresis phenomena in pool boiling on micro-structured surfaces, flow boiling in minichannels, heat transfer and pressure drop in minichanels with microstructured surface and various spatial orientation, and numerical analysis of boiling two-phase flow in mini- and microchannels. \nThe first volume of the second set deals with special topics in boiling in microchannels, and is a compilation of chapters from different authors, including: novel micro/nanoscale configurations to enhance flow boiling in microchannels by Fanghao Yang and Chen Li; evaporation, dynamics and interface deformations in thin liquid films sheared by gas in a microchannel by O A Kabov, V V Kuznetsov and Yu O Kabova; boiling heat transfer enhancement at the microscale by Yoav Peles; multi-microchannel evaporators: flow stabilization and mapping for safe operation by Sylwia Szczukiewicz and John R Thome; dynamic modeling of on-chip two-phase cooling system with multiple micro-evaporators in parallel flow by Nicolas Lamaison, Jackson B.
