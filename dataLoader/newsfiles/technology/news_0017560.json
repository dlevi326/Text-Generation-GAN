He came from the music technology firm Topspin, and previously was general manager at Yahoo Music and had been the webmaster of the rap group Beastie Boys.\nAnalysts were not surprised by the announcement as Rogers will bring tech industry expertise and mentality to LVMH.\n“This appointment is perfectly logical and foreseeable as for two years Apple has been recruiting several senior executives from the luxury industry, so it is time that luxury opens itself up to real digital talents,” said Eric Briones, who consults luxury companies on their communication strategies.\nDamien Douani, a new technologies expert at the FaDa consultancy said “LVMH may also have been looking for some ‘cool’, a quirky background, to sweep the dust off itself” as luxury companies try to freshen up their images.\nLMVH’s other brands include fashion icons Givenchy, Fendi, Kenzo and Donna Karan and perfumes by Christian Dior and Guerlain.\nAFP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T13:58:57.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
