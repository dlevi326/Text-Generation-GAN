Eric Carlborg, former chief financial officer of e-commerce outfit Provide Commerce, is a general partner at August Capital. Provide Commerce, based in San Diego, is now owned by FTD Companies.\nSan Diego start-up HouseCall raised $6 million in funding, led by Bay Area venture firm August Capital. — HouseCall + Read Caption San Diego start-up HouseCall raised $6 million in funding, led by Bay Area venture firm August Capital. / HouseCall \nShare Photo\n   ✉ In addition, individual investor Michael Beaudoin also joined the funding round and will get a seat on HouseCall’s board of directors. He is the former co-CEO of HomeAdvisor, the leader in the home services technology market.\nWith the new funding, the 12-employee company, founded by former Qualcomm software engineers, has raised $9 million since it was founded in 2013.\nThe company recently changed its business model. When it launched, it aimed to be like Uber for consumers who needed plumbers, landscapers, painters, carpet cleaners and other home services.\nAfter downloading it mobile app, HouseCall users could request services from a stable of HouseCall vetted service providers. Once an offer was accepted by both parties, the app tracked the location of the service provider, handled payments via a registered credit card and provided other services.\nWhile HouseCall still does that, it has shifted its focus to selling software to home repair services firms to run the back office of their businesses – including estimates, scheduling, dispatching employees, invoicing, credit card processing, follow up marketing and so on.\n“One thing we found when we were more consumer focused is it’s expensive in terms of acquisition costs to get new homeowner customers,” said Ian Heidt, chief executive of HouseCall. “And we also found a lot of the service professionals ... didn’t use any other software with the exception of QuickBooks to run their businesses.”\nThe switch has given the company a different approach in the hotly competitive market, where HomeAdvisor, RepairPal and Yelp are among the competitors trying to dominate.\n“In the home services space – which is massive yet notoriously difficult to navigate – HouseCall stood out,” said Beaudoin, the former HomeAdvisor executive, in a statement. “I think the HouseCall platform is well positioned to bridge the operational needs of home services companies with rapidly unfolding consumer expectations in the mobile era.”\nHeidt said the company will use the venture funding mostly to beef up sales efforts. When HouseCall started, it rolled out only in a few cities. Earlier this year, the company went nationwide and now has customers in 700 cities in the U.S. and Canada. \nMike Freeman   More from Mike Freeman ViaSat looks to offer in-flight Wi-Fi to Boeing customers Qualcomm cuts 1,314 jobs in San Diego San Diego's HouseCall raises $6 million", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:13:01.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
