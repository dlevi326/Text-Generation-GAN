The R3 revision is the third major version of the X51and it keeps the same chassis.\nThe new models include Intel Skylake i5k or i7k processors, DDR4 RAM and optional liquid cooling support, which is quieter and more efficient than a traditional fan system.\nOn the graphics front, the base GPU is an Nvidia GTX 745, but the users can go for an AMD Radeon R9 370 or an Nvidia GTX 960. The R3 is the first X51 model to support Alienware’s external Graphics Amplifier, meaning the users could also hook up a card as powerful as a GTX Titan X. The new models are available from USD 1,099.\nAlso, the Alienware 13, 15 and 17 now feature USB Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 3, faster PCIe SSD storage and dynamic overclocking which is software that balances out high performance and acceptable heat levels. The 17-inch models can be fitted with 4K IGZO displays and the 13-inch goes up to QHD+.\nAlienware is also introducing an special edition 18-inch model featuring dual Nvidia 980M graphics totaling 16GB of fast GDDR5 memory, along with an overclocked Intel Extreme Edition processor that’s socket-mounted for future upgradeability.\nAll of these laptops are available but they run on Haswell processors for now, as Intel has not fully rolled out Skylake beyond desktops just yet.\nThe new Alienware products come preloaded with Windows 10.\nFirst Published on August 29, 2015 6:40 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T08:59:33.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
