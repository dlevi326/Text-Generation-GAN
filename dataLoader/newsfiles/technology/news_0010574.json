The reason has more to do than just with the rock bottom price of under Rs 2.57 lakh. Clearly, the interest generated by the car in India has transcended all barriers and we take this opportunity to show exactly why the Renault Kwid is stealing so many hearts even though very few people have got the opportunity to see its physical avatar. So, here are top 5 reasons to ‘like’ the Renault Kwid:\n1. The French carmaker, with the Renault Kwid, has been able to deliver exactly what the car-buying public wants and that too at a compelling starting price point of Rs 2.57 lakh.\n2. The Renault Kwid comes under the small car segment, but looking at it, you would be left scratching your head. Why? Because it looks big from the outside and feels bigger still from the inside. Certainly, this is something that Indian carbuyers would appreciate – getting cramped in a small cabin is not pleasant.\n3. The Renault Kwid has done to the Indian car market, which no other car, barring the old Maruti 800, has been able to do – threaten to upstage the norms and trends of the small car segment and raise expectations of consumers on which the rest of the carmakers will have to deliver.\n4. Under the hood too Renault Kwid has made a stellar attempt to deliver an ‘above-class’ engine. A very powerful set of specs with an 800cc engine that churns out 54bhp power along with 74Nm torque is on offer and this is always going to be more than reasonable figures to do the job expected of it.\n5. There are a lot of features that would appeal to customers including a touchscreen infotainment system which would make Renault Kwid the first in its class to offer this package. There would also be air conditioning controls and a digital instrument cluster that looks quite sporty and spunky. There are plenty of accessories as well for the users to choose from that would add to the external and internal aesthetics of the car. The steering wheel itself looks ‘classy’.\n(With CarDekho Inputs)\n 30, 2015 2:47 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:12:04.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
