The inspectors are needed to protect the environment and prevent potential health hazards caused by leaking wells, she said. \nThe Associated Press reported last year that 40 percent of new wells on federal and Indian land with a higher pollution risk were not inspected from 2009 to 2012. \nAsked if the situation had improved since then, Jewell said no, adding: “We are under-resourced.” \nWhile the proposed fee has stalled in Congress, Jewell said it remains the agency’s best option to whittle its inspections backlog. \n“It makes no sense not to match supply and demand,” she said, adding that if the drilling boom slows or fizzles, the need to charge a fee would go away. \nJewell also lamented a practice in which energy companies “flare” or burn off vast supplies of natural gas as they drill for oil. A report by the Government Accountability Office said 40 percent of the gas being burned or vented could be captured economically and sold. \nThe bureau has not completed new guidelines on flaring, but Jewell said a proposed rule could be released for public comment later this year. But even without new federal rules, Jewell urged energy companies to rethink their practice of flaring natural gas in the pursuit of higher-priced oil. \n“It’s crazy to vent natural gas into the atmosphere when natural gas is a fuel that can produce electricity at a much lower carbon footprint than other [energy] sources like coal,” Jewell said.
