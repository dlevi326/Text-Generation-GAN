In this regard, visibility over any network-based performance issues would help identify whether any bottleneck issues in the network are attributable to RSPs or the network provider.”\nMr Sims said the ACCC was greatly encouraged by the results of its trial, but a decision to proceed with a future program has not been made and any finalised program would require further stakeholder consultation. Plans on how the program would be funded have also not been finalised.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T05:45:03.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
