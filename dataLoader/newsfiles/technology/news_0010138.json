Apparently looks can be deceiving. Source: Supplied \nAPPLE has had its biggest day of announcement this year, showing off two new iPhones, a bigger iPad and an updated Apple TV. \n“We are about to make some monster announcements across several of our product lines,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said. And he was right. \nThe new iPad Pro has more power and performance than any other before it and features a super sharp 12.9-inch screen that can fit a full-size virtual keyboard. \nThe new iPhones may look almost identical to last year’s models, however everything else about them has been radically changed. \nA new Apple TV has finally been announced too, with a focus on apps, powerful new hardware and a new user interface. \niPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus \nThe follow-up devices to last year’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have both been announced. Both look almost identical to last year’s devices, however, new colours including Rose Gold have been added. \n“While they look familiar, we have changed everything about these new iPhones,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said. Apple CEO Tim Cook shows off the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus Source: AP \nThe iPhone 6s and 6s Plus have a new screen technology called 3D touch which incorporates both multi-touch and Force Touch. This means it can detect things like gestures and open new menus based on how hard you press on the display. So if you press lightly you get one thing and if you press harder you get another. \n“This is a dynamic system, deeply integrated into iOS 9,” Apple’s Jony Ive said. “You can dip in and out of where you are, without losing sense of your context.” \nYou can peek in on details when pressing hard, such as a flight number, which will show up the flight details inside your existing app as long as you’re pressing on the screen. Or when someone asks you if you’re free on a certain date, you can hard press the date and a snapview of your calender on that day will pop on so you can see if you’re busy or not. \nBoth new devices have received big internal updates, with a new A9 chip that’s 80 per cent faster than the iPhone 6 and has 90 per cent more graphics power. TouchID has been updated to work twice as fast too. Here's he one slide summary of the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus pic.twitter.com/51KqcZQjxD — Trevor Long (@trevorlong) September 9, 2015 \nThe other big iPhone announcement was a brand new 12-megapixel iSight camera that can record video in 4K resolution, or four times the resolution of full-high definition. \nThe images shown off on stage that were taken on the iPhone 6s looked very impressive, in several different scenario such as portraits, landscape and in low-light scenarios. \nSelfies are going to look better than ever, with Apple now allowing you to use the screen as a front-facing camera flash. \nA new type of picture called “live photos” was shown off, which are photos with four-second videos that play with sound when you hard-press using 3D touch. If you’ve used a Nokia Lumia or HTC One device, they’ve both had very similar features in the past. Apple iPhone 6S and 6S plus photos look great, the bird is the stand out. #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/AYtsmW6Yst — techAU (@techAU) September 9, 2015 \nUnfortunately, desepite pictures taking and apps taking up more space, the entry level model is still just 16GB, with US pricing exactly the same as last year, starting at $199 on contract. Australian pricing will be released this morning and will go on sale September 25. iOS 9 will be available on September 16 for existing iPhones.

Apple showed this off with the Microsoft Office suite, showing how you can edit and use data from both Word and Excel at the same time and copy and past information from one document to the other. \nApple’s new A9X processor has “desktop class performance” with two times the graphics as last year’s iPad Air and 1.8-times processor speed with a 10 hour battery life. \n“It can do things that a smartphone doesn’t do because it doesn’t have to sit in your pocket,” said Apple’s Phil Schiller. The specs for the new iPad Pro. Source: AFP \nThe speakers have been upgraded as well, now with a four-speaker stereo system, despite the iPad Pro being just 6.9mm thick. \nApple also announced a physical keyboard case like Microsoft’s Surface series, with a special “woven fabric” that creates the structure of the keys. It’s connected with a smart connector, again, much like Microsoft’s Surface, that powers and carries data to the keyboard. \nAn Apple Pencil stylus will be available as an optional extra too, which can sense pressure, tilt and stroke when you’re using it. There will be a new Notes app update where you can draw and diagram directly with the Apple Pencil. \nThe pencil can be recharged using a built-in lightning connector that plugs directly into the bottom of the iPad Pro. \nThe iPad Pro starts at $US799, the Pencil at $US99 and keyboard at $169 with Australian pricing expected later today. Release date is in November. Apple has reinvented... the pencil? Source: Supplied \nTHE APPLE TV \nThe Apple TV has finally received an update, with a big emphasis on apps and a new TV operating system. \nIt will finally support games, with a touchpad packed into the remote that can also be moved like a Wii remote with motion sensors. \nSiri has been included, which appears to be the main way Apple wants you to navigate through the Apple TV. Through Siri you can just say things like “show me funny TV shows” to find the latest hit comedy, through not only the iTunes store but through Netflix and other streaming services. \nSiri can not only search directly for TV shows, but can also do things such as searching for a specific episode of a TV show that features a cameo, for example. Or even rewind 15 seconds with subtitles if you ask “what did she say?” The magic of the new AppleTV appears to be the voice- and touch-enabled remote. #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/JNCx7U9Ir4 — Lance Ulanoff (@LanceUlanoff) September 9, 2015 \nApple is trying to bring big games to the Apple TV to help it to become the go-to system for casual gamers. \nGuitar Hero will be coming to the TV, as will the new Disney Infinity game and a Wii Sports-esque family sports game called Beat Sports. The Aussie developers behind the acclaimed iPhone game CrossyRoad were also brought up on stage to show off their game on the Apple TV. \nAs long as you own an iPhone or an iPod Touch you won’t need to buy any more remotes when playing multiplayer either, as both can be used as game controllers. \nTHE APPLE WATCH \nThe Apple Watch which was announced at last year’s iPhone event has been the first thing to receive an update by Apple at this year’s event. The new watchOS2 software update was shown off for the Watch which allows app data to be installed directly, making loading speeds faster and gives app developers more tools to work with. \nNew apps were also showed off such as Facebook Messenger and a new iTranslate app which can translate 90 languages on your wrist. \nNew watch bands have been announced, including a much needed Hermes leather band and new rubber sports bands. A new Rose Gold and Gold Watch model was also shown off. \nCook also highlighted the fitness aspects of the Apple Watch which he said had been “life changing” for many users. \nWatchOS 2 will be available on September 16 for existing users, with the new Watch models available to buy from Apple stores today. The new Hermes leather watch bands look great. Source: AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:24:13.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
