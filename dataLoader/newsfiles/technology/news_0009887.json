The resulting groups then have spent years working to put programs in place.\nEach summit has been focused on a different topic, including energy efficiency, renewable energy, recycling, emphasizing local foods, and this year's topic, clean water.\nThe focus of clean water will work to develop programs and practices to keep storm water from overwhelming sewage treatment plants and to make consumers aware of products containing nano-sized plastic pellets that are polluting the oceans, as well as the Great Lakes.\nIn remarks opening the two-day summit, Mayor Frank Jackson reminded the crowd who the city has been doing this for.\n\"People are the reason we are doing this work,\" he said. \"We are doing this for the people who live, work and visit our community.\"\nWe are positioning and moving Cleveland in to the future in order to create a sustainable economy that creates opportunities for economic prosperity, increases quality of life and improves the physical and social health of our community in order to make Cleveland a city of choice,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T05:38:00.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
