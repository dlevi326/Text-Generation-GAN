Fox, the media conglomerate created by magnate Rupert Murdoch, will pay $725 million for a 73 percent stake in the new entity called National Geographic Partners \nJames Murdoch, who became CEO at Fox this year when his father stepped aside to be executive chairman, said: \"We believe in the Society's mission of bringing the world to audiences through science, education and exploration.\" \nThe funds will allow the Society to double its investment in an array of science, research and education programs, and will lead to the creation of a center dedicated to improving the geographic skills of high school students, and centers for excellence in cartography, journalism and photography. \nThe Society will maintain its National Geographic Museum, forums and related programs. \nEarlier this year, 84-year-old Rupert Murdoch announced he was stepping aside from the Fox CEO job to be co-executive chairman with his eldest son, Lachlan. \nFox, which operates a major Hollywood studio and an array of broadcast and cable television channels, was split off in 2013 from News Corp., which owns newspapers and other publishing assets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T03:14:41.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
