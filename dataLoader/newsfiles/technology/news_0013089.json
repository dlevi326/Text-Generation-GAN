The Suwon, South Korea-based company also plans to cut some expenses next year, the report added. Samsung declined to comment in an e-mail.\nThe moves come after new high-end Galaxy smartphones failed to impress consumers, triggering five straight monthly declines and wiping out more than $40 billion in Samsung’s market value since April. The company’s share of global smartphone shipments fell more than 3 percentage points in the second quarter, and it’s no longer the top seller in China, the world’s biggest mobile-phone market.\nSamsung shares fell 0.4 percent to 1,108,000 won as of 9:39 a.m. in Seoul, extending their decline this year to 17 percent.\nSamsung tried to attract customers before this week’s product launch from Apple by advancing the release of new Galaxy models. Yet that failed to ease market concerns about its second-half earnings, when technology companies typically benefit from the year-end holiday shopping season.\nSamsung, which had 206.2 trillion won ($171 billion) in sales last year, is estimated to post about 200.2 trillion won in sales this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T04:32:47.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
