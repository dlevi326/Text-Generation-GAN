RELATED NEW DELHI: Mobile wallet firm Paytm has set aside a $3-4 million kitty, up from $1 million last year, for people it refers to as those \"taking a shot at the moon.\" In other words, those setting audacious targets for the company. This money, reserved for top talent including its 100 million wallet team members, is besides the usual compensation and variable pay expenditure paid to top performers in companies. \"We have crores of rupees set aside for such teams. Like the team that was behind the 100 million wallet plan...They had set a target of achieving $20 million wallet transactions and ended up with $25 million in one year. We're in a fast pace of growth and people are superlative performers. They're key to driving large scale projects for us,\" said Amit Sinha, VP, business and people, Paytm. Only last month, the firm received approval for a payments bank. Paytm is also expanding the Esops pool this year. Around 1,200 people will get Esops in the company this year, up from 600-700 last year. \"As a culture we're horizontal. We feel it's driven by people's capabilities. We hire from people from every industry and want them to build a story here,\" he added. The race to scale up and meet ambitious targets is leading to a rewards and recognition overhaul in Paytm. In terms of its employee base, Paytm has grown three fold over the past year from 1000 employees to 3000 people and hopes to hire 2000 more employees this year. The company follows the bell curve, but the top performers are not restricted to 10%; they constitute around 20-25% of its employee base. \"Everybody is a risk taker. We can't optimize on costs for an employee who is trying to grow from 0 to a 25 million wallet count within a year in a country where the market size is 10 million. We can't implement a balanced scorecard here,\" said Sinha. The company also encourages multiple hat-wearing and has been grooming people for different opportunities internally. Saurabh Vashishtha started with a segment of fashion and added multiple categories to his role including product for marketplace at Paytm. Renu Satti started with HR, moved to merchant acquisition and is currently heading overall operations, while Shankar Nath, who started off as the recharge business head, and is now also heading overall marketing. The company will hire around 225 students from campuses this year as compared to 150 last year. Around 100 of these students will be from business schools. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias= Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:39:40.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
