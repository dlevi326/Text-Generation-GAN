A total of 145 Apple Watch owners participated.\nCustomer Satisfaction\nOverall satisfaction ratings (87%) are very positive for the Apple Watch – with more than half (54%) of owners saying they’re Very Satisfied and 33% Somewhat Satisfied with their new device.\nIn terms of expectations, 28% of Apple Watch owners say their new smart watch Exceeds expectations and 51% say it Meets expectations.\nWhen Apple Watch owners were asked whether they’d recommend their new device to a friend or colleague, a robust 83% say they’re Very (55%) or Somewhat Likely (28%) to do so.\nKey Likes and Dislikes\nWe asked Apple Watch owners what they like best and dislike most about their device.\nTop Likes. Notifications (49%) is the number one thing Apple Watch owners like best about their device, followed by Health and Fitness Monitoring (41%). Aesthetics/Design (30%) was also a popular choice.\nTop Dislikes. A total of 37% of owners say the Battery Life is Too Short, and 31% dislike its Reliance on the iPhone. Other dislikes include Lack of Waterproofing (25%), Selection of Apps (17%) and Learning Curve (17%).\nHealth and Fitness Monitors and Traditional Watches Most Vulnerable\nNearly half of all Apple Watch owners (46%) say they had previously planned on buying a health and fitness monitor but have put that purchase on hold or canceled it altogether now that they have an Apple Watch.\nAnother 16% say they’ve put on hold or canceled a traditional watch purchase. We took a closer look at how the Apple Watch is impacting the traditional watch market.\nA Clear Threat to Traditional Watches. A striking 85% of Apple Watch owners say they wear their device on a daily basis, and another 11% several times a week.\nBefore purchasing the Apple Watch, more than two-thirds (69%) say they wore a traditional watch daily (61%) or several times a week (8%). But since buying their Apple Watch, an overwhelming majority of owners who also have a traditional watch say the Apple Watch has replaced it (82%) – a clear sign of the negative impact it is having on the traditional watch market.\nOther key findings from the survey include:\nApple Watch owners were asked how often they use various features and functionalities on their smart watch. Four-in-five (79%) say they use their Apple Watch for Health and Fitness Monitoring on a daily basis. Another 63% say they Send and Receive Text Messages, while 52% Check the Weather daily. The survey found Lag Time When Scrolling or Refreshing (29%) is the top problem experienced by owners. Issues with the Sensor (19%) – the focus of several media reports in the aftermath of the Apple Watch release – ranks second. But when we asked Apple Watch owners about the extent of the sensor problem, just 4% characterize it as a Very Big Problem and 8% say it’s Somewhat of a Problem. Fashion or Tech? A total of 61% consider their Apple Watch to be a Technology Device, but just 1% think it’s a Fashion Accessory. At the same time, better than a third (36%) say Equally as Both.\n451 Research will publish an updated look at the smart watch market in October 2015 when its ChangeWave service fields the next quarterly wearable trends survey.\nTo request more information from 451 Research on the latest ChangeWave survey results, follow this link .\nMethodology: The findings are based upon a July 27 – August 4, 2015 consumer survey of Apple Watch owners, and a total of 145 respondents from 451 Research’s ChangeWave survey network participated. 451 leverages its ChangeWave network of 25,000 business and technology professionals – as well as early-adopter consumers – to provide a forward-looking view of technologies, companies and the macro economy well in advance of other sources.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12959692.htm\n ", "external_links": ["https://451research.com/report-long?icid=3512", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12959692.htm"], "published": "2015-09-15T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T03:24:40.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
