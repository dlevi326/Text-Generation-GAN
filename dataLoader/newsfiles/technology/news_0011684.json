Oleg Teterin, the company’s director, told the Russian paper that a third of the Russian population doesn’t have access to movie theaters: At the end of last year, the country had 3,787 screens, compared to 39,956 screens in the United States.\nThe repurposing of shipping containers is hardly new—they’ve been turned into everything from compact homes , to coffeeshops , to hospitals .
