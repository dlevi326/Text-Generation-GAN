It’s an explosion of devices that, Mr McAfee says, raises the stakes ­associated with computer security to “unprecedented levels.”\n“Hackers are just salivating at the prospects of total world dominance and litigation lawyers are going to be laughing all the way to the bank,” he told The Australian.\nMr McAfee is no stranger to litigation, having been sued more than 200 times and says he is “more targeted than anybody”. The self-described eccentric millionaire also happens to be running for president as a candidate of his own “Cyber Party”.\nHe cited the recent hack of a new smart safe by Brinks — the largest manufacturer of bank vaults and personal safes in the US — as a demonstration of the risks of passing computer security ­issues over to companies with ­little experience in the field.\n“These are iron hard safes. There’s no way to physically break the thing or force your way in with a sledgehammer and yet a couple of teenagers cracked the thing within 30 minutes without leaving a trace,” he said.\nCarmakers have also been under fire recently with Fiat Chrysler recalling 1.4 million US cars and trucks after hackers demonstrated they could remotely control their systems while they were in operation. A few months ago a personal friend of Mr McAfee’s, Chris Roberts, was able to take control of a United Airlines plane after successfully hacking into the on-board entertainment system. According to both Mr Roberts and Mr McAfee, he had tried for years to get Boeing to heed warnings about the security flaw. Mr Roberts is now Mr Mc­Afee’s chief technology adviser as a part of his political campaign.\n“What’s going to happen when the line of smart vacuum cleaners, smart toasters, smart riding mowers, and, god forbid, smart handguns come out? What happens when hardware stores release their smart compressors and smart fuses for detonation devices? And my favourite nightmare — smart ignition systems for every propane or natural gas-powered device on the planet. Hackers could orchestrate a fireworks display magnificent enough for the entire world to see.”\nThe worry, Mr McAfee says, is that companies are still making the “same foolish move” by using off-the-shelf parts and software because they don’t have the time to build their own, leaving devices wide open for attackers.\n“To do it properly will take five to 10 years; to do it improperly would take a matter of months.”\nTo make smart devices “smart”, manufacturers are ­enabling them to collect data about the user’s habits and preferences in order to automate a lot of functions without the need for ­direct user input. Aside from the ability to connect to the internet, smart devices are also generally built with additional sensors so ­devices can talk to each other.\nMr McAfee says this turns a seemingly harmless device into an attractive target. “If I buy a smart toaster that talks to my smart refrigerator that has been weighing my milk and it notices that I haven’t been opening the door for a few days, well it will assume that I’m on vacation. It will tell my toaster who, in turn, will broadcast that information onto my entire neighbourhood.\n“When thieves that just happen to be driving down the street tap in to the broadcast from the toaster saying ‘my master’s away, my master’s away’ and invites them into the house, you’re going to have some lawsuits.\n“And it won’t be just one, it will be thousands and the more widespread your product is, the bigger the lawsuit is going to get.”\nMr McAfee added that the ­deluge of litigation sparked by the recent hack of Ashley Madison and the release of its customer data should serve as a warning to companies rushing to manufacture a smart device.\n“If you are in care of someone’s data the world is going to make you responsible if that data is in anyway revealed.”\nMr McAfee recommends companies to invest in hiring white hat hackers to build the underlying ­security and software of smart ­devices to avoid needless security holes.\n“To build a smart toaster is not a big job and an average team of 3 to 4 white hat hackers can build it correctly in a couple of months — the same amount of time as it would take an entire team of regular programmers to build the product using off the shelf parts.”\nThis article was first published in The Australian.", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/28/1227547/970447-146c524a-65cd-11e5-ae2c-91350e74fa5b.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-29T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:36:45.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
