The portable metagenomic test developed by Charles Chiu and his team can detect the Ebola virus and many other known pathogens in less than an hour.

The USB-powered sequencer used by Chiu’s research team, dubbed MinION, was made by Oxford Nanopore Technologies and is no larger than a modern cell phone. \nAlthough the technology is still new and thereby prone to error, Chiu claims it’s becoming faster and more accurate by the month. With the sequencing part cut down to mere minutes, the team has now set its sights on streamlining the sample preparation technique, which still requires several hours, regardless of the setup. \n“To our knowledge, this is the first time that nanopore sequencing has been used for real-time metagenomic detection of pathogens in complex clinical samples in the setting of human infections,” claims Chiu. “Unbiased point-of-care testing for pathogens by rapid metagenomic sequencing has the potential to radically transform infectious disease diagnosis in both clinical and public health settings. \nProving the robustness of their invention, the researchers successfully used their sequencing kit to detect Hepatitis C in the blood of an infected UCSF patient, and the Chikungunya virus in a man who was asymptomatic at the time, but eventually reported having a fever and joint pains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T14:38:15.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
