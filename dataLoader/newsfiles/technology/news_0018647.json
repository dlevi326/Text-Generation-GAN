This makes SSAM the first container terminal in the Americas to operate 100% on electric power. The joint achievement between Conductix-Wampfler and SSAM marks a growing shift from diesel rubber-tyred gantries (RTGs) to electrified ERTGs.\nTraditionally, RTGs run on diesel fuel. But with rising fuel costs and environmental concerns, terminals around the world have begun to introduce this cleaner and more efficient method of operation.\nSSAM began the transition to electric in September, 2012, partnering with Conductix-Wampfler to retrofit eight RTGs to ERTGs. With technical support and training from Conductix-Wampfler, SSAM successfully completed the retrofit using their own manpower.\nGustavo Oberto, Managing Director of SMO Americas at Conductix-Wampfler, said: “SSAM’s successful transition to a 100% electrical operation, using their own manpower, is an outstanding technical achievement.”\nTo complete the initiative, SSAM also converted four Paceco RTGs into RMGs for intermodal rail yard operations. Those units are powered with Conductix-Wampfler’s Hevi-Bar II Conductor Bar System.\nGabriel Juri, Cranes Maintenance Manager, SSA Mexico, said: “The transition to E-RTGs is a clear benefit no matter how you look at it. We are extremely satisfied with the performance of the E-RTGS, particularly due to the higher speeds and increased productivity from not having to refuel or conduct diesel engine maintenance.”\nFact File: Conductix-Wampfler is the largest global producer of systems and equipment to electrify RTGs. Since 2006, the company has supplied over 300 cable reels and 1,600 conductor rail trolleys worldwide for both new cranes and retrofits\n\n(Source: Conductix)\nFor all the latest on Conductix, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:16:14.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
