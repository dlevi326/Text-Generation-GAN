Scientists say they’ve discovered a new member of the human family tree, revealed by a huge trove of bones in a barely accessible, pitch-dark chamber of a cave in South Africa, showing a surprising mix of human-like and more primitive characteristics. (AP Photo/Themba Hadebe)[/caption]Look very closely at the reconstruction of the skull of newly discovered hominin ancestor Homo naledi. Can you tell that it's been 3D printed? According to John Hawks, a palaeoanthropologist on the Rising Star Expedition, it was produced by scaling cranial elements from different individuals to size-match and virtually reconstructed. It was 3D printed, then spruced up with modelling clay and a coat of paint. With just a standard desktop 3D printer, you too can get similar results and have your own cast of H. naledi . But what about other fossil hominins?The Rising Star Expedition's opening up of information so soon after discovery is unprecedented and very, very welcome. In the past, fellow researchers and teachers would have to wait multiple years -- and pay hundreds of dollars -- to get a cast of the new fossil. And wait many more years for all the data to be opened up. Within 12 hours of the species announcement, I had downloaded and printed 5 of my favorite pieces of H. naledi on the MakerBot 3D printer we have in my Virtebra Lab at the Division of Anthropology and Archaeology at the University of West Florida : I selected a mandible, a fragment of a maxilla that matches, the top half of a femur, one of the anatomically fascinating first metacarpals, and a large chunk of skull. I spent much of the day of the announcement printing, which meant I was able to bring the fragments in to my Human Osteology course almost immediately after the to talk to the students about what had been discovered. While not all of them were interested in the find, the ones that geeked out with me made my frenzied printing of them worthwhile.[caption id=\"attachment_1125\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] 3D printed mandible and maxilla of Homo naledi .

Killgrove)[/caption]Now that the news about the availability of 3D models has made its way into my circle of fellow anthropologists, many have been asking how I have printed the fossils and where they can find more. First, the H. naledi fossils were mostly easy to work with -- published in .stl or .ply (which is easily convertible to .stl), I simply imported them into MakerWare, the software for my MakerBot printer, and generated a print file. Voilà! And second, there are unfortunately only a small number of 3D models available. Why small? Well, not all fossil remains have been digitized, not all researchers want them digitized, and not all companies that make and sell casts want them digitized and made freely available.We are still approaching the question of open access of artifact and fossil scans in archaeology and palaeoanthropology, which makes Rising Star the new benchmark for high-quality publication of all forms of data. But some of the available hominin fossils that can be downloaded and printed -- should you want to beef up your collection of casts -- include (in approximate order of evolution, from earliest to most recent): Australopithecus anamensis (jaw fragment) - AfricanFossils.org Australopithecus africanus (Taung child skull) by RadioLab and the Chicago Field Museum - Thingiverse Australopithecus ( Paranthropus ) aethiopicus ( KNM-WT 17000 ) - AfricanFossils.org Australopithecus (Paranthropus) boisei (8 specimens) - AfricanFossils.org\nOH-5 t KNM-WT 17400 Homo naledi (91 specimens) by Rising Star - Morphosource Homo habilis (4 specimens) - AfricanFossils.org OH24 t KNM-ER 1813 Homo rudolfensis (5 specimens) - AfricanFossils.org KNM-ER 1470 Homo erectus (12 specimens) - AfricanFossils.org KNM-WT 1500b t KNM-WT 1500c t KNM-ER 3733 Homo heidelbergensis ( KNM-ES 11693 ) - AfricanFossils.org Homo sapiens (4 specimens) - AfricanFossils.org Omo 2 t KNM-ER 5306 There are many other sites with 3D fossil models that are not downloadable or are not printable, such as the Smithsonian's 3D fossil collection . But within the last few years, the discipline of palaeoanthropology has opened up considerably, which is a major boon for both researchers and anyone who teaches human evolution. The cost of 3D printing is relatively low, numerous libraries around the country have installed publicly-accessible 3D printers, and sites like 3DHubs can help you access one locally, meaning the collection and analysis of fossil hominin casts is finally within the reach of millions of people around the world.[gallery2012]", "external_links": ["http://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmer-3733?o=1", "http://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmes-11693?o=1", "http://africanfossils.org/hominids/KNMWT%2015000%20c#_=_", "http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:332463", "http://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmwt-17400?o=1", "http://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmer-1813?o=1", "http://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmwt-17000?o=1", "http://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmer-30745?o=1", "https://www.3dhubs.com/", "http://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmer-5306?o=1", "https://virtebra.wordpress.com/", "http://africanfossils.org/hominids/oh-5?o=1", "http://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmer-1470?o=1", "http://africanfossils.org/hominids/omo-2?o=1", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/ac4ca2e5016540b2b4cfd7a040bb1c9a/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://africanfossils.org/hominids/oh-24?o=1", "http://morphosource.org/index.php/Detail/ProjectDetail/Show/project_id/124", "http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/3d-collection", "http://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmwt-15000-b?o=1"], "published": "2015-09-20T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T03:30:29.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
