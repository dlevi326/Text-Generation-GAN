Among the questions the FTC is exploring is whether Google uses Android to enhance its lead in online search, this person said.\nSmartphone makers are free to not use Google's licensed Android operating system. But to get access to Google's Play app store and other services that enhance Android phones, they have to agree to put Google's search service prominently on the devices.\nHiroshi Lockheimer, head of Android, defended its arrangements with smartphone makers in a blog in April, after European officials launched their own investigation.\nMr. Lockheimer said Google's agreements with manufacturers ensured that Android phones would work well when people first bought them, by getting basic services like email and maps preinstalled and functioning harmoniously.\nMr. Lockheimer also said that even smartphone makers who use Google's licensed version of Android are allowed to preload, in prominent positions, apps and services from Google rivals like Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\nBut FairSearch, a coalition of large technology companies that includes Google rival Microsoft Corp., said Google has misused its position and welcomed the FTC's interest in Android.\n\"Google has used a range of anticompetitive tactics, carrying on a troubling pattern of conduct that has made it more difficult and expensive for fresh, innovative companies to reach the market,\" the group, which has long been critical of Google, said in a statement.\nThe FTC previously conducted a detailed investigation of whether Google abused its dominance in Internet search, but closed that probe in early 2013 without bringing a case.\nIn that inquiry, FTC staffers concluded Google had biased its search results to benefit its own services and hurt rivals. But in what they termed \"a close call,\" the staffers recommended against a broad lawsuit, citing legal hurdles and Google's \"strong procompetitive justifications\" for its actions.\nFTC competition officials in the previous investigation recommended challenging three Google practices, including its alleged \"scraping\" of content from rival websites. The commission agreed to close its investigation after Google agreed to make voluntary changes to those practices.\nThe companies that have complained to the FTC recently about Google include app developers and other providers of online services. They say they have been hampered in their attempts to get prominent positioning on Android phones or to win the status of a preinstalled, default app for their products.\nThe FTC declined to address the issue. \"FTC investigations are nonpublic and we do not comment on an investigation or the existence of an investigation,\" said spokesman Justin Cole.\nEuropean antitrust officials are several months into a formal investigation of whether Google uses Android to stifle competition. The European Commission launched a full probe in April after several years of informal investigation.\nSeparately, the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, also has formally charged Google with skewing its search results to favor its own shopping services.\nBloomberg reported earlier Friday that the FTC was examining Android-related issues.\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com and Alistair Barr at alistair.barr@wsj.com\n 25, 2015 15:21 ET (19:21 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T11:43:44.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
