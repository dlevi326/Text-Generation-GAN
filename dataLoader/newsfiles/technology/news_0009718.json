Lisa Jackson , Apple's top environmental executive, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that carbon emissions tied to the production of those iPhone enclosures have been cut in half from last year.\nAlthough those gains won't be highlighted in any of Apple's ads leading up to the Sept. 25 release of the last iPhones, the company is hoping its faithful customers will appreciate the progress.\n\"We feel it's really important to tell folks what we did,\" Jackson said. \"We shouldn't keep these kinds of ideas in a box because we believe other folks should be doing exactly the same thing.\"\nOther major technology companies also have been trying to reduce the pollution caused by their digital services and products, usually by investing heavily in hydroelectricity and renewable energy such as solar and wind power, to run the millions of computers that store and process data for their users.\nBy some estimates, technology products and services account for as much of the world's carbon emissions as the airline industry.\nBesides Apple Inc. , both Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. have also been praised by environmental groups for reducing their reliance on power plants that burn coal and natural gas.\nApple boasts that all its data centers, offices and stores in the U.S. are now powered by renewable energy. On a worldwide basis, about 13 percent of Apple's operations still draw on power generated from fossil figures. The Cupertino, California, company has pledged to eliminate all fossil fuels from its energy mix.\nApple is also pressuring the hundreds of suppliers of that make and assemble parts for its gadgets to become more environmentally friendly. As part of that resolve, Apple put a higher priority on equipping its latest iPhones with aluminum produced with hydroelectric power.\n\"It's a first step, but it's the kind of work you have to do to turn the corner,\" Jackson said. \"At the end of the day, if environment is one of our values, then also want it to show up in our products.\"", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-16T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:46:48.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
