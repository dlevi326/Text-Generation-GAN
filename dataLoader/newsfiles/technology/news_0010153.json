Privacy Sentry is 1 of 5 companies selected as a CTIA Startup Lab Finalist in the Cybersecurity category. The company also released its first Threat Report after discovering unusual activity by Leo Privacy Guard, offering detailed information on how the app collects data about users and sends to a server in Singapore and China without permission.

Our unique approach provides detailed, up-to-date privacy threat detection when mobile apps leak data, which we believe is the biggest threat to enterprise security today.\"\nPrivacy Sentry Mobile Threat Intelligence Platform \nEach startup selected by CTIA as a Startup Lab finalist is allocated three minutes to describe their product and the problem it solves. During this allocated time Spiegelberg will discuss how Privacy Sentry monitors app behavior on employees phones via SpyAware, an app currently available in Google Play . SpyAware monitors when apps are misusing their permissions to take private data or a users location, as well as notifies users when high threat apps are detected on their phone. Spiegelberg will also discuss its complete Mobile Threat Intelligence Platform, which includes SpyAware, as well as a sophisticated mobile threat intelligence database with real-time threats, deep analytics of up-to-date threat information, and tools to take action as part of an integrated strategy with Security Information Management and Mobile Device Management solutions. \nTo showcase how the Privacy Sentry platform works, Privacy Sentry will start releasing a Threat Report, which takes a deeper analysis when it discovers applications leaking private data. As part of this Threat Report analysts, Privacy Sentry first sought to analyze what companies in the mobile privacy space where doing, believing that this industry should lead by example. However, enough red flags were raised immediately with one application, Leo Privacy Guard, which prompted Privacy Sentry to use its deep enterprise analysis tools for a closer look. Privacy Sentry discovered that Leo Privacy Guard was taking sensitive data from users, including identifying details such as the IMEI, a unique phone identifier, and IMSI, which identifies your phone to your mobile provider's network, and much more.  In fact, it discovered that Leo Privacy Guard was taking enough personal information that pirates could use to make a phone stop working, steal mobile minutes, or compromise someone's personal identity. Privacy Sentry's first Threat Report on Leo Privacy Guard is available here for download .\nAttendees at CTIA are invited to visit the Privacy Sentry booth  (#4374) to learn more about the Privacy Sentry Mobile Threat Intelligence platform and the Leo Privacy Guard Threat Report.\nABOUT PRIVACY SENTRY\nSpyAware is created by Privacy Sentry Corp (PSC), a company that provides security software for mobile devices based on its patented technology that continuously monitors, displays, and disrupts the capturing of private dataâ€”whether between apps, data brokers, Internet companies, and government agencies.
