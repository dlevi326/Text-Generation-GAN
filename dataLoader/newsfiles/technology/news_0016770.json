Included in the order was a mandate to fund the creation of a non-profit organization to develop a common set of voluntary standards for ISAOs. \nThe voluntary ISAOs expand information sharing by encouraging the formation of communities that share information not just within a sector, but across a region or in response to a specific emerging cyber threat, Ozment said. \nThe University of Texas at San Antonio, he said, was selected after a competitive process, and will work with existing information sharing organizations, owners and operators of critical infrastructure, federal agencies, and other public and private sector stakeholders to identify a common set of voluntary standards or guidelines for the creation and functioning of ISAOs. \nAccording to Ozment, the university will develop its standards through open-ended engagement business communities, civil society groups, and other stakeholders, looking to produce transparent best practices that align with the needs of all industry groups.
