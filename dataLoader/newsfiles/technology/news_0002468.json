It will be showcased within the Vehicle Zone for the duration of the show. \nFAUN Trackway's new suite of computer-based training (CBT) will also be showcased at DSEi. The e-learning programme consists of simulated and animated content that enables armed forces to remotely train personnel anywhere in the world. \nThe software is available for the whole FAUN Trackway product range, allowing users to understand the theoretical content of operating FAUN Trackway systems at their own pace, and attendees will be able to trial the software via an interactive touchscreen at the FAUN Trackway stand. \nFAUN Trackway CEO Chris Kendall said: \"Our constant strive for engineering excellence drives us to deliver innovative systems that truly meet the needs of modern armed forces. \n\"These latest systems will allow organisations to reinforce their capabilities, whether it's through the HGMS-IV providing quick and easy access for vehicles in disaster relief situations, or CBT allowing countries to upskill multiple users on theoretical content at the individual's own pace. \n\"As the biggest exhibition we attend, and with attendees visiting from all corners of the globe, DSEi is the perfect opportunity for us to display our new suite of solutions and showcase our credentials as a UK manufacturer.\" \nFAUN Trackway will be at stand S4-140 and in the vehicle zone N10-190.
