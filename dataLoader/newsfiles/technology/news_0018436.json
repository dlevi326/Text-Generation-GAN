RELATED SAN FRANCISCO: Apple is leaning on Cisco Systems' internet networking expertise in its latest attempt to sell more iPhones and iPads to corporate customers. The alliance announced calls for Cisco to ensure that corporate internet connections relying on its gear deliver content quickly and securely to iPhones and iPads. Cisco will also help Apple develop ways for iPhones to interact more smoothly with workers' office phones. Financial terms of the partnership weren't disclosed. This is the second time in two years that Apple has teamed up with a major technology company that focuses on business customers. Apple joined forces with IBM 13 months ago to build and sell business applications for the iPhone and iPad. The aggressive push into the corporate market is part of Apple's strategy to reverse a slump in the iPad. Sales of the pioneering tablet have fallen from the previous year in six consecutive quarters, reflecting competition from less expensive alternatives and consumers' aversion to upgrading to the latest iPads as frequently as they have with new versions of the iPhone. Apple is hoping to spur more sales of the iPad by making the tablet more useful for businesses. The Cupertino, California, company also wants to expand the appeal of the iPhone, its biggest moneymaker. \"All this makes perfect sense to me,'' said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. Apple's intensifying focus on business customers has prodded the company to befriend former antagonists. The notion of Apple and IBM helping each other out once would have seemed inconceivable because they were such bitter rivals in the personal computer market. The animosity ran so high that Apple famously skewered IBM as a soulless company devoid of new ideas in a television commercial that evoked images of novelist George Orwell's \"Big Brother'' figure in \"1984.'' Although Apple's relationship with Cisco never got that nasty, the two companies locked in a legal skirmish over rights to use the terms \"iPhone'' and \"iOS,'' the software that powers Apple's mobile devices. Maintaining that it owned the iPhone trademark, Cisco sued Apple shortly after that device was announced in 2007. The companies reached a confidential settlement that allowed both companies to use the name. Cisco Systems Inc also calls its own networking software \"IOS.'' The San Jose, California, company agreed to license that name to Apple for an undisclosed amount. Apple isn't the only maker of popular consumer products that's trying to court more business customers. Google, the maker of the Android operating system for mobile devices and Chrome operating system for personal computers, also has been trying to muscle into the same market. 10 worst products Apple has ever made of 11 Apple is known for the hit products it has released in the last decade: iPod, iPhone and most recently iPad. The company broke all corporate records with its iPhone sales this year.But the iPhone maker hasn't always been a synonym for success. Some of of its products, particularly in the '80s and '90s, were huge flops.From the PowerPC to the Pippin game console, we recount the ill-fated products Apple probably wishes you forgot about permanently. iPod Hi-Fi was built with Apple's sleek design aesthetic, but ultimately failed to deliver the sound quality that third-party competitors could offer. Apple's hockey puck mouse came out with the first iMac, but its shape proved very uncomfortable for users and forced Apple to reconsider its peripheral ergonomics. Before Apple TV was even a twinkle in Steve Jobs's eye, Apple released Macintosh TV in 1993. It was incapable of displaying TV on the desktop and sold only 10,000 units. Pippin, manufactured by Bandai, was Apple's first stab at a gaming console. It sold only 42,000 units before being discontinued in 1997, a year after its release. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias= Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T07:09:04.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
