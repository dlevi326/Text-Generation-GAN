The Environmental Protection Agency has issued a notice to Volkswagen that it broke the law by using software to circumvent emissions testing. The result is a mandatory recall of 500,000 Volkswagen and Audi vehicles. The affected cars are from model years 2009 through 2015. Volkswagen was caught building a so-called “defeat device” into its consumer diesel vehicles including the Jetta, Beetle, Passat, and Audi A3. The software works so that when the vehicle isn’t being tested, it will produce much more pollution.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T04:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:11:56.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
