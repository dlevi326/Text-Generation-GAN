Did Jesus ever exist ?\n2.) Did Jesus perform the miracles that he was claimed to perform ?\n3.) Was Jesus mentally ill ?\n4.) What of the \"lost years\" of Jesus, where exactly did he get to and why ?\nI will deal with item 3 above although it has some bearing on 2 and 4.\n\"In short, the nature of the hallucinations of Jesus, as they are described in the orthodox Gospels, permits us to conclude that the founder of the Christian religion was afflicted with religious paranoia.\" (Charles Binet-Sanglé, La Folie de Jésus, The Madness of Jesus, 1910, p 393)\nJesus has been said to have been psychotic at times, he was paranoid schizophrenic (paraphrenic), so preaching end days would have been quite in line with his mental illness. This explains why he taught all to give away their worldly goods and to turn their backs on their family because he believed that he was in end times so these chattels would be of no use in heaven. This is a classic paranoid delusion.\nHis preoccupation with end times, the rapture etc were all due to his paranoid delusions. His illness is understandable today and has been found to occur in about 1% of the population.\nHad Jesus lived today he would have been readily treated, he would have stayed a carpenter and most likely \"Christianity\" as we know it would not have existed in it's present form at least.\nThis also explains why Jesus saw demons and attempted exorcism because the thought he was on a mission by a higher power in order to change the world, but alas these were all symptoms of the illness.\nAn example of this was \"Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac\" while trying to cast out \"Legion\".\n\"Everything that we know about him [Jesus] conforms so perfectly to the clinical picture of paranoia that it is hardly conceivable that people can even question the accuracy of the diagnosis.\"(American psychiatrist William Hirsch, Conclusions of a Psychiatrist, 1912, p 99)\nA team of psychiatrists have examined how Jesus behaved in the bible and their conclusion was he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia (paraphrenic).\nSept. 2012: The Role of Psychotic Disorders in Religious History Considered, Evan D. Murray, M.D. Miles G. Cunningham, M.D., Ph.D. Bruce H. Price, M.D., The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences 2012; 24:410-426)\nBy this time you may be wondering how did I connect the dot's to item 4.\nIt is though that Jesus was taken to India in an attempt to cure him of his demons, thus explaining the lost years and why Gandi liked Jesus's teachings (but not the Christians) because, in it he recognised teachings similar to his own.\nRefer to en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_years_of_Jesus\nThe Rev Eva McIntyre on behalf of the Church’s Archbishops’ Council has raised Jesus's mental health issue in an article and it says \"It even asks followers to consider accusations made in the New Testament that Jesus \"had lost his mind.\"\nReferences:\nwww.express.co.uk/news/uk/341926/Jesus-Christ-may-have-suffered-from-mental-health-problems-claims-Church-of-England\nkoenraadelst.bharatvani.org/books/pp/ch3.htm\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_delusion\nthepracticalpsychosomaticist.com/2013/01/14/have-you-been-hearing-gods-voice/", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:05:37.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
