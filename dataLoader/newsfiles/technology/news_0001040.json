Accenture was tapped last year to help fix the embattled HealthCare.gov website, and last December the company said it won a five-year $563 million contract to continue its work on the federal insurance site.\nMeanwhile, Accenture's digital revenues have surged and the company has moved to boost its cloud services. Earlier this month, the company agreed to buy cloud-computing consultancy Cloud Sherpas, which provides services to companies such as Google Inc. and Salesforce.com Inc.\nIn the latest quarter, the consulting unit's revenue grew 14% excluding currency impacts, while outsourcing revenue jumped 9% in the local currency.\nOverall, Accenture reported fourth-quarter earnings of $737.6 million, up from $701 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, which includes profit from some noncontrolling interests, earnings rose to $1.15 a share from $1.08 a share.\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters had projected earnings of $1.12 a share.\nNet revenue, or revenues before reimbursements, ticked up 1.4% to $7.89 billion. But excluding currency impacts, revenue would have grown 12%.\nAccenture had forecast net revenue to be between $7.45 billion and $7.70 billion.\nFor the year ending next August, Accenture said it expects earnings of $5.09 to $5.24 a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast $5.22 a share in earnings.\nThe company forecast revenue growth of 5% to 8%, excluding the impact of foreign currency, which would represent a slowdown from the 11% growth in its 2015 fiscal year.\nFor its current quarter, Accenture said it expects revenue of $7.7 billion to $7.95 billion, including a negative 8.5% impact from foreign exchange. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast $8.1 billion in revenue.\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at chelsey.dulaney@wsj.com\n 24, 2015 08:05 ET (12:05 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T15:58:45.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
