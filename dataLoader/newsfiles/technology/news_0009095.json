People returned to their homes on the coast after a tsunami alert was lifted -- only for a killer wave to strike in the following hours, claiming more than 100 lives. \nChilean courts are still trying to determine responsibility for the fiasco. \n\"The 2010 quake, which directly affected 70 percent of the population, triggered an awareness that would not otherwise have come about,\" said Sergio Barrientos of the Chilean national seismology center. \nThis week's quake was the most powerful recorded anywhere in the world this year, and the sixth strongest in the history of geologically volatile Chile. \nBut this time, within minutes of the quake, the navy launched a tsunami alert covering the entire country, triggering the evacuation of a million people, who have since gradually been returning home. \n\"The evacuation of one million people ensured that there was no repetition of the loss of life which happened five years ago,\" Wahlstroem said. \n- Seismic isolation - \nChile lies on what is known as the \"Ring of Fire\" -- an arc of fault lines that circles the Pacific Basin and is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. \nThe country has long put in place antiseismic engineering systems, applying a technique known as seismic isolation, or base isolation to protect buildings from the earth's judders. \n\"Strong quakes are so frequent in Chile that our engineers have designed infrastructure and buildings able to withstand them,\" said Barrientos. \nBack in 2010, those norms already limited damage to 0.3 percent of buildings in Santiago. \nThis week's quake occurred 228 kilometers (about 140 miles) north of the capital, where it set buildings swaying but caused no major damage. \nAcross the country, material damage has largely been limited to lightweight structures of wood or packed earth. \nChilean authorities have yet to put a financial figure on the damage, but it is not expected to come anywhere near the $30 billion -- 18 percent of Chile's GDP -- suffered five years ago. \nThe national emergency service ONEMI has also been leading a big push to educate the population, organizing frequent drills and visiting schools to simulate earthquake situations. \n\"We have learned to live with these phenomena,\" said Barrientos. \"It's part of our daily lives to deal with the possible consequences of earthquakes.\" \nThousands left homeless by giant Chile quake Santiago (AFP) Sept 21, 2015 - More than 9,000 people were left homeless after a powerful earthquake hit northern and central Chile last week, officials said Sunday, dramatically increasing previous estimates. \nThe death toll from the 8.3 magnitude quake that struck on September 16 remained at 13, with four still missing, said Deputy Interior Minister Mahmud Aleuy. \nThe number of people left homeless however jumped drastically from 3,500, as officials scour remote towns in the Coquimbo region, more than 260 kilometers north of Santiago, where the quake epicenter was located. \n\"We hope that by Friday we will have surveyed all of the people who were affected,\" Aleuy said. \nThe offshore earthquake was the sixth strongest in the history of geologically volatile Chile and the most powerful anywhere in the world this year, officials say. \nEmergency personnel backed by soldiers were still busy cleaning up the coastal city of Coquimbo, which was a jumble of fishing boats, destroyed homes, vendors' stands and vehicles washed up by the tsunami waves that followed the quake. \nPublic Works Minister Alberto Undurraga toured the city on Sunday, and said that only 25 percent of the area's cleanup work had been completed. \nThe tsunami crashed ashore just minutes after about one million people were evacuated from the shoreline following the quake. \nThe human toll was far lower than in February 2010, when an 8.8-magnitude quake and tsunami left 500 people dead. \nChilean authorities have yet to put a financial figure on the damage, but it is not expected to come anywhere near the $30 billion -- 18 percent of Chile's GDP -- suffered five years ago. \nThe national emergency service ONEMI reported Sunday that 647 homes were destroyed, 1,183 families were without power and 2,400 were without drinking water. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T11:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T06:57:56.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
