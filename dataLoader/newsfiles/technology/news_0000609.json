That gap will drop to less than $8 per hour by the end of the new four-year agreement.\nFiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne has said he believes in \"wealth distribution,\" and the pact would offer the lower-paid \"second tier\" workers the chance to make more in profit-sharing bonuses than more senior \"first-tier\" workers. About 45 percent of Fiat Chrysler's 36,600 hourly workers are second-tier.\nThe company has another 3,400 salaried UAW-represented employees who are affected by some aspects of the proposed pact, a company spokeswoman said.\nVeteran workers will get 3 percent raises immediately and in September 2017, and $2,500 lump sum payments in 2016 and 2018. By not giving per-hour base pay hikes in two of the four years in the contract, Fiat Chrysler saves because the rates are not compounded.\nSecond-tier workers could also get bigger profit sharing bonuses than veteran UAW members if the company achieves at least an 8 percent North American annual profit margin. In its most recent quarter, Fiat Chrysler's North American profit was 7.7 percent, which pales next to Ford Motor Co's ( F.N ) 11.1 percent margin and the 10.5 percent earned recently by General Motors Co ( GM.N ).\nA veteran Fiat Chrysler worker can make an extra $7,200 if the company achieves a 9 percent profit margin, while a second-tier worker would get $9,200.\nBy September 2017, hourly pay for top-tier workers would be $29.76, up from $28.05. Starting pay for newer second-tier workers at ratification would rise to $17 from $15.78 currently. By 2018 the starting pay for second tier workers would rise to $22 per hour. Top pay for a worker with six to seven years seniority would be $25.35 per hour by 2018.\n(Reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Tom Brown )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T00:31:21.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
