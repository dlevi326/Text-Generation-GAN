The report claimed one human resources policy Quote: : “We must focus on a solution which will be acceptable to staff which will obviously be less than [the current estimate].”\n“I always thought that UCL opening a campus in Doha was strange given Qatar’s appalling record on equality and diversity and workers’ rights. The only excuse could be that UCL would behave as an exemplary employer,\" one anonymous academic was Quote: d as saying. “Now it seems that UCL staff based in Doha have been remunerated differently depending on their gender.”\nHowever, a UCL spokesperson told Arabian Business in a statement that the policy had been adjusted and backdated payments had been made to female staff to correct the difference.\nThe spokesperson clarified that this means female staff are now paid the same as male staff as standard policy.\nThe statement said: “There was never any deliberate intention on UCL’s part to apply a discriminatory policy to its staff in Qatar, and there is nothing in any of the papers relevant to this case to suggest that that was the case.\n“Our presence in Qatar required complex negotiation and unfortunately this issue was not picked up at the time. Clearly, this was never intended as an intentional policy and as soon as the anomaly came to light we took steps to rectify it.\n“The policy change was backdated so that staff were not disadvantaged [and] the papers released indicated UCL leadership dealt with the issue as soon as it was brought to their attention.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:41:44.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
