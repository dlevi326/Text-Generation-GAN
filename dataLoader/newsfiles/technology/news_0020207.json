Four more machines will be added by the end of the year. \nEquipped with a high-resolution camera and super-sensitive microphone, the drones will record audio-visual data and capture still photographs of specific locations. \nKhalil Odeh Shalan, vice president of operation and facilities at DSO, said “the new system will not compromise the privacy of residential or commercial properties at DSO”.\n“The use of this new technology will significantly enhance the security team’s response time and help us monitor the premises with ease,” Mr Shalan said. \nThe drones are part of a smart security surveillance programme and are being introduced in collaboration with Dubai Civil Aviation Authority.\nDrone operators will be equipped with a radio system that permits text exchanges, calls and location of handsets via GPS while ensuring confidential communication. \n“The use of drones and the related air support they provide can be a distinct advantage in protecting the public from threats and in successfully helping to identify and prevent crime,” said Khalid Al Arif, director of DCAA’s standards and regulations department.\n“Civil safety and security is of utmost importance to us.”\nThe aviation authority said it hoped other organisations came forward with innovative security proposals.\n\nnewsdesk@thenational.ae", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T02:32:00.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
