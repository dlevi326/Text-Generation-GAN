By that point, the body of the steenbok was already surrounded by the snake and she had started to constrict her prey,” he said.\n“It was quite thrilling, how long the steenbok could still breathe before it passed away and its tongue rolled out.”\nMr Barfuss said the battle to kill its prey had worn the snake out and it was forced to retreat before returning to indulge on its dinner.\n“The snake was too exhausted and disappeared for a while. After more than 24 hours, the python came back out and gave it another go,” he said.\n“It took almost four hours to get the whole carrion in the body.\n“It was amazing to see the hard work and it looked very painful.”\nThe antelope put up a noble fight, but in the end it was killed.
