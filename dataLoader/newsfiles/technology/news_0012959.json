But new techniques have allowed researchers to confirm it. \nJim Green, Director of Planetary Science at NASA said during a press conference on Monday that “under certain circumstances, liquid water has been found on Mars”. \"Under certain circumstances, liquid water has been found on Mars\" - Jim Green, NASA Planetary Science Director https://t.co/MvErxberG3 — NASA (@NASA) September 28, 2015 \nSince water is essential for life, the latest discovery increases the possibility of finding life on Mars, NASA said. \n“Our rover’s finding a lot more humidity in the air than we ever imagined. As we inject the soils, they’re most, they’re hydrated, full of water,” he said at a press conference. \n“These discoveries are very important, but only part of the hydrological cycle on Mars that we are just now beginning to understand. What we are going to announce today is Mars is not the dry planet that we thought of in the past. \n“Today we are going to announce that that under certain circumstances liquid water has been found on Mars.” Mountain flow ... A NASA image shows dark, narrow, 100-metre-long streaks called recurring slope lineae flowing downhill on Mars, believed to have been formed by flowing water. Picture: AFP Source: AFP \nAlfred McEwen, principal investigator for the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) at the University of Arizona in Tucson, told the press conference that he thinks the chances of microbial life on Mars is very high. \nThe findings are published in the journal Nature Geoscience and are being discussed at a Nasa press conference at James Webb Auditorium in Nasa Headquarters, Washington. \nMonday’s announcement confirmed earlier reports by scientists about the RSL, with NASA saying the flowing streams of salty water flow down certain Martian slopes each summer. Evidence ... Image of the streaks on the surface of Mars. Source: Twitter Source: Twitter \nThese dark, narrow streaks tend to appear and grow during the warmest Martian months, and fade the rest of the year. Salt lowers the freezing point of water, and scientists say that would explain these seasonal briny flows. \nSimilar streaks to those being seen on Mars can be found in Antarctica. \nMary Beth Wilhelm of NASA’s Ames Research Centre in Moffett Field, California said these RSLs have been found in many locations. \n“These vital perchlorates have been found at many of the landing sites on Mars. They may be more widespread than first thought,” she said. Miss today's #MarsAnnouncement ? Here's the highlights on evidence that liquid water flows on present-day Mars: https://t.co/sFKSJo7VqD — NASA (@NASA) September 28, 2015 \nJohn Grunsfield, Associate Administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said the discovery could prove significant ahead of future manned missions to the planet that will “explore the question of whether there’s current life on Mars”. \nThere are three unmanned spacecraft planned to go to Mars in the coming three years, at least one of which — the European Space Agency’s ExoMars rover — will drill into the surface to look for evidence of life. \nIce was already known to exist on the Red Planet but the possibility of flowing water was first suggested in 2011 by a 21-year-old American PhD student, Lujendra Ojha. Chance find ... A PhD student first discovered irregular streaks appearing and disappearing on the surface of Mars in 2011. Picture: AFP/NASA Source: AFP \nAccording to a CNN report , Mr Ojha was studying at the University of Arizona when he used a computer algorithm to remove visual distortions from images of Mars obtained by satellite. \nWhile Mr Ojha was comparing changes to the planet over time, he accidentally discovered irregular streaks appearing and disappearing on the surface of Mars. Exciting discovery ... dark narrow streaks called recurring slope lineae emanate from the walls of Garni crater on Mars. Picture: AFP/NASA/JPL/University of Arizona Source: AFP \nAfter months of research, Mr Ojha concluded the streaks were likely dried salts left by salt water running on the surface of Mars during the warmer months. \nThe researchers say further exploration is warranted to determine whether any microscopic life might exist at modern-day Mars. They based their findings on data from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling Mars since 2006. \nNASA’s announcement prompted a flurry of excitement on social media. Water on Mars! The best evidence so far that (briny) water is indeed on Mars! This is so cool. #MarsAnnouncement https://t.co/RyrzwlxpuN — Shannon Morse (@Snubs) September 28, 2015 Liquid water on Mars makes future manned missions to the planet even more exciting and imperative than ever before #MarsAnnouncement  — Austin Suhr (@austinsuhr) September 28, 2015 \nSome Twitter users determined to see the funny side.
