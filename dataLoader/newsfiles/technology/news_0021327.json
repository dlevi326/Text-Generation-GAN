ThinkGeek\nBeing a \"Star Wars\" fan means more than collecting Wampa-sized piles of toys and action figures.\nFor some of us grown-up fans, it means revealing our appreciation for a galaxy far, far away through our choice of home decor and kitchenware.\nIt can, however, be rather embarrassing wandering the kids' section for bedding and kitchen gadgets in hopes of finding the coolest \"Star Wars\" pillow or cookie cutters. Luckily, ThinkGeek has our nerdy needs in mind with its latest \"Star Wars\" items for Force Friday -- a daylong marketing push where Lucasfilm and Disney licensees release information on a barrage of new \"Star Wars\" products.\nStar Wars Rebel friends cookie cutters: Make Chibi versions of your favorite intergalactic heroes with these Star Wars Rebel friends cookie cutters . Adorable designs of Luke, Leia, Yoda, Chewie, C-3PO and R2-D2 will make your delicious treats even more delightful.

The BB-8 pillow measures 15 inches (38 centimeters) tall by 11.5 inches (29 centimeters) wide by 4.25 inches (11 centimeters) deep, and retails for $20 (which converts to about £13 or AU$29).\nWhen you invite this R2-D2 to lunch, he brings his own gear.
