The software’s GUI precisely mirrors the layout of Pioneer DJ controllers, to give DJs instinctive, effortless control of rekordbox dj’s features. The software is packed with all the usual performance tools – Hot Cues, Sampler, Slicer, Sound Color FX, Beat FX – plus Beat Jump and the industry’s first Pad FX. \nAlso introduced today are the DDJ-RZ and DDJ-RX controllers – the first hardware to deliver native control of the new rekordbox dj performance software. The controllers give rekordbox DJs the ultimate flexibility and convenience to prepare their tracks in rekordbox and then get plug-and-play performance with the software, direct from their laptop. The DDJ-RZ and DDJ-RX mirror the layout of the software precisely to enable intuitive creative performances. Low latency jog wheels with On Jog Display, multi-colored Performance Pads and a four-channel mixer deliver highly responsive, tactile control. New to these controllers are the beat parameter buttons, Sampler Cue mode, and the Sequencer mode – which lets DJs record and loop sample sequences on the fly. Plus, improved MIC channels deliver a high-quality sound. \nThe flagship DDJ-RZ takes the creative possibilities even further, sharing all the features of the DDJ-RX, plus a club-quality magnetic crossfader and large jog wheels inherited from the flagship CDJ-2000NXS. The OSC Sampler gives DJs the freedom to trigger and manipulate pre-set oscillator samples – or load their own in rekordbox dj. Two USB sound cards and ports with a top-loaded input switcher enable smooth DJ transitions. \nStarting on October 1, 2015, rekordbox 4.0 will be available as a free download on rekordbox.com and will remain as a music management software for compatible Pioneer DJ products. The rekordbox dj Plus Pack will be available for a 30-day free trial or purchase within the rekordbox 4.0 software for $129.00. \nThe DDJ-RZ will be available in late October 2015 with a retail price of $1999.00 and the DDJ-RX will be available in late November 2015 with a retail price of $999.00. Both controllers come bundled with the rekordbox dj Plus Pack (a $129.00 value). \nWatch the rekordbox dj walkthrough video.
