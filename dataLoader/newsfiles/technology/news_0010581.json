Of the 75 on HRT 53 died, compared with 68 who did not take it.\nPast studies found HRT raised the risk of causing some cancers.\nBut Prof Ros Eeles, of The Institute of Cancer Research, says in the Journal of Clinical Oncology: “Our results not only suggest HRT is safe for women with ovarian cancer but that it may actually improve their chances of long-term survival.”\nThe new study, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology was led by researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.\nPA Ovarian cancer: Scientists have made a breakthrough in long running research\nIt is the largest ever piece of research to investigate HRT's effects on ovarian cancer survival.\nAround 7,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the UK each year.\nSet up in 1990, the trial followed 150 women with ovarian cancer - half of whom were allocated to receive HRT during their treatment, and half of whom were not - and compared overall survival at a point in 2012.\nWomen were recruited from 19 different hospitals across the UK, Spain and Hungary.\nThe study suggests women with ovarian cancer can receive the known benefits of HRT on the side-effects of the menopause, without it reducing their survival chances.\nIn fact, the results indicate that HRT might improve chances for overall survival.\nHRT: It could help the survival chances of women with ovarian cancer\nFiona Osgun, health information officer at Cancer Research UK , said: \"Years of research has shown that women taking HRT are at an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, as well as endometrial cancer for some forms of HRT.\n\"This research takes a different approach and looks at women already diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\n\"These results are a great first step in helping to understand if HRT is safe to take for women with ovarian cancer, but we need larger studies with more women to confirm them.\n\"HRT has been shown to be effective at reducing symptoms of the menopause and there are many factors that play into a woman's decision to use it or not.\n\"If you are thinking of stopping or starting HRT speak to your GP.\"\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/andrewgregory", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-09-29T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T05:23:11.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
