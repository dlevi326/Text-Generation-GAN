Advanced safety systems such as adaptive cruise control, that are partially automated but relieve some of the tedium of driving, are therefore more attractive, he said. \nBecause many advanced driver assistance features are still so expensive, their adoption in the United States continues to grow slowly, at an annual rate of 2 percent to 5 percent, Boston Consulting said. \n\"Motivation is obviously needed\" to boost those rates, which in turn could dramatically reduce costs, Handschuh said. \nWithout such motivation, from lower insurance rates to new government regulations, it will take 20 to 25 years for widespread adoption, he said. \nBoston Consulting said automated driver assistance systems could help U.S. drivers avert 28 percent of vehicle crashes and save 9,900 lives each year. \nSuppliers of advanced driver assistance systems include Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL], Autoliv Inc, Continental AG, Delphi Automotive PLC, Valeo SA and Denso Corp. \n(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn) \nOur top photos from the last 24 hours.
