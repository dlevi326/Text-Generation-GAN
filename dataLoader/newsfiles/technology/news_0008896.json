But a court last month awarded Savchuk symbolic damages of one ruble in recognition of the legal claims she made. \n\"We achieved that the existence of the troll factory was recognized, and ascertained that they are producing paid comments,\" she said in an interview by email. \nRelated: Russia bans more foreign food \nBased in St. Petersburg, the agency was staffed predominately by young people, many of whom were unable to find jobs elsewhere, Savchuk said. \nThey were given targets such as President Obama, Europe or Ukraine, and ordered to celebrate two characters: Putin and his defense minister Sergey Shoygu. \n\"Most of them do the work unconsciously and write what they're dictated,\" she said, \"If tomorrow they're told to praise Obama and hate Putin, they will do so.\" \nThe trolls were paid between 40,000 and 50,000 rubles (about $750) per month. Savchuk said she donated her pay to charity. \nHer work for the agency appeared on LiveJournal , a blog hosting platform particularly popular in Russia. \nThe trolls sometimes created entirely fictional accounts, for example devising a blog for a fortune teller who gave \"veiled political theses\" in between mystical pronouncements. \nRumors of state-sponsored trolling have long swirled in Russia , and intensified after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Speculation mounted that organized trolls were attempting to skew discussion about the conflict in Moscow's favor through social media posts and comments on Western media websites. \nUkraine fought back. The country created special information forces and launched a website for volunteers to combat propaganda spreading from Russia. Enlisted \"soldiers\" would receive emails with tasks such as monitoring social media and taking on trolls by promoting Ukraine's messages in online discussions. \n- Olga Pavlova in Moscow contributed to this report CNNMoney (London) September 3, 2015: 8:11 AM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T16:04:11.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
