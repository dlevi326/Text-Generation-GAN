Broadband has the potential to boost economic growth and a stat oft cited from the World Bank is that the economy will gain 1 percent for every 10 increase in broadband. \nBMI-Techknowledge telecoms specialist Tim Parle painted a picture of the low levels of connectivity and speed South Africans enjoy. \nHe notes South Africa has a population of 54 million people, based on Statistics SA’s latest numbers, but only 11 percent of the 15.6 million South African homes access Internet at home on a device other than a phone. \nBy comparison, Parle notes, 32.6 million South Africans older than 16 have cellphones, a figure that is evenly split between feature phones and smartphones. In addition, SA’s broadband speeds are lacking when compared to developed nations, he says. \nBMI-T MD Denis Smit notes there has been progress with SA Connect, but progress was held up when president Jacob Zuma shuffled the Cabinet last May. He adds the market was also caught by surprise when Zuma announced Telkom would be the lead agency for the national broadband network during Zuma’s February State of the Agency Address. \nTelkom’s role, says Smit, has yet to be clarified because no-one knows whether it will handle the whole project, or outsource parts. \nSmit notes the first phase of SA Connect has not been completed as yet, and phase two is due to start in 2016. However, as the first phase has not been completed, it is not clear whether further funding will be forthcoming. \nThe first phase has a budget of R28.5 million according to Treasury’s latest budget figures. So far, an additional R770 has been earmarked for the project. \nSmit says this is not enough, pointing out the private sector will spend about R20 billion in one year on broadband. He adds there is little in the form of “new funds” available to government because the fiscus is under pressure and belts are being tightened. \nThere has been clear progress in some areas, but progress is poor overall, says Smit. He says the next 6 to 12 months will be a tipping point. \nTersia Smit, a public sector and telecoms analyst at BMI-T, points out government will spend around R15 billion on ICT in the 2017/18 financial year, but the bulk of this will go into aspects such as computer equipment. She says, as this spending is on internal systems, it is not clear where the money will come from the the broadband plan. \nMedia reports have previously pegged the amount to be spent at around R98 billion. \nTersia Smit also notes there is a lack of clarity around which money is being spent on what ICT projects. “There is no one view, it’s very difficult to see what government is doing. It’s all over the place.” \nIOL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T14:08:25.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
