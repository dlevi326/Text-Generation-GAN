The platform includes full support for iBeacon™, Eddystone™ by Google, and Signal360’s patented inaudible technology, that is able to reach phones even with Bluetooth disabled. Content is delivered using the izit mobile application, available on both iOS and Android. Izit, which uses proprietary geo-location technology, can systematically identify when an end user is in a particular location. izit technology consists of an application (app) that once installed on a smartphone (iPhone or Android) enables stores and their brands to send personalized messages (Whispers™) to users based on their location via Signal360 beacons. With this innovation, it is possible to send promotions to users exactly at or near their point of purchase, greatly increasing the conversion value of the promotion and at the same time enhancing the shopping experience.\nTwo recently released metrics by izit and Signal360 reveal the power of proximity engagement. Key indicators include: MCR (Mobile Click-through Rate) and PAR (Promotion Acceptance Rate). While click-through rates are commonly used in the on-line and mobile space, PAR is a new metric that measures the acceptance rate of a promotion in-app. Specifically, that a user receives the promotion, views the offer, clicks to view, and accepts the offer. The izit channel has achieved an average click-through rate of over 36% and promotion acceptance rates of nearly 15%, rates considerably higher than other digital marketing channels available today.\nIzit’s footprint is made up of three primary verticals, QSR, Fashion and Transportation, and they are expanding their footprint rapidly to supermarkets, among other verticals. Many national brands are taking advantage of the results that the izit and Signal360 offering represents. Unimarc is an early adopter and proponent of the platform in the supermarket space. In the QSR space, all McDonald’s restaurants in Chile, Dunkin Donuts, Hard Rock Cafe, and Yum! Brands chain locations, like KFC, have seen powerful results. In all, there are currently 390 major brands participating in the platform, including UBER, Guess,TopShop, Forever 21, Steve Madden, Heineken, Virgin Airlines, Sky Airlines and Lotus (events promoter of Lollapalooza). Combined mobile engagement from all of these brands via the izit app account for over 12.5 million Whispers™ to date.\nAccording to Marcos Almendras, CEO of izit, “Mobile based contextual marketing provides the opportunity for brands engage their customers at the actual point where the purchase decision is being made. Our partnership with Signal360 allows us to offer the most robust platform available. We are excited about the results we are able to deliver for brands and look forward to massive expansion using this technology.” Lev Raslin, Senior Director of Business Development at Signal360 feels similarly, “izit is a best in class partner to work with. The combined offering, and the metrics we are seeing from the platform simply add analytics to the results we knew were being delivered for the brands that we are proud to work with.”\nAbout izit\nThe izit app was launched in Santiago, Chile in July of 2013 and now has over 450,000 downloads and more than 75,000 fans on Facebook and 6,800 followers on Twitter. Whispers™ have been distributed on behalf of more than 390 brands in Chile with leading malls and retailers such as Cencosud, Vivo, Mall Plaza, Paris, Falabella, Ripley, Unimarc, Pronto, McDonald’s, Hoyts Cinema, Rosen, and many others. izit is expanding its coverage every day and is now available in malls and shops throughout Chile with the goal of expanding internationally to the US and other Latin American countries.For more information, visit http://www.izitapp.com\nAbout Signal360\nSignal360 is the leading turnkey in-venue mobile notification platform for real-time proximity informed user engagement.
