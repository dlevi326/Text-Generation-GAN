Total wealth is US$2.34 trillion, up from US$2.29 trillion in 2014. \nEntering the top 10 this year were three founders of e-businesses. \nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos bolted from 15th to fourth place at US$47 billion, thanks to the surging value of Amazon stock. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who jumped from 11th to seventh place, had net worth of US$40.3 billion. And Larry Page, CEO of Google, moved from number 13 in 2014 to land the 10th spot, with US$33.3 billion. \nThe business magazine also spotlighted Republican presidential contender Donald Trump, who has claimed wealth of at least US$10 billion. \nForbes came up with a lower figure, rating the billionaire in 121st place. \n\"After interviewing more than 80 sources and devoting unprecedented resources to valuing a single fortune, we're going with a figure less than half that - US$4.5 billion, albeit still the highest figure we've ever had for him,\" Forbes said. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:57:53.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
