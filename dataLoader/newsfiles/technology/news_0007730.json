Wednesday, September 16, 2015 5:15PM IST (11:45AM GMT) InsideView Debuts New Market Intelligence Solution for Salesforce with Updated Experience Designed to Mirror Sales Workflow Introduces InsideView Refresh, a New Data Cleansing and Management Solution for Salesforce Customers Hyderabad, India and San Francisco, United States \nInsideView powers the world’s business conversations. Today the company unveiled a major update to its InsideView for Sales solution and introduced InsideView Refresh, a new data cleansing and management solution. InsideView for Sales now provides a new adaptive, task-oriented user experience uniquely designed around the most common sales workflows and inspired by modern app interfaces to drive productivity. InsideView for Sales now makes it easier than ever for Salesforce customers to find, engage with, and win deals based on accurate and complete prospect data, business insights and social connections. InsideView is also introducing a charter customer program for InsideView Refresh, a new solution for Salesforce customers that continually cleans and maintains Salesforce CRM records with InsideView data. Both products will initially be available exclusively for Salesforce customers. “Working with Salesforce and its customers over the past 10-plus years has taught us how sellers work best,” said Jenny Cheng, InsideView’s Chief Product Officer. Cheng spent nine years in product leadership positions at Salesforce, leading product teams through the company’s IPO and subsequent aggressive growth. “We’ve redesigned InsideView for Sales to fit right into the typical sales workflow. Salesforce users can tap into InsideView’s market intelligence within the Lightning experience to drive better business conversations with customers, prospects, and partners.” A New User Experience in InsideView for Sales InsideView for Sales is InsideView’s flagship market intelligence product for sales professionals. It is used by more than 500,000 people across more than 20,000 customers worldwide and continues to be ranked as a market leader by G2 Crowd. The product’s new adaptive, task-oriented user experience makes it even easier for Salesforce users to capitalize on InsideView’s industry-leading market intelligence. The new InsideView Sales experience brings data to life with better data visualization and icon-based, sidebar navigation consistent with the Salesforce Lightning experience, the significant redesign of Salesforce’s CRM product. The InsideView for Sales experience closely mirrors sales workflows, so sellers can more easily find the right information at the right moment in the sales process. That means users can find company information and contacts they need when they need it. App-inspired navigation mimics sales actions as users move through the process of: Finding and connecting with contacts Engaging with customers Closing and expanding accounts InsideView for Sales works seamlessly across all devices and screens, with app-inspired icons and buttons that feel at home on any display or device. It is also integrated with Salesforce1 allowing users to move seamlessly between the Salesforce1 and InsideView mobile apps. Sellers can research companies and contacts, view account information, and access timely company or market updates data while on the go. InsideView Refresh InsideView Refresh is a new data cleansing and management solution available now in a charter program for Salesforce customers. InsideView Refresh automatically cleans and updates Salesforce CRM records with InsideView data based on the customer’s business rules and desired frequency. InsideView Refresh was designed to address the CRM data quality challenges faced by most Salesforce customers, with the ultimate goal of improving the effectiveness of their sales and marketing efforts. Data cleansing and management requirements are increasingly nuanced and a one-size-fits-all approach is insufficient. InsideView Refresh gives customers more flexibility and control to address these nuances, including rules-based controls that precisely define management at the record and field-level. InsideView for Sales customers will enjoy an even stronger solution when combined with Refresh, as this new solution automatically leverages InsideView for Sales user activity to increase data accuracy. InsideView Refresh automates data across sales and marketing systems. Accurate and consistent customer data drives better response rates, more qualified leads, and increased win rates. InsideView Refresh is available on a limited basis today to charter customers and slated for general release in the first quarter of 2016. InsideView and Salesforce InsideView was the original market intelligence provider for Salesforce, and in 2007, InsideView was one of the few invited by Salesforce to be among the original AppExchange Incubator Partners—a group tapped to help Salesforce expand the best practices and experience of the on-demand community. “Salesforce forever changed how B2B software is delivered,” added Cheng. “For years, InsideView has delivered market intelligence into the Salesforce platform so Salesforce customers can have high-value business conversations that greatly increase their odds of success.
