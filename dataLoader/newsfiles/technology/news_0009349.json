More Instagram monthly active users hit 400m \nIt comes after Snapdeal, Flipkart’s bitter domestic rival, announced last month it had raised $500m in financing from Japan’s SoftBank, Foxconn of Taiwan, and China’s Alibaba, valuing the company at about $5bn. \nFlipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon are battling for supremacy of India’s ecommerce industry. Paytm , the mobile payments group which received $500m in funding from Alibaba earlier this year, has also joined the competition. It launched an online marketplace last year, providing a platform for business to sell products to customers online. \nHowever, some are unconvinced the country’s ecommerce group’s merit their lofty valuations. UBS researchers said in April that valuations for Indian ecommerce companies were “quite rich.” \nFlipkart announced earlier this week it had hired Dan Rawson, the former head of fulfilment for Amazon in North America, to manage its logistics and supply chain, one of the biggest challenges in a country with poor logistics networks. \nRetail industry analysts estimate that Indians will be buying more than $30bn worth of merchandise over the internet every year by 2020. \nFlipkart, which says it has about 50m individual customers, is turning its focus to smaller cities in which it has struggled to extend its reach. \nAnkit Nagori, Flipkart’s chief business officer, said about 60-70 per cent of Flipkart’s orders come from India’s 10 to 15 biggest cities. But the company sees a huge market opportunity in the next 20 cities, where residents often have a very narrow selection of goods available through local brick-and-mortar retailers. \nHowever, Mr Nagori says these potential customers — most of whom access the internet on their smartphones — must be wooed with special, highly regionalised marketing to introduce them to online shopping. \n“It the right time to join these customers from smaller towns to help them understand why people buy online,” he said. “A lot of these people don’t know the products they’ve been looking for forever are available on one tap of the screen. The moment they have access to the inventory they will start buying.” \nIn its bid to deepen its penetration of the Indian market and move beyond the national English-speaking elites, Flipkart plans to run vernacular language advertisements using local celebrities. \n“Most of our campaigns have been very national in nature where we were talking to a similar kind of customer,” he said. “But now we are taking a very regional route.” \nFlipkart is launching a three-month hyper-local marketing campaign to promote the site among these potential customers, relying on outdoor billboards, advertisements in vernacular language websites, and events with company executives speaking about ecommerce. \nThe company’s new initiative comes as ecommerce groups are gearing up for fierce competition over the upcoming Diwali festival season. The three-month peak of the Indian shopping season accounts for about 40 per cent of annual spending on clothes and consumer durables. \nLast year, Diwali proved a major headache for Indian ecommerce players, as the country’s creaky logistics network proved unable to cope with the sudden surge in order volumes, resulting in long waiting periods for delivery.
