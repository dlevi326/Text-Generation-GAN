In order to easily handle growing vessel sizes and heavy industrial goods right from the beginning, Port Bronka ordered the giant model of Liebherr’s mobile harbour crane product range: the LHM 800. \nRead a Technical Paper on the vision behind Port Bronka from CEO of Port Bronka Dmitry Mikhalchenko \nDesigned for handling of oversised and heavy lift cargo, the first LHM 800 is equipped with a special reinforced 64 metre boom with a total weight of 63 tonnes. \nTwo winches and a four-rope configuration provide a maximum lifting capacity of 308 tonnes. This exceeds the maximum capacity of the so far strongest mobile harbour crane, type LHM 600, by 100 tonnes. \nRead a Technical Paper from Liebherr which covers the LHM 800 \nAccording to Liebherr, the cranes total weight of 820 tonnes is evenly spread to the ground thanks to four double supporting pads with a total area of more than 100 square metres. In driving mode 36 axel sets with altogether 144 wheels provide a “remarkable” mobility for a crane of this size. \nIn addition to single lifts, the new LHM 800 is also designed for tandem lifts. With Liebherr’s tandem operation tool Sycratronic activated, synchronised movement is guaranteed, and one crane driver can simultaneously operate both cranes for improved speed, capacity and safety. \nIn tandem operation with a second LHM 800, the maximum lifting capacity rises to 616 tonnes. \nAfter eight months of production, the LHM 800 was shipped fully assembled by the open deck vessel MV Papenburg. To ensure roll-on roll-off, the specialised vessel needed to get an elaborate steel and wood enlargement by three metres to a total width of 18 metres. \nBy the help of a specifically designed ramp, it took the giant crane only one hour to drive onto the open-deck vessel. After one and a half days of on-board stowage, the MV Papenburg started its three-day-long journey to the 1,300 kilometres distant Port Bronka.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T16:30:02.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
