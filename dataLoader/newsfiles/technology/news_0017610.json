The London Fraud Forum’s ninth annual event , at One Great George Street, Westminster, brings together counter-fraud specialists from financial institutions, companies, local authorities, law enforcement, government organisations, accountancy practices and law firms to share information and experiences, and combine efforts to fight fraud.\nLondon (PRWEB UK) 29 September 2015\nAccording to figures released in BDO’s latest Fraudtrack report, the total value of reported fraud across the UK between December 2014 and May 2015 was £798m - an increase of nearly £80m on the same period last year. The average cost per fraud was £3.27m, almost double the £1.82m of 12 months ago.\nAlthough fraud continues to be big business, the London Fraud Forum chairman Rob Brooker points to the number of initiatives being undertaken by the industry to change perceptions and attitudes towards fraud and its enablers. He emphasises the importance of co-operation: “the common denominator that remains constant throughout the fight against fraud is the need for us all in the counter-fraud community to work together to defeat this pervasive threat to the economic well-being of our nation, our people and our companies.”\nDelegates at the conference will hear updates on the latest trends in fraud and financial crime and also in the tools and methods of prevention, detection and investigation. Speakers include representatives of the Cabinet Office, City of London Police, Transparency International and the Information Commissioner’s Office.\nThe keynote speaker at this year’s event is Paul Kimmage, who represented Ireland in cycling at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and completed his first Tour de France in 1986. His 1990 book Rough Ride was the first to draw attention to the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs in cycling. As a journalist he has continued to campaign against doping in the sport, and he was instrumental in exposing Lance Armstrong as a fraud. Paul will tell his story, and explore the relevance of whistleblowing to all types of organisation.\nThe attendance fee for the conference includes a year’s membership of the London Fraud Forum, which also runs workshops and masterclasses for its members throughout the year.\nENDS\nNotes to editor\nThe London Fraud Forum is a not-for-profit organisation which was established in 2006.
