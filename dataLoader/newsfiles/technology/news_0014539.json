The company combines proven Internet marketing strategies that include SEO, digital ads, Web content and social media optimization (SMO) to help businesses increase profits and expand brand awareness. \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150910/265461LOGO \nAccording to Clay Darrohn, Chief Executive Officer of fishbat, \"Social media has become the most important campaign platform for the 2016 presidential election. It has become very obvious that candidates need to utilize social media to stay connected to voters, and doing so will benefit them substantially in the presidential race\". \nBeginning during the 2008 presidential election, social media began skyrocketing to the forefront of popular platforms for candidates. President Barack Obama was one of the first candidates to utilize social media in a campaign. Following in his footsteps, almost all candidates in the upcoming 2016 election have taken to social media as a major platform to reach out to voters. \nIt is much more common in today's society for people who engage in social media to use sites like Facebook and Twitter to stay informed. Although television and newspapers are still important platforms for candidates, social media is taking over. Now more than ever before, presidential candidates are well-aware of the importance of staying connected to voters through sites and apps like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and even Snapchat. \nFacebook is one of the most important social media platforms for candidates mainly because of its extremely large audience (i.e. one billion users). It is also important because almost all age groups use Facebook. Candidates can post almost anything and everything to Facebook - videos, articles, statistics, photos, etc.- that reach a vast array of people. Doing this can attract undecided voters who use Facebook to keep informed. It is also a good way for a candidate to create a following. Facebook has many features that allow users to create groups and/or events. Utilizing these certain features can help candidates stay connected to the following that they have already built. \nTwitter has become increasingly popular for presidential candidates to promote their campaigns as well. Right now, Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton both have over 3 million followers on Twitter. Unlike Facebook, Twitter is a great platform to keep users informed in real time. For example, live-tweeting during debates can help keep people who can't get to a television stay informed. Twitter is also much simpler than Facebook and has a much younger age demographic. It is a great way for candidates to reach younger voters and keep them constantly informed. \nAlthough it is still a brand new platform, Snapchat is also becoming a great way to reach young voters. Snapchat is important because information can be obtained through simple and short videos and/or photos. Similar to Twitter, Snapchat utilizes live-streaming, keeping users updated in real time. Snapchat has become an increasingly important platform for businesses to advertise, and will most likely continue to grow in prevalence for presidential candidates as well. \nfishbat is a full-service online marketing firm and social media agency dedicated to connecting all types of businesses with their target audiences in the most effective and efficient way. Through innovative strategies in social media management, search engine optimization (SEO), branding, web design, reputation management and public relations, fishbat promotes a consistent and professional online voice for all of its clients. \nMedia Contact: Scott Darrohn, fishbat, 855-347-4228, press@fishbat.com \nNews distributed by PR Newswire iReach: https://ireach.prnewswire.com \nSOURCE fishbat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:17:01.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
