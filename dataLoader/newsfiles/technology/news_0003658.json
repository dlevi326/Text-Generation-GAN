The Red Herring editorial team selected the most innovative companies from a pool of hundreds from across the continent. The nominees are evaluated on both quantitative and qualitative criteria, such as financial performance, technological innovation, quality of management, execution of strategy, and integration into their respective industries.\nHurix CEO, Subrat Mohanty said, \"We are happy that our digital innovations for Publishers, Corporations and Institutions have been recognized by such a prestigious forum. This motivates us to build word class products and make a difference to our customers.\"\n\"Entrepreneurship in Asia has reached an inflexion point, and as a result, Red Herring Asia 2015 has shifted into a new phase,\" said Alex Vieux, publisher and CEO of Red Herring. \"A second generation of entrepreneurs with CEO backgrounds is emerging and their execution skills and global ambitions lead to restless growth and amazing journeys. As importantly, we are seeing more companies from countries once absent from innovation circles. Hurix shows great promise and therefore deserves to be among the short-listed companies. Now we're faced with the difficult task of selecting the Top 100 winners of Red Herring Asia. We know that the 2015 crop will reward us for long and continued efforts in scouting disruptive companies in Asia.
