[Click to enlarge image] \nDaihatsu Motor Co Ltd announced Sept 9, 2015, that it has released the \"Cast\" light vehicle on that day. \nThe Cast was developed based on the new Move and designed in response to the needs of customers who put weight on individuality. It comes in three models: SUV (sport-utility vehicle)-type \"Cast Activa\"; \"Cast Style,\" which expresses an upper-grade quality with plated decorations; and \"Cast Sport,\" which gives priority to driving performance. \nThe minimum ground clearance of the Cast Activa, which looks like an SUV, is 180mm, which is 30mm higher than that of the other two models. As a result, it has a high running performance on snowy and mountain roads. \nThe Cast Style features a high-quality appearance because its front and rear bumper moldings and side rocker moldings have plated decorations. The Cast Sport realizes a high stability because Daihatsu optimized the shock absorber and the spring constant of the coil spring. \nFor all of the three models, Daihatsu applied its \"D Wrapping\" technology to the roof, roof side and spoiler. The D Wrapping is used for decorating an auto body by attaching PVC (polyvinyl chloride) resin films to parts instead of painting them. It enables to add patterns looking like a carbon fiber fabric to iron and resin parts having three-dimensional shapes. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:32:00.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
