Photo: Supplied\nSonos Heos Bluesound In 1999 I bought an inner-city terrace and set it up for music in every room. Back then hard-wiring was the only way to do a multi-room installation and it involved a guy crawling around in the ceiling for a couple of days. But at the end of it I had stereo music in every room and five-channel surround in the living room for movies, all operated by a couple of remotes. It cost heaps.\nI sold the house five years later, the new buyers inheriting all the cables and the superb flush-mount speakers in the ceilings. They had no interest in it whatsoever. Broke my heart. Then I forgot about it until I got an email from a guy on the northern NSW coast who bought a house that was set up a lot like my little terrace.\nIt had a hard-wired five-channel system in a media room with stereo to ceiling speakers in the bedroom and lounge, the whole shooting match operated by three remotes.\nAdvertisement \"When the planets aligned we got music from the upstairs speakers,\" he wrote. \"We retired the system on the grounds of incomprehensibility.\"\nHe wanted to know how to get it all operating again as cheaply as possible. \"What about a cheap amplifier for all those people that either have in-built speakers or have some around the house?\" he asked, and noted that he'd seen an amplifier for between $30 and $40 and wondered if it could do the job. He'd looked at a Sonos system but; \"It cost a fortune.\"\n\"Any ideas?\" he asked.\nAfter my hard-wired experience I don't think a Sonos system costs a fortune, but then this guy was talking about a $40 amplifier and while some very simple ones may have cost that in the 1960s, these days the cheapest amps I'd recommend would be entry-level Pioneers or Yamahas for around $400.\nMy inclination would be to dump the idea of getting the existing hard-wired system up and running; it would be too complex, too expensive and too limited. I'd buy a far more flexible Heos or Sonos multi room system and run it through a home Wi-Fi network or a Sonos Bridge. But then I know just enough about hard-wired systems to know that I need to ask advice, so I went to Len Wallis. We turned out to be on the same page.\n\"I must admit that even during my early days in this industry in the 1970s I can't recall an amplifier selling for $40,\" he began.\n\"I think your reader's best option is going down the track of Sonos or Heos. I'm confused when people say they're expensive. In real terms these products cost a fraction of what it took to get a similar result 20 years ago. Back then we were charging $20,000 and more for Audio Access systems, and selling lots of them, and they offered less for the consumer than a current $4000 Sonos system.\n\"And as far as hard-wired systems go we don't even have an offering these days. They no longer make sense to us.\"\nTo get an equivalent result to the hard-wired system my reader would need stereo speakers in his bedroom and living room and a home theatre system in his media room. For a Sonos soundbar in there and a couple of speakers in the other rooms he'd be looking at a starting cost of $2415, or $3514 with a subwoofer, and with Denon's Heos it would be $3615 with a subwoofer. That's provided he already had source units such as a DVD or Blu-ray player.\nFrom there he could move up to bigger, more powerful and better sounding speakers in either system, free standing or wall mounted, or to a higher quality whole-of-home system such as those from Bluesound or Linn. I suspect, however, that he may want a cheaper system and Samsung has one that is a little cheaper than Heos or Sonos and sounds good for the money.\nJust out of interest I googled cheap amplifiers and found a few under $300, one of them for a desk-top system and a couple that looked suspiciously like knock-offs of reputable brands. I'm not sure any of them would have enough power to get good quality in-ceiling speakers sounding sweet.", "external_links": ["http://www.bluesound.com/", "http://www.sonos.com/en-au?r=1", "http://au.denon.com/au/heos"], "published": "2015-09-16T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T23:04:41.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
