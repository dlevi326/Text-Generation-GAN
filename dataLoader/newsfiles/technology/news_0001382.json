Here are some interesting figures provided by Phiyega:\n1. Approximately 5.3 million firearms are accounted for by around 2.4 million owners. “These figures include 61 162 naturalised foreign nationals in possession of 90 083 firearms. Over the past three financial years, we have issued 296 315 individual and business firearm licenses. We have destroyed 108 257 firearms over the past three years alone.\n2. She said that police were still struggling to stem the surge of money moved illegally out of the country - in the review period a total of R10.8bn was illegally transferred.\n3. Police found themselves in the firing line during the reporting period. “There have been 1 537 attacks on police this year and 86 murders. This is a very serious concern in terms of investment of training and experience. The Western Cape is having the most attacks with 645 attacks and 21 murders; we rely on the province to help tackle this. KZN shows 326 attacks and 11 murders. In Gauteng, for this period, 132 officers were attacked and 19 killed.”", "external_links": ["http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=56407", "http://whoswho.co.za/mangwashi-phiyega-24877", "http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=24877", "http://whoswho.co.za/nkosinathi-nhleko"], "published": "2015-09-29T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:19:02.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
