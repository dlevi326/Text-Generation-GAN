With none other than Pelé kicking off the first game, the first few weeks post-launch produced earned media coverage in 20+ countries, with 16 million impressions generated from social conversation, 35 million people reached through Shell's owned channels and 30 million additional impressions achieved through Condé Nast custom content in the United States. Most importantly, MediaCom helped motivate people to think about Shell differently, with brand familiarly jumping by nearly 13% and those stating that Shell is \"working to provide a sustainable energy future\" as \"a leader in providing innovative energy solutions\" both increasing by nearly 10%. \n\"Cities Energized\" was a thrilling multi-media venture with The New York Times: the first native advertising campaign ever permitted by the iconic newspaper. Elegant print, desktop, mobile, video and AR content explored the growing demand for efficient energy solutions as more and more of the world's population migrates to urban centers. Consumers who interacted with Cities Energized spent twice as much time as they do with general Times content, and Shell saw unprecedented brand lifts, including a 23% bump in brand favorability and a 19% increase in those describing Shell as \"working to provide a sustainable energy future.\" \nFinally, \"The World's First Fully Personalized TV Campaign\" was a brilliant follow up to the first year of \"Share A Coke\", an initiative that saw consumers searching store shelves for bottles featuring their own names, along with the names of friends and family. In Year Two, Coke and MediaCom turned this winning idea into a video-on-demand campaign that surprised 4 million viewers with their very own personalized digital TV ads in their own homes. How did it do? Campaign awareness was 17% higher than previous benchmarks, ad recall was 71%, purchase intent increased 24% and social reach of #ShareACoke peaked at 11 million. \nBoth Power of Sport and The World's First Fully Personalized TV Campaign were recognized in the Media category at this year's Cannes International Festival of Creativity, winning a Bronze (Best Corporate Image & Communication) and a Silver Lion (Use of Screens), respectively. \n\"We thank Adweek for recognizing three campaigns that represent not only our global commitment to Content + Connections, but also our focus on delivering exceptional bottom-line results for clients,\" said Sasha Savic, CEO of MediaCom USA. \"For us, this three-peat proves the rule: engaging stories, told through original content and a fully-integrated communications system, work for both marketers and consumers alike.\" \nAdweek's full Media Plan of the Year feature is available today in print and online. \nAbout MediaCom MediaCom is the \"The Content + Connections Agency,\" working to produce a step change in its clients' businesses by leveraging their brands' entire system of communications across paid, owned and earned channels.
