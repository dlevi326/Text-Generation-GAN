How cool is that! \nWatching the WalkCar in action reveals a device that can power you up steep hills, push another person in a wheelchair and even navigate a tight obstacle course.

The company behind the device, Tokyo-based Cocoa Motors, will launch a Kickstarter campaign soon, with pre-orders beginning in October. \n ;</p> <p> \nThis looks like amazing fun \nThis nifty transporter portable “walkcar” was invented by a Japenese engineer. \nThe Japenese certainly always seem to be head in technology inventions so I keep a close eye \non what they are producing \nThis little invention may look like it can’t hold much weight it is made from aluminum, and can apparently have as much as 265 lbs on board.If you buy one of these please be sure to tell us about your experience. \nSourced:mashable .com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T20:02:34.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
