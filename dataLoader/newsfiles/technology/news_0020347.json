Also for a sense of security.\nAlso for companionship.\nYou must work on it . Agree to disagree. Obviously you will have the occasional argument. It is healthy. Not to argue on a regular basis. The best part is to kiss and make up.\nCommunication is another way of ironing out your differences.\nHaving things in common. Like for instance sport and reading. Do what he or she wants and the same applies .\nTo reach a middle ground. In other words to compromise.\nDivorce is too easy these days. Not like before when you had no option, but to stay married.\nMarriage is a good thing..
