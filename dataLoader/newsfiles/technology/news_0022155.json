High levels of nitrogen in the organic muck on the lake bottom fed the monoculture of aquatic vegetation. The water depth was only five feet in places – too shallow for many plants to survive the winter. Low oxygen levels, combined with the high acidity and iron content in the water, eventually \"reached a tipping point,\" Parsons said.\nThat's when the new president and CEO, Clem Hamilton, took over, launching an $8.9 million New Leaf capital improvement plan that included the construction of the Canopy Walk and Emergent Tower, and a five-mile long, eight-foot tall deer fence around the arboretum's 233-acre core gardens.\nA key component of the plan was the $2.2 million rescue and restoration of Corning Lake and the adjoining Lotus Pond.\n\"Corning Lake lies at the geographic and aesthetic center of the arboretum's core area,\" Hamilton wrote in a recent edition of \"Leaves,\" the arboretum's quarterly magazine.\n\"Renewing Corning Lake,\" he wrote, \"will lay the groundwork for handsome tree plantings around the lake's perimeter, which will be as iconic as any element in the New Leaf plan.\"\nThe monumental project involved scraping the lake to its bare bones and building it back up to its original glory, which had begun with the building of a dam in 1938.\nParsons knocked open the dam to start the drainage process early last April. After all of the putrid water had flowed out, he had it sealed up this past May.\nParsons was shocked at the scarcity of life on the lake bottom: a total of 12 golden shiners and a bunch of snapping turtles. And that was all – not a bass or a bluegill to be found, he said.\nThat sick lake scene was a sharp contrast to the healthy and bountiful body of sparkling water that Haans Petruschke knew from his youth growing up in Kirtland. He recalled accompanying his mother to Corning Lake, carrying a pair of beat up Tasco binoculars for bird-watching while his mother fished for bream, when he was thrilled to see a black-and-white raptor dive into the water.\n\"Osprey!\" young Haans called out, as the fish hawk flew away with a wriggling fish in its talons.\nSome of Ohio's leading naturalists originally ran the Holden Arboretum, and the habitat was maintained with birds in mind, said Petruschke, who works as a volunteer guide at the arboretum.\nIncluded among those bird-loving founders was philanthropist Maude Corning, wife of the lake's namesake, Warren, who donated the land to the arboretum. Mrs. Corning loved Canada geese, which she kept fat and happy during the winter by feeding them bushel bags of corn. She even had a sculpture of two geese mounted in Lotus Pond.\nMrs. Corning especially appreciated the electric-powered bubbler in Corning Lake that aerated the water, expelled much of the iron into the air, and kept it ice-free year-round for the geese, which no longer migrated south for the winter.\nBut by the early 1980s, the geese had become progressively more common to the point where many at Holden considered them nuisances. When Maude Corning moved away in 1983, the anti-goose forces found the opportunity they had waited for, Parsons said. They shut off the lake bubbler and ended the winter feeding routine.\nThe Canada geese departed, but without the bubbler the water quality worsened. As the fish died off during the ensuing decade, the osprey, loons, grebes, and teal stopped coming to Corning Lake, too, said Parsons.\n\"I haven't seen tundra swans on Corning Lake since 2001 or 2002,\" Parsons said.\nIt wasn't until the leaves of the garden plants started turning rusty and dying, and the lake levels were becoming precipitously low, that Holden officials became sufficiently shocked enough to take action.\nRestoring the lake to its original glory would not be a simple process, he said.\n\"There's a lot more science to ponds than you would think,\" Parsons said. \"We're not just using a dirt-mover. This is an environmental restoration to create a body of water that is ecologically diverse. We're starting anew and transforming the face of Holden in the process.\"\nAfter the muck dried in the lake bed, bulldozers scraped out 26,000 cubic yards of sediment, being careful not to break the 75-year-old clay liner that kept the water from draining through the bottom into the gravel foundation below. The depth was returned to its original nine feet. Workers also removed a concrete spillway that was replaced with a riparian stream corridor of native vegetation.\nAll of the invasive plants had been previously removed from the edges of the lake, including common buckthorn and multiflora rose, which didn't make everyone happy, Parsons said.\n\"The birders went wild,\" he said. \"The invasive thorny shrubs were habitat for one of their favorite birds,\" the blue-winged warbler. \"But from a conservation perspective, we were right.\"\nParsons put together a strong team of advisors for the project, including Jim Bissell, the head botanist at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, water quality scientist Paul Anderson of the Ohio EPA, and Bob Carlson, an aquatics environmental services consultant.\nSlowly this summer, rainfall has begun to refill the lake with fresh, clean water that can support fish and a healthy variety of aquatic vegetation.\nEven the Canada geese have returned. A flock of about a dozen were on the lake last Monday during a roundup by staff and volunteers to drive all of the deer from the arboretum's central core.\nSoon, Parsons will oversee the planting of submerged plants in earthen shelves created around the rim of the lake. After the plants take root, they will introduce fish back into the lake.\nMeanwhile, Roger Gettig, Holden's director of horticulture and conservation, will direct the planting of trees and shrubs along the shore, including red osier dogwood, buttonbush, sweetbay magnolia, swamp white oak, and willows.\nParsons said he hopes to complete the project in the next three years. After that, Holden will continue to perform water-monitoring tests and apply treatments to assure the water quality doesn't regress to its former unhealthy state. He is still considering adding an aeration unit similar to a giant bottom-diffusing bubbler, but is not sure it will be necessary.\n\"The plants chosen will also serve as an additional draw for birds, providing food and habitat around the lake,\" Hamilton wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:13:26.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
