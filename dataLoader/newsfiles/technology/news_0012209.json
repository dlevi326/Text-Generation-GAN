In the past few months, terminal operators from Brazil, Haiti and Sint Maarten have purchased a total of four diesel-electric Terex Gottwald mobile harbour cranes – two model four cranes in the G HMK 4406 B four-rope-grab variant and two Model six cranes in the G HMK 6507 two-rope-grab variant. The model 4 cranes, supplied with mechanical grabs and automatic single-lift spreaders primarily handle coal and load and unload containers in the Brazilian Port of Açu.\nIn the port located to the north of Rio de Janeiro, the machines have a radius up to 46 metres, a maximum lifting capacity of 100 tonnes and a 40-tonne grab curve.\nSince 2012, Açu has played a major role in fast growing Brazilian-Chinese maritime trade. Like all Terex Gottwald mobile harbour cranes in the four-rope-grab design, the cranes provide a long service life. The cranes also offer high handling rates, enabling fast loading and unloading of ships.\nThe two G HMK 6507 cranes are used in Sint Maarten and Haiti for container and general cargo handling. The crane for Sint Maarten will work together with two existing Terex Gottwald mobile harbour cranes in the port of the capital Philipsburg, a hub of maritime trade in the North East of the Caribbean.\nHolger Schauer, Regional Sales Manager Harbour Cranes TPS, said: “We have been on a consistent growth course in Brazil for around 15 years, but also increasingly in other countries in South and Central America. We are pleased to have been selected by another, very ambitious Brazilian customer and to be represented with two additional cranes in the Caribbean. This shows that our technology provides excellent solutions for the diverse requirements of customers in this region of the world.”\nFact File: TPS is part of the material handling and port solutions business segment of Terex Corporation that supplies customers in ports with a combination of machines, software and services under the Terex and Terex Gottwald brands.\nFor all the latest on Terex, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T18:46:09.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
