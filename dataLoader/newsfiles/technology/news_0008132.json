Fibre will soon be available in multiple additional suburbs of Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, Bloemfontein, Kimberley and Port Elizabeth. \nFibre to the home currently allows for download speeds of up to 100Mbps, allowing users to download a standard definition 4.7GB video in under seven minutes. An entire music album can be downloaded in eight seconds. \nFibre optic cables transmit light and is thus not affected by interference from electromagnetic noise such as radios, motors, power lines, electric fences or other cables. Consequently, fibre is a reliable and stable broadband product. \nTelkom’s coverage map allows you to check fibre availability for your area.
