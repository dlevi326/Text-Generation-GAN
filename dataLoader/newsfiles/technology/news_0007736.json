The company promises your iPhone or iPad will be able to run an extra hour without charging once you upgrade, thanks to higher efficiency \"across the entire operating system.\" \nYour device will also automatically keep its screen off when it's face down to save power, and you'll have access to a Low Power mode for when you're especially worried about running out of juice. 2. Split-screen views for multitasking on the iPad \nApple has created several split-screen viewing features for the iPad that make it possible to do more computer-like multitasking, such as answering an email while you're browsing the web: Slide Over lets you open a second app as a sidebar without closing the first app. Split View lets you have two apps open and active at the same time. Picture in Picture lets you shrink your FaceTime or Video screen down to a small rectangle in the corner while you work in other apps. Split View is one of iOS 9's three multitasking views for iPad. It lets you have two apps open and active at the same time. (Apple) 3. Transit directions for Toronto \nApple's Maps app has a number of incremental upgrades, including public transit directions â€” something Apple has been criticized about for not offering. (Transit directions are available in both Google and Bing Maps). Unfortunately, Apple's transit directions are only available in 10 cities worldwide, including one in Canada: Toronto. 4. A more proactive Siri \nLike its competitors Google Now and Microsoft's Cortana , Siri will now try to anticipate your needs. Google's virtual assistant invades Sir's turf In iOS 9, your search screen will include Siri's suggestions for what you might want to do next based on the apps you commonly use and the time of day you use them. (Apple) \nYour search screen will include Siri's suggestions for what you might want to do next, based on the apps you commonly use and the time of day you use them. For example, if you check stock prices first thing in the morning, your Stocks app will show up on the search screen at the time you normally wake up, Apple says. The search screen will also show contacts you're scheduled to meet and those you talk with the most. \nEarly reviews suggest Siri is not yet as adept as Google Now, but at least one reviewer thinks it's still a welcome new feature. 5. Support for doodles \nApple announced its new Apple Pencil stylus last week, and now wants you to be able to doodle and draw in its apps. With iOS 9, Apple's built-in Notes and Mail apps will both let you add drawings, including sketches made with your finger or a signature. In the case of Mail, the Markup feature is similar to a feature with the same name in OS X that lets you draw on documents or images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T03:47:44.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
