Samsung did not give information about pricing though the player is expected to cost between $500 and $1,000. \nThe player will offer high dynamic range (HDR) and colours that are 64 times higher those of standard Blu-ray discs. It is also capable of up-scaling content to provide UHD resolution for any disc, screen mirroring and streaming 4K content. \nAt the same time, Twentieth Century Fox has unveiled the first batch of 4K Blu-ray discs, including “Exodus: Gods and Kings”, “Kingsman: The Secret Service”, “Fantastic Four”, “X-Men: Days of Future Past”, “Life of Pi”, “The Maze Runner” and “Wild”. \nHanno Basse, chair of the UHD Alliance that decides specifications for the new disc, said: “We're getting close to finalising our technical specifications, as well as our certification and logo programs...And we hope to share a lot more details in the coming months on the launch of our licensing program and the availability of new products in the market.” \nHowever, experts have questioned whether the new UHD Blu-ray format will gain widespread acceptance at a time when more people are streaming and downloading high-definition content, including movies and TV shows.
