It has promised to return most of the proceeds to shareholders, while focusing on its remaining insurance technology operations, including Himex and Ingenie, which install black boxes in cars. Quindell is also co-operating with a Serious Fraud Office investigation into its past business and accounting practices . \nIndro Mukerjee , who took over as chief executive on September 7, said he would deal with losses “as quickly as possible”, while also improving the company’s governance and identifying opportunities for growth. “I plan to share an outline strategy around the turn of the year,” he added. \nQuindell has described its continuing operations as having significant growth potential. However, revenues fell 17.5 per cent year-on-year to £35.3m in the first half of 2015. \nThe company’s loft insulation operations — which sat uneasily with its proclaimed technology focus — were particularly hit, “affected by government policy and subsidy changes”. \nHimex — Quindell’s biggest acquisition — suffered “a temporary interruption in supply within one of our US customers and a slowdown in new software sales . . . in the UK and Canada due to issues concerning the Quindell brand”. \nOverall trading since June has been “broadly in line” with the first-half performance, Quindell said. \nQuindell had £524m in cash as of September 25, more than its stock market capitalisation, with a further £55m held in an escrow account in relation to the sale to Slater & Gordon.
