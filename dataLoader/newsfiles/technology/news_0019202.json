By acquiring Good, BlackBerry eliminates a competitor to help bolster its competitive advantage against Citrix Systems Inc. and other rivals.\n\"Like BlackBerry, Good has a very strong presence in enterprises and governments around the world and, with this transaction, BlackBerry will enhance its sales and distribution capabilities and further grow its enterprise software revenue stream,\" Chief Executive John Chen said in a statement.\nThe deal also provides BlackBerry with additional revenue, which has been under pressure amid a slow takeup of the company's latest version of its mobile device management software.\nBlackBerry said it expects to realize approximately $160 million in revenue from Good in the first year after closing.\nWrite to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com\n 04, 2015 09:00 ET (13:00 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T03:05:21.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
