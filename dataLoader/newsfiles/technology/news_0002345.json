Spending a total of $60, Jeff built a device for Erica, which she now uses every day.\nOthers who want to try out the treatment, which is still a way off from FDA approval, are building their own devices at home.\nWe speak to scientists and researchers who are testing TDCS at Burke Medical Research Institute and at a pediatric hospital, and meet other patients, including an elderly man who had a stroke and young girl with cerebral palsy.\nWe see how testing in controlled lab environments is being carried out and hear from medical researchers and Jeff and Erica about the ethical implications of their very different approaches.\nAlso in this episode:\nCould your selfie tell you how old you are? Or more interesting - at what age you’ll die?\n\"We do know that people who look younger for their age tend to live longer,\" says S. Jay Olshansky, an aging expert at the University of Illinois in Chicago and the co-creator of \" Face My Age .\"\nThe TechKnow team tries out the \"Face My Age\" website, which uses facial recognition software and a questionnaire to estimate an individual’s \"face\" age - not their actual age - and their life expectancy.\nSource: Al Jazeera", "external_links": ["http://facemyage.com/#how-we-age"], "published": "2015-09-18T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T15:43:06.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
