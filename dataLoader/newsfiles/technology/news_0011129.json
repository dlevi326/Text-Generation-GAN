Running on Android 5.1, it boasts an 8-core Qualcomm processor and a big 2,900 milliampere hour battery that Sony says can deliver battery life of up to 2 days.\nAccording to Telsyte, the second half of 2015 should see 4.5 million smartphones sold, with pricing and brand still the key arbiters for buyers. However, there are doubts that Apple’s impending refresh to the iPhone 6 is likely to help it regain the top spot in Australia.\nDespite the expected upgrades -- a 12 megapixel camera, Force Touch technology, and a front flash -- the tweaks are unlikely to be attractive enough to spark a big upgrade cycle. The Telsyte report also points to the increasing level of importance being placed on ‘lifestyle’ factors such as durability and resistance to the elements.\nThat trend is likely to benefit the secondary Android players in the market rather than Apple.\nThe data reinforces the primacy of smartphones as the favoured device for communications and portable computing and as the smartphone market enters maturity, the wearable devices trend still has some way to go.\nAccording to the Telsyte data, despite the promotional hype surrounding smartwatches, only 205,000 units were sold in Australia in the first half of 2015.\nApple Watch is the market leader with a 64 per cent share in the first half of 2015, beating out both Samsung and LG. However, Apple’s competitors are catching up with Samsung’s Gear S2 a dramatically improved product and Motorola’s 42mm Moto 360 smartwatch coming to the market at an attractive price point.\nInterestingly, Telsyte also found that some 10 per cent of smartwatch users stopped using their device altogether once the initial euphoria had evaporated.\nTelsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi said that the lack of unique -- the so called 'killer' apps -- on smartwatches was still a big inhibitor to adoption.\n“The Apple watch remains a luxury gadget, with its sales price typically more than twice the average of rival Android-compatible smartwatches,” he said.\n“It is difficult to see mass market consumers paying as much as premium tablets or smartphones for wearable technology that does not have significant new or unique features.”\nDespite the slow sales of smartwatches, smart wristbands such as those sold by Fitbit and Garmin continue to grow, up 30 per cent on H2 2014. Telsyte estimates that there are around 2 million smart wristband users in Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:56:55.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
