Moon is now roughly at a distance of 3,56,800 km from the earth, a little closer than the average earth-moon distance of 3,84,000 km.\nThe rare celestial event is often described as a \"Super moon\" by astronomers and skywatchers.On its elliptical path around the Earth, moon sometimes comes closest to the earth, the portion being called perigee. \"Today's moon is at the perigee and also it happens to be full moon,\" Duari said explaining the reason of the large appearance of the moon. Although Indians could enjoy the 'Supermoon' but they are going to miss a total lunar eclipse since the totality of the eclipse will start after 7 am tomorrow.\n\"But people from North and South America, well almost everybody, and people in Europe will see the moon as bigger and also 'blood red' in colour. Because during a total lunar eclipse moon does not become black, but gets a reddish-copper tinge which popularly is mentioned as blood red,\" the expert on celestial bodies said. This happens because the red light of the sun's whitelight gets least scattered by the atmosphere and falls on the moon during an eclipse making it look blood red, he added. This rare phenomenon of a supermoon and blood-red moon together was last seen during 1982 and will recur only in 2033.\n technology Science and Trends Super moon Also Read NASA to roll out Space Launch System Rocket soon Oppo Neo 5 (2015) budget handset officially launched in India Leaked: WhatsApp desktop version in the making Google wireless phone service challenges major carriers", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/new-red.gif", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150928/technology-latest/article/moon-comes-close-earth-india-miss-total-lunar-eclipse", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/new-red.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-09-30T07:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:14:08.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
