We rely on word of mouth,\" Meyrose added, noting that building public awareness is a particular problem of community theater.\nThe audience filled a respectable two-thirds of the comfortably rustic 240-seat theater. They ranged from first-timers to regulars of more than 40 years.\n\"It saddens my heart\" that the current season could be the last, said a woman from North Royalton who has been coming for years. \"I think it's terrible.\"\nMore information: huntingtonplayhouse.org .", "external_links": ["http://huntingtonplayhouse.org/index.html", "http://huntingtonplayhouse.org/season.html"], "published": "2015-08-30T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:16:09.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
