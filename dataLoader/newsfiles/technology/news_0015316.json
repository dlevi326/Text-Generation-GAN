The company conducted nine experiments: four on leaves, two on raisins, and three on humans. The images are visible here: http://quwave.com/QuWave-Test-Resuls-from-Kirlian-Photography-Experiments.html\nEach of the experiments tested the organic matter before being used on the Energizer or Harmonizer and after being used on the Energizer or Harmonizer. In each of the experiments the aura is brighter and more distinct after being put under the influence of one of the QuWave products.\nKirlian Photography was discovered in 1939 by Russian electrical engineer and inventor Semyon Kirlian. Although it was discovered in the 1930's it did not gain widespread recognition until the early 1960's. George Harrison (a member of the Beatles) used an image from Kirlian Photography on his 1973 album Living in the Material World.\nThe Kirlian Image is purported to be a physical manifestation of the spiritual aura. It is designed to reveal the bioelectrical charge of an organism. Some theorize it shows orgone or chi energy.\nThe QuWave Energizer and QuWave Harmonizer are two of QuWave's most popular products. The Energizer is designed to energize food, water, or jewelry with orgone chi energy. The Harmonizer is designed to protect against the harmful effects of electromagnetic fields and improve quality of life.\nAbout QuWave:\nQuWave LLC, a prominent organization in the energy medicine field, manufacturing unique and active products that block the negative effects of EMF pollution and radiation while also generating Scalar Waves, Solfeggio Frequencies, Schumann Resonance, and Chi Orgone energies to promote a healthy, balanced lifestyle.
