Tickets for “My Fair Lady” are available now at participating theater box offices and online at www.MyFairLady50.com . \nThe limited theatrical engagement will be followed by the release of the film on Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack “My Fair Lady: 50 th Anniversary Edition” from CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Media Distribution, available October 27. \n“My Fair Lady” won a staggering eight Academy Awards ® in 1964, including Best Picture. Fifty years after its original release, audiences are still enchanted by the musical that follows elitist linguistic professor Henry Higgins (Harrison) as he makes a wager with his colleague that he can turn sassy, cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Hepburn) into the toast of English society. The film remains one of the most celebrated movie musicals in film history, and includes such timeless songs as “The Rain in Spain,”“I Could Have Danced All Night” and “Get Me to the Church on Time.” \nAcclaimed film historian and preservationist Robert A. Harris painstakingly restored the film to its original beauty. The 4K restoration comes from an 8K scan of the original negative and other surviving 65mm elements. Harris has previously restored such film classics as “Lawrence of Arabia,”“Spartacus,”“Vertigo,”“Rear Window” and “The Godfather.” \n“‘My Fair Lady’ is one of the crown jewels in our library,” said Ken Ross, executive vice president and general manager, CBS Home Entertainment. “And now this timeless masterpiece will be presented to a new generation of fans in a quality never before seen or heard.” \n“Movie musicals are such an important part of Hollywood and motion picture history, and certainly ‘My Fair Lady’ is one of the most highly regarded by critics and fans,” said Julie Borchard-Young, co-president of BY Experience. “We are thrilled to work with CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Media Distribution to bring ‘My Fair Lady’ back to cinema screens across the country for all ages to enjoy.” \n“My Fair Lady: 50 th Anniversary Edition” Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack comes in collectible packaging with an entire Blu-ray disc dedicated to 90 minutes of special features including a variety of original trailers and featurettes that were used in theaters to promote the feature film, as well as footage from the film’s Los Angeles and British premieres in 1964. The collection is rated G and will be available for the suggested retail price of $42.99. \nFor artwork/photos related to “My Fair Lady,” visit https://arc.paramount.com . \nAbout BY Experience \nBY Experiencekicked off the digital revolution of live events to movie theaters and other locations globally with David Bowie’s 2003 Reality album launch and since then, over 22 million tickets have been sold worldwide for cinema events BY Experience has distributed globally.
