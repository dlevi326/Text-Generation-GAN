The event will consist of a theatre-style awards program followed by desserts and live music. Before and after the awards will be a Technology Showcase including finalists, sponsors and partners. \n“Michael Crow’s entire career has demonstrated a commitment to employing science and technology to drive positive social, economic, and environmental outcomes,” said Steven G. Zylstra , president and CEO of the Arizona Technology Council. “Arizonans everywhere can be proud that Crow’s leadership has transformed ASU into one of the nation’s leading metropolitan research universities and forever shaped our technology ecosystem.” \nLifetime Achievement Award winners are chosen by public vote. Crow joins an impressive list of honorees including Pat Sullivan, co-founder and CEO of Ryver in 2014, Eric and Tim Crown of Insight Enterprises in 2013, Gary Tooker, former CEO and chairman of Motorola, Inc. in 2012, Roy Vallee, retired chairman and CEO of Avnet, Inc. in 2011, Steve Sanghi, president, CEO and chairman, Microchip Technology in 2010, former Intel CEO and chairman, Craig Barrett in 2009, and renowned architect Paolo Soleri in 2008. \n“The future of our state and our economy depend on producing the people, ideas and technology needed to solve problems and shape the kind of future that we want for Arizona,” Crow said. “I am grateful for this honor, which really recognizes the great strides we have made at ASU in creating an environment that encourages students from all walks of life to become highly adaptable master learners.” \nUnder Crow’s leadership, ASU redefined its mission to focus on providing access to education, delivering research and innovation with a positive impact in Arizona and around the world and fulfilling a responsibility to better the community in which the university is embedded. Enrollment has doubled, the graduation rate has nearly doubled and, in the past two years, only Harvard produced more Fulbrights than ASU. \nASU’s research enterprise has tripled under Crow to more than $425 million. In the last year alone, NASA awarded ASU a complete moon mission; an ASU researcher led development of the Ebola treatment that saved two American doctors; the world’s first white laser, the next step beyond LED lighting, emerged from an ASU lab; a jaw found by ASU anthropologists last year fundamentally changed our understanding of the earliest origins of man and the National Science Foundation made ASU one of only two institutions in the nation to lead two Engineering Research Centers – technology hubs charged with solving some of the world’s biggest problems. \nThe New York Times last month dubbed Barrett Honors College, at ASU, as the “gold standard” among honors colleges, and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan has said that the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College “raises the bar” for all other teacher preparation programs in the country. \nThis month (September), U.S. News & World Report declared ASU as the “Most Innovative School” in the nation. \nCrow’s success in – and blueprint for – transforming higher education is chronicled in his book, with co-author William Dabars, “Designing the New American University.” \nIn addition to Crow’s impressive administrative career, Crow has long been an influential voice in science and technology policy. Crow served as an advisor to the Office of Technology Assessment at the U.S. Congress and was a Research Fellow on the Technology and Information Policy Program at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. He also has served as an advisor to the U.S. Department of Energy. \n“Under Michael Crow’s visionary leadership, Arizona State University has, time and again, forged institutional initiatives that render Arizona more economically competitive,\" said Sandra Watson , president and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. “He’s a tireless champion of Arizona, and a fitting recipient of this lifetime achievement award.” \nIndividual and Corporate Innovator and Pioneer Award winners will also be honored at GCOI. This includes the Future Innovators awards given to Arizona students, the Arizona Teacher of the Year, the Tech Champion Awards given to Arizona legislators, and awards for the Arizona Senator of the Year and Arizona Representative of the Year. \nAbout the Arizona Technology Council \nThe Arizona Technology Council is Arizona’s premier trade association for science and technology companies.
