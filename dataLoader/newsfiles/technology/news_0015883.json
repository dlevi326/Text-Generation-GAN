Many are anticipating the film’s release not just to see Daniel Craig in his final 007 role, but also to see what car he will be driving (or probably wrecking). \nEver since the very first James Bond film in 1963, fans have been fascinated not only with the next “Bond Girl,” but also the next Bond super sports car. Many different makes and models, like BMW and Lotus, have appeared throughout the years. However, an Ashton Martin has been the vehicle of choice for most of the films and has since become synonymous with 007. \nAn Ashton Martin DB5 first appeared in Goldfinger and came loaded with the usual spy devices such as revolving license plates, machine guns, and an ejector seat. Later, another DB5 was the MI6 agent vehicle of choice in Goldeneye . \nIn Casino Royale , a vintage 1963 Aston Martin DB5 is used as a bet during a poker game which, in usual 007 style, Bond wins. Spectre will be no different, as an Ashton Martin will take center stage again in the latest film.

Obviously, only enough to be used in the film as many of them were most likely destroyed during production. An unpleasant thought for many car buffs. \nThere is even more bad news, as wannabe Bonds will not be able to buy a DB10 since they will not be made available for sale to the public. However, the Belfast Telegraph reports that a similar Bond Aston Martin is available. With the anticipated release of the new film, demand is high and sales are strong for the luxury vehicle.

The sophisticated sports car, driven by villain Hinx (Dave Bautista), will be used in a high-speed night chase through the streets of Rome. Many car enthusiasts have defined it as “the most advanced Jaguar ever created.” \nAt an event hosted by Jaguar Land Rover, Bautista described his experience driving such a car in a 007 film. \n“To have the opportunity to be a part of an iconic chase scene in a Bond movie and to drive the C-X75 supercar was like a dream come true for me. It truly is a beautiful beast of a car that will go down in movie history.” \nIn another scene, set in the Austrian Alps, a few modified Land Rover Defenders and a Range Rover Sport SVR will appear. All of the Land Rovers were modified to make them appear more off-road ready, which included large 37-inch diameter tires and improved body protection. \nOf course, John Edwards, current Managing Director of Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations, is thrilled the vehicles had a part in the new film. \n“For Jaguar Land Rover to once again be a part of the iconic vehicle line ups in one of the most celebrated film franchises in the world represents a proud moment for us. It’s an incredible opportunity to showcase production and concept cars alike and we look forward to continuing this relationship well into the future.” \nSpectre , from EON Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and Sony Pictures Entertainment, stars Daniel Craig as Bond and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny. It was directed by Sam Mendes and written by John Logan and Neal Purvis. Also, it was recently confirmed by the Inquisitr that the new 007 theme will be performed by Sam Smith. \nAlthough Craig will have top billing in the film’s credits, these super sophisticated sports cars will have their own starring moments in the 24th James Bond film. \n[Video courtesy of Youtube ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T22:18:18.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
