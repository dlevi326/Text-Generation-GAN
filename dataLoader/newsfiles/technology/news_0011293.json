Why? Because they need to understand more the product in order to make the transformation they think they can make,\" Carlos Ghosn said at a press conference in Frankfurt on Wednesday.\nAs cars become more connected to smartphones, opportunities for new business models are emerging. These put less emphasis on ownership and could open the door to companies which manage and rent out fleets of cars, charging users a fee for time spent in a car.\nEarlier this week Google named auto industry veteran John Krafcik, a former chief executive of Hyundai Motors America, as head of its self-driving car project.
