Open Energi has selected the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP™) to transform the way energy is delivered and consumed through smart grids with Hadoop-powered, real-time, Internet of Things (IoT) data. Smart grids, powered by sensor data, allow energy consumption to be managed in real-time based on immediate demand and supply data rather than historic patterns of energy use. With HDP, the industry's only Open Enterprise Hadoop solution, Open Energi will help organisations gain valuable insights by analysing real-time information based on data streamed from over 3,000 electricity consuming assets and meters around the United Kingdom . Hortonworks and Open Energi: Building the Virtual Power Station Open Energi's patented demand response technology is helping to drive momentum behind smart grids by enabling organisations – including the likes of Sainsbury's, United Utilities and Aggregate Industries – to turn energy-intensive equipment such as fridges, pumps and fans into \"smart devices\" which can alter their energy use intelligently in response to fluctuations in electricity supply and demand nationwide. Its unique Dynamic Demand technology aggregates consumption across its customers' sites to provide a fast, flexible solution equivalent to a power station, only instead of adjusting supply up or down, it adjusts demand to meet supply. Using HDP, Open Energi will collect, store and analyse sensor data containing information about real-time electricity consumption and control processes more efficiently and at a far greater scale than previously possible. Additionally, HDP will provide a single view of all this information to enable organisations to react swiftly to changing conditions on the grid, and identify ways to generate extra revenue from existing assets, maximise energy savings and spot opportunities to reduce CO 2 emissions. \"Our vision is to build the world's first virtual power station and we aim to do that by developing a smarter platform built around smarter demand,\" explained David Hill , Business Development Director, Open Energi. \"Using the HDP in combination with the IoT will enable us to make connections between a wider range of disparate datasets at a far greater scale, so that we can provide organisations with a previously unattainable level of insight into their use of energy and ultimately create an energy system which is cleaner, cheaper and more secure.\" Hadoop and the Internet of Things: Better together As more devices connect to the IoT, an ever-increasing amount of data is being created that can offer valuable insight into a number of areas. In addition to supporting the optimisation of smart grids, Open Enterprise Hadoop's ability to accommodate over 1 trillion files through an internet-scale storage layer can be used to track everything from weather patterns to supporting the healthcare industry to more effectively record and monitor patients' vital statistics and other health indicators. \"Data is the driving force behind a smarter energy grid and with access to more accurate technology, it is now possible to build a far more detailed picture of energy usage,\" said Andy Leaver , Vice President of International Operations, Hortonworks. \"Through its use of the Hortonworks Data Platform, Open Energi will have real-time information and insight into grid conditions that can be fed back to customers help them make more informed decisions about their energy consumption. This collaboration is a great example of Hortonworks' momentum internationally as more customers in more industries turn to Hortonworks to solve their big data problems.\" Additional Resources Hortonworks to Acquire Onyara: [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTlvYjNKMGIyNTNiM0pyY3k1amIyMHZZbXh2Wnk5b2IzSjBiMjUzYjNKcmN5MWhZM0YxYVhKbGN5MXZibmxoY21FdlhDSWdjbVZzUFZ3aWJtOW1iMnhzYjNkY0lpQjBZWEpuWlhROVhDSmZZbXhoYm10Y0lqNW9kSFJ3T2k4dmFHOXlkRzl1ZDI5eWEzTXVZMjl0TDJKc2IyY3ZhRzl5ZEc5dWQyOXlhM010WVdOeGRXbHlaWE10YjI1NVlYSmhMend2WVQ0PXw=]] Hortonworks Customers: [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTlvYjNKMGIyNTNiM0pyY3k1amIyMHZZM1Z6ZEc5dFpYSnpMMXdpSUhKbGJEMWNJbTV2Wm05c2JHOTNYQ0lnZEdGeVoyVjBQVndpWDJKc1lXNXJYQ0krYUhSMGNEb3ZMMmh2Y25SdmJuZHZjbXR6TG1OdmJTOWpkWE4wYjIxbGNuTXZQQzloUGc9PXw=]] About Hortonworks Hortonworks is the leader in accelerating business transformations with Open Enterprise Hadoop by developing, distributing and supporting an enterprise-scale data platform built entirely on open source technology including Apache™ Hadoop®.

About Open Energi Open Energi's unique Dynamic Demand technology aggregates energy consumption from across our customers' sites to provide a fast, flexible solution which is equivalent to a power station, only instead of adjusting supply up or down to meet demand, it adjusts demand up or down to meet supply. Solutions such as this, coupled with on-site generation and energy storage technologies means that the energy market is no longer a linear value chain driven by fossil fuel production but is becoming bi-directional; creating a new energy economy where energy consumers can both take and provide service back to the grid and generate revenue.
