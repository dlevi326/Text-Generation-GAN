Secret Service sounds the alarm on mobile payment weaknesses \nThe Secret Service distributed an advisory Sept. 8 warning of a \"steady increase\" in near field communication (NFC) payment fraud over the past few months. \nHackers are both stealing existing credentials and using stolen tax records and other personal information to set up falsified credentials on NFC devices, the advisory noted.
