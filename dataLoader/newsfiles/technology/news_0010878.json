We have added performance analytics, historical trending, data export capability and threshold based alerting. Really, what we have done is add a new dimension to Citrix NetScaler which allows IT Operations teams to utilize the NetScaler as part of the ongoing Proactive IT Management and troubleshooting process,” said Tom Peck, Goliath’s CTO and VP of Product Development, Goliath for NetScaler Products Group.\nAdditional new features in Goliath IT Analytics for NetScaler include—NetScaler end user and server data to isolate performance failures and historical reports without limitation for key metrics like Citrix Sessions, Users, Apps, and Web Performance.\n“With Goliath IT Analytics for NetScaler I can see at a glance and in real time, whether a reported issue is a client side or server side issue. In other words is the performance bottleneck within the data center or is it in the connection. Additionally, I have access to connection forensics that provide deep insight into what the user and server are trying to do. This is valuable because I can immediately begin to disqualify what isn’t the root cause, which reduces time to remediation,” said Jacob Rutski, Citrix Engineer.\nIn conjunction with the new release, Goliath has launched a fully functional live demo of Goliath IT Analytics for NetScaler .\nAbout Goliath Technologies\nGoliath Technologies provides proactive IT Operations software for IT organizations that address the evolving challenges of deploying virtual server and virtual desktop infrastructure whether on premise or in the cloud.
