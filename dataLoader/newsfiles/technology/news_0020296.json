Yuck. No one wants a stylus.” \nEight years later, Apple has introduced a brand new $99 stylus called the Apple Pencil as an accessory to a new tablet aimed at professionals and artists called the iPad Pro. The 12-9-inch tablet allows users to use the Apple Pencil to sketch, draw, paint, take notes and manipulate complex architectural drawings among other things.
