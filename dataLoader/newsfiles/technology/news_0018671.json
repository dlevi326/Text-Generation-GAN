It’s not quite Terminator level self-healing tech, but it could be the thing that saves a crew in a hull breach. \nScientists have developed a new material, a gel they’ve named tributylborane, that sits between two polymer layers. Then those outer casings are punctured, say with a bullet, the gel fills in the space and hardens when exposed to oxygen. \nEssentially repairing the hole, at least until humans can make their way to the damaged area and give it a more permanent fix. \n-AllMediaNY Staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T05:25:44.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
