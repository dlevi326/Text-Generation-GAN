We use our cell phone for calls, texts, searching and accessing the Internet, navigation, commerce and entertainment. Leave the house without your cell phone and you are likely to feel disconnected and tense within a couple of hours.\nIt’s relatively easy to fit a few things in pockets or purses, but casual wear like summer shorts and T-shirts only provide a small place to store a wallet, keys and phone. As a result, extra items like reading glasses are often left behind because they become too difficult and bulky to carry around. That’s why Steve and Cheryl Grealy spent almost 2 years designing, prototyping and developing Lenzcase - a lightweight, sleek phone case with ‘spring-loaded’ reading glasses that are part of the case itself, and ready for action whenever you really need them.\nMany people need glasses everyday for reading small print on phones, or menus and labels, but sometimes forget their lenses or choose to leave them at home. It’s not uncommon for friends in a restaurant to pass one pair of prescription glasses around the table so that each can read items on the menu. This is because carrying around reading glasses for the few instances we need them is inconvenient. That’s what inspired the Grealy’s to design the “Lenzcase.”\n“The concept came to me when I was trying to fit my bulky case for my glasses into my clutch purse,” says Cheryl Grealy. “I realized that people always take their cell phone but would rather not bother with carrying around their bulky reading glasses.”\nNow, with the Lenzcase, smartphone users will have a pair of lightweight reading glasses tucked right in their cell phone cover to use anytime.\nThe Lenzcase reading glasses come in +2, +2.5, +3 and +3.5 dioptre strengths, so the millions of adults who require a bit help with reading very small print are sure to find one that works for their vision needs.\nThe extraordinary case design and innovative functionality of the Lenzcase will appeal to people looking for an easy way to bring their reading glasses anywhere. It is lightweight with clean lines and lightly textured surface which provides a secure grip for the phone. The Grealy’s and their team developed an surprisingly slim case using an internal plate made of durable aluminum and held in place with small aircraft grade machine screws. Using an efficient ‘switchblade action’ configuration powered by a light coil spring, ball race and carriage, the glasses are spring loaded to be readily accessible for a quick read, and can then be instantly slipped back into the case.\nThe Grealy’s believe launching Lenzcase through the U.S. Kickstarter crowdfunding site will provide a strong foundation for bringing the product to the world.\n“Globally there have been more than 100 million iPhone 6 phones sold,” said Steve Grealy. “And it has been reported 1 in 4 Americans and Australians need reading assistance. So, the market is huge.”\nThrough the Kickstarter campaign, the Lenzcase is now available as pre-order item, and should be ready for shipment in time for Christmas. The product will sell for $28-48 depending on options and packaging, with worldwide shipping available.\n“You’ll never have to worry about forgetting your glasses again,” said Cheryl Grealy.\nTo learn more about the Lenzcase product, or to order your case online, contribute to the Kickstarter page at https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lenzcase/lenzcase-your-phone-glasses-in-one-minimalist-case .\nWebsite: www.Lenzcase.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Lenzcase\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Lenzcase\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSvEnb06D3lcRT4kSgx2tkA\nKickstarter Campaign:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lenzcase/lenzcase-your-phone-glasses-in-one-minimalist-case\nContact:\nSteve Grealy\nFounder, Lenzcase\nEmail:\nPhone: +61404873079", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Lenzcase", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSvEnb06D3lcRT4kSgx2tkA", "https://twitter.com/Lenzcase", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lenzcase/lenzcase-your-phone-glasses-in-one-minimalist-case"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T10:36:28.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
