Every month, the team aims to publish findings to shed light and raise awareness to the quality of meetings. With this information, they can help promote better meetings by sharing and providing monthly insights. This Meeting Sucks! (TMS) was conceived by Abe Reese, Align Us, Inc.’s President and Founder. He recalls, “After a particular meeting, I overheard a group say how they wished they had a 'This Meeting Sucks’ button that worked like American Idol, where after enough votes, the presenter was kicked off stage. So, I decided we should make that our first project at Align Us, Inc.”\nHe added, “It was a perfect, lighthearted, way to deliver something of real value to corporate America. Even if only one organization uses it to bring awareness to how simple it is to make your meetings rock– well, that's a win for us.\"\nWith the growth of the dotsucks vanity domain names, it was perfect for TMS to take advantage of the new trend as it perfectly fits its name. In Bloomberg Business’ Why the .Sucks Domain Doesn’t Have to Suck article, This Meeting Sucks! finds its way under the Memorable and Rebellious section. With a perfect domain name, TMS expect users and organizations to take advantage of the free app.\nThis Meeting Sucks! is very easy to use.\nSign up and log in using your email, Facebook, Twitter, or Google account. Enter your organization. Rate your meetings by toggling applicable reasons or by adding your very own. Share reports anonymously.\nAbout Align Us, Inc.: Align Us, Inc. is a software development company based in Chicago.
