According to island records, Lambert was deaf; his children, born after his arrival, were the first congenitally deaf residents of Martha’s Vineyard. They were also the beginning of a language and deaf culture unique to the island—one that used to thrive, but is now extinct.\nFor its first couple centuries, Chilmark was a rural fishing village, isolated from the other towns on the island. Getting to Chilmark from anywhere else “was probably a solid day’s journey over bad roads on a horse,” said Bowdoin Van Riper, the librarian at the Martha’s Vineyard Museum. Other towns had their own ports, which meant a consistent flow of outsiders coming in and out on ships; Chilmark had none. In seclusion, its residents married and had children almost exclusively with one another, and the Lamberts’ hereditary deafness soon spread throughout the town. By the middle of the 19th century, one in every 25 people in Chilmark was deaf. In the U.S. overall, by contrast, that number was roughly one in 5,700.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T16:19:45.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
