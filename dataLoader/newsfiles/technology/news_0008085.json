So he took it out on the $1,600 (Â£1,048) robot, known as Pepper, instead. \nThe humanoid was created specifically for SoftBank Mobile to greet and interact with customers in stores. \nAccording to Aldebaran, the creators of the bot, Pepper can converse with you , recognize or react to your emotions, and move autonomously. It is unknown whether he reacted to being angrily kicked. \nThe intelligent bot, which has been available to buy since June this year , can analyse your facial expressions, body language and the words you use to recognise five basic emotions: joy, surprise, anger, doubt and sadness. He can then respond in like, by adapting to your mood, by trying to cheer you up by playing a favourite song or telling a joke. \nA model of the Pepper robot that was attacked Photo: Bloomberg \nInvestigators told the Japan Times that security footage showed the drunken Ishikawa kicking the robot. While the human clerk was unharmed, the damaged Pepper now moves slower and its internal computer system may have been broken. \nThis recent case of rage against a robot comes in the wake of an incident with hitchBOT , a child-sized hitchhiking robot that relied on strangers to travel the world. In August, it was found with its head and arms ripped off, just two weeks into its first American tour. \nSimilarly, a video released last year by Boston Dynamics, owned by Google, showed a person kicking one of its dog-like robots in order demonstrate its self-stabilising ability. Animal rights charity PETA received so many complaints about the video that it was forced to issue a statement.Scientists believe that incidents like these might help robots to make people more empathetic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:56:19.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
