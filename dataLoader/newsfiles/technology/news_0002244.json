With the demand for reduction in critical water resource, the soil moisture sensors market is expected to have a wide scope of applications in areas such as agriculture, residential, landscaping and ground care, sports turf, weather forecasting, forestry, research studies, and construction. The growth of the soil moisture sensor market is driven by gradual shift in the climatic conditions, environmental regulations, and improved productivity. \nThe Americas accounted for a large market share followed by Europe and APAC in 2014. The market in APAC is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period. The Rest of World which includes the Middle East and Africa accounts for a small market share at present; however, it is expected to grow during the forecast period due to the increasing requirement of soil moisture sensors in this region. \nThis market, in spite of its exceptional demand, has some restraints in terms of its growth; the key restraints are the soil spatial variability and reliability which are inhibiting the growth of this market. The lack of awareness among people about soil moisture sensors is the major challenge of the soil moisture sensor market which needs to be addressed. Factors such as government incentives, advanced farming techniques, and decline in the average selling prices can generate huge opportunities for soil moisture sensor market in the near future. \nKey Topics Covered", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T16:59:59.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
