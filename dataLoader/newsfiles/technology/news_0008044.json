TNN | 09 September 2015, 8:40 AM IST Share \nSecurity firm Zscalar has reported a new mobile ransomware variant that uses pornography to lure victims into downloading and installing it. This ransomware acts as a porn app named 'Adult Player' and lures victims who assume it to be a pornographic video player. When the victim starts using it, the app takes a photo of the user, which is then displayed on their phone's screen along with the ransom message. The app demands $500, payable via PayPal. Adult Player does not allow its victims to operate their device and keeps the screen active with the ransom message. Restarting the device also does not work as the ransomware becomes active immediately after reboot, which leaves no scope for the victim to uninstall it. \nZscalar said the Adult Player app is not available on the Google Play store. Victims of the ransomware would have had to copy its '.apk' installation file from a third-party resource, and then even check the box in settings to allow their phones to run apps from non-trusted sources. \nTo avoid being a victim of such malware, the security firm recommends that users only download apps from trusted app stores such as Google Play. This can be enforced by unchecking the option of \"Unknown Sources\" under the \"Security\" settings in Android devices, it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T07:49:20.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
