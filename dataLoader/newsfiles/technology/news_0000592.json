Video surveillance is no longer just about security, it’s about staying connected with our homes and loved ones. Planned or unplanned, magic moments happen in our homes every day and we designed the Logi Circle as your destination for capturing and discovering them no matter where you are or what you’re doing. Now you can watch your kids playing or catch your dog chasing its tail even if you’re running errands, traveling for business or at the office.” \nExperience your home as it happens. Through the free iOS® or Android™ app you can stream Live HD Video with 2-Way Talk & Listen over Wi-Fi®. Smart filtering of all video happens with our Scene Intuition™ technology, so you see what matters most at home. It learns your home life patterns and filters the footage to send alerts only on interesting activity, so you don’t need to sift through spam footage. And, when you want to see what action has taken place in your home, Day Briefs™ provide an auto-generated, 30-second video summary of the best moments from that day. You can see this daily summary with one touch of the app. \nBecause life doesn’t stay still, the Logi Circle is portable and rechargeable. Take the camera room to room with you to stream for up to three hours, and when you need to recharge it simply place on the included magnetic charging ring. \nAvailability \nThe Logi Circle is the second product introduced under the new Logi label . The Logi Circle is available now for pre-order in the U.S. and in select countries in Europe for a suggested retail price of $199.99, and is expected to begin shipping in October 2015.
