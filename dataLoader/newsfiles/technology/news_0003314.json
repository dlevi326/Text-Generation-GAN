Today ZWSOFT would like to share the first prize review from Mr. Lee Wangje, a sophisticated architect with over 20 years of CAD experience, who chose ZWCAD for its functionality and cost-effectiveness.\nZWCAD Can Endure All Kinds of Tests\nBefore deciding to introduce ZWCAD to his company, Mr. Lee had run multiple tests, mainly on its compatibility and performance. Compatibility was tested in three aspects, namely its file format compatibility, external resources compatibility and compatibility with different versions. “The results of the compatibility tests are very satisfying,” Mr. Lee commented. “ZWCAD can not only fully support many different formats like .dwg and .dwt, but also work smoothly with external resources like external references. Other versions are also fully supported — there is no problem in opening and editing drawings that have been created using other versions.”\nZWCAD Is Really Easy-to-navigate and Fast\n“When it comes to switching to other CAD programs, many designers would be reluctant to accept it,” Mr. Lee said. “But switching to ZWCAD is not even a problem. it has a very similar UI and commands to AutoCAD. Speed is another big advantage that should be stressed in ZWCAD. The installation package of ZWCAD is smaller than other CAD software which largely lowers requirements for computer configurations and takes up less memory. Because of these, it runs very fast when it comes to opening and saving drawings and saves a lot of time processing large-sized drawings. Still speed is also reflected in printing drawings — ZWCAD can export and print drawings really fast, which also increases efficiency a lot.”\n“I first heard ZWCAD in 2000. Honestly I didn’t expect much from ZWCAD, because the market was dominated by AutoCAD in Korea,” said Mr. Lee. “But looking at the data from all kinds of rigid tests and users’ positive feedback, I am impressed by the high performance of ZWCAD, and I really think I made a right choice.”\n*Out of respect for Mr. Lee, the article and all the content in it can’t be copied or forwarded.\nAbout ZWSOFT\nZWCAD Software Co., Ltd. is an international CAD software provider through its network of over 300 partners in 80+ countries and regions.
