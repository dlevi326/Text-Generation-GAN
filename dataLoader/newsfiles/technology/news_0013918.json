The won paced gains by developing currencies after Standard & Poor’s upgraded South Korea’s credit ratings.\nSamsung Electronics Co. headed for a four-week high in Seoul, pacing gains by technology shares, while Hyundai Motor Co. rose to its highest level since May. The won strengthened to a two-week high. Baoxin Auto Group jumped by the most on record in Hong Kong after China’s biggest listed car dealer said it’s in talks to buy a stake in the company. Citic Securities Co. fell in Shanghai after confirming its president was being investigated.\nThe MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 1 percent to 814.43 at 12:19 p.m. in Hong Kong, poised for its highest close since Aug. 31. U.S. retail sales rose for a second month in August, signaling the resilience of American consumers amid the countdown to the Federal Reserve’s policy decision on Thursday. Traders see a 32 percent chance of an increase in borrowing costs, up from as low as 26 percent on Monday but still below the 50 percent odds before China’s yuan devaluation last month.\n“Investors are paying more attention to the strong retail sales data,” Jeffrosenberg Tan, a portfolio manager at PT Sinarmas Asset Management. “If the Fed raised the rate this week, that will remove a lot of uncertainties from the market and give a strong signal that the U.S. economy is ready to take the baton from China as the next engine of growth for the world.”\nAll 10 industry groups in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index advanced, led by a gauge of technology companies, which jumped 1.9 percent. The developing-nations stock gauge has dropped 15 percent this year and trades at 10.8 times its estimated 12-month earnings. The MSCI World Index of developed-nation stocks has lost 4.3 percent in 2015 and is valued at 15.2 times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T08:22:58.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
