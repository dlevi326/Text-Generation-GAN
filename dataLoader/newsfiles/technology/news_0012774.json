SiteJabber is able to offer these services for free because it generates revenue through other channels: Google advertising, lead generation and dedicated customer support services. \nStarting today, online businesses can access the following reputation management tools on SiteJabber free of charge: Unlimited review collection: collect unlimited customer reviews to build online reputation, diminish the impact of negative reviews and generate new leads. Unlimited public and private responses to reviews : directly resolve customer complaints and communicate with customers. Review page at the top of Google search results : many prospective customers search for a business’ brand plus the words “reviews” or “complaints,” making it critical for businesses to actively manage a review page. Trust seals and review widgets : recognized seals and widgets build trust and improve conversion rates on any business’ website. 24-hour account support : 24-hour email support to resolve any issues or address reviews that may violate SiteJabber’s guidelines. \nSiteJabber Facts and Figures 5,000 online businesses registered for SiteJabber for Business during beta testing, including Lowe’s ATGStores and Ebates Registered businesses have seen overwhelmingly positive results from SiteJabber for Business, including one e-commerce business seeing a 1,400% increase in reviews, 263% increase in website leads and 20% increase in total onsite revenue 700,000+ members in the SiteJabber community 50,000+ businesses reviewed 34 million+ consumers have used SiteJabber to research online businesses $1.25 million in funding from the U.S. Government’s National Science Foundation and private investors 500Startups and Seraph Group \nAbout SiteJabber \nSiteJabber is the leading online review community that helps consumers find great online businesses and avoid online scams.
