He left EBay, the online marketplace operator, in July after nine years as chief financial officer and remains on the San Jose, California-based company’s board.\nPrivate equity firms are increasingly hiring industry experts both to differentiate themselves when buying companies and to work on improving the businesses, rather than relying on leverage and rising markets for investment returns. General Atlantic, which this year acquired stakes in companies including Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc., previously hired Gary Reiner, General Electric Co.’s former chief information officer, and Anish Batlaw, a former operating partner at buyout firm TPG Capital.\nBlackstone Group LP, the biggest buyout firm, counts former Unilever chief operating officer Harish Manwani and former Boeing Co. executive Jim Albaugh among its senior advisers. At KKR & Co., advisers include David Cote, who is Honeywell International Inc.’s chief executive officer, and former Caterpillar Inc. Chairman Jim Owens. Carlyle Group LP this year added former Wal-Mart Stores Inc. CEO Mike Duke to advise on consumer and retail deals.\n“Bob’s deep expertise in the Internet and technology sector will make him an exceptional asset,” Bill Ford, General Atlantic’s CEO, said in the statement.\nGeneral Atlantic, started in 1980, oversaw $17.4 billion as of June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:13:55.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
