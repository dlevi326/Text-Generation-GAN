Retro Infinity intends to re-release classic video games from the late 80’s and 90’s. They have licensed hundreds of amazing retro games that were played on consoles and PC's created by such legendary video gaming companies as Amiga, Atari, and others. The Retro Infinity Player is a software engine that allows these timeless games to be played on today’s mobile phones, tablets, smart TVs and streaming set-top devices. Imagine playing those great games on devices such as an iPhone, Android, Windows Phone, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, and Roku.\nMany of these games have been unavailable to play for years because the software is incompatible with today's mobile platforms, but the Retro Infinity Player is the solution. However, before everyone can enjoy these classic games, Retro Infinity needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $100,000 by October 7, 2015. The funds raised will go towards completing the software development and releasing the Retro Infinity Player.\nTo help bring this innovative software engine to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered between November 2015 and May 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help Retro Infinity reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: Eric Mitchell\nTitle: President, Amiga Games, Inc.\nPhone: 310-461-3737\nemail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
