Varun Jain | 22 September 2015, 10:10 AM IST Share NEW DELHI: The next time you look for fashion on Myntra, Artie will help you find the latest styles and designs with little effort.Myntra, the online fashion store owned by Flipkart, has launched Moda Rapido, a fashion brand powered by artificial intelligence. Artie is a robot character created by Myntra to represent Moda Rapido, the in-house brand that the company says will be capable of offering new styles and designs to its consumers every week round the year.The software will scan fashion data available on the Internet looking for what consumers are looking for, and using that data it will come up with the key attributes that they like.\"We will bring new products every week. We will react to everything that is selling well, go back and make it, and bring it for our customers in 20 days,\" said Gautam Kotamraju, senior vice president for new initiatives at Myntra. \"We have a nimble supply chain which allows us to do so.\"It took eight months for a 25-member tech team at Myntra to build this brand at its Bengaluru facility. Myntra used computer vision for machine to learn fashion and its attributes and had a few design specialists who helped the machine to learn.\"Our artificial intelligence tells us what material we have on one side and what people are liking on the other side and therefore it puts across a basic skeletal framework together for the in-house designers, who would then tweak the designs according to the demand,\" Kotamraju said.Ecommerce majors like Snapdeal and Flipkart are aggressively working on technological fronts to engage more with their customers. Flipkart, the market leader, recently introduced Ping, a messaging platform which allows online shoppers to consult with friends and others in real-time to make a decision on what to buy. It also launched a feature called the Image Search, which allows users to upload an image of the product they are looking for and find visually similar stuff on the platform. Rival Snapdeal has introduced findmystyle.in, a tool that filters the wide catalogue of apparels and footwear to show the most relevant products without the traditional way of using filters like keywords, brands, price, etc.\"Whatever products you see under the Moda Rapido brand are based purely on (artificial) intelligence and there are no designers involved in the process,\" said Ganesh Subramanian, head of new initiatives at Myntra. \"It is machine created mostly. We are calling it the Insta Trend.\"Initially, the brand will offer popular items such as jeans and t-shirts for men and women and then extend it to other categories.According to Myntra, this is the first step and in 2016 it will start sharing the insights and intelligence with their other partners as well.\"We will tell them (suppliers) the attributes which are working well. Those with the nimble supply chain and have the ability to react within the timeframe will react. When they start making products according to consumer liking, it will help both of us to go a long way in increasing our consumers,\" said Kotamraju.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T08:11:27.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
