Plural is a full cut-off performance LED fixture, with narrow or medium down light distribution options, packaged in a chic, tapered profile and fluted form. Like the recent release of exterior fixtures, Plural is designed for exterior wall lighting applications such as egress and mullion applications. Glass façades are popular and until now, there have been few aesthetically pleasing options; these exterior fixtures were created with that application in mind. If you are looking for continuity in design, the same fixture can be mounted to the mullion inside and out.\n\"Plural is another perfect addition to Visa Lighting's portfolio of modern, high-performing exterior products\", says Cindy Vera, Vice President of Sales & Marketing.\nThese budget-friendly fixtures, not only meet a wide variety of exterior lighting requirements, but they are sustainable as well. They are made from recyclable materials and designed with LED sources for long life and low power consumption. The white LED color temperature options range from 3000K to 4000K and are dimmable down to 10%.\nCreated and tested to the high quality standards that are Visa Lighting’s hallmark, these robust LED exterior fixtures have an IP65 rating for dust and water intrusion, are made in the USA, and include a 5-year warranty. Visa Lighting offers many quality fixtures for exterior environments, ranging from the newest contemporary styles to traditional applications.\nLearn More about Plural and the latest exterior products from Visa Lighting\nAbout Visa Lighting: Located in Milwaukee, Wis., Visa Lighting products are manufactured and assembled in the United States.
