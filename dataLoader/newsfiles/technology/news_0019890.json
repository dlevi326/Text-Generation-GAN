At worst, it is a temporary inconvenience to users of our website.\n“We have a duty to balance the value of keeping our website accessible with the cost of doing so, especially in the face of a threat which can scale up endlessly.\n“The measures we have in place at present mean that our site is generally up and running again within 30 minutes, though occasionally it can take longer. We think that’s proportionate.”\nTwitter/@Lizardmafia The Lizard Squad is an infamous hacking group\nLizard Stresser is seen as a “DDos for hire” facility which gained notoriety among the hacking community after the group known as Lizard Squad claimed to have used it to knock Sony PlayStation and Xbox gaming services offline last Christmas.\nNone of those arrested in the most recent police activity are accused of involvement in those incidents, nor are they believed to be members of Lizard Squad.\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) said they are suspected of maliciously deploying Lizard Stresser, having bought it using alternative payment services such as Bitcoin in an attempt to remain anonymous.\nOrganisations believed to have been targeted by the suspects include a national newspaper, a school, gaming companies and a number of online retailers. They have not been named and it has not been confirmed whether the attempted DDoS attacks were successful.\nThe arrests were made as part of an operation codenamed Vivarium, co-ordinated by the NCA and involving officers from several police forces.\nThose arrested last week were an 18-year-old from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire; an 18-year-old from Manchester ; a 16-year-old from Northampton; and a 15-year-old from Stockport .\nHack attack: The NCA website was brought down in a massive DDoS attack\nTwo other suspects, both 17, were arrested earlier this year. One is from Cardiff while the other is from Northolt, north-west London.\nAll six have been bailed, while a further two 18-year-olds - one from Manchester and one from Milton Keynes - were interviewed under caution.\nAs part of the same operation, officers are visiting around 50 addresses linked to individuals who are registered on the Lizard Stresser website - but who are not suspected of involvement in attacks.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://t.co/5631pELDMR", "http://t.co/hxhAuSdoqq", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/offline?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/LizardLands/status/638617494702399488", "http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/691-operation-vivarium-targets-users-of-lizard-squad-s-website-attack-tool", "http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/stockport", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/jasperhamill", "http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-09-01T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:09:23.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
