(Photo: John Shinal, for USA TODAY)\n6 CONNECT 62 TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE SAN FRANCISCO — Softbank President Nikesh Arora is looking to make huge investments in technology companies right now – just not in the U.S.\nThe former chief business officer of Google, who spent a decade at the search giant and made millions from its surging stock price, is writing big checks all over the globe.\nHis new job is to “acquire more assets…more technology companies around the world” for Softbank, the Japanese conglomerate founded 35 years ago by investor Masayoshi Son.\nMost of the checks Softbank is writing for these deals “are between $100 million and $1 billion,” Arora told an audience gathered here for the second day of the TechCrunch DisruptSF conference.\nFor example, Softbank in June poured $1 billion into Korean e-commerce company Coupang, which is attacking a market worth $15 billion, Arora says.\nLast October, in one of the first big stakes Softbank took after Arora came on board, the company invested $627 million in Snapdeal, an Indian online retailer.\nIn August, Softbank joined another $500 million investment round in Snapdeal, in a round led by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.\nPeople walk in the headquarters campus of Alibaba in Hangzhou, China.
