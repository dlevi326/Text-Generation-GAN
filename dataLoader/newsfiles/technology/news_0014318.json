The researchers used the measures of impulsivity, social problem solving, and criminal thinking. \nThe study results showed that offenders who did not complete the programme had significantly higher levels of non-planning impulsivity than those who did. The researchers also found out from their results that non-completers were at a higher risk of reconviction. \nNo significant differences were found between completers and non-completers for social problem solving and criminal thinking, as well as no significant differences between the two groups for age. \nDr Emma Palmer said: \"It is a well-established research finding that those offenders who complete programmes have lower rates of reconviction than no treatment comparison groups and that non-completers have worse reconviction outcomes than both completers and those offenders who do not participate in programmes. \n\"Therefore, the finding that non-completers of offender rehabilitation programmes have higher levels of impulsivity than those offenders who complete has obvious implications for practice, suggesting that some offenders need extra support to engage with rehabilitation programmes. \n\"Although these programmes usually include impulsivity as a treatment target it is likely also to be beneficial to these high risk offenders to receive additional pre-programme work and/or ongoing support during the programme itself.\" 2 hours ago 0 What is the best way to protect the community from sex offenders?
