The Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) is hosting both the Storage Developer Conference ( SDC ) and the Data Storage Security Summit ( DSSS ) next week at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Santa Clara. \nCryptsoft will once again be presenting at SDC, focussing on the background, selection and deployment of standards based enterprise key management using KMIP. Tim Hudson, (Cryptsoft CTO) will bring his unique style to this presentation whilst sharing some examples of what not to do when selecting your encryption key management solution. \nTony Cox, Justin Corlett and Tim Hudson are also presenting at the inaugural Data Storage Security Summit. The event is an opportunity for those faced with the challenge of securing data to hear directly from industry leaders and to participate in panels and round table sessions to provide insights into solution providers such as HP, Thales, Vormetric and others. \n\"As the data storage industry continues to embrace standardised enterprise key management for its data encryption key management requirements, events like this enable industry experts to dispel much of the creative marketing messages delivered by those who have failed to keep up with market reality,\" said Tony Cox, Director Business Development, Strategy & Alliances at Cryptsoft. \"With large financial medical insurance and government institutions now basing purchasing decisions on a vendor's ability to deliver standards based encryption key management across the enterprise, events such as these are becoming critical sources of market intelligence for key decision makers.\" \nStorage Developer Conference (SDC) - www.snia.org/events/storage-developer \nData Storage Security Summit (DSSS) - www.snia.org/dss-summit \nCRYPTSOFT Pty Ltd is a privately held Australian company that operates worldwide in the enterprise key management security market.
