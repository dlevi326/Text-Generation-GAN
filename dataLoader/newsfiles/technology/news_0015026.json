The videos range in subject matter from storage unit size guides and sales tools to educational and marketing materials. September 09, 2015 19:12 ET | Source: StorageFront.com \nIRVINE, Calif., Sept. 9, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - StorageFront.com, an online marketplace for self storage, announced today the release of a series of best in class self storage videos. The videos were produced through a partnership between Janus international Group, the self storage industry's leading manufacturer of steel roll-up doors and building components and storelocal Corporation, which owns StorageFront.com. They include various size guides as well as tools to educate customers on insurance options and the benefits of renting online. \nJanus International Group LLC also produced installation videos and product images that will be used to educate clients in emerging markets. \n\"Janus International was pleased to be asked to partner with storeLocal for their self storage size guide video project. It provided storeLocal the opportunity to use our products to shoot their videos while allowing us to showcase our industry-leading door and hallway systems, our new SecurGuardâ„¢ Electronic Lock, and ADA solutions,\" said Janus International VP of Business Development Terry Bagley. \"We are using the video and still shots obtained from the video shoot to upgrade our marketing materials, develop new ones, and enhance the content we are delivering on our website.\" \nThe storelocal cooperative will also provide a white label version of the videos to storelocal members that they can use on their own business websites. To customize the white label product, co-op members will work directly with the production company that produced the videos, CastFam Incorporated. \nBy providing world-class size guides, storelocal is giving yet another online conversion tool to its members. Companies that have implemented video size guides have seen the number of online renters who change unit sizes at the facility drop by 40%. The efficiencies these videos bring co-op members will add to their bottom line. \n\"This partnership is a perfect example of collaboration. Janus and storelocal needed marketing tools and together were able to produce a higher quality result at minimal cost,\" said storelocal CEO Lance Watkins. \nStorageFront.com and storelocal thank Janus International Group and CastFam Incorporated greatly for their help with this project.
