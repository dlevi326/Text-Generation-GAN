Rubio said a key part of that is for the government to avoid new regulations and to roll back existing ones that can serve as barriers to entry. Rubio met with several entrepreneurs, including moving service Bellhops, which coordinates the logistics of managing thousands of college student contractors around the country; image digitizer Southtree; and Torch, the makers of a Wi-Fi router designed to give parents more control over their children's online behavior. Rubio said his limited-government philosophy translates well to tech-savvy young people who have come to rely on innovations like online ride-sharing service Uber instead of traditional taxis. »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T15:30:41.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
