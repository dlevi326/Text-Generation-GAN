This new version builds on the integrated nature of Bedrock as a unified platform for managing a Hadoop data lake and adds several new features, including improved user experience and reporting capabilities as well as extended support for complex metadata management. Bedrock is widely recognized as the only integrated platform for data management across the entire Hadoop data pipeline – ingestion, organization, enrichment, and extraction – providing a single interface from which to leverage the full power of Hadoop, and unlock the true value of big data. By continuing to make it easier for enterprises to manage and use all of their structured and unstructured data, Zaloni is providing enterprise organizations with the information they need to make critical business decisions on-the-fly.\nKey new functionality in Zaloni Bedrock 3.3 includes:\n Operational dashboards – built-in dashboards and reports for Ingestion, Workflow, Metadata and Data Quality provide highly flexible, customized and extensible reporting for users.

Visualization on complex data structures like array, struct and map\n Spark support for workflow – workflow actions now support Spark as an execution environment, along with MapReduce. Allows users to share RDD’s across various actions to improve execution performance\n User Experience Improvements - streamlined User Experience leveraging Google Material Design pattern Quote: s\n“When people think about the power of big data, they are imagining omniscience.
