It was severely affected by the sub prime mortgage crisis and home foreclosures. However, from now until 2020, I am confident that industry will continue improving due to recovering residential and commercial construction.\" Curtains add color and textures which will make any living space more inviting to be in. It can provide shade and privacy when needed, says Cattya Bella, Director of Product Development for World Patent Marketing. However, hanging up curtains can be quite dangerous, most particularly when done alone. Normally, one would have to step onto a ladder or chair just to reach the curtain rod. If they are alone, they risk having to accidentally fall off when they lose their balance. But with the aid of the unique invention known as the Curtain Hanger, this will no longer happen. The Curtain Hanger is a household invention which provides an easier and safer method for changing or hanging curtains. It is fitted with features such as a clamp and extendable pole to ensure that no curtain rod is too high to reach. In addition to this, the Curtain Hanger limits and even prevents people, particularly the elderly, from stepping onto a ladder or chair when hanging curtains. Replacing curtains can be quite difficult and unsafe, most particularly if a person lives alone, says Loureynold P., inventor of the Curtain Hanger. Curtain rods located in hard to reach spots would force people to step on a chair or ladder. This can be quite dangerous because these items tend to wobble even with the slightest movement. The Curtain Hanger is a household invention that can be adjusted to the desired length to reach the curtain rod. Bessie Arnott, a caregiver and blogger from Cleveland, OH has this to say about the Curtain Hanger: As one gets older, balance and dexterity can be affected, causing a person to be less efficient. This household invention will help the elderly change their curtains at home and also double as an extended arm to reach for other things such as cans placed on the top shelf of a cabinet. Putting up curtains can be quite difficult, especially for the elderly. Thanks to this household invention, anyone, no matter how young or old, will be able to hang all the curtains they want with ease!
