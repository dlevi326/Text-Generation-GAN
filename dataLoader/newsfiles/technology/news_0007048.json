Based on client feedback, Rentec Direct simplified the interface for the software's tenant screening access so users can view an applicant’s address when ordering background reports online. Rentec Direct offers powerful online software for property managers and landlords who seek simple solutions for handling business tasks related to managing rental properties. One of the software’s most useful features includes instant access to tenant screening reports , such as credit reports, criminal background, and eviction history.\nRentec Direct allows property managers and landlords to order tenant screening reports on individuals who submit an online rental application. The program uses the applicant’s personal information provided on the rental application to pre-populate the tenant screening order form but the system requires users to manually enter an applicant’s current address. The recent update displays an applicant’s address on the tenant screening order form directly above the input fields for users to as reference for manual entry.\n“Our previous interface required users to take an extra step when inputting an applicant’s information into the screening report order form - mainly, an applicant’s address was not easily accessible or visible between the rental application and the report order form, so users had to write down the address for reference or memorize it,” explains Nathan Miller, President of Rentec Direct’s. “We updated the system to now display an applicant’s current address for reference right there on the order form. This new update significantly improves the ease of use and makes ordering screening reports even more instantaneous.”\nTo find out more about how Rentec Direct’s property management software can improve a property manager’s workflow and streamline business processes today, visit https://www.rentecdirect.com/ .\nAbout Rentec Direct\nRentec Direct provides affordable property management software solutions to property managers and landlords.
