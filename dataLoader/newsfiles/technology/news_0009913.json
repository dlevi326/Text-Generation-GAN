The offer ends along with the F1 Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday, September 20.\nThose lucky enough to book a supercar will ride one of seven different models: the Aston Martin DB9 Volante convertible, the Aston Martin DBS Volante convertible, the Maserati GranTurismo, the Maserati Quattroporte Sports GTS, the McLaren MP4-12C, the Porsche C4S 911 Cabriolet or the Porsche Carrera.\nHowever, there is a catch. Like Uber's supercar rides, GrabTaxi's vehicles are limited to just one passenger, so Singaporeans hoping to take this as an opportunity to impress a date are out of luck.\nBesides giving out luxurious free rides, GrabTaxi is also doing something special for the mid-Autumn festival that's celebrated in some Asian countries like Singapore and China. The company is letting its users order mooncakes, a traditional Chinese pastry, during the festival -- the cakes themselves will be free, though buyers will have to fork out S$38 ($27) for delivery.\nBoth Uber and GrabTaxi have been testing different promotions in the country; in July Uber had drones deliver customers ice cream , while GrabTaxi allowed users to order deliveries of durians, a local delicacy.\nSingapore is a hotly contested battleground for transportation booking apps. GrabTaxi was polled last year to be the most popular , beating local taxi giant Comfort-Delgro's app, while US-based Uber came in a distant third for taxi bookings. Besides competing in this race, GrabTaxi also last year launched GrabCar , a similar service to Uber's Black program.", "external_links": ["http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/grabtaxi-comfortdelgro-flagged-as-most-popular-straits-times-online-poll", "http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/16/5253e03a-261f-4393-85c1-e79a0060dcd9/resize/970x546/13dc6585092a4b7c4db43281ac6f6f72/grabtaxi-supercar.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-16T11:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:43:09.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
