The Met Police’s cybercrime unit FALCON confirmed to the Telegraph that it was currently investigating these attacks, which spiked to 41 cases globally in June alone. \nA cybersecurity report released by US firm Akamai found that the number of attacks by DD4BC had hugely increased since it began its reign of terror last year – resulting in more than 140 attacks to date. \nThe report also found that 58pc of the attacks targeted the financial services sector . Banks and credit unions accounted for 35pc of the attacks on financial services companies, 13pc involved currency exchanges, and the rest were payment processing companies. \nThe number of Bitcoin attacks by DD4BC have spiked since April. \n\"The latest attacks – focused primarily on the financial service industry – involved new strategies and tactics intended to harass, extort and ultimately embarrass the victim publically,\" said Stuart Scholly, manager of Akamai's security division, in a statement. \nThe UK National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT UK), which runs a national cyber-threat data-sharing initiative, confirms a “marked increase” in reports of attacks by DD4BC against its partners – which include Lloyd’s Bank and BAE Systems. \n58 pc of the extortion ring's targets were in financial services industry How do they attack? \nDD4BC sends an email with a 48-hour deadline, saying they require a payment in Bitcoin – anywhere from 25 Bitcoin ($6,150) to 100 Bitcoin ($25,000) – to be sent to an account. \nThey then do a “demo-hack” on a small part of the victim’s infrastructure, to prove they mean business. We do bad things, but we keep our word Extract from DD4BC's ransom email \nThere are many hundreds of ways to conduct a DDOS attack, which the group specialises in. “They often blend several approaches, which is harder to defend against,” said James Chappell, co-founder of Digital Shadows, a London-based cybersecurity company that monitors the internet looking for threats, and helps defend their clients against cyberattack. \nIf victims don’t pay, a larger-scale attack is launched, knocking the bank’s client-facing services offline. To the outside world, it would look like the website going down. \n“What’s interesting about DD4BC is they are focusing on quite large institutions, which are usually well protected,” Chappell said. “But their whole extortion process has been industrialised and professionalised.” What's the fallout? \nThe fallout is both quantitative and qualitative. According to DDoS mitigation firm Neustar, which analysed the results of hacking data from 300 financial institutions, banks have the potential to lose upto $100,000 per hour, because of downtime-related costs and possible fraud, during a DDoS attack. \nAnd the outage can cause aftershocks. The Akamai team’s research showed that DD4BC recently threatened to expose targeted organisations via social media, thus tarnishing the company's reputation among the public, leading to longer-term costs. Who are these people anyway? \nThe identity of the group remains closely guarded, but DD4BC has been responsible for a large number of Bitcoin extortion campaigns since September 2014. \nThey started out targeting the online gaming and gambling industries whose systems were poorly protected, but have moved on to bigger fish. \n“What we do know is the emails are written in good English, but it’s hard to deduce anything in the linguistics about their nationality,” Chappell says. \nThey’re clearly well organised, experienced and careful: “The only evidence we have at the moment is the IP addresses, and the emails they’ve sent but both have been set up to provide the attacker a high level of anonymity,” Chappell said. “We are waiting for some slip up in their operational security or behaviour to give us a bigger clue.” So should these institutions pay? \nDigital Shadows has had multiple banking clients attacked by DD4BC. While the company won’t directly reveal client names, it is part of an incubation programme sponsored by major banks like Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Santander and UBS – many of whom are now their clients. \n“Our advice to these clients is never to pay the criminals, as that’s morally and ethically wrong,” said Chappell. “I’m pretty sure none of our clients will have paid, because of the size of these institutions. Plus, getting a sign off for someone in corporate to buy Bitcoin is a struggle anyway.” How do you stay safe? \nThe best approach to fight off DD4BC is to be prepared and get your infrastructure set up with defence and mitigation systems – this is the only measure that can help targets survive a DDoS attack with as little fallout as possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T19:53:20.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
