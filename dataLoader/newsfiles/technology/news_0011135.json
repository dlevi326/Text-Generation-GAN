Some people are nostalgic for those days. \nOne feature that constantly floats to the top of the rumor pool is Force Touch , which would bring pressure sensitivity combined with haptic feedback into the mix. You would no longer just swipe at your touchscreen, but instead press into it and feel it respond. \nAs usual, we can look forward to some bumps in specs, with the likelihood of an upgraded camera and a new processor for more speed and power. The topic of longer battery life once again arises and iPhone fans may get it courtesy of iOS 9's new low-power mode. \nIf specs and design features don't wow you , maybe some new color choices will. There's a chance this fresh batch of iPhones could come out in a selection of colors we haven't seen before. The word \"pink\" has been mentioned. Apple could even step into the bling game with a 14-karat gold \"Edition\" version made to go with the top-of-the-line Apple Watch. \nYou know the possibilities, so which of these upgrades would you most like to see in the iPhone 6S? Vote in our poll and talk it out in the comments. Then, check into CNET's live coverage of the event on September 9.
