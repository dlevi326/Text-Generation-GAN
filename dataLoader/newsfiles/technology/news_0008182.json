Tubelite operates nine distribution centers in eight states: Florida, New Jersey, North Carolina, Alabama, Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee and Arizona. \n\"We're always looking for the newest products on the market that can help our customers operate more efficiently and better manage their costs,\" says Bill Dickinson, digital products manager of Tubelite. \"Spike does just that. Our customers can create quicker estimates and site surveys, which allows them to take on more jobs.\" \nWith Spike, sign and digital graphics professionals can quickly capture accurate measurements of the width, height and area of signage locations from a smartphone or tablet picture. A ladder, bucket truck and tape measure are no longer required to create estimates, saving sign companies time and overhead costs on a traditionally lengthy process. \nThe measurements of the sign or graphic location are saved with the Spike photo and can be shared with customers, designers or production team to create job estimates and design proofs, assess installation and complete permit applications. If additional measurements are needed, users can refer to their saved Spike photos at any time to make modifications. There's no need to return to the site for further measurements or estimations. \n\"ikeGPS is excited to be working with Tubelite, one of the largest and most respected suppliers to the sign, screen printing and digital imaging industries in the U.S.,\" says Jeff Ross, chief marketing officer of ikeGPS. \nFor more information on purchasing Spike, contact your local Tubelite representative or the Tubelite sales department at 800-505-4900. \nAbout ikeGPS ikeGPS is changing the way the world is measured, utilizing its smart laser measurement solutions to capture, record and export measurement data.
