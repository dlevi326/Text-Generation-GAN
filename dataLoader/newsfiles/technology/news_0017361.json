Unisys Corporation (NYSE: UIS ) today announced a modernization program and a Platform Management service for the BMC Remedy Service Management Suite . Both are designed to help organizations expand the range of digitally delivered, personalized business and IT services that enable their users to increase productivity and deliver improved business results. The new Unisys modernization program for BMC Remedy helps organizations streamline the transition to the latest versions of the Remedy platform. The Platform Management service enables enterprise clients to optimize the capabilities of the Remedy suite and simplify ongoing management of the environment. Unisys will showcase both sets of services from September 8-10 in Booth 421 at the BMC Engage 2015 conference in Las Vegas . Unisys is a Silver Sponsor of the event. \"Through our new modernization and Platform Management services, enterprise clients can benefit from the experience Unisys has gained by installing and managing enterprise instances of the Remedy suite around the world,\" said Paul Gleeson , global vice president, Edge Services, Unisys. \"Our operational expertise and analytics-based enhancements enable organizations to unlock the full power of the Remedy platform for new digital services that help boost their employees' productivity, grow their business and serve their customers more effectively.\" Modernization Program Opens the Way for New Capabilities from Remedy Organizations using versions earlier than Remedy 8.1 will face a tipping point in 2016, as users demand new features such as an enterprise service catalog, advanced service level reporting and analytics, and personalized mobile support. Many will lack the expertise or the time to migrate to the newer versions quickly and cost-efficiently to capitalize on the newest capabilities for more effective service management. Unisys can help Remedy clients take a comprehensive inventory of their current processes and understand how they are using their current version and then help them create a transition plan – covering technology, processes and people – to move data, workflows and other unique items and map them to the platform version of the client's choice. Unisys service personnel use data on service performance gathered through analytical tools to discover the root causes of prior service degradation and outages down to the component level. This advanced analytics information can be used to pre-empt future service issues, streamlining operations and maintaining individual users' productivity. Similarly, Unisys can help organizations use information about individual users and their service history to further customize the personalized support that end users can obtain through Remedy's MyIT self-service application. Platform Management Improves Planning and Availability in Day-to-Day Operations Unisys delivers the Platform Management service for BMC Remedy in combination with Unisys Service Management Advisory and Consulting Services and Unisys Service Management Implementation, Integration and Optimization Services . This approach provides organizations a three-step methodology to better plan, optimize and run a digital service management environment. Unisys provides comprehensive, cost-efficient management of key Remedy functions, such as system configurations, patch management, additions to the service catalog and administrative rights. The Platform Management service enables organizations to benefit especially from two key proprietary solutions that Unisys has developed for BMC Remedy: Unisys Resilient ITSM Service (URISE) and Unisys Short Maintenance Window (SMW) to reduce planned and unplanned outages, enhance platform performance and increase platform availability – a key metric in today's global 24/7 digital business. URISE links system, application, database and network architectures through an analytics-based methodology that makes it easier to do large-scale planned maintenance and disaster recovery. The solution factors in service-event history to predict the amount of time required to make proactive equipment and software upgrades. Through that process, URISE can reduce planned outage hours by up to 90 percent,* enabling users to stay more consistently productive. Using a process similar to that of URISE, Unisys SMW enables management of shorter-term patches, upgrades and maintenance. It can reduce planned downtime hours by an average of 85 percent and unplanned hours by an average of 56 percent.* Clients can also have the platform monitored both to identify and resolve key application-level issues not normally encountered and to take proactive steps to adjust and correct issues before they become incidents affecting normal platform operations. The modernization program and Platform Management service are the latest additions to the Unisys Edge Service Management suite for the BMC platform. These offerings give digital businesses access to personalized, on-demand, \"always on\" business and IT services to support their workers, partners and clients. Professionals from the Unisys Service Management practice deliver managed services for the BMC Remedy platform, from planning, implementation and optimization to long-term management of Remedy solutions. Unisys' proven approach to service management, recognized as a leader in the 2014 Forrester Research, Inc. \"Wave\" report , helps clients realize the full potential of their investments in BMC Remedy while also providing an enterprise-wide framework for delivery of services crucial to the operations of a digital business.
