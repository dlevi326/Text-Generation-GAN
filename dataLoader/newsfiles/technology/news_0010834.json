Scientists make rubber that can heal itself September 24, 2015 Credit: The American Chemical Society \nFew things will ruin a day faster than a flat tire. But what if you never had to break out that spare again? Scientists have developed a new type of rubber that can heal itself after a tear or break. \nAmit Das and his colleagues at the Leibniz Institute for Polymer Research in Dresden, Germany, published their research in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces. \nSee more in the latest episode of ACS Headline Science here: This video is not supported by your browser at this time. New insight into how rubber is made could improve tires, reduce air pollution February 11, 2015 \nPeople have been making rubber products from elastic bands to tires for centuries, but a key step in this process has remained a mystery. In a report in the ACS journal Macromolecules, scientists have described this elusive ... Video: Sunglasses on demand March 17, 2015 \nApart from their style, sunglasses have changed very little in the last few decades. Photochromic lenses that change from clear to tinted in sunlight were a big breakthrough. Video: Silk sponges that can help the body heal April 21, 2015 \nA team at Tufts University has developed materials using ordinary silk that can be programmed to help the body heal. Video: Why are we still fighting tuberculosis? June 4, 2015 \nIt's a disease that has plagued humans since the Paleolithic era: tuberculosis. After centuries of deaths and decades of research, why are we still fighting this deadly disease? Toward tires that repair themselves September 23, 2015 \nA cut or torn tire usually means one thing—you have to buy a new one. But some day, that could change. For the first time, scientists have made tire-grade rubber without the processing step—vulcanization—that has been ... Recommended for you Study explores hybrid ultrasmall gold nanocluster for enzymatic fuel cells September 24, 2015 \nWith fossil-fuel sources dwindling, better biofuel cell design is a strong candidate in the energy field. In research published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Los Alamos researchers and external collaborators ... Researchers redefine the rules of chemistry September 18, 2015 \nResearch by a Northumbria academic could have a significant impact on the teaching of chemistry after he developed a radical new interpretation of a 99-year-old rule featured in all standard textbooks. The world's nitrogen fixation, explained September 23, 2015 \nYale University scientists may have cracked a part of the chemical code for one of the most basic, yet mysterious, processes in the natural world—nature's ability to transform nitrogen from the air into usable nitrogen ... Liquid crystals show potential for detection of neuro-degenerative disease September 23, 2015 \nLiquid crystals are familiar to most of us as the somewhat humdrum stuff used to make computer displays and TVs. Even for scientists, it has not been easy to find other ways of using them. Researchers develop a library of elastin-like proteins to help in creating synthetic designs September 23, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—A pair of researchers at Duke University has built a library of protein data that outlines the specific amino acid sequences that control changes of many elastin proteins. In their paper published in the journal ... New synthesis method imitates the way molecules were formed at the dawn of life on Earth September 23, 2015 \nResearchers from the Institute for Advanced Chemistry of Catalonia (IQAC-CSIC), with support from the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Service of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB) have developed a method for synthesising ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T01:01:23.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
