This cutting edge mobile app uses videos to create, plan, and coordinate events with your friends. PORD has the ability to see what is happening live, comment, and meet people based on common interest. The simplicity of use, find what you are looking for based on common interest categories, bring everyone together with a great video. PORD is the future app for this current generation and the upcoming generations. These young adults are the future, and PORD want to create something new and innovative that will be useful in fulfilling to this generation.\nPORD allows people to meet in person, through an online network. Users will be able to see where people are located, and they will be able to spot their current location. Users can also go “incognito” and drop off the grid for privacy. They’ll be able to create, plan and share events based on location. Users will be able to find exactly what they want by categories, such as art, music, business, fashion, and more. However, before this app can exist, PORD needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $99,000 by October 18, 2015.\nTo help bring this innovative app to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered by October 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help PORD reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: Brad G.
