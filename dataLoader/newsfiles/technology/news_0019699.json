(TASE: NNDM, OTCQB: NNDMY), through its subsidiary, Nano-Dimension Technologies Ltd., is engaged in research and development of a three-dimensional (3D) printer that prints multi-layer electric circuit boards (PCBs) and the development of ink products and materials (including conductive ink) based on nano-technology. The ink products constitute supplementary products and are ancillary to the advanced printers, and 3D printers of the company in particular. Nano announced that it has received approval to commence its American Depository Receipt (ADR) program. Each ADR of Nano Dimension represents 5 ordinary shares of Nano Dimension. Trading has begun on the OTCQB Venture Market in the U.S. under the ticker symbol NNDMY. \nDevelopment of some of the ink products has been completed, and the company has begun the production process of the conductive nano-ink. The 3D printers are in advanced stages of development, and a prototype of the printer exists. \nAccording to the company, the Nano Dimension PCB printer is a highly accurate and versatile inkjet deposition system for printing multi-layer electric circuit boards. The company believes that the hardware, dedicated nano-inks and software bring new possibilities to a wide range of R&D, prototyping and custom manufacturing projects. Nano Dimension's highly conductive silver nano-inks are also available separately. \nDuring the development process of the 3D printer and the ink, the company's subsidiary uses and integrates three advanced technologies: the 3D printer; inject technology (the injection of the ink); and advanced nano-technology that enables use of conductive ink and isolated ink in order to print PCBs. By combining these technologies, the subsidiary is developing a unique 3D printer that prints prototypes of PCBs. Based on the needs of users and the plan created by the user, the PCB can be multi-layer, according to the company. \nOn February 25, 2015, the company introduced the first generation (alpha version) of the printer, and the company held a launch conference for its alpha printer on April 14, 2015. The company is testing the alpha printer with a limited number of customers in order to examine and test the performances of the 3D printer and receive customer feedback. \nUpon completion of the development of its products, the company intends to engage with potential strategic partners that are engaged in the field of marketing and distribution in the local and global electronics market. \nIn May 2015, the company's subsidiary filed a U.S. patent application for registration of a patent for the method of converting Gerber files (for the production of electronic cards) for three-dimensional printing and the application of the ink injection technology. The patent describes the direct printing system of the PCBs with ink injection technology. Nano Dimension has two fully equipped laboratories. One laboratory is dedicated to the research and production of conductive silver nano-particle inks, while the second laboratory is focused on innovative dielectric nano-inks. The labs are focused primarily on nano-silver and nano-polymers for the company's 3D PCB printer. \nNano Dimension's wet-chemistry approach to making silver nano-particles starts with a silver precursor raw material. The patented process is licensed from the Hebrew University. \nThe company can reliably extract 10-100+ nano-meter sized particles of pure silver. Nano Dimension's labs can control the size, shape and dispersion of the silver nano-particles in accordance with customers' printing requirements. The company can also formulate inks for a variety of substrates and printing profiles. \nNano Dimension's high-performance silver nano-particle ink for inkjet printers is available for purchase/testing by industry partners seeking high conductivity for RFID, antenna, OLED and other applications. \nNano Dimension Ltd. is headquartered in Ness-Tsiona, Israel. \nS&P Capital IQ's Factual Stock Report coverage on Nano Dimension Ltd. will also be accessible on an ongoing basis to the investment community by scores of buy-side institutions and sell-side firms that utilize S&P Capital IQ research and information platforms daily.
