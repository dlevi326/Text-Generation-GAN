You know how when you log onto Facebook and you get an event invitation and you really just want to say to them:\" Oh, i wish i could, but i don't want to.\" But you can't, so usually you just pretend you can't make it or just pretend you never saw it in the first place. That little game is over, because Facebook's latest update includes read receipts for events. The host of the event can see who has viewed (and ignored) the event page.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T09:22:08.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
