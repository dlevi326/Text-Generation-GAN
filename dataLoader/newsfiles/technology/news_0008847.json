Wellness was also a major focus, with top experts from the Cooper Clinic presenting about fitness, nutrition, wellness, and cardiology.\nThe Meeting's unofficial start was a tour of the Cooper Clinic. \"A particular treat for me, and terrific way to kick off the Meeting, was the honor and privilege of visiting the Cooper Campus.\" says Daniel A. 'Danny' Bobrow, president of AIM Dental Marketing , and AAOSH's Founding Executive Committee Chair.\nAttendees were given the opportunity to participate in health screenings—including antioxidant levels using the biophotonic scanner, carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) ultrasound, blood tests for inflammatory biomarkers, and salivary diagnostics: all at a significant discount. Over 300 tests were administered over the course of the three-day event.\nThe 6th Annual AAOSH Scientific Session will take place September 16-17 in Orlando, Florida.
