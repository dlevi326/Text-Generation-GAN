One of his US investments, Lookflow, was acquired by Yahoo in 2013.\nHe said that Australia has a ‘strong start-up scene’ with talented engineers and great ideas who just need a little funding to get off the ground.\n“I’ve met a lot of passionate founders and investors that simply want to make useful products that further people’s lives. A lot of the focus and passion reminds me of Silicon Valley circa 2005, when it was a smaller community than it is today. The biggest challenge for the Australian tech scene surrounds funding and being competitive with other markets where there are bigger funds willing to take larger risks.”\nThe WNH platform currently has more than 40,000 home decor products (up to 500,000 next year) and 340 interior designers, and expects rapid development and expansion of its home decor inventory, interior designer partners and customer base. One feature of the platform is called ‘Design Studios’ where home designers and customers can create a 3D holographic image of each room in their house, allowing users to decorate, interact and walk around the image.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:39:17.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
