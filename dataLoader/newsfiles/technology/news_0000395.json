It cited slower economic growth, depressed commodity prices, power shortages and expectations that the country’s fiscal and debt metrics would deteriorate.\nThe government said on Sunday in a posting on its Facebook page that the downgrade \"should be ignored because its correctness was not discussed with any authorised representative of the Zambian government\".\n\"The only agencies with whom the Zambian government has rating relationships are Fitch and Standard & Poor’s. The two are the only ones with whom we engage on policy matters, and data provision and reconciliation.\"\nIn May, Moody’s had affirmed its then B1 rating on Zambia.\nZambia’s economy is likely to grow by less than 5% in 2015 due to a power crunch that has hit output from mining companies already grappling with a slide in global copper prices, Finance Minister Alexander Chikwanda told Reuters earlier this month.\nThe kwacha currency fell more than 2% to a record low of 10.85 against the dollar on Friday.\nZambia issued a $1.25bn 10-year Eurobond in July at a hefty 9.375% interest rate to finance a budget deficit expected to swell to 20-billion kwacha by the end of 2015 from an initial forecast of 8.5-billion.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:04:32.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
