It is the first to use social network analysis to study insect communities in the corn production system to understand how large groups of organisms interact from an applied angle. The project was supported by a $150,000 National Institute of Food and Agriculture seed grant. \n\"This research gives farmers a metric whereby they can assess their corn production system,\" said Lundgren, pointing out that use of no-till and a diverse crop rotation plan can improve insect diversity. \n\"It also has implications for costs associated with producing corn,\" Fausti added. \"A balanced ecosystem can then lead to reduced costs associated with insecticides.\" \nThe results are published in the July 31 issue of Science Advances . Philippa Benson, managing editor of Science Advances , said, \"This is high quality research that is novel and that moves the field of concern forward meaningfully.\" \nLundgren and a team of 10 economics and biology graduate and undergraduate students harvested 50 plants during pollination on each farm. \nThey dissected approximately 2,650 plants and identified more than 37,000 insect specimens. Shown on a corn anther, this lady beetle or Coleomegilla maculata will help reduce the number of pests in the plant. \nThe research suggests that it's not the number of species, but the balance of species within the insect communities that are responsible for pest suppression. \n\"To understand the ecological community, you need to look at the system in the real world,\" pointed out Fausti, who worked with the South Dakota Corn Utilization Council and SDSU Extension to select the sites. Each field had to cover at least 10 acres. \nFarms ranged from conventional to organic, Lundgren explained. The variety of crops and landscaping characteristics make the study \"a good snapshot of corn production in the state.\" \nDuring the last 50 years, American agriculture has moved to a more chemically intensive production system, Fausti explained. In 2013, U.S. farmers spent $3.2 billion to control corn pests. \"Unfortunately, the chemicals we use have a negative impact on nontargeted insects.\" \nThe researchers emphasized the need to focus on profitability rather than yields. Farmers that adopt a diverse cropping system can reduce the need for insecticides and thus lower their input costs, according to Lundgren. \nIn addition, a more diverse cropping system also decreases the revenue variability in farm production, Fausti explained. \"It's about not putting all your eggs in one basket.\" \nLundgren is working on similar studies, including a project to assess insects and profitability on farms in North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska. \"This opens a lot of opportunities to apply community ecology in ways never done before.\" Spying on Corn Rootworm Predators Nightlife October 31, 2009 \n(PhysOrg.com) -- Agricultural Research Service (ARS) entomologist Jonathan G. Lundgren, while exploring corn fields at night, has found a very different group of predators than the ones that feed during the day. It turns ... Predatory bugs can save cornfields November 30, 2010 \nOne of the worst pests of corn in the world, the corn rootworm, may owe its worldwide success partly to its larvae's nasty, sticky blood. Lady beetle diet influences its effectiveness as biocontrol agent January 11, 2013 \nBy examining what lady beetles eat, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists are learning more about the movement of these beneficial insects in farm fieldsâ€”and whether they'll actively feed on crop pests. Insect-resistant maize could increase yields and decrease pesticide use in Mexico November 17, 2014 \nAlthough maize was originally domesticated in Mexico, the country's average yield per hectare is 38% below the world's average. In fact, Mexico imports 30% of its maize from foreign sources to keep up with internal demand. Rapid increase in neonicotinoid insecticides driven by seed treatments April 2, 2015 \nUse of a class of insecticides, called neonicotinoids, increased dramatically in the mid-2000s and was driven almost entirely by the use of corn and soybean seeds treated with the pesticides, according to researchers at Penn ... Clemson scientists stopping small insects from doing big damage to corn July 20, 2015 \nThere are almost 275,000 acres of corn planted in South Carolina, with an economic impact of approximately $130 million. Though this is dwarfed by Midwest states such as Iowa (13.7 million acres, $8.75 billion), it's still ... Recommended for you Image-tracking technology allows scientists to observe nature vs. nurture in neural stem cells September 3, 2015 \nOne of the longstanding debates in science, that has, perhaps unsurprisingly, permeated into the field of stem cell research, is the question of nature versus nurture influencing development. Science on stem cells thus far, ... Surprisingly, low-toxin MRSA strains may be the real killer September 3, 2015 \nThe most serious MRSA infections could be those caused by superbugs which produce fewer toxins, as opposed to high toxin strains, according to surprise findings revealed today by scientists from the Department of Biology ... New research shows why cats are more independent than dogs September 3, 2015 \nDomestic cats do not generally see their owners as a focus of safety and security in the same way that dogs do, according to new research published today. Which insects are the best pollinators? September 3, 2015 \nBees top the charts for pollination success according to one of the first studies of insect functionality within pollination networks, published today by researchers at the University of Bristol and the University of St Andrews. Change in environment can lead to rapid evolution, researchers say September 2, 2015 \nA new Florida State University study is giving researchers a glimpse at how organisms from fish to flowers to tumors evolve in response to rapid environmental change. Study reveals how distinctive termite mounds are ventilated, could offer lessons to human architects September 2, 2015 \nAs animal architects go, the average termite doesn't have many tools at their disposal - just their bodies, soil and saliva. And as guidance, variations in wind speed and direction and daily fluctuations in temperature as ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T14:39:22.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
