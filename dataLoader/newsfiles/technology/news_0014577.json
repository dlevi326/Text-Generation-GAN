Building on this foundation, our recently announced eGain Try+Buy program is being received enthusiastically by enterprise clients looking for guidance to quick value in their digital customer engagement initiatives. In fiscal 2016, we intend to only sell cloud solutions to new clients through our direct sales team, a move that puts us firmly on the path to becoming a cloud business. \n\"As we previously announced, our fourth quarter and full year revenue fell below our guidance, due to lower than expected license revenue. However, our recurring revenue was within our guidance range and overall bookings grew a solid 26% over the prior year.
