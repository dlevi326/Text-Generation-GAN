Paul Chapman reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nIt looks like Apple's new iPhone 6s, the packaging looks like the real thing too...but it's all fake. This version is on sale in the Chinese city of Shenzhen days ahead of the first deliveries of the real thing. And with a price tag of just 91 dollars it's a tenth of the cost. Opinions of the pirate trade on the streets vary. (SOUNDBITE)(Mandarin) 22-YEAR-OLD APPLE PHONE WHOLESALER ZHENG ZHUANGJIAN SAYING: \"I think if some people are short on money and want a 6s maybe they'll consider buying a fake phone. After all, its appearance is 99.9 per cent similar to a 6s so it depends on the buyers. I won't buy it. If you support fake goods it means you're hurting the real ones.\" (SOUNDBITE)(Mandarin) 40-YEAR-OLD WHITE COLLAR WORKERS MARK LI SAYING: \"Many people, especially ones in their 20s and 30s, really like Apple. The Apple logo attracts them. When they see a shop selling Apple they'll go inside and they don't sell Apple maybe they won't go in. Even if the shop doesn't sell real Apple products they think getting a pirate or refurbished one is not bad anyway. They think they have face and face is very important for many people.\" There are some drawbacks with the fake version. It's slow for a new phone, and the photos it takes are fuzzy. But that appears to be no object for the counterfeiters. There's a wealth of stores sporting the Apple logo even though the company has only one official store and five authorised dealers in Shenzhen. Some of the fake stores have covered their Apple logos after a raid on one such premises a week earlier. The organisation which monitors trading activities in the city didn't respond to questions faxed to it by Reuters. Apple declined to comment.
