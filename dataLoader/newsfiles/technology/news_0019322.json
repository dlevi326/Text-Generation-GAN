The company also caters to the pulp and paper, oil and gas, mining, and water treatment segments. \"The Soto Industries acquisition is an example of Kemira's dedication to the pulp and paper industry.\" \nLast year, Kemira recorded revenues of €2.1bn. It employs approximately 4,250 people. \nFor the first six months of this year, the company's revenue increased 10% to €1.1bn, with a 20% increase in operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) to €141.1m. \nThe latest acquisition comes after Kemira opened a water treatment chemicals plant in Catalonia, Spain in June. \nSaid to be one of the largest of such production plants in Europe, the facility features a unit to manufacture sizing agents used in the pulp and paper industry. \nEarlier this year, the company also completed the acquisition of AkzoNobel's global paper chemicals business in a €153m deal. \nImage: Kemira headquarters in Helsinki, Finland.
