The machining type involved here has 3 linear axes and an additional two rotary axes that can take rotary table form or rotary axes on the machine spindle and headstock. 5-axis milling is quite an advanced solution, especially for components that are complicated and require high precision. The fact that all features are done under one setup, the accuracy is much higher. \n5 Axis machining advantages \n1. 5-axis process makes it very simple to machine shapes that are complex in one single step, thus greatly reducing on machining time, errors and costs in terms of tools needed for the task at hand. You will therefore enjoy faster, accurate and affordable results for your production project. \n2. This type of machining also allows the use of shorter cutting tools considering that the head can be lowered and cutter oriented to surface. This means, therefore that a higher cutting speed is achieved and tool vibration is greatly reduced as well and together help in achieving the best results regardless of the task that is at hand. \n3. The machining has the ability of handling parts that are extremely complex from solids that would have otherwise required casting. The five axis milling can handle a number of raw materials including high temperature alloys like tool steel, brass, stainless steel, titanium, Inconel, copper, tungsten, carbon steel, sterling silver and bronze. It can also accommodate plastics like polycarbonate, PP, acetal, ABS and nylon among others. \n4. The machining saves time when it comes to drilling of holes. Plenty of time is needed to drill a series of holes when using compound angles, but with the machine, it is easy to orient the head along the right axis for every hole automatically. It means, therefore that hole drilling is made a simple affair that can be completed faster using the 5-axis milling or machining. \nChoosing 5-axis Machining services \nWhen seeking the machining services, choose a factory that has been in operation for a considerable length of time. Remember that experience in the machining services can highly determine the quality of work and the turnaround. Choose a reliable and trustworthy factory for the best experience to your needs. \nAlso very important to consider are the five axis CNC milling machines that the factory has. The higher the quality of the machine the more the consistency you will enjoy with the delivery of your product results. The machines should be in top condition to offer you expected results within a short period of time. \nService affordability should also be considered. The prices should match the product quality that you get in the end. Remember that the raw materials used can determine the service charge. Look at what materials the factory can handle and the needs you have before choosing the best you can afford. \nThe machining team should have the expertise and experience needed for accuracy. \nChina CNC machining services are very essential to different industries and sectors. 5-axis milling in China has become very reliable, but there's need to choose a factory you can fully trust for quality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T08:41:33.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
