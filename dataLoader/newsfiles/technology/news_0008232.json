Matarbari is sufficient, we may have to give up the other port project.” \nMustafa Kamal added that the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) had offered 80% financing on good terms, which includes the port complex in Matarbari, as well as four coal-fired power plants. \nThe project is of global importance due to its connection with China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative, with the port providing a key gateway for growing trade in and out of Bangladesh.
