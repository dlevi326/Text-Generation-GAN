The company posted about $150 billion in revenue last year.\nChief Digital Officer Bill Ruh said the added revenue would come largely from industrial applications as well as sales of GE's cloud-based operating system, known as Predix.\n\"Itâ€™s a very ambitious goal, but with that said, the market opportunity is large as well,\" Ruh said in an interview.\nIn one example of its latest offerings, GE on Tuesday announced Digital Power Plant, a software suite designed to help utilities save money through increased reliability, reduced maintenance costs and other means.\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T23:28:12.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
