This category included criteria related to data breach response such as: call center, notification mailings, other notification communications, reporting, translations, and identity monitoring and remediation. For all of these, Kroll received the highest score possible. Criteria also included additional capabilities such as incident assessment and forensics, security assessment and incident response planning criteria. For these, Kroll also received the highest score possible. \n“Our combination of exemplary human intelligence with technology, together with our ability to adjust course as the situation requires are the distinctive capabilities that set us apart,” said Brian Lapidus, practice leader for Kroll’s Identity Theft and Breach Notification division. \nAdditionally, Kroll received the highest score possible in the “employee subject matter expertise” category. Data breach response is a sensitive and complex endeavor; because of this, Kroll’s team strives to build a response strategy with the client so that the solution can be agile, flexible, and scaled to fit any situation. \n“We are honored to achieve the highest score possible for the criteria listed above,” said Lapidus. “We believe this is further testament to the unparalleled level of expertise our team members bring to every aspect of our diverse set of services – from the most basic notification letter to the most complex investigation.” \nGiven the massive breaches that have hit retailers and healthcare providers in recent years, public interest in data breach is growing, most likely due to concern over identity theft. According to the Federal Trade Commission’s Consumer Sentinel Network Data Book, identity theft has been the top consumer complaint for the past 15 years in a row. Resolving identity theft issues can be a frustrating and time-consuming process for the consumer; in its 2012 national crime victimization survey, the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics indicates that among victims who had personal information used for fraudulent purposes, 29 percent spent a month or more resolving problems. \n“Consumer consultation and restoration has been a core competency for Kroll since we began providing data breach notification services more than a decade ago,” explains Lapidus. “The consumer experience is absolutely vital to the success of a client’s breach response. Providing understandable and accessible services that manage the consumer’s level of risk can positively impact how your breach response is perceived by the public and subsequently your reputation.” \nFor a complete download of the report, click here: http://www.kroll.com/en-us/intelligence-center/reports/forrester-wave-data-breach-notification-response \nAbout Kroll: \nKroll is the leading global provider of risk solutions.
