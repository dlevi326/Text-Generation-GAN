The platform enables cable operators to leverage the existing cable plant to compete with fiber optic service. Early adopters of Broadcom's DOCSIS 3.1 technology include both major cable operators such as Comcast and Liberty Global, and CCAP equipment suppliers such as ARRIS and Harmonic. \"The performance improvements offered by Broadcom's end-to-end DOCSIS 3.1 platform enables cable operators to cost effectively upgrade their head-end equipment for the delivery and use of a new range of subscriber content,\" said Dan Marotta , Broadcom Executive Vice President and General Manager, Broadband & Connectivity Group. \"Today's new CCAP infrastructure devices, combined with the BCM3390 cable modem platform, provide a complete DOCSIS 3.1-based silicon solution with advanced capabilities that effectively compete with speeds offered by fiber deployments.\" \"End-to-end DOCSIS 3.1 technology, in both cable infrastructure and cable modems, is critical for subscribers to receive Gigabit speeds in the home,\" said Balan Nair , Liberty Global Executive Vice President and CTO. \"DOCSIS 3.1 is making it possible for Liberty Global to deliver enhanced services to consumers later this year.\" \"DOCSIS 3.1 will allow Comcast to cost-effectively deliver faster and more reliable data speeds to our subscribers over our existing HFC network,\" said Tony Werner , Comcast Executive Vice-President. \"Having DOCSIS 3.1 technology for both CCAP and home equipment will allow us to offer more and better speed options to more customers in 2015 and beyond.\" \"The evolutionary nature of DOCSIS technology continues with the introduction of the DOCSIS 3.1 specification, enabling an elegant and rapid upgrade of the growing installed base of ARRIS CCAP equipment around the world,\" said Tom Cloonan , ARRIS CTO, Network Solutions. \"The efficiency gains enabled by DOCSIS 3.1 will ensure cable operators remain at the forefront of the Broadband industry and meet consumers' ever-increasing demand for richer, more interactive media experiences.\" \"DOCSIS 3.1 opens the door to a new generation of cable services,\" said Nimrod Ben-Natan , Harmonic Senior Vice President and General Manager, Cable Edge Business. \"Broadcom's complete end-to-end solution in support of this standard enables Harmonic to provide cable operators with CCAP equipment that cost-effectively leverages their existing infrastructure to deliver Gigabit speeds today.\" Broadcom's new chips provide a complete physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layer solution for operators deploying DOCSIS 3.1 in CCAP infrastructure equipment. The new PHY devices include the BCM31442 upstream burst receiver which receives transmissions from the home toward the network and BCM3047 downstream transmitter which supports transmissions from the network to the home. The new MAC device, the BCM3222, supports rapid and efficient cable modem access to network resources. Key Features of the BCM3047 Transmitter Industry's first single-chip transmitter with integrated high-speed digital to analog converter (DAC) enabling transmission out to 1.2 GHz on the cable plant Supports up to 160 SC-QAM and up to 6 OFDM transmitters Key Features of the BCM31442 Receiver Industry's first DOCSIS 3.1 burst receiver with integrated analog to digital converter (ADC) supporting up to 300 MHz of upstream spectrum Supports 2 upstream ports across 24 SC-QAM and 4 OFDMA receivers Key Features of the BCM3222 MAC Device Capable of supporting up to 25 Gbps Availability Broadcom's BCM3047, BCM31442 and BCM3222 are currently sampling.
