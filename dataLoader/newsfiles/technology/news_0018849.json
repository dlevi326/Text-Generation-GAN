With this in mind Cushman & Wakefield partnered with KISI Inc. a developer of a cloud-managed keyless access control system to provide mobile access technology at the C&W corporate headquarters in New York City. It was the first enterprise installation of its kind in a New York City office building. \nOnce Cushman & Wakefield employees have downloaded the secure KISI mobile application they can unlock doors within the C&W office suite via their iPhone or Android devices.

KISI’s technology enables all of this at the point of access and makes our corporate headquarters ready for the future.”\nRead Entire Article at:\nAbout Us:\nTechnology’s impact on commercial real estate is moving at an exponential rate.
