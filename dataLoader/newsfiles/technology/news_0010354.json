View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150924006188/en/ Dr. Ron Ross, Fellow, NIST (Photo: Business Wire) \nRon Ross, Ph.D., a fellow at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), offered that assessment while discussing his upcoming keynote presentation at the 19 th Si2CON, Tuesday, October 6, at the Biltmore Hotel, Santa Clara, Calif. His presentation is titled Rethinking Cybersecurity from the Inside Out: An Engineering and Life Cycle-Based Approach for Building Trustworthy Resilient Systems. \n\"Software and system developers can no longer take the security of computer hardware for granted,\" Dr. Ross said. \"Counterfeiting, reverse engineering and sabotage are serious threats and from a security standpoint just as important as components, systems and other parts of the infrastructure.\" \nDr. Ross leads the Federal Information Security Management Act Implementation Project, which includes the development of security standards and guidelines for the federal government, contractors, and the United States critical information infrastructure. \nSi2CON is presented by the Silicon Integration Initiative and features speakers from leading semiconductor and electronic-design automation (EDA) companies. Speakers will focus on such industry-wide topics as Design for Security, Business in China and highlights of key Si2 projects. The complete agenda can be found at: http://www.si2.org/?page=2129 . \nOther keynote speakers are: Robert \"Bob\" Smith, executive director, Electronic Design Automation Consortium (EDAC), China - New Center of the Semiconductor Universe (?) Allen Lu, president, SEMI China, Challenges and Opportunities of the China Semiconductor Industry \nA panel session, Pros and Cons of Collaboration , will be moderated by Shishpal Rawat, chairman of Accellera, and director of Business Enablement Programs, Intel ( News - Alert ) Corp. \nOther presentations include discussions of new development programs at Si2: a gallium nitride transistor SPICE model from the Compact Model Coalition, proof of concept results of low power model, the OpenDevices program, and an Intel application of OpenAccess scripting interface applied to a production environment. \nBreakfast, lunch and a post-conference networking session are included. Cadence Design Systems ( News - Alert ) and Spectral Design & Test are the event sponsors. \nTo register on-line: http://www.si2.org/Si2Con/2015/Si2Con_2015_registration.php or use a fax/mail form: http://www.si2.org/?page=2192 . \nAbout Si2: Si2 is the largest organization of industry-leading semiconductor, systems, EDA and manufacturing companies focused on the development and adoption of standards to improve the way integrated circuits are designed and manufactured. Si2's focus is to speed time-to market, reduce costs, and meet the challenges of sub-micron design. Now in its 27th year, Si2 is uniquely positioned to enable timely collaboration through dedicated staff and a strong implementation focus driven by its member companies. Si2 represents approximately 80 companies involved in all parts of the silicon supply chain throughout the world.
