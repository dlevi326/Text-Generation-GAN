Many previous systems like Atari's were low-quality versions of some arcade games with blocky graphics.\nIt also gave us the \"side-scroller\" game allowing players to move through various lands and worlds, instead of being in one stationary setting.\nEveryone who got an NES received \"Super Mario Bros.,\" creating a legion of fans. It didn't hurt that it was a lot of fun to play, as Mario and his brother jumped, squished and warped their way through a strange world of \"koopas\" and \"goombas\" called Mushroom Kingdom, on the lookout for Princess Peach, held captive by the evil Bowser (or King Koopa).\nFuture Nintendo game systems would almost always include a new \"Super Mario\" sequel or spinoff, including the Super Nintendo, Game Boy and multiple versions of the hand-held DS.\nJUST WATCHED Check out real-life 'Mario Brothers' Replay More Videos ...

Super Show,\" a half live-action, half animated expansion of the \"Mario\" brand to other platforms (though \"Legend of Zelda\" stepped in on Friday afternoons).\nCaptain Lou Albano of wrestling fame portrayed Mario in the live-action portions, which were a bit of a callback to Sid and Marty Krofft series of the 1970s.\nThe show was successful enough to get spun off to Saturday mornings on NBC for a few more seasons.\n3. Mario takes to the road\n\"Mario Kart\" translated the \"Super Mario\" characters to the racetrack in 1992, and this game and its many, many sequels are some of the most popular racing games of all time.\nIt was followed by another of the many spinoffs, 1998's \"Mario Party\" (not to mention the earlier 1991 spinoff \"Dr. Mario\").\n4. Super Mario hits the big screen (it does not go well)\nThe bright and happy world of \"Super Mario Bros.\" was inevitably translated into a feature film in 1993, a movie that had more in common with \"Blade Runner\" than anything on a gaming console.\nBob Hoskins, a few years after \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" starred as Mario Mario, with up-and-coming John Leguizamo as Luigi Mario.\nDennis Hopper chewed the scenery as the reptilian King Koopa.\nDirectors Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton went from creating \"Max Headroom\" to turning Mushroom Kingdom into a dystopian hellscape with evolved dinosaurs.\nThe movie got abysmal reviews, but it's not like no one warned us.\nIn 1992, the Los Angeles Times went to the set and came back with Quote: s like this: \"The directors won't give interviews? That's the smartest thing I've heard from them. That's the only intelligent thing I've heard that they've really actually done.\"\nThat was from Hopper, one of the stars.\nIn 2007, Hoskins called the film a \"nightmare\" and \"the worst thing I've ever done.\"\nThe (slightly) better Mario-related film might have been \"The Wizard,\" a feature length ad for Nintendo, where the purpose of the heroes is to win a \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" tournament.\n5. Mario goes 3-D\nBack in the video game world, Super Mario continued to make strides. In 1996, Nintendo 64 was released along with \"Super Mario 64,\" which created a three-dimensional world for Mario and friends to explore.\nIt's considered one of the most challenging and best games of all time.\nToday, following the even more expansive \"Super Mario Galaxy\" games, Nintendo has just released a DIY version, \"Super Mario Maker,\" in which fans can create their own Mario levels.\nSo here's to 30 more years of gaming fun with the lovable Mario. Perhaps one day we'll be playing with a life-size holographic Mario and Luigi.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130829091031-mario-brothers-parkour-hp-video.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSpoDDi-cPM", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130829091031-mario-brothers-parkour-story-top.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWvc-7suhvs", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz1uHCxWxMw", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/wtMZKYnLg5c", "http://techland.time.com/2012/11/15/all-time-100-video-games/slide/super-mario-64-1996/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DLoRd6_a1CI", "http://www.empireonline.com/100greatestgames/?p=9", "http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-16/entertainment/ca-6865_1_koopa-square-dennis-hopper-rocky-morton", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/jm8rz90mv-c", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130829091031-mario-brothers-parkour-topics.jpg", "http://traffic.outbrain.com/network/trackpxl?advid=814&action=view", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/S40fBi65U8c", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130829091031-mario-brothers-parkour-story-body.jpg", "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/03/2", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130829091031-mario-brothers-parkour-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pJ9jyIreBc"], "published": "2015-09-14T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T19:19:05.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
