Now, four years after its inception, the Chinese smartphone powerhouse looks to bring the fight to Apple in the laptop market.\nAccording to a Bloomberg report out of South Korea, Xiaomi is in talks with electronics giant Samsung, which could be providing screens and memory components for the new device.\nThe publication's anonymous sources add that the laptop could be released as soon as early 2016 and that the Beijing-based company hopes to compete with Apple's Macbook Air line.\nThe world's fourth largest smartphone maker, Xiaomi became popular in China by offering devices with attractive features at budget and midrange prices, which it managed to do by opting for an online-only distribution model.\nIt's been battling Apple for the top spot in the region. The iPhone maker started the year by grabbing the smartphone sales crown , but in the second quarter Xiaomi bounced back to take the lead.\nA laptop wouldn't be Xiaomi's first foray outside of phones -- it's also made TVs, fitness bands, tablets and, somewhat randomly, an air purifier.\nXiaomi may cook up a laptop to compete with Apple's Macbook Air range.\nSarah Tew/CNET Xiaomi released its most recent flagship device, the Mi Note Pro, in July to compete with Apple's iPhone 6 range. The Mi Note Pro received a strong score from CNET thanks to its zippy performance and super sharp design.\nNeither Samsung nor Xiaomi was immediately available for comment.", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-02/xiaomi-said-to-consider-laptop-for-early-2016-aiming-at-apple", "http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/07/29/6da55c67-bf7b-4f36-ad56-d6620bee382b/resize/970x546/78539a0874af7d0cbeca48aa7057d12e/applemacbookair13-inch3578145106.jpg", "http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25804315", "http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/06/30/80221454-32ae-43cd-b460-90e21fdff711/resize/270xauto/baf6b250d8f50e7ebc3820d70c59a8c7/xiaomiminotepro03.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-02T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:53:17.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
