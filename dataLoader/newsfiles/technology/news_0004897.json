Launches Food Matters, National Educational Initiative to Illustrate the Powerful and Unexpected Role Food Plays in Our Lives First installment: Member data reveals that you can’t out-exercise a bad diet September 08, 2015 08:07 AM Eastern Daylight Time \nBOSTON--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Lose It! , a comprehensive app-based weight loss program with more than 25 million members, today launched Food Matters, a national initiative to educate consumers about the powerful and unexpected role that food plays in our lives, powered by Lose It! member data and clinical research. The first installment, “ You Can’t Out-Exercise A Bad Diet ,” is based on data analysis of Lose It! members who have successfully lost weight, Lose It! member survey results, and insights from weight loss physicians and experts. \nIn order to uncover the effect of exercise on weight loss, Lose It! exported anonymized data from 378,706 active Lose It! members who have recently lost weight. The members were split into two groups: those who exercise more than average, the “dedicated exercisers,” and those who exercise less than average, the “occasional exercisers.” The dedicated exercisers exercised four or five times a week, burning an average of 432 calories per workout, while the occasional exercisers exercised twice a week and burned an average of 244 calories per workout. Despite their increased adherence to an exercise regimen, the dedicated exercisers lost fewer pounds per week than the occasional exercisers (0.99 pounds per week versus 1.11 pounds per week). The dedicated exercisers also ate 163 more daily calories on average, supporting the suspicion that exercise may actually derail weight loss by triggering an increase in appetite or desire for a food-based reward. \nThese results show that you can’t out-exercise a bad diet. While important to overall health, exercise alone typically plays a small role in weight loss, and diet is the definitive determining factor in a person’s ability to lose weight. \nFeedback from Lose It! members supports these statistics. In a recent survey, Lose It! members attributed their success first and foremost to tracking their food, second to adhering to a calorie budget, and third to an increase in their base level of exercise. \n“Exercise helps augment weight loss, but moderate exercise may not burn as many calories as you think,” says Kristin Kirkpatrick, award-winning dietician and nutrition expert. “A 20-minute walk a few days a week won’t offset a few nights of ice cream or a few too many hands in the chip bowl.” \n“There is so much misinformation about weight loss that can be easily disproven with data, and as the world’s most popular weight loss app, we have a unique window into the true factors that drive successful weight loss,” said Charles Teague, CEO of Lose It!. “Our Food Matters campaign will share with the American public highly reliable data that they can use to lead healthier, more vibrant lives.” \nWhile exercise does not have a strong impact on weight loss, there are tremendous health benefits that accompany exercise. Regular exercise is tied to heart health, diabetes control, improved mental health, strong bones, and healthy aging. Lose It! recognizes exercise as a key component to a healthy lifestyle and seamlessly integrates with top health and fitness brands such as Jawbone, FitBit, Nike, Misfit, Withings, Strava, MapMyFitness, Apple Health, Google Fit, and RunKeeper. The app also gives members the ability to share data through wearable activity trackers, Bluetooth devices, and a variety of connected mobile apps. \nAbout Lose It! \nSince 2008, Lose It!
