AT&T Inc. logo.  ><- stripped tags -> LOUISVILLE, Ky. , Sept. 14,   Reflecting the company's long-standing commitment to deploying high-speed Internet access in urban and rural areas across the Commonwealth, AT&T has committed to extend broadband to more than 84,000 rural homes and businesses in Kentucky over the next six years. \"It is exciting to announce that AT&T in Kentucky will accept more than $30 million annually over the next six years to supplement the expansion of high-speed Internet service to more than 84,000 rural homes and businesses across the Commonwealth,\" said Hood Harris, president of AT&T Kentucky. \"AT&T has been investing in our innovative networks in urban and rural areas across the Commonwealth for more than 135 years, and we are pleased to participate in this program to continue bringing high-speed Internet services to more Kentuckians.\" Understanding that broadband deployment in some remote areas is not economically viable, in late 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) created the Connect America Fund (CAF) to expand broadband in rural areas where market forces and economics do not support expansion. AT&T has elected to participate in the second phase of the CAF program in Kentucky , committing to deploy broadband to more than 84,000 homes and businesses in rural areas the FCC has targeted. In those areas AT&T will deliver broadband at speeds of at least 10 Megabits per second (Mbps) for downloads and 1 Mbps for uploads. \"Today's economy requires reliable high-speed Internet connectivity for both businesses and consumers, and AT&T's continuing commitment to deploy these vital services is essential for our continuing economic strength in the Commonwealth,\" said Hal B. Goode , President and CEO of the Kentucky Association for Economic Development. \"This past legislative session, with the leadership of Sen. Hornback and Rep. Rand, we saw how bi-partisan efforts can lead to a more investment-friendly environment in the Commonwealth, and this announcement is a great example of the public and private sectors working together to expand economic opportunities in Kentucky .\" \"I am glad to hear of this upcoming infusion of funds to supplement the cost of deployment of high-speed Internet in rural areas, and I am confident that it will make communities across the Commonwealth more attractive to future investment,\" said State Senator Paul Hornback . \"This infusion of tens of millions of dollars into broadband deployment in rural Kentucky points to an even stronger future for communities and businesses across the state,\" said State Representative Rick Rand .
