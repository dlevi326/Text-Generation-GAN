The tradecraft should support an organization's offensive and defensive cyber operations, the paper states. \nThe organization also recommended that the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security add two more \"knowledge units\" -- intelligence analysis and knowledge management -- to their National Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance/Cyber Defense. \n\"Knowing what cyber adversaries and criminals are doing and intend to do is the single most important approach to getting ahead of cybercrime, fraud, espionage and disruption,\" said Terry Roberts, a former naval intelligence official who helped produce the paper. Marines conduct first live-fire augmented reality training \nMarines recently tested augmented reality technology in a live-fire training exercise for the first time, Defense Systems reported . \nDeveloped by the Office of Naval Research, the Augmented Immersive Team Trainer system consists of a laptop with special software and a helmet-mounted display. It supports live, virtual and cutting-edge training scenarios. The system combines the physical domain with the virtual by superimposing objects into a real environment. \n\"This affordable lightweight system can be taken anywhere -- turning any environment into a training ground -- and could be used to prepare Marines for real-world situations and environments they will face,\" said Brig. Gen. Julian Alford, vice chief of naval research and commanding general of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory. Tech council signs up Palo Alto \nThe Information Technology Industry Council has signed Palo Alto Networks as a new member. \nPalo Alto executives said the company wants to work with ITI to expedite policies aimed at preventing cyber breaches. \n\"We are excited to welcome Palo Alto Networks, a company with next-generation security technology at its core that continuously strives to be on the cutting edge of cybersecurity to ensure organizations are protected from evolving threats,\" ITI President and CEO Dean Garfield said in a joint statement with Palo Alto. \"We look forward to collaborating with Palo Alto Networks as we continue to advance our members' policy priorities.\" Cybercom's Rogers releases cyber 'vision' \nU.S. Cyber Command Commander Adm. Michael Rogers has released a \"vision statement\" outlining how he wants the command to approach cyberspace. The plan calls for military commanders to fully grasp that cyberspace is a warring domain. \n\"We [must] maintain an operational mindset, with our networks and cyber capabilities led by commanders who understand they are always in real or imminent contact with adversaries,\" wrote Rogers, who is also director of the National Security Agency. Report: Hackers hit DOE computers 150 times from 2010 to 2014 \nHackers hit Energy Department computer systems more than 150 times from 2010 to 2014, USA Today reported . \nDOE components reported 1,131 cyberattacks during that period, 159 of which were successful, according to the report, which cited records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. \nThe report describes a near-constant barrage of attempted breaches of information systems that hold data on the nation's power grid, nuclear weapons stockpile and energy labs.
