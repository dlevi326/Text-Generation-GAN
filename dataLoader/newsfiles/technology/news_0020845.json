MacRumors has the news. \n“ Last month, a new Apple Wireless Keyboard with Bluetooth 4.2 and a rechargeable lithium-on battery was discovered in filings with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Images of an Apple Wireless Keyboard with backlit keys and a power button also briefly surfaced on the Apple Online Store in March.” \n9to5Mac also says Apple is preparing a new Bluetooth keyboard for the iPad Pro and lists other information about Apple’s new tablet. \n“Codenamed J99 and J98 internally, the new models will feature a larger, 2732 x 2048 display that is encased in a thin bezel similar to the designs of both the iPad mini and iPad Air. Said a source, ‘it literally looks like a big iPad.’ The device will have a similar aluminum back with curved edges, a FaceTime camera on the front, and an iSight camera on the rear.” \nIt was thought that the iPad Pro would compete with Microsoft’s upcoming Surface Pro 4 and run a specialized version of OS X instead of iOS. However, this is seeming less likely as most reports indicate the iPad Pro will definitely run iOS. However, Apple may add one special edition to their new tablet. Tech Times has the news . \n“Now, highly respected KGI securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a stellar record in reporting the latest Apple news, has noted that the new tablet is set to feature a Force Touch screen, activated with an optional Bluetooth stylus available for separate purchase.” \nIt is believed that the Bluetooth stylus will be a digital one like the N-Trig Stylus included with the Surface Pro 4. It could also be a Wacom stylus. However, it wouldn’t be surprising if Apple invented it’s own digital stylus technology. \nOne can use a capacitive stylus with all iPad devices now, but that doesn’t provide the same accurate experience as a digital stylus, which writes just like a pen or marker would. In the past, Apple has been against using a stylus because they believed your fingers should provide an even better experience. However, with the success of the Surface Pro and Galaxy Note devices, Apple needs to face the competition. \nThe iPad Pro is just one of the new items Apple will release this year. Next week, Apple will announce the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Apple is also getting ready to announce the upcoming new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops. However, the iPad Pro may be the item that causes the most excitement. \n[Photo by Mario Tama / Getty Images News]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:53:51.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
