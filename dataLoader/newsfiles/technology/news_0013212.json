To be fair, he is often the werewolf. And he has a habit of saying “I’m the werewolf,” right at the beginning of the game, essentially short-circuiting everyone’s thought processes, because the point of the game is to lie, and to find the liars. Admitting upfront to being a werewolf just does not compute. Unless, of course, he’s lying. But what if he isn’t?\nIf you’ve ever played Mafia at camp, this is a similar sort of game. Everyone is assigned a role, and is either on Team Villager or Team Werewolf. There’s one quick round of play that leaves no one sure who anyone else is, or even who they themselves are (though the werewolves know who each other are, for cahooting purposes).\nThen you just… discuss. And through discussion, try to find out who the werewolves are and kill them. The werewolves, of course, are lying through their fangs, trying not to be killed, and it behooves the villagers to lie also, to try to squeeze information out of the others.", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00HS7GG5G", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)"], "published": "2015-09-14T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T14:29:49.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
