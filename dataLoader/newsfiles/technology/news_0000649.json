Featuring an integrated 725 V MOSFET, synchronous rectification and precise secondary-side feedback sensing control, the new IC family delivers excellent multi-output cross-regulation with full line protection and instantaneous transient response with less than 10mW no load consumption. InnoSwitch-EP ICs employ Power Integrations’ innovative FluxLink ™ technology to produce highly-efficient, very accurate and reliable power supply circuits without an opto-coupler for auxiliary and standby power in appliances, HVAC, consumer electronics, computing, telecom and data communication applications. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150917005264/en/ \nExplains Doug Bailey, VP of marketing at Power Integrations: “Our switcher ICs have long been highly regarded for auxiliary and standby power supplies because of their proven ruggedness and because of the inherent reliability benefits of a highly integrated device. Increasingly demanding Total Energy Consumption (TEC) regulations are challenging engineers to find ways to reduce system power consumption in all operational modes. InnoSwitch-EP ICs are an easy-to-implement solution that improves power supply efficiency from standby to full load, giving designers a new tool to address TEC regulations.” \nThe use of FluxLink technology enables high-performance secondary-side control to be delivered with the simplicity and low component count usually associated with primary-side regulation. This allows highly-efficient synchronous rectification technology to be employed, resulting in extremely efficient performance across the full load range, including heavy loads. For example, InnoSwitch-EP ICs enable 20 W power supplies to achieve approximately 90% efficiency in a multi-output design, while minimizing no load consumption to less than 30 mW. Line over-voltage regulation is highly accurate at +/-5 %, while +/-5 % OCP regulation is also achieved. \nInnoSwitch-EP ICs enhance power-supply reliability by enabling a low BOM count and the elimination of opto-couplers, which degrade with time. Low voltage-drop across the synchronous rectifier FETs ensures highly accurate cross regulation between output voltage rails, potentially eliminating second stage linear regulators, saving both cost and wasted energy. This makes them suitable for applications in home appliances such as microwaves, washers and dryers, as well as stand-by power supplies for PC/server, air conditioning systems, displays, TVs, and smart lighting ballasts. InnoSwitch-EP ICs also enable designers to meet new ENERGY STAR 7 efficiency standards for monitors. \nInnoSwitch-EP samples are available now. Devices are priced at $1.08 in 10,000-piece quantities.
