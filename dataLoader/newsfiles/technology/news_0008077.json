This placement illustrates our commitment to the revenue-cycle industry and underscores our dedication to empowering hospital and healthcare professionals with the insight they need to make informed, smart decisions.\" \nThe By the Numbers list is ranked by the total number of healthcare revenue-cycle contracts for 2014.

First published in 2012, the survey is open to U.S. firms that have dedicated practice areas and staff to address the needs of the healthcare revenue-cycle process. Modern Healthcare defined \"revenue cycle\" as all administrative and clinical functions that contribute to the capture, management and resolution of patient service revenue. \n\"The healthcare industry is a dynamic market with a complex payment system that is undergoing unprecedented change,\" said Jennifer Schulz, group president of Experian's vertical markets. \"Experian Health provides an integrated end-to-end financial solution that helps to ease this change for healthcare providers by delivering unmatched payment certainty from a single partner.
