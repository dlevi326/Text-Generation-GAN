The partnership will include two limited-edition collections sold exclusively at select Banana Republic flagship stores and online. The program will spotlight one New York-based designer, who will create a capsule collection for Spring 2016, which is designed, cut and sewn exclusively in New York. This is going to be followed by a collection from a Los Angeles-based designer, which will be designed and produced exclusively in Los Angeles. \n“We are proud to partner with the CFDA and its network of emerging designers and manufacturers,” says Marissa Webb, Creative Director of Banana Republic. “This new program is a great opportunity to provide mentorship and resources to help creative talent grow their business while designing and producing locally.” \n”Banana Republic is a quintessential American retailer, which makes them the perfect partner to support our mission to help promote designers here in America and domestic manufacturing,” said Steven Kolb, President and CEO of the CFDA. \nFor the first collaboration, Banana Republic will work with designer Timo Weiland, an alumnus of the CFDA {FASHION INCUBATOR} program, on a womenswear collection for Spring 2016. The capsule will include twelve styles in solids and in custom prints, including dresses, tops, skirts and a blazer cut and sewn in New York by Sunrise Studio, a CFDA Fashion Manufacturing Initiative (FMI) grant winner, and Sn Productions. \nAs part of Banana Republic’s partnership with the CFDA, FMI is receiving a monetary contribution that will be matched by the City's financial commitment to the program. FMI, in affiliation with the New York City Economic Development Corporation, aims to nurture, elevate, and preserve garment production in New York City. \n“Donna, Alan and I are honored to collaborate on the first CFDA x Banana Republic capsule collection for Spring 2016,” says Timo Weiland, founder of Timo Weiland. “Since launching the brand, we have designed, cut and sewn our core signature woven styles in New York with factory partners based in the Garment District. Building upon this Made-in-New York aspect has been an integral part of our business and our story as a brand.” \nThe collection will debut at Banana Republic’s Spring 2016 presentation during New York Fashion Week in September, and launch at retail in March 2016. \nAbout Banana Republic Banana Republic is a global apparel and accessories brand focused on delivering versatile, contemporary style.
