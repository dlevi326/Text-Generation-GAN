A spokesman for Square declined comment.\nMarket turmoil of the type seen in August, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 588 points in a single day, could derail IPO plans.\nSquare has become one of the most scrutinized start-ups in Silicon Valley. Many venture capitalists have privately questioned whether it is really worth the $6-billion valuation. The doubters have cited heavy competition and tight margins in the payments business.\nAn IPO will provide a quick answer to that question, as well as guidance for many of the other private start-up companies dubbed “unicorns,” meaning their valuation is $1-billion or more. CB Insights, a venture-capital tracker, says more than 130 such companies now exist.\nOverall, the climate for venture-backed IPOs has weakened this year, with just 44 venture-backed companies listing on public markets in the first half of the year, according to the National Venture Capital Association. That compares with 66 in the first half of 2014.\nEarlier this year, Square had filed for a “confidential” IPO, which lets companies with under $1-billion in annual revenue file registration documents and go through a Securities and Exchange Commission review without public scrutiny. After the review, if the company wishes to continue with an IPO, it makes a public filing.\nGoldman Sachs will serve as lead underwriter, with Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase also participating, Fortune reported.\nSquare’s IPO comes at a critical time for Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey, who is also interim CEO of Twitter Inc.
