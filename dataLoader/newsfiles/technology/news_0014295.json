Many key agencies are working together to provide tools to Alaska’s Service members, Families and Veterans to ensure financial success. The “Alaska Forget Me Not Coalition” is hosting the financial fair in response to the financial scams that have been targeting Military Families in the recent months. According to the Alaska Regional Manager of the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and Coalition member, Michelle Tabler, “Recent schemes include a new twist on the ‘grandparent scam’ which targets seniors with deployed relatives; phony rental property scams that target relocating Service members; and fake websites that mimic legitimate Military benefits sites but instead attempt to collect personal information to divert payments. The Coalition, including the BBB, believes that financial readiness equals mission readiness.” Military Money $mart is designed to educate Alaska’s Military population on the importance of financial literacy and provide tips to secure their finances during different life stages such as deployment and transition.\nThe event is open to anyone who has access to JBER and has an interest in financial literacy and resources. Subject matter experts from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Alaska Division of Banking and Securities and Alaska Commission on Post-Secondary Education are scheduled to present. Additionally, the Alaska Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service will be on hand to answer questions from Service members, their Families and Veterans. For those individuals participating in the workshops, door prizes will be given away. The workshop schedule is as follows:\n3:00 p.m. — Welcome and Opening Remarks\n3:30 p.m. — Teens & Money / Consumer Rights\n4:30 p.m. — FAFSA & You / Fraud Alert\n5:30 p.m. — TSP / Securing Your Retirement\n6:30 p.m. — Q&A with the Experts\nTo register and find out more information, participants are encouraged to visit: bit.ly/MilitaryMoneySmart.\nThe Military Money $mart Financial Fitness Fair is made possible by the Alaska Forget Me Not Coalition, Securities and Exchange Commission, Army Community Services, Internal Revenue Service, Alaska Department of Law, Alaska Division of Banking and Securities, Boys & Girls Clubs of Alaska (tentative), and the Alaska Commission on Post-Secondary Education (tentative).\nFor more information, contact Magen James, State Community Support Coordinator, Army OneSource, 907-306-3442 or mjames@afsc.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T17:12:55.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
