He believes that quality education is crucial to South Africa’s economic success, which is a strong motivation to invest in education in various ways.\n“We have supported educational needs similar to JB Matabane School on numerous occasions over the years. As a non-fee paying school with 1 500 learners it topped the needs-list and this is why we selected JB Matabane as our beneficiary,” said Portia Xaki, marketing assistant for the Goscor Group.\n“Sangari’s ActiveScience products are developed to enable teachers and learners to engage and learn science anywhere. The ActiveScience Mobile Laboratory encourages teachers and learners to gain practical experience through curriculum-aligned experiments. Teacher and learner workbooks are structured to take advantage of the learners’ natural curiosity,” said Bez Sangari, CEO Sangari SA, the wholly-owned South African learning solutions provider.\n“The portable science laboratory enables learners to work independently doing their own experiments, and is priced significantly lower than setting up a formal laboratory.”\n The portable unit is designed to prolong chemicals and apparatus life, little storage space is needed and the unit is lockable.\nPractical experiments make use of small quantities of chemicals resulting in less wastage and easy disposal. Practicals are done with minimal teacher supervision enabling learners to work independently.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:03:22.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
