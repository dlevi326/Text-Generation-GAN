The new iPhones, named iPhone 6S and 6S, feature a new display technology called 3D Touch, a derivative of the Force Touch technology used in Apple Watch. In a video, Apple explained that 3D Touch will be able to differentiate various types of touches and taps in Apple's preloaded apps as well as on the homescreen. This new technology adds new functionalities to iPhones, for example applying a little extra pressure on the screen may preview a photo in one app and open a file in another. 3D Touch will deliver information like time taken in the journey in the Maps app with a force-touch, while a light tap would only bring up the directions. This display technology would also make it easy to navigate through apps; for example, you will be able to see all active apps with a long-press at the edge of the screen. Other major additions to the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus include the rose gold colour option, the 70% faster A9 chipset, and 12MP iSight rear camera with 4K recording and 5MP front camera. Apple said the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus will cost the same as their predecessors; iPhone 6S' 16, 64 and 128GB variants will cost $199, $299 and $399 on contract, while the iPhone 6S Plus' three variants have been priced at $299, $399 and $499. iPhone 5S has become the new entry-level model and will be available free on contract, whereas iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (16GB variants only) will cost $99 and $199, respectively.
