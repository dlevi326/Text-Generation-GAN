Since launching in January 2015, the Roadie app has been downloaded more than 130K times and built a community that spans all 50 states.\nBridges, a Grammy-award-winning recording artist and co-founder of Disturbing tha Peace, an imprint distributed by Def Jam Records, has also starred in movies including the Fast & the Furious series and “Crash.”\n“I am intrigued by new technology and I love seeing the Atlanta tech scene on the rise so I partnered with Roadie to help spread the word about this brand new, completely unique app created in Atlanta. In a world where I feel we need a lot more people helping each other out, Friendshipping is the future.” Bridges said.\nBridges has been a long-time supporter of Atlanta-based youth, college students and families through his Ludacris Foundation and the LudaDay Weekend, held each year over Labor Day. The Roadie partnership is another step in his commitment to the Atlanta community. By supporting the Atlanta-based startup scene, Ludacris aims to help provide more educational and career opportunities to area residents. Through the partnership, Ludacris will help promote Roadie at various events, promotions and via his massive social network.\nForming strong, local partnerships is key to Roadie’s growth strategy. In February, Roadie announced a partnership with Waffle House, another Georgia-based company. Waffle House offers Roadie drivers free food and beverages at its more than 1,750 restaurants in 25 states, and provides a convenient meeting location for drivers and senders. Roadies get a free waffle upon downloading the app and a free beverage when they're on a gig (delivery).\nAbout Roadie Inc.\nRoadie, headquartered in Atlanta, is an app-based community that puts unused capacity in passenger vehicles to work by connecting people with stuff to send with drivers heading in the right direction. Roadie’s model enables efficient, low cost delivery for senders and rewards drivers for trips they were already taking. Roadie is backed by Warren Stephens of Stephens Inc.; the UPS Strategic Enterprise Fund; Eric Schmidt’s TomorrowVentures; David Bonderman, founder of TPG Capital; Guggenheim Partners’ Executive Chairman Alan Schwartz; Square Co-founder Jim McKelvey; the Mellon Group; former CEO of ISS Tom Noonan, and H.
