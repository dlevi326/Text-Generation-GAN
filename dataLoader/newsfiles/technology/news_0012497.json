TELUS reported in a press release that it will be making it easier for its customers to scale their Internet of Things (IoT) businesses globally with the introduction of a new TELUS Global IoT Connectivity Platform. The TELUS Global IoT Connectivity Platform connects internet-enabled devices around the world at simplified rates without roaming charges or currency risk. For example, a shipping company with a fleet tracking solution can continue to monitor its vehicles when they travel to the U.S., Mexico and beyond without swapping out SIM cards, worrying about connectivity or encountering billing surprises. The platform dramatically streamlines the management of connected devices by providing one contract and one bill for global access. The solution also provides an at-a-glance dashboard view of the company's connected IoT devices, and SIM cards can be activated or deactivated, monitored for usage and set to provide data alerts no matter where they are. And if there's ever an issue, customers can rely on TELUS and enjoy Canada's best customer service. In addition to TELUS customers, the startups in the TELUS IoT Marketplace will also benefit from the new platform; as it enables them to offer a global solution and quickly expand into new international markets. Launched in December 2014, the TELUS IoT Marketplace has rapidly grown to now offer more than 75 solutions from 25 partners. To learn more about TELUS' IoT solutions, please visit telus.com/iot.
