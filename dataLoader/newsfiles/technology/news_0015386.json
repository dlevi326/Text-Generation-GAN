In general, vitamin A levels were lower in the liver and higher in other tissues. \nThis strongly suggests that vitamin A in the liver is reduced by excessive alcohol consumption and that these findings are important in the development of alcoholic liver disease. \nThe findings appeared in the FASEB Journal.
