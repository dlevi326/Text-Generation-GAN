You can download the review of the report for free here \nThe report highlights several key developments, such as a 5% increase in throughput 2014 on 2013 in Northern Europe, and that 16 Northern European terminals are now able to handle 18,000 TEU mega-ships.\nAccording to the report, there is now a “consensus” among carriers that the expectation for terminals is to move 6,000 TEU a day when handling a mega-ship, consent amongst stevedores is that a figure closer to 3,500 is more realistic.\nThe most popular TOS system designer recorded as being used by terminals in the report was Navis, with the California-based company’s system utilised in 20 of 75 terminals.\nThe review of the report covers the many pertinent, and interlinked, areas that the industry is presently grappling with; congestion, mega-ships, terminal capacity and gate pressures.\nA regional review is also provided, covering the Baltic / Scandinavia region, UK / Ireland, Europe Northwest and Europe Atlantic.\nIn response to the mounting and inextricably linked challenges of mega-ships, congestion and capacity, Dynamar state that automation is “the holy grail”, furthering the case for advanced technology in every region of the world.\nThe Alkmaar-based company argue that if anything close to the 6,000 TEU move per day carrier demand is to be reached, it would have to be done with the aid of automation.\nSenior Shipping Consultant with Dynamar Dirk Visser said: \"Extensive automation is the only way to achieve more lifts per hour. Fifteen years ago, the largest ship in the world with a capacity of 8,200 TEU could be handled with maximum seven ship-to-shore container gantry cranes. Today’s biggest vessel’s capacity reaches 19,900 TEU, but could only be handled with nine quay cranes at the max.\n\"The first 18,000 TEU ship hit water in mid-2013. By 2019, the number of vessels so large or even bigger will swell to more than 100. All are invariably deployed on the high-volume route between the Far East and North Europe.\n\"Without automation, terminals cannot reach the productivity levels that carriers need to get the maximum return on their investments. An automated crane will work 24 hours, all day and night, without constraints including back and neck stress, fatigue, fading concentration and so on that a human operator in his high above cabin would be subject to.\n\"A terminal operator’s investments in the handling of much larger ships should, but do not necessarily translate into higher stevedoring prices; carriers rather pass the economy of scale savings on the shippers in the form of yet a lower freight rates.\"\nView the full report from Dynamar here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:40:04.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
