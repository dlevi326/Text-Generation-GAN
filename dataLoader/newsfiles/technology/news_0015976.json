We are lulled into the illusory feeling that we as voters have\"power\", because we vote for a particular party, but the sad reality is that once these parties are\"voted\" into power, they generallydo as they please with total disregard and impunity to the will and aspirations of the people, even those who voted for them.We do not have any say in the deployment of cadre's into postions of power.It is much like a woman having sex with a man with a condom.It gives her a sense of \"warmth\" , enjoyment and security, whilst being screwed\".The comments section has been the epitome of our cobstitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of thought and expression. No govt. or news story should be considered being beyond the scope of public opinion.If the govt. , pubic and media want loyalty and decorun and servile\"respect\", then I suggest they get a dog!Respect is a two way street and must be earned, not demanded.The govt. and public stories need to be open to all legitimate comment and not be labelled as\"hate\" speech, simply it is not servile and fawning to their favour.The only thing that should be\"filtered\" out of comments, is vituperitive ad hominem!What we have in this country is simply an oligarchy sustained by blind loyalty and enjoyed by the moneyed class within the govt. and media.Better to know the feelings of the nation, than to gag them into silence and perceived submission.When the powder keg explodes, you will be totally clueless.Comments are alsi just another\"condom\", perpetuating the myth that our opinions are being heard and taken seriously.We the people know that the comments are like water on a ducks back.But at least we get to vent some steam and delay the inevitsble explosion.\n totally disregard the\"will\" and aspirations of the people and become a law unto themselves.
