Innr is using the Ayla IoT platform, including Ayla’s Agile Mobile Application Platform (AMAP) technology, to scale its smart home lighting solution across Europe. \n“We realized that to add the functionality, security and compatibilities needed to extend beyond our local base would be prohibitively expensive, time-consuming and complex to do ourselves,” said Jeroen Dalderop, CEO and co-founder of Innr. “We are in the lighting business, not the IoT connectivity business. Ayla not only provides all the back-end connectivity, security and cross-brand compatibility we need, but also has the AMAP framework for adding mobile app control to our cloud-based products.” \nInnr, founded by former Philips executives, develops and markets smart home lighting solutions with the goal of bringing better home lighting within reach of everyone. Innr uses knowledge of light placement and light intensity to allow users to create room- and activity-specific lighting “scenes” that affect users’ moods in advantageous ways. \nFor example, users can create lighting scenes for family dinners in the dining room, or cocktail parties in the living area, or movie night in front of the TV, or kids’ homework or parents’ reading in particular areas in the house. Innr’s online Light Advisor lets users quickly and easily design a professional lighting plan, including the products needed, to create scenes for each user’s individual home layout and needs. \n“Innr is an exciting company with a very cool product line that’s perfectly suited for Ayla’s end-to-end IoT connectivity,” said David Friedman, CEO and co-founder of Ayla Networks. “With Innr, we now have customers on three continents: North America, Asia and Europe.” \nThe Innr smart lighting product portfolio includes a growing range of smart lamps, luminaires and sensors. People can use the Innr smart lighting products and cloud-based platform to achieve lighting results previously reserved for professionally designed and installed systems. Innr sells its products through home improvement and consumer electronics retailers in the Netherlands, as well as through its website, and is actively expanding distribution across Europe. \nAbout Ayla Networks \nAyla Networks provides the industry’s first Agile IoT platform, accelerating development, support and ongoing enhancements of connected products for the Internet of Things.
