Cars require tuning, houses need repairs, and you should have regular check-ups. So why shouldn’t the same concept apply to loyalty and customer engagement strategies as well? Market forces change and so do customer habits, behaviors, and opinions. Therefore, in order to remain competitive and relevant, brands should regularly give their loyalty programs a comprehensive “HealthCheck.”\nBrands must ask themselves if the loyalty program they currently have is as engaging as it once was. More pointedly: Does the loyalty program provide an edge over competitors? Is it truly driving the behaviors that inspire customers to give their loyalty, and is it doing so profitably?\nThis webinar will (a) give you a robust approach to evaluating your loyalty program (b) help you “sniff out” where some of the opportunities in your program might be.\n“The very best programs have a healthy tension between balancing the needs of the customer with the needs of the business,” says Manu Sarna, VP Loyalty Strategy & Analytics at Aimia, “Imbalance one way or the other and you can watch the red ink flow from your program.”\nJesse Grittner, Senior Director at Aimia: “A loyalty program HealthCheck is so much more than just seeing what points value your customers earn relative to your competitors – you have to review every aspect of your offerings and operations to ensure they’re delivering optimal value to your brand.”\nOn Oct. 1, 2015 at 1 p.m. EDT, Loyalty360 will host a webinar titled, “ Give your Loyalty Program an Annual Physical with a Loyalty HealthCheck ,” which will be presented by Aimia .\nJoin Manu Sarna, Aimia VP of Loyalty Strategy & Analytics, who has been Quote: d on loyalty in multiple publications including Canadian Retail, The Globe and Mail, Star Tribune, National Post amongst others and Jesse Grittner, Senior Director of Loyalty Strategy & Analytics, who has led the design of loyalty programs for a number of global brands across the retail, hospitality, and media industries.\n“Life is never static and almost everything exists in a dynamic flux,” said Mark Johnson, CEO & CMO of Loyalty360 – The Loyalty Marketers’ Association . “Brands need to understand that this applies to marketing strategies as well. Brands simply cannot rely on old modes of thinking to remain competitive today. And this webinar will offer the insights marketers need to redesign any loyalty program. ”\nMarketers are invited to join Loyalty360 and Aimia on Oct. 1, 2015 at 1 p.m. EDT to learn how create, or recreate, a loyalty program that provides a competitive edge.
