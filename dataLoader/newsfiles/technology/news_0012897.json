It said individual countries should have the right to ban U.S. companies from transferring data in the future. \nThe court said the easy access to the data by the U.S. authorities \"constitutes an interference with the right to respect for private life and the right to protection of personal data.\" It also said that U.S. intelligence services were carrying out \"mass, indiscriminate surveillance.\" \nThe case against Facebook was brought forward by Austrian law student Max Schrems. He said he was uncomfortable with the way Facebook transfers his personal data to the U.S., where it can be accessed by authorities with little respect for his privacy. He used documents exposed by the Wikileaks whistleblower Edward Snowden to illustrate the problem. \n\"This finding, if confirmed by the court, would be a major step in limiting the legal options for U.S. authorities to conduct mass surveillance on data held by EU companies, including EU subsidiaries of U.S. companies,\" Schrems said in a statement. \nRelated: Google under siege in Europe \nFacebook said it operates \"in compliance with EU Data Protection law.\" \n\"Like the thousands of other companies who operate data transfers across the Atlantic we await the full judgment,\" a Facebook spokesperson said. Austrian activist Max Schrems brought the case against Facebook. \nA final ruling is expected later this year. In the majority of cases at the European court, the verdict is consistent with the opinion of the advocate general. \n\"The opinion on U.S. surveillance is very strong,\" Paul Bernal, data protection expert and a law lecturer at University of East Anglia, said. \n\"To say strongly and clearly that US surveillance is 'mass, indiscriminate surveillance' is very direct,\" he added. \nThe case could cause headaches for other big U.S. companies operating in Europe. Around 4,000 companies use the current rules to transfer data. \nOther big tech companies, such as Google ( GOOG ) , Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) , and Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 ) , are already under the scrutiny of the European Union over antitrust and privacy concerns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:35:55.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
