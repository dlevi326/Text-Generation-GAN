A lawsuit calling into question the employment status of Uber drivers will be heard as a class-action suit on behalf of tens of thousands of people who drive for the company, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled on Tuesday. The ruling by Judge Edward M. Chen will allow a jury to decide whether Uber drivers should be considered employees or 1099 contract workers, named after a tax designation, which does not require the company to pay payroll taxes or apply minimum wage and overtime laws to the drivers. In some states, the designation also exempts Uber from paying for things like health insurance or general vehicle upkeep. The case speaks to the heart of Uber’s business model, which lets the company keep its costs low while recruiting scores of people who use their own cars to ferry passengers around more than 300 cities worldwide. Uber’s rapid growth in just five years has given rise to a new service economy applying a similar contract-worker model across multiple sectors, from house cleaning to grocery delivery. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer representing the drivers, did not immediately comment on the decision by Judge Chen, of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California. Uber has contested the suit since it was filed in 2013, asserting that the company is in the technology and logistics business, essentially an online marketplace matching willing riders with available drivers that should not be considered a traditional transportation company. Uber has frequently said its drivers are able to set their own schedules, are not forced to wear uniforms and do not have to abide by the many other requirements that companies can impose on their employees. In July, it came out strongly against the class-action suit, presenting testimonials from hundreds of the company’s drivers who say they appreciate the flexibility Uber provides.
