Navis Ready is a validation program, open to all vendors of handheld devices and other hardware technologies intended for use within a container terminal operating environment.\nRead a Technical Paper from JLT on the Internet of Big Things \nBy submitting its VERSO range to Navis scrutiny and achieving validation, JLT is confirming to customers that they can have confidence in the VERSO range of rugged computers — including the new, compact VERSO+ 10 — and that devices will integrate reliably within a Navis N4 2.6 TOS environment at both the hardware and software level.\n\nThe VERSO Series and VERSO+ 10 computers passed the standard tests for Vehicle Mounted Terminals (VMTs), the validation focused on the ECN4 business flows in a container terminal , which included tests for JLT’s VMTs and ECN4 end-to-end CHE flows.\nCopies of the validation reports are available on request.\nReview Navis in the PTI Supplier Directory \nAccess to and confidence in reliable IT technology is critical in a marine port and terminal environment, as business is won and retained based on up-time and the efficiency with which containers are moved from ship to shore, and on to their final destination.\nThe use of rugged computers and wireless communication promotes productivity and efficiency in any sector, but in shipping ports and terminals the harsh environment presents specific challenges to both the hardware and the software.\nJLT’s VERSO range was designed to work in such harsh environments, whether installed in a crane or truck, and has, once again, been independently proven to be up to the challenge.\n“Whether tracking cargo through a port or enabling the automation of processes or equipment, the demands on computer hardware and wireless connectivity in ports are substantially higher than in the average operating environment,” commented Per Holmberg, CEO, JLT Mobile Computers.\n“Validation and acceptance into the Navis Ready Program demonstrates that JLT’s mobile computers meet and exceed these demands.”\nJLT recently featured in a PTI article on the Internet of Things and the Container Port , to read that article, click here \nFact file: JLT Mobile Computers JLT Mobile Computers is a leading developer of rugged mobile computers for demanding environments.
