This was made possible by Fusion's forward-thinking and customer-focused engineering team who have learned not only to expect that failures will happen, but to embrace that fact and build robust systems that are designed from the ground up to work while others are failing. Major companies and online services like Netflix , IMDb , Tinder, reddit, Amazon's own Prime Video service, and many others suffered service disruptions and often left their customers without service. Fusion Interactive's systems were not impacted at all, and no customers experienced any loss of service. \"This is precisely the kind of event that we plan for and design for in our business continuity strategy,\" said Michael Self, Fusion Interactive Group's co-founder and Chief Architect. Self went on to say, \"Disaster and failure are inevitable in the cloud computing world. They're going to happen no matter how much you try to avoid them, so the key isn't simply to try to avoid them. Rather, systems need to be built with an understanding that the goal is to weather any storm, not to try to avoid every storm. Our engineers analyze every technology we use and find the most likely points of failure and build in fail-safes and backup plans for when the failures come...which they always will.\"\nFred White, CEO of Fusion Interactive Group, was quick to add, \"This really speaks well of our technology team. When I see names like Netflix, reddit, and Amazon themselves, being impacted by an outage like this, but then I receive an email from our architecture team that we had zero impact, I just can't help but break out into a big smile. The women and men of Fusion Interactive Group really should be proud of what they've built and what a great service level they provide to our customers around the clock. We know that business continuity is a major area of focus for our customers, so we have to insure that our systems help our customers stay up even during disasters.\"\nAbout Fusion Interactive Group:\nFusion Interactive Group is the trusted leader in innovative virtualized technologies, including a wide range of communication and computing capabilities enabling dynamic businesses from SMBs through multi-national enterprises. visit fusionig.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2F3cy5hbWF6b24uY29tLw==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbWRiLmNvbS8=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20v", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mdXNpb25pZy5jb20v"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T12:07:11.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
