An operating system can link services such as digital entertainment, health care and travel, and allow the company to cross-sell items.\n“We will continue to invest in the operating system,” Tsai said. “We will continue our transition from PC to mobile.”\nApple Inc.’s iOS and Google Inc.’s Android dominate the world’s smartphones, curbing enthusiasm for competing software developed by companies such as Samsung Electronics Co and Tencent Holdings Ltd.\nOn Thursday, Apple unveiled a plethora of new products including its latest iPhones and a bigger iPad. And an estimated nine of 10 Chinese smartphones run on Android.\nTsai however has set a target of getting YunOS onto tens of millions of smartphones, without providing a timeframe.\nAlibaba, which has made it a priority to reach customers on mobile and other devices beyond the PC, has made some headway with YunOS. It has partnered with China Telecom Corp. to sell YunOS phones and has deals to get the software onto TVs.\nTsai was speaking on the sidelines of a Thursday preview for a Nov. 14 U.S. college basketball game . Teams from the National Collegiate Athletic Association will square off in China for the first time during a regular season.\nLarry Scott, commissioner of the Pac-12 conference, said China has become one of the most important markets for the sport. The Pac-12 conference includes Stanford University and University of California at Berkeley.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T19:30:40.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
