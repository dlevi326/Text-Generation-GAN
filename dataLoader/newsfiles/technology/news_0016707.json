The product line, realized as a part of the Minco Technology Labs, LLC acquisition and based on a group of Linear Technology Corporation's best in class Linear, Mixed-Signal and Interface semiconductors, will now be manufactured and supported from Micross’ Orlando operations site. This product line, with its 50 SMD listed/5962 drawings supporting 202 device/package options which are currently qualified in our Texas facility, has successfully transferred to our Orlando site within five months. Our ability to complete this product transfer very quickly was facilitated by Micross’ Orlando facility being a MIL-PRF-38535, Class Q certified facility and having been qualified on many of the same listings. Each SMD listed item will be qualified in the Orlando facility at time of order placement. All item materials and manufacturing processes are those used and qualified in the Texas facility. At any time a process, material change or process enhancement is required, it will follow a change control process which includes customer notification.\nDavid Harrison, Product Marketing, noted: “Our intentions for this product line include expansion of devices offered as QML-Q/883 devices, in multiple package outlines under the Micross brand and product specific specification sheets, thus providing a critical continuance of support for hermetic packaging that is no longer available from the original semiconductor manufacturer.”\n“Our vision is to provide our semiconductor principals unique value by centralizing sales, distribution and support, thereby being a valued partner and for our clients, a broad suite of solutions, services and support. We continue to drive improvements in our business to deliver world class services and products to our customers, both domestically and internationally. The integration of the QML, Linear Technology based solutions is the latest example of our efforts,” added Tony Hamby, Chief Commercial Officer.\nAbout Micross Components\nMicross Components is a leading global provider of distributed and specialty electronic components for military, space, medical, and demanding industrial applications.
