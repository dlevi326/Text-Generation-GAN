Fortunately, Pyne will not be flying solo. He finds partners in Wyatt Roy, the new Assistant Minister for Innovation, and Minister for Small Business and Assistant Treasurer Kelly O’Dwyer, both of whom will play important roles.\nFor Australia’s start-up community, which has been effusive in its praise for Turnbull, the prospect of dealing with Pyne may prove to be an interesting exercise.\nBut the initial reaction to the reshuf­fle on the whole has been positive.\nPeer-to-peer lender MoneyPlace’s chief executive Stuart Stoyan is particularly pleased with the ascension of O’Dwyer, citing her active interest in fostering innovation and growth among the start-up community as a real plus.\n“This interest is genuine — over the past six months she has pro­actively engaged with MoneyPlace in discussions on a wide range of issues, including ESS (employee share scheme), reducing red tape, the need for promotion of STEM (science, technology, engineer and mathematics) and ASIC’s innovation hub,” Stoyan says.\nWhile O’Dwyer will look to streamline the regulatory landscape for technology-focused start-ups, it’s likely Roy will be the face of the innovation beat in Canberra. The intrepid Roy has completed several trips to the global innovation ­hotbeds and is gearing up for another to Israel in November. His ­commitment to the start-up sector has already won him plaudits and it’s Roy rather than Pyne who is likely to lead the charge for the start-ups.\nAs for Pyne, whose final act in the education portfolio was the release of the long-overdue national digital technologies curriculum, the emphasis needs to be on commercialisation and ensuring that a reinvigorated CSIRO, headed by former Telstra boss David Thodey, is off to a flyer.\nThat means prosecuting a case that’s less focused on the dollars and more on commercial outcomes, which in turn has the potential to improve awareness of Australia as a desirable place for global investors and technology professionals.\nThe wish list from the tech community will be long and any far-reaching outcome will depend on the policy, which Turnbull will keep a close eye on.\nShark Tank judge and start-up millionaire Steve Baxter is hopeful that Pyne has the tenacity to carry out the agenda that Turnbull is preaching so enthusiastically and says it’s time for a policy push to encourage greater commercialisation of Australian technology initiatives.\nAccording to Baxter, the millions poured into research locally have yielded precious little of value so far ­and one of Pyne’s key priorities needs to be finding a remedy to this predicament.\nHe may be divisive, but Pyne’s not scared of a fight and for some in the tech community that attitude just may be what’s needed to get the job done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:36:47.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
