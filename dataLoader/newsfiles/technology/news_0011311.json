Users swipe up on your screen, select a card, press their fingerprint to the fingerprint reader (or enter a pin number) and they’re done. \nSamsung Pay uses both both near field communication (NFC) and LoopPay’s magnetic secure transmission technology. Samsung says the service can be used by Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge, and Galaxy S6 owners to make transactions at 90 percent of retail locations in the U.S., Samsung says. \nThe technology communicates with magnetic stripe readers, so most retailers who accept credit cards should also be able to accept Samsung Pay. However, merchants won’t necessarily know that they accept the payment method, which could lead to some complications. \nSamsung Pay competes only indirectly with Apple Pay, but many consumers will make a choice between Samsung Pay and Android Pay. \nApple Pay launched September 9, 2014, with mixed results so far, while Android Pay launched roughly a year later in earlier September 14, 2015.
