China is preparing to unveil broad reforms for state-owned companies which will see some firms shut and others introduce more diversified ownership, according to media reports, in moves one analyst called a \"game-changer\".\nWorries have mounted that China is slowing reforms because its economy, the world's second largest, is faltering, while the stock exchange remains volatile after a collapse from June. \nThe rout has prompted broad government interventions, largely seen as anti-market, to try to shore up prices. \nA purported Communist party document circulating online said the government will \"withdraw a batch, restructure a batch and innovatively develop a batch of state-owned enterprises\" but gave no specific details. \nImages of nine pages of the supposedly 20-page paper were posted on social media, but their authenticity and source could not be verified. \nIt emerged after the official Xinhua news agency said that the ruling Communist Party has approved guidelines for \"deepening state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform\" which will be announced publicly soon. \nReports have previously said that China is considering merging scores of its biggest state firms to create around 40 national champions, from the more than 100 companies managed directly by the central government. \nThe online document also showed the party urged state firms to diversify their ownership and list publicly after restructuring. \n\"We consider this round of SOE reform a game-changer of China's economic development,\" ANZ Banking Group said in a research report on Wednesday. \n\"By encouraging private sector participation and allowing market force to play a decisive role in resource allocation, the reform will unlock a massive amount of economic value.\" \nMany of China's biggest state firms already have listed units on domestic and overseas stock markets, though the state continues to hold majority stakes. \nA key Communist Party meeting in 2013 called for the market to play a greater role in the economy by giving private companies opportunities and requiring state firms to contribute more to public coffers. \nFollowing the meeting, a unit of energy giant Sinopec sold a 30 percent stake in its marketing arm to outside investors for more than $17 billion while a subsidiary of another oil firm CNPC unveiled plans to spin off part of its pipeline business. \nThe new round of reforms envisions using investment companies to act as shareholders in state firms, similar to Singapore state investment giant Temasek, the China Daily newspaper reported on Wednesday. \nBut foreign companies complain that China has implemented few substantive market reforms in the last two years. \nThe economy \"has been dominated by strong state-owned enterprises to which the government channelled the population's savings in order to develop large-scale projects,\" the European Chamber of Commerce in China said Tuesday. \n\"This approach has been costly and inefficient and has to be abandoned now if the market is to play a decisive role in the economy,\" the chamber said in its annual position paper. \nRising costs, falling prices, striking workers -- iron ore mine manager Song Denggan has a lot on his mind, and chain smokes as he faces the prospect of industrial stagnation in China. \nSong's mine in Hebei, a gritty northern province surrounding Beijing, exemplifies the challenges the country faces as it seeks to move from the factory-driven, fast-growing economy of the past to a consumer-led future. \n\"There is no comparison between business now and a few years back,\" the grey-haired industry veteran said. \"The best we can hope for is to remain stable.\" \nIndustries across China are struggling with massive debts and overcapacity, the hangover from credit-fuelled expansion which helped drive a decades-long growth party. \nChina's government says the world's second largest economy is expanding at its slowest for 25 years -- and according to analysts the real figures could be much lower -- and the slowdown has world markets rattled. \nMiners at Song's firm have struggled to increase output in the face of dwindling prices, he said, and have gone on strike over lack of pay, holding a red banner outside the gate reading \"We want our wages\". \n\"We have to maintain production, and even increase it because prices are falling. But our costs are going up,\" grey-haired Song told AFP. \n\"We are feeling the impact of changes in the steel industry.\" \nIt is a pattern repeated across northern China, which is dominated by large, indebted and often state-run firms producing coal, cement and steel. \nPrices in China's once booming real estate sector have remained largely flat over the past year, while overproduction has driven down prices and profits for its suppliers. \nSome northern Chinese regions expanded by less than four percent in the first half of this year. \nManufacturing data has been dismal in recent months, with activity contracting in August, according to an official purchasing managers index (PMI) survey. \n\"A lot of the historical industries which China has built heavily on are in flat-out recession,\" said Christopher Balding, an economist at Peking University's HSBC Business School in Shenzhen. \n\"There are large amounts of industries that have enormous surplus capacity,\" he added. \n- 'Overcapacity is rife' - \nIts a far cry from the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when China won plaudits for averting a slowdown by pumping nearly $600 billion into the economy. \nBut much of the credit -- funnelled through state-run banks to government firms -- fuelled wasteful expansion in industries which now suffer from overproduction, analysts say, while debt repayment is crimping growth. \n\"A lot of Chinese economy activity in the last 10 years has consisted of investments which create a lot of economic activity but not real growth,\" Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University, told AFP. \nIndustrial provinces \"would like to keep the game going... but if you have a lot of debt there's a constraint on your ability to do that\", he added. \n\"Every country that had a growth miracle has ended up with the same problem. And it's very hard to resolve.\" \nBeijing's master plan is to rebalance the economy, putting more money into the pockets of households whose spending will step in to replace wasteful big-ticket investment. \nThe need is felt especially keenly in Hebei, which had 286 million tonnes of steelmaking capacity in 2013, more than the entire European Union. \nBut prices for the metal have tumbled, with overproduction pushing some steel values below that of cabbage. \n\"Overcapacity is rife... and the need to transform the steel sector is pressing,\" local media cited government sources as saying last year. \nReplacing millions of jobs in heavy industry is a huge challenge. \nOfficials hope that more profitable high-tech industries can fill the gap, along with service sectors such as tourism and retail. \nThose sectors have soared in recent years, with shopping malls dotting Chinese cities and online retailers such as Alibaba booming, while travel is high on Chinese middle class wish lists. \nHowever, momentum is slowing and the scale of the substitution enormous. \nBut Pettis warned: \"Bringing down investment means closing non-productive factories, and their workers. If you fire the workers, consumption will fall.\" \n- 'Wildly overoptimistic' - \nCosting 470 million yuan ($74 million), local media have billed the \"Juran Home\" mall in Xingtai, an hour away from Song's mine, as \"accelerating the region's economic transition\". \n\"Developing modern service industries is the key to economic adjustment,\" they quoted a Communist planning official as saying. \nThe retail centre specialises in home decor supplies such as wallpaper, mouldings and furniture, but was nearly empty on a weekday afternoon. \nThere were few customers at weekends either, said Du Zhiyan, 26, who sells woodchip wallpaper. \n\"My boss isn't happy, but there's nothing he can do except lower prices,\" she said. \n\"We will need to find new industries or there is not much hope for the city. State firms aren't doing as well as before.\" \nSome Chinese service sector measures have been holding up -- both official and private services PMI surveys consistently show expansion, and last year the sector grew by 8.4 percent, against 6.1 percent for manufacturing. \nPoor industrial data \"has to be to be set alongside the relatively strong releases that we've also seen concerning the service sector,\" said Mark Williams of Capital Economics. \n\"Part of the shift in sentiment towards China over the last couple of months was people realising that their expectations for China were wildly overoptimistic,\" he added. \nEven so the boom days are over for mine manager Song. The market can recover, he said, taking another drag on his cigarette, \"but it will never go back to the way it was\". .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T16:09:34.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
