In his talk, \"What Got Us Here Won't Get Us There,\" (a riff on Marshall Goldsmith's best seller, What Got You Here Won't Get You There ), Meer will dissect the difficult question of why despite growing security budgets and larger InfoSec teams we are still struggling to solve problems we've \"known about\" since the 90s. In addition to discussing the problems we should be tackling, Meer will explore those activities that we're currently engaged in (as individuals and as an industry) that are doing us all more harm than good.\nBlack Hat Briefings:\nThe infamous Black Hat Briefings – the main talks – headline every annual show.
