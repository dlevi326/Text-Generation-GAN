They grew and swam slower than fish that were not exposed, making them more vulnerable to predators.\nExposure to oil as embryos also altered the structural development of the hearts of juvenile fish.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-08T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:31:37.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
