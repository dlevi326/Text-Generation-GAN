The prosecutors are attempting to fabricate a case out of whole cloth and are targeting a young man due to possible \"occult involvement\" in the past. They are trying to create a case with possible occult links based on the scapegoat and strawman of \"the Occult\" and \"Satanism\" already established by previous cases with tenuous and pseudo links to real Occult practices and real Satanism.\nThis young mans identity has been leaked and he has been dubbed a murderer without having been officially accused or tried. A murderer because of tenuous occult and Satanism links in his past. Guilty until proven otherwise because he liked Vampires and dark aesthetics at one stage .\nThis occult strawman is constructed by consultation with Christian occult \"experts\" who have their fingers in every pie, including the South African Police Service.\nWhy are \"experts\" consulted by police when their only claim to expertise is anecdotal stories about their former involvement with Satanism or the Occult - while their anecdotes don't even match up with any real practices.\nWe essentially have Christians - born-again hucksters, having the power to define and talk about other faiths on their terms. It is unbelievable that in South Africa we still take Satanic Panic rhetoric seriously.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:03:50.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
