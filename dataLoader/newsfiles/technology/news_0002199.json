A total of 15 delegates from the Community, representing each Member State, and the General Secretariat of the Andean Community, arrived at the SES headquarters in Betzdorf, Luxembourg, today for the five-day training session. \n“The training will enable member countries of the Andean Community to optimise SES-10’s coverage,” said Gerhard Bethscheider, Managing Director at SES Techcom Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SES which is in charge of the training. “By interacting directly with our experts, the delegates will develop their knowledge and gain a deep insight into the workings of a satellite. These sessions will also open the doors for potential future partnerships between the Andean Community and SES in areas like disaster response communications and e-health.” \nAs with the first training held last September, the new group of participants will start with an introductory overview of the satellite communications industry and then be taken through a series of sessions that cover the lifecycle of a satellite. \nTechnical, operational, business and regulatory matters will all be covered. Participants will conclude the training with a hands-on exercise, where they will apply their newly-acquired knowledge to design a value proposition and business model for a satellite network. \n“We pride ourselves on going beyond the technical provision of satellite capacity to enable our customers and their end-users to utilize our technology, bringing social and economic benefits to both the Andean Community and Latin America,” added Bethscheider. “This is one of a number of sessions we plan to host in the near future to bring together broadcast communities in different corners of the world and help grow our ecosystem.” \nFor more information please visit http://www.ses.com \nFollow us on:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T19:00:14.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
