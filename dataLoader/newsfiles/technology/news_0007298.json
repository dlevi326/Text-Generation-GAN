They can then transmit the images to a dermatologist through a secure, online application using their computer, tablet or smartphone. This enables physicians to more quickly diagnose and treat skin disorders, benefiting patients – especially people who live in rural areas and lack access to dermatologists or other specialists. Patients can receive treatment faster, and save time and money. \n“Sharing patient data and images remotely reduces the wait for real-time results, which can be critically important for patients – especially when it concerns conditions like skin cancer,” said Dr. Ron Fujimoto, chief medical officer of UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Hawaii. \nSkin cancer and other skin-related issues are a significant concern in Hawaii due to constant sunshine and the state’s close proximity to the equator. The rate of new melanoma diagnoses in Maui, Hawaii and Kauai counties is higher than the national average; in Maui County, the rate is nearly double the national average. Although melanoma is not the most common type of skin cancer, it is the most deadly, responsible for about 75 percent of all deaths from skin cancer. 1 \nFor many people in Hawaii, the nearest dermatologist may be hours away. Arranging to see a specialist could take weeks to confirm an appointment and require additional time off work to travel to the appointment. \n“Telemedicine now gives Medicaid beneficiaries in Hawaii access to more timely care and treatment,” said David Heywood, CEO of UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Hawaii, UnitedHealthcare’s Medicaid business in the state. “This technology helps save time and costs, and gives patients better access to care no matter where they live.” \nUnitedHealthcare, a UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) company, is using telemedicine technology, care provider networks and benefit plan/reimbursement programs to improve access and health outcomes, and reduce costs.
