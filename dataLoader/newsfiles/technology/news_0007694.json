Orders declined from other major markets, down 14.8 percent from China, 12.1 percent from Europe and 17.1 ercent from Japan, the ministry said.\nThe 8.3 percent contraction in overall export orders was the worst since August 2009 when ruling out distortions from the Lunar New Year, the ministry told a news conference. The dates of the long holiday are different in every year according to the lunar calendar.\nTaiwan's export orders, which are seen as an indication of the strength of Asian exports and of global demand for technology, have been contracting after surging last year from strong demand for Apple Inc's iPhones.\nThe drag from exports on economic growth has raised the possibility the central bank may cut its policy interest rate for the first time since 2009 on Thursday.\nEconomist Tim Condon of ING said in a research report ahead of the data the current gap between orders growth and shipment growth was the widest since the global financial crisis.\n\"An obvious explanation that comes to mind is that customers cancelled orders at the last minute,\" he said.\nOn the bright side, manufacturers may get a lift from the release of new Apple products in the fourth quarter.\nOrders in Septembers are likely to exceed August's $35.03 billion in August, the ministry said, though it has said that it did not rule out a full-year drop in overall export orders.\nAmong the seven major categories, only information and communications products posted year-on-year growth in August, up 4.7 percent. Precision equipment and basic materials both shed more than 20 percent.\n(Reporting by Faith Hung; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:10:41.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
