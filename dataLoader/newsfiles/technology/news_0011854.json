This is a huge amount and really points to the ubiquity of plastic pollution.\" \nResearch done in the early 1960s showed that, back then, less than five percent of seabirds had ingested plastic. \nBut that number has soared in recent decades, reaching 80 percent in 2010, with even more birds likely to be affected in years to come, the study found. \n\"We predict that plastics ingestion is increasing in seabirds, that it will reach 99 percent of all species by 2050, and that effective waste management can reduce this threat,\" said the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), a peer-reviewed US journal. \nEver since commercial plastic production began in the 1950s, production has doubled every 11 years, according to background information in the article. \n\"Thus, between 2015 and 2026, we will make as much plastic as has been made since production began,\" said the study. \nScientists have documented concentrations of up to 580,000 plastic pieces per square kilometer in the world's oceans. \nBut the full extent of plastics' impact on birds is not yet known. \n\"Although evidence of population level impacts from plastic pollution is still emerging, our results suggest that this threat is geographically widespread, pervasive, and rapidly increasing,\" said the study. \nWhile coastal bird populations have received much focus from researchers, the study warned that some areas that were not previously seen as particularly dangerous may be perilous for seabirds. \n\"The highest area of expected impact occurs at the Southern Ocean boundary in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand\" because of the high plastic concentration and high seabird diversity in those areas, it warned. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T08:01:52.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
