The new model would involve almost anything being converted into “As-A-Service’’, from back-office functions, IT operations, production processes, supply chain management and customer-facing operations.\n“In many ways, the new kind of As-A-Service outsourcing is going to give enterprises a chance to leapfrog on to new technologies,’’ Ms Jew said.\nThe new As-A-Service outsourcing would involve entirely different commercial models.\n“The As-A-Service model is simpler, focused on outcomes rather than vendor specifications, it’s pay-as-you-go, pay-by-the-drink; it’s almost coming to an outsourcing for the masses because you don’t have these large set-up costs,’’ she said.\nMs Jew warned that vendors had to deliver more sophisticated service offerings.\nAnd she added that the As-A-Service models would move ahead quicker in industries such as insurance, financial services, HR and recruitment, and the health sector.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T07:31:27.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
