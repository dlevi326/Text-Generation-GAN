Other streaming services, including Hulu and HBO Now, already provide in-app purchasing from Apple devices. To be sure, the change isn’t likely to result in a major lift in Netflix subscriber signups. If anything, it’s an acknowledgement of the rapid rise of mobile-video viewing, and the fact that smartphones and tablets are the primary screen for entertainment among a growing mass of people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T13:51:33.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
