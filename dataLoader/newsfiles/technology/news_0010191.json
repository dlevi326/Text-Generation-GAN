Opera\nUsers with severely limited data caps rejoice -- Opera's latest update to its Opera Mini browser for Android has gotten a new update that promises data savings without making your web page look ugly.\nUsually used in lower-end budget phones, the Opera Mini browser was previously limited to just the Extreme-compression mode which reduced web pages to the bare minimum (including scaled-down pictures), the new High-compression mode is optimized for 4G, 3G and Wi-Fi networks and doesn't affect how a page looks.\n\"With the rise of better smartphones and better network conditions our users now want the option to have a less aggressive data compression mode so they can experience the full internet when network conditions allow for it,\" said Christian Uribe, Opera Mini product manager in a statement.\nOther notable features of the mobile browser include a better UI for saving pages, an overhauled tab switcher, private browsing mode and a scalable interface for higher resolution devices. While Opera Mini is usually targeted at lower-end devices, having a scalable interface would also be handy for data-roamers who may use a higher-end smartphone and want to save on data.\nOpera is counting on the update to reach out to more users -- the company has set a target of 275 million Android users by the end of 2017, and a big chunk of this user base will come from India and Indonesia, where users experience slower internet and network issues.\nThe Opera Mini revamp follows a recent update to the company's Opera Max browser , which added the capability of saving data for users who want to watch videos on YouTube or Netflix.", "external_links": ["http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/08/d1ca8cc5-c72f-42f8-88e6-536e0ac5e598/resize/970x546/0bf74368909cef3ad1ed183de0835f33/operaminicompression.png"], "published": "2015-09-08T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:09:27.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
