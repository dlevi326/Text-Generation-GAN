I offer my deepest apologies to our customers, the authorities and to the public at large for our misconduct,\" the 68-year-old executive said in a video statement after VW admitted that 11 million of its diesel cars worldwide had been fitted with devices that could skew emissions data. \nThe \"irregularities... contradict everything that our company stands for,\" Winterkorn said. \nThe carmaker would be \"ruthless\" in its investigation of the matter and would act \"quickly, thoroughly and transparently,\" he promised. \n\"(Our) top priority is a rapid and comprehensive investigation. We owe that to our customers, our employees and the general public.\" \nWinterkorn insisted that \"manipulation must never again occur at Volkswagen. Millions of people all over the world trust our brands, our cars and our technologies.\" \nVW, previously seen as paragon of German engineering, has become engulfed in one of the biggest scandals seen in the automobile sector in decades. \nThe company, one of the heavyweights of the German blue-chip DAX index, has seen its market capitalisation slashed by nearly a third in two days and said the costs of the scandal will cause it to miss its profit targets for this year. \nUN calls VW cheating scandal 'extremely troubling' United Nations, United States (AFP) Sept 22, 2015 - The United Nations on Tuesday described as \"extremely troubling\" Volkswagen's admission that it had equipped 11 million of its cars with devices to cheat emission tests and urged the auto giant to correct the situation. \n\"The auto industry has to be a partner in all efforts in the private sector in terms of combating climate change,\" said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric. \n\"I hope the company, Volkswagen, cooperates fully and rectifies the issue,\" he said. \nVolkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn apologized for the scandal that has triggered investigations in the United States, France and South Korea, among other countries, sending company shares into a tailspin. \nUS authorities announced Friday that special software on VW diesel vehicles drastically reduced output of pollutants when they were undergoing emissions test. \nThe cheating device affected nearly half a million vehicles sold in the United States. \nVW faces US criminal probe on cheating scandal: source Washington (AFP) Sept 22, 2015 - The United States has opened a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, which has admitted almost 500,000 of its cars in the US have a clean-air cheating device, a source close to the probe told AFP Tuesday. \nThe investigation is being led by the US Justice Department's environment and natural resources division, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity and confirming media reports. \nThe German automaker is already under investigation by the US Environmental Protection Agency, and could face up to $18 billion in fines related to that inquiry. \nThe California Air Resources Board is also investigating Volkswagen's violations of emissions standards. \nVolkswagen, the world's largest automaker by sales in the first half of this year, has said it is cooperating with the various US investigations. \nOn Tuesday, Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its diesel cars worldwide are equipped with devices that can cheat pollution tests. \nA hearing over the emissions scandal will be held soon in Congress, two Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives announced Monday. \nVolkswagen's pollution cheating scandal escalated dramatically Tuesday when the automaker revealed 11 million of its cars worldwide could be affected, wiping a third off the company's market value and threatening to topple its chief executive. \nAs the United States opened a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, chief executive Martin Winterkorn offered his \"deepest apologies\" for the scandal which threatens to tarnish Germany's pristine industrial reputation. \n\"I am infinitely sorry that we have disappointed people's trust. I offer my deepest apologies to our customers, the authorities and to the public at large for our misconduct,\" the 68-year-old executive said in a video statement and promised to be \"ruthless\" in getting to the bottom of the scandal. \nThe \"irregularities... contradict everything that our company stands for,\" Winterkorn said. \"Manipulation must never again occur at Volkswagen.\" \nThe German firm has halted all diesel vehicles sales in the United States during the US probe, which could lead to fines amounting to a maximum of more than $18 billion. \nAuthorities from France to South Korea also said they would investigate the affair, prompting Volkswagen to announce that it was setting aside 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) in provisions for the third quarter to cover the potential costs of the scandal. \n- Profit warning - \nVW shares, which dived 17 percent on Monday, closed down a further 19.8 percent on Tuesday at 106.00 euros, as the automaker's new revelations, including a warning that it will have to lower its profit outlook, sent investors fleeing. \nWhen US authorities announced Friday that special software on VW diesel vehicles drastically reduced output of pollutants when they were undergoing emissions tests they said it concerned nearly half a million vehicles sold in the United States. \n\"Further internal investigations have shown that the software concerned is also installed in other diesel vehicles,\" VW said in a statement. \n\"Anomalies have shown up in around 11 million cars worldwide that are equipped with a specific engine type,\" added the car manufacturer, the world's biggest by sales in the first half of this year. \n\"In order to cover the necessary service and other measures to win back customer confidence, VW plans to set aside 6.5 billion euros in provisions in the third quarter. The group's earnings targets for 2015 will be adjusted accordingly.\" \nThe impact on the reputation of Volkswagen, whose parent company also owns brands including Audi, Skoda and Lamborghini, is hard to measure. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel called on the company to show \"full transparency\" to clear up the matter. \n- 'No others involved' - \nWhile the scandal has been restricted to Volkswagen so far, environment protection groups, particularly in Germany, suspect other carmakers may be using similar technology. \nThe US Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that it will screen for defeat devices in other manufacturers' diesel vehicles now on the road, although it declined to identify the automakers whose vehicles will be tested. \nGerman Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said however there was no indication so far that others apart from Volkswagen were involved. \nDobrindt said a commission of inquiry -- made up of transport ministry staff, employees of the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) and scientists -- would travel this week to VW Group headquarters in the northern city of Wolfsburg. \nTheir mission would be to interview VW experts and examine company documents to verify \"whether the vehicles in question were built and tested in full compliance with German and European rules\". \nIndustry experts believe Winterkorn's job is on the line. \nSenior members of VW's supervisory board met late Tuesday, the German news agency DPA said. \nIt said no information has emerged about any decisions taken at the talks, which are to continue on Wednesday. \nThe regional Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung earlier said that \"Winterkorn has lost the confidence of the major shareholders\". \n- Market capitalisation \nThe shockwave of the scandal has slashed VW's market capitalisation by about 25 billion euros to 51 billion euros in just two days. \n\"Our company was dishonest, with the EPA and the California Air Resources board, and with all of you and -- in my German words -- we have totally screwed up,\" the chief executive of Volkswagen America, Michael Horn, said at an event in New York late Monday, according to video posted by CNBC. \nFrench Finance Minister Michel Sapin requested a Europe-wide probe, and Environment Minister Segolene Royal said she was launching an \"in-depth\" probe. \nSouth Korean officials summoned VW representatives for explanations on Tuesday, saying tests would be started by \"no later than next month.\" \nBritain called on the European Commission to urgently investigate vehicle emissions tests, and the United Nations described Volkswagen's admission as \"extremely troubling\". \nIn addition to the environmental probe already under way, the US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation, a source told AFP. \nThe investigation is being led by the US Justice Department's environment and natural resources division, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity and confirming media reports. \nAccording to the US authorities, VW has admitted that it had equipped about 482,000 cars in the United States with sophisticated software that covertly turns off pollution controls when the car is being driven and turns them on only when it detects that the vehicle is undergoing an emissions test. \nWith the so-called \"defeat device\" deactivated, the car can spew pollutant gases into the air, including nitrogen oxide in amounts as much as 40 times higher than emissions standards, said the US Environmental Protection Agency, which announced the allegations Friday along with California authorities. \nspm/hmn/rl/wdb", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:00:01.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
