The platform is expected to facilitate more than 20 million messages a month ­between healthcare workers and patients.\nThe multi-million-dollar rollout of MEMS is now under way across hundreds of primary and secondary care facilities in ­England and Scotland, with deployment completed in Queen Victoria Hospital in Sussex and Royal Surrey County Hospital.\nSoprano’s chief executive, Horden Wiltshire, said MEMS provided a secure communications platform for health providers and patients.\n“Across these facilities, MEMS is connecting a spiderweb of proprietary and third-party mission-critical IT applications that deliver high-volume SMS, email and fax messages to employees and patients,” he said.\n“While this is happening in an individual ‘doctor and nurse to patient’ environment, it’s also ­enabling quick and secure SMS connections to help improve ­hospital administration and, on a wider scale again, broadcasts to whole communities.”\nSMS usage was expected to grow even as mobile messaging was adopted in specialised medical areas such as ambulatory and urgent care, Mr Wiltshire said.\nHe added the MEMS deployment could lay the foundation for future opportunities for Soprano and its GAMMA encrypted ­mobile messaging application.\nThe application could potentially be the next step implementation across the healthcare platform. Soprano said it was scoping out implementation opportunities with institutions in Britain. “Through MEMS we’re ­providing a cloud platform at a low overall cost to align multiple service layers across geographically dispersed locations,” Mr Wiltshire said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:55:30.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
