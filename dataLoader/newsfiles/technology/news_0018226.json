Ms. Ellis' son, Ryan, struggled with learning to write the alphabet for years, despite using all the programs and theories available. Finally, Ellis realized she could motivate her son by using the tool he responded to best: television. Together, Ellis and Danielson made an engaging three-minute video about writing the letter \"c\", and Ryan began to write - within minutes! \nTheir discovery prompted the two to become business partners and produce professional DVD writing programs that have helped tens of thousands of children in school systems, clinics and homes around the world. \"When we began filming our first Alphabet Beats program in September 2005,\" says Ellis, \"we were hoping that our unique idea would help...50 kids, and we've definitely surpassed that! In honor of this ten year anniversary, for the month of September, we are offering 10% off all products using coupon code \"TVT10\" . This is the first time we've ever offered a sale, but we really wanted to celebrate this successful occasion with others.\" \n\"Writing is a fundamental skill that many children with special needs like Autism and Down syndrome struggle to achieve,\" says Danielson. \"Knowing that you've helped to create something that makes learning to write motivating and fun is an amazing gift. As a pediatric occupational therapist you hope to make a difference in every child you treat. To me, it's incredible to know that I'm helping children I've never even met before -- all over the world.\" \n\"We continuously receive incredible stories about children with Autism and Down syndrome that have struggled with letter identification and writing for years,\" says Ellis. \"Our product is like a magic switch for them and many make immediate progress or shortly after they watch our videos. Our multi-sensory approach of pairing visuals with rhythmic chants and songs speaks the language they needed all along.\" \nThe TV Teacher has been featured on CNN, NBC, CBS, FOX, various radio, and print media.
