Image caption Images of the moon from LRO \nNoah Petro is a deputy project scientist at Nasa and has been chatting to Newsbeat from his base in America. \n\"With the eclipse the spacecraft will be out of direct sunlight for just about three hours,\" he says. \n\"Normally LRO recharges batteries in the sunlight so when we go into eclipse we are very cautious with the spacecraft. \n\"We have been through a number of eclipses over the years and no how to take care of the spacecraft.\" \nNoah told us that they are keeping a close eye on LRO. \n\"There are two things that happen during the eclipse, it gets very cold and there is no sun to charge the batteries. \n\"We preheat the spacecraft and we turn off instruments bar one to keep the spacecraft safe. \n\"It's like on your phone, whenever I get the alert that I am at 20% I can turn off the wi-fi or certain applications running in the background. \n\"We anticipate a very smooth ride during the eclipse and a smooth recovery. We will be really prepared for it and will be ready to tackle it. \n\"We will be watching the battery levels and will be ready to react if something doesn't go according to plan. We will make sure it comes out of the eclipse in fine shape.\" \nThere won't be another total lunar eclipse until 2018 and there won't be a supermoon and lunar eclipse at the same time until 2033. \n\"It's not like the difference between an ordinary man and Superman,'' said Alan MacRobert, a senior editor at Sky & Telescope magazine. \n\"It really ought to be called a tiny, slightly little bit bigger moon, rather than the supermoon.'' \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:40:54.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
