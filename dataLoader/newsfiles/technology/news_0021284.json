Built specifically for small businesses, MDS’ affordable cyber security platform protects the long-standing New York restaurant against outside intrusion, hackers and viruses and ensures the safety of all customer and in-house data, including Point of Sale (POS) transactions, customer credit card data and public Wi-Fi with content filtering.\nA 40-year-old dining landmark of Williamsville, NY, Protocol Steak & Seafood Restaurant is a family owned and operated restaurant, bar and banquet facility. Protocol Restaurant’s decision to leverage MDS’ platform was driven by its need for an affordable cyber security solution that would protect against the latest threats without the need for tedious, time-consuming updates, freeing up the time to focus efforts on maintaining day-to-day operations and growing the business.\n“As cyber security continues to be a growing concern, I knew it was critical as a small business to ensure the security of customer data as well as the livelihood of my business should an attempted cyber attack occur,” said Paul Pelczynski, owner and president of Protocol Steak & Seafood Restaurant. “No other solution compared to the value MDS provided us at the price point we could justify allocating towards cyber security. I’m satisfied with how it’s working out and have already started recommending MDS to other small businesses in the area.”\nVisa reports that restaurants account for 73 percent of the data breaches in the United States in 2011. According to the Verizon Communications 2013 Data Breach Investigations report, 62 percent of data breaches in 2013 affected small to medium sized businesses. In addition to the financial setback of a breach, restaurant industry owners also run the risk of jeopardizing their reputation as Visa reports that 46 percent of customers avoid merchants in response to fraud or a data breach.\n“We are thrilled to see MDS’ cyber security solution being utilized by Protocol Restaurant and are confident that our unique solution will protect the restaurant’s valuable in-house data, as well as those of customers,” said Andrew Bagrin, founder and CEO of My Digital Shield. “Taking into account that one data breach can cost a small business as much as $300,000, more restaurant owners are realizing the importance of data security. MDS’ platform has been helping small business owners sleep better at night knowing that it is filtering and cleaning all the data by working as a gatekeeper between their internet connection and data collection devices – whether that be a POS system, tablet, smartphone, etc.”\nFounded in 2013 to bring affordable, enterprise-level security technology to the small business, MDS has become a leading provider of Security-as-a-Service (SECaaS) and has served numerous managed service providers (MSPs) and small businesses across various industries including retail, restaurants, hospitality, and professional services.\nMDS is currently offering Shield Test ( http://www.shieldtest.com ), an online-based, complimentary security assessment tool that helps small businesses measure their vulnerability to cyber threats.
