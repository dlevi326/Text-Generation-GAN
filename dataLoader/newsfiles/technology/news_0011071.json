Once police gained entry, they found a man and his female partner, believed to be a prostitute, rushing to put on the rest of their clothes.\nThe project, nicknamed Project Abasebenzi Bocansi, which translates to “sex workers” in English, was the brainchild of Pietermaritzburg cluster commander Major-General Lucas Ngobeni and has seen more than 15 brothels, illegal BnBs and escort agencies throughout the city being shut down since June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T12:06:21.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
