The game will be available as of December 2015 in all Anglophone and Francophone country worldwide. \nMagic World of Words is the only game in the world to combine aspects of word games and role-playing games. Target Population \nSince each battle lasts less than 2 minutes, and that the game can be played as long as the player wishes, Magic World of Words is suitable for all players, regardless of their age, who use their tablet or Smartphone for entertainment. The game will most appeal to fans of crossword puzzles, word-search games, Scrabble or Boggle, be they novice or expert players. Available in English and in French, Magic World of Words can also be used to improve knowledge of a second language. Role-Playing Aspect \nIn Magic World of Words , the player is a wizard who progresses by accomplishing feats using letters and words. By fighting epic battles against opponents, the player obtains rewards, improves characteristics and discovers new worlds where the wizard is faced with increasingly terrifying and knowledgeable adversaries. Word Games Aspect \nIn Magic World of Words, the player must form words to score points against opponents. As in Scrabble or Boggle, the longer the word, and the more uncommon letters it contains, the more points the word is worth. Interestingly, by forming special words found in the wizard’s library, such as F-I-R-E or B-O-M-B, the player can burn or blast opponents. Also, unlike other games in its category, Magic World of Words allows the player to reuse previously selected letters to create even longer and more powerful words. \nWatch the YouTube video or download Magic World of Words now from YouTube , Facebook or the company’s Website.
