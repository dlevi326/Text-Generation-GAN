They can: -- Check their account status, service plan and current balance -- Dispute usage or other charges and track the resolution process -- Change auto-pay subscriptions and payment methods -- Check service subscription of their account and dependent accounts -- Upgrade service subscriptions for their account and dependent accounts -- Enable or disable services for their account and dependent accounts -- Request additional service lines -- Convert mobile prepaid into postpaid plan -- Check their loyalty rewards program account and redeem points. \nThe Mobile Self-Care app can be implemented as a standalone application or part of a suite of Beesion solutions.
