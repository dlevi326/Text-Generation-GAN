This new platform allows healthcare employers to quickly and easily find and connect with only the types of candidates they need without spending hours with 'old-fashioned' searching. \nEmployers who are registered with StaffDNA will soon have access to this database, which will allow them to specify their criteria by profession, specialty, available start date, desired job type and years of experience. To learn more about a specific candidate found through the database, one click provides the user a downloadable profile that includes the candidate's contact information and other employment data-such as license and certification information or skills checklist-when provided by the candidate. \n\"Healthcare employers understand the importance of finding qualified candidates in a timely manner,\" says Sheldon Arora, StaffDNA founder and CEO. \"StaffDNA's Clinician SmartSearch will show only the most relevant candidates per your criteria with the ease of a few clicks.\" \nAccess to StaffDNA's Clinician SmartSearch will be available in November by monthly subscription.
