Calls are rising for the Obama administration to develop better strategies to neutralise a more assertive China.\nStill, Mr Xi and Mr Obama have used their past summits to project a workmanlike relationship in public, despite friction in their behind-the-scenes discussions.\nIn the interview, Mr Xi cited cooperation on pressing global issues, from agreements to reduce emissions linked to climate change and common efforts in negotiating limits to Iran's nuclear program; rather than supplanting the US, he said, China wants to work with Washington on improving global order, he said.\n\"I don't believe any country is capable of rearranging the architecture of global governance toward itself,\" he said. He later added: \"Facts have shown that the interests of China and the US are increasingly intertwined.\"\nOn issues of contention, however, Mr Xi appeared conciliatory without giving much ground. He said his government treats all businesses fairly and brushed aside complaints by foreign business organisations that regulations are being used to hobble foreign firms, particularly US technology companies, and favour Chinese competitors.\nMr Xi said reclamation and other construction work in the disputed South China Sea that has alarmed neighbours and the US would serve freedom of navigation -- a key US concern -- though he didn't say how. He also signaled that there would be no let-up in restrictions on the internet that have blocked several foreign media sites, including the Journal's English and Chinese editions. He also backed a proposed law that foreign nonprofit groups say would limit their ability to work with social activists.\nMr Xi tried to counter allegations about the cybertheft of trade secrets to benefit Chinese companies -- a problem the Obama Administration is considering using sanctions to deter -- and welcomed greater engagement.\n\"The Chinese government does not engage in theft of commercial secrets in any form, nor does it encourage or support Chinese companies to engage in such practices in any way,\" Mr Xi said. \"We are ready to strengthen cooperation with the US side on this issue.\"\nMr Xi seldom engages with the international media. For the written interview, the Journal submitted a dozen questions to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Mr Xi. While the ministry acknowledged that officials pulled together facts and research for the answers, it said Mr Xi revised and reviewed them.\nXi vows to 'ford dangerous rapids' in pursuit of reforms\nThe answers at times glint with the rhetorical flair that has differentiated President Xi from his immediate predecessors and made him popular among many Chinese. His policies having met resistance from vested interests, he vows \"to crack hard nuts and ford dangerous rapids\" in pursuit of reforms that would rely more on market-based solutions.\nOverall, though, he made it clear that the government will maintain firm regulatory hold as it allows markets broader sway in allocating resources. \"That means we need to make good use of both the invisible hand and the visible hand,\" he said.\nHis current trip to America -- his first formal visit since taking office nearly three years ago -- showcases China's wider sway in the world as visits by previous Chinese leaders didn't. In Seattle, Mr Xi will see top executives of Apple, Microsoft, Boeing and other US business giants on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nMr Xi will address UN sessions over the weekend, presiding at a panel on empowering women. In between are his discussions at the White House and with members of Congress -- the optics of which, Chinese and US officials say, are important for his image back home.\nTroubling to some governments has been the rapidly improving capabilities of China's military at a time when Beijing is more forcefully asserting its maritime claims. Chinese naval vessels recently sailed into US waters in the Bering Sea, the first time the Pentagon had seen Chinese naval vessels there, just as President Obama was visiting Alaska.\nMr Xi said China needs a military commensurate with its \"vast territorial land, sea and airspace and very long borders.\"\nThe Chinese military, he said, has benefited the world, contributing more peacekeepers to UN missions than other permanent Security Council members and taking part in the removal of chemical weapons from Syria.\n\"In strengthening our defence and military building, we are not going after some kind of military adventure. It never crosses our mind,\" he said. \"China has no military base in Asia and stations no troops outside its borders.\"\nEven as the Chinese navy operates farther from home shores, Mr Xi has also worked to improve communications with the US military. The two sides have reached several agreements, one on rules of behaviour when naval surface vessels meet at sea. A similar pact on air encounters is under discussion. Mr Xi said he's looking for more areas of convergence and to lessen the chances for conflict.\n\"The Asia-Pacific should be a cooperative ground for enhanced China-US coordination and collaboration rather than their Coliseum for supremacy,\" Mr Xi said.\nMr Xi offered to extend cooperation to the infrastructure development bank that Beijing founded, joined by US allies like Britain and Germany despite initial objections from Washington. Mr Xi welcomed the US to become a member.\nWhile saying repeatedly that China remains open to foreigners and foreign businesses, he also said that the internet must be carefully regulated to \"safeguard the country's sovereignty, security and development interests.\"\nUnder Mr Xi, arrests and prosecutions of people for spreading what authorities consider rumours have had the effect of subduing social media.\n\"Freedom and order must be upheld side by side in both cyberspace and the physical world. Freedom is the purpose of order, and order the guarantee of freedom,\" he said. Though he didn't directly address the block on foreign news sites, he said foreign companies must \"do nothing to undermine China's national interests and interests of consumers.\"\nStill, Mr Xi said nations must remain open and willing to learn from other civilisations. One of Mr Xi's catchiest slogans has been the \"Chinese dream\" -- the effort to restore China to what many Chinese see as the position of global primacy the Middle Kingdom held for centuries before being eclipsed by the West. The country then slipped into a century of foreign aggression, civil war and social and political upheaval.\n\"To understand today's China, one needs to fully appreciate the Chinese nation's deep suffering since modern times and the profound impact of such suffering on the Chinese minds,\" he said. He added: \"Every country and every nation has a dream, and dream brings hope.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:55:28.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
