An Avid Life Media spokesman declined to comment on the claims.\nLast week, hackers belonging to the group calling itself The Impact Team released nearly 10 gigabytes of data stolen from Avid Life. The data included sensitive information, including Ashley Madison customers’ names, email addresses and credit-card details.\nToronto police have said they are investigating two suicides with potential links to the leaked data. They also said this week that they had confirmed cases of extortion of Ashley Madison clients, in which the clients were threatened with exposure unless they paid 300 Canadian dollars ($US227). The US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security are assisting Toronto police.\n“We are actively cooperating with international law enforcement in an effort to bring those responsible for the theft of proprietary member and business information to justice,” Avid Life Media said on Friday.\nAvid Life has offered a $C500,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the hackers responsible for stealing and leaking the data. Ashley Madison has 33 million registered users in more than 40 countries and special administrative regions, including Israel, Japan, Hong Kong and Turkey, according to Avid Life’s website. The company has said it has five million additional users registered on other dating websites it owns, such as Established Men and Cougar Life.\nBecause Avid Life Media is privately held, it is difficult to verify the company’s user base, revenue and profit figures.\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:34:20.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
