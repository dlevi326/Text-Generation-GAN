It’s a rather circuitous route that has eventually led to Rule creating a business text messaging company that sends about 70 million messages a month and boasts annual revenue of about $70 million.\nRule and fellow MessageMedia co-founder Justin Lau set up the company in Melbourne in late 2000 and received angel investment in 2002.\nThe investors — Mike van de Wiel, Tony Barker and Martin Nicholson — also became early mentors. Rule bought all of the shareholders out in 2009 to own the company outright. Since then his main mentor has been advisory board chairman Michael Schoenfeld.\nMessageMedia serves more than 16,000 business and government customers and has about 170,000 users globally. The business has about 100 staff and 20 contractors across offices in Auckland, Melbourne, San Francisco, Miami and London. Rule is currently overseeing the company’s technology transformation, which will see it move its infrastructure into AWS.\n“We are spending $10m on a complete rebuild of our technology, which is our infrastructure or gateway, our product and also our business systems, mainly CRM and billing systems,’’ he says.\nThe migration of customers has just commenced and will ramp up over the months ahead until it is completed next year.\n“The new system we are building is capable of sending billions of messages a month,’’ Rule says.\n“It means we will be able to provide SLAs (service level agreements) to customers about how quickly we are sending their messages.’’\nRule, who went to university at 27 to do a bachelor of business and accounting, says the appointment of former Netspace founder Stuart Marburg as chief executive last year was necessary for the company. “It is a challenge to be able to recognise that you are not the right person to continue to grow the organisation,’’ says the father-of three, who likes to be told “the unvarnished facts’’ when it comes to business.\nRule, who draws guidance from the Entrepreneurs Organisation, used to be kept awake at night with worries of survival, but these days it’s excitement. “I find that is worse for my sleep than anxiety,’’ Rule says. “I am a competitive person and the notion of becoming a world leader in what we do is something that is very exciting and keeps me up.’’\nMessageMedia is now starting to look at new markets in less developed geographies where messaging hasn’t caught on.\n“We will look at Europe, Asia and South America and really doing assessments of where the opportunities are in those markets.’’\nLike most in the industry, Rule sees a big future for cloud computing in terms of the efficiencies and scalability it offers as well as ongoing development in the area of mobile communications.\n“The great next step in the evolution of our business is the use of links within messages,’’ says Rule, whose favourite technology is the Audible audiobooks app and his Apple Watch.\nRule is also starting to contemplate life beyond MessageMedia and is hoping to spend his considerable energies and acumen into doing something tangible for the community.\nWhile he will remain a director of MessageMedia, Rule will increasingly step out of the company from next year to work with his wife in a foundation funded by the business.\n“I don’t want to look back in 40 or 50 years and think ‘I’m a really wealthy guy, I have got a great family but what did I really contribute, what did I really do for my community’,’’ he says. “My goal is to spend the second half of my life, hopefully, on making that contribution so when I look back I can say I made a difference.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:24:19.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
