Lawyers are moving to consolidate widespread litigation stemming from Volkswagen AG’s emissions-cheating scandal, drawing the German auto maker into a prolonged legal case expected to spur rafts of depositions and demands for billions of dollars in damages.\nPlaintiffs’ lawyers filed more than two dozen lawsuits in courts across the U.S. within days of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Sept. 18 disclosure that Volkswagen VOW, +0.25% VLKAY, -6.66% admitted to cheating on emissions tests for nearly a half million diesel-powered cars sold since 2008.\nVolkswagen says as many as 11 million vehicles world-wide employ what authorities call defeat devices, or software that can make cars appear cleaner than they are during regulatory tests and disable emissions controls during normal driving conditions.\nNow, lawyers across the U.S. are jockeying to move class-action lawsuits, expected to number in the hundreds, before one federal judge for a long-running case. Such consolidated lawsuits are called multidistrict litigation, or MDL, since they are culled from legal actions across different jurisdictions.\nThe history of Volkswagen, 'The People's Car' (3:41) Volkswagen has always been more than a car. It occupies a special place in German society. WSJ's Dipti Kapadia goes through some of the iconic moments\nThe plaintiffs’ lawyers are accusing Volkswagen of defrauding consumers who are suffering declining vehicle values. They’re also seeking recompense for consumers who paid higher prices — in some cases premiums exceeding $6,000 — for models advertised as clean diesel cars with impressive horsepower, fuel economy and emissions.\nThe suits are expected to seek billions of dollars of damages, lawyers said, though they haven’t yet cited specific figures. While a judicial panel has yet to decide whether to consolidate the Volkswagen litigation, many lawyers expect action in coming weeks.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/vw-faces-barrage-of-litigation-1443465416"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T13:08:47.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
