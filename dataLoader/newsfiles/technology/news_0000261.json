(NASDAQ: NUAN) launched Dragon Medical Advisor , a next generation Computer-Assisted Physician Documentation (CAPD) solution that automatically provides real-time quality feedback to physicians while they are documenting patient encounters. This improves the completeness of clinical notes and helps provider organizations meet the impending ICD-10 requirements, justify medical necessity of care decisions, and support better patient care. \nBuilding on the work done in 2011 when Nuance pioneered the industry’s first CAPD solution, Dragon Medical Advisor processes physician notes using any input method – speech or keyboard – analyzes the structured and unstructured documentation within the notes, and automatically provides physicians with clinical documentation improvement (CDI) recommendations based on industry best practices and guidelines. \nCloud-based CDI Advice \nDragon Medical Advisor is a cloud-based solution that leverages the patented Nuance Clinical Language Understanding (CLU) technology. It can be rapidly deployed across any size healthcare enterprise and any electronic health record (EHR) to help physicians create high-quality documentation at the point of care, resulting in a more complete, compliant, and accurate description of the patient story. Designed for both inpatient and ambulatory settings, Dragon Medical Advisor automatically recognizes when incomplete or unspecific information is entered and provides relevant advice on how to improve the quality of the note. The result is a more comprehensive picture of the patient’s condition, improved efficiency of staff, a reduction in discharged but not final billed (DFNB) charts, and more appropriate reimbursement. \n“Building on Nuance’s extensive work with virtual assistants, Dragon Medical Advisor functions like a specialized medical virtual assistant for physicians,” explains Joe Petro , senior vice president of Healthcare Research and Development , Nuance Communications. “It provides immediate feedback during clinical documentation and focuses on high-impact areas, such as congestive heart failure, where the lack of required specificity can negatively affect patient care, as well as coding and risk adjustment.” \nQuery Relief for Physicians \nA recent study found clinicians spend approximately 69 minutes per day searching for information requested by someone else . By providing instant feedback while the patient story is still fresh in the mind of the physician, Dragon Medical Advisor improves productivity by reducing time-consuming and workflow-disrupting retrospective CDI queries needed to provide information required by current regulations such as ICD-10. \n“Dragon Medical Advisor is a win for physicians because it provides immediate feedback on what to improve in clinical notes while they are still thinking about the patient instead of querying physicians to fix records for patients seen hours or days before,” said Rizwan Pasha, MD, practicing ED physician at Kettering Health and Co-Founder of Physician Technology Partners. “This real-time guidance is also a win for organizations that need CDI starting with physician documentation to achieve the appropriate level of reimbursement without disrupting clinical care.” \nAvailability \nDragon Medical Advisor is available today.
