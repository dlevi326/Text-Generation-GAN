In terms of sales value, the two companies swept a 34% market share in 2014. In 2014, Stratasys acquired Solid Concept, Harvest Technologies, GrabCAD, and Interfacial Solutions, while 3D Systems purchased Cimatron ( News - Alert ), Simbionix, LayerWise, Laser Reproductions, Robtec, etc. \nAt present, China's 3D printing market is still at its initial stage, with the industry chain to be improved. For example, some core components and 3D printing materials for China-made 3D printing equipment have to be imported from overseas. But 3D printing technologies in national defense and aviation industries have taken the lead in the world. In 2014, China's 3D printing market size approximated 4.65 billion. It is projected that in the following years themarket size will still grow at an average rate of around 40%, and that it will very likely exceed RMB20 billion by 2018. \nIn 2014, China's 3D printing market featured a rather low concentration degree, and the number of enterprises involved was close to 100, but mostly small-sized. The 3D printing equipment manufacturers consist mainly of Beijing Tiertime Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Farsoon High-tech Co., Ltd., and Shining 3D. \nIn recent years, as the State introduced policies incentive to the development of 3D printing industry, more and more listed companies have entered the industry, a situation that helped integrate and develop China's 3D printing industry. In 2014, there were more than 10 enterprises operating 3D printing business in China, mainly including Golden Laser, Sunshine Laser & Electronics, Guangdong Silver Age Sci & Tech, Yinbang Clad Material, and Jiangsu Asia-Pacific Light Alloy Technology, etc. \nKey Topics Covered: \n1 Overview of 3D Printing \n2 Global 3D Printing Market \n3 China's 3D Printing Market \n4 Key Global Companies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T11:14:12.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
