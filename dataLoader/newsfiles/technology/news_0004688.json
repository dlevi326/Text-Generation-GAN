Bloodhound, which can cover a mile in just 3.6 seconds, will be at Canary Wharf in London before it is fully tested next year at Newquay Aerohub in Cornwall and later at a desert venue in South Africa.\nThe Â£10m Bloodhound was assembled at Avonmouth, near Bristol, and is the result of eight years of research, design and production by more than 350 companies and universities.\nThere are hopes the car can set a new world land speed record by reaching speeds of up to 1,000mph.\nBloodhound technical details. Pic: Flock and Siemens\nThe record currently stands at 763mph and was set by Andy Green in Thrust SSC at Black Rock Desert in Nevada in 1997.\nMr Green, 52, will also be driving Bloodhound, a machine he describes as \"an extraordinary piece of extreme technology\".\nPlay video \"March: Supersonic Car 1,000mph\" Video: March: Supersonic Car 1,000mph The car has three power sources - a Rolls Royce EJ200 jet from a Eurofighter Typhoon, a cluster of Nammo hybrid rockets and a Jaguar V8 engine.\nBetween them they can generate 135,000 thrust horsepower - the equivalent of 180 Formula One cars.\nWhen Bloodhound is on public display, some of the carbon fibre panels will be removed to allow people to see the technology inside.\n1 / 12 Gallery: Previous Attempts To Break The Land Speed Record\nArthur MacDonald set a land speed record of 104mph in 1905 in his Napier racing car. Several records had been set and broken in the preceding decades\nMembers of the public will also be able to see inside the cockpit, which includes a sophisticated digital dashboard.\nRichard Noble, who is the project's director, said there had been \"incredible\" public interest in Bloodhound.\nHe added: \"With the car now built and the track in South Africa prepared, our focus is on racing in 2016.\nPlay video \"Bloodhound Cockpit Unveiled\" Video: Bloodhound Cockpit Unveiled \"That part of the adventure starts with runway tests at Newquay Aerohub next Easter.\"\nThe car is on display at East Wintergarden this Friday and Saturday - the events are free but timed tickets must be obtained in advance .\n:: Tell Us What You Want From The Sky News App \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T11:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T16:04:29.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
