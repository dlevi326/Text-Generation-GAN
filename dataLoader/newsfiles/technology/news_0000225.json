(Photo: Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY)\n11 CONNECT 28 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Apple says it sold more than 13 million iPhone 6S and 6S Plus smartphones during their first weekend of availability, setting a company record.\nThe sales top last year's record weekend, during which Apple sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus smartphones. In a statement released Monday, Apple says the devices will launch in 40 more countries by October 9.\n\"Sales for iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any previous first weekend sales results in Appleâ€™s history,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook in a statement.\nThe results fall in line with most analyst estimates calling for first weekend sales ranging between 12 million and 13 million. A key factor in the higher figures: early availability of the new phones in China. S&P Capital IQ analyst Angelo Zino projects Apple will ship 76 million iPhones during the December quarter, up from 74.5 million the previous year.\nThis year marked the first where China was among the initial launch markets for the new iPhones. Sales of the iPhone 6S models in China are estimated between 2 million and 2.5 million, says FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives, which would mean sales outside of China were up as much as 10% compared to last year.\n\"We believe the stage is now set to show moderate (year-over-year) growth over iPhone 6 for the coming quarters, which should be front and center for Apple investors,\" says Ives.\nThe iPhone 6S and 6S Plus introduced 3D Touch, a feature allowing the touchscreen to measure inputs based on how much pressure is applied to the display. There's also a big upgrade to the rear-facing camera: 12 megapixels. Apple says the new phones will be available in more than 130 countries by the end of the year.\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .\n11 CONNECT 28 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 //usat.ly/1FvYD49 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FvYD49&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1FvYD49", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FvYD49&text=Apple%20sells%2013%20million%20iPhones%20over%20weekend&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787248261226090-XXX-IPHONE-6S-AND-6S-PLUS-76138324.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/09/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787248261226090-XXX-IPHONE-6S-AND-6S-PLUS-76138324.JPG", "http://twitter.com/brettmolina23", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/54528ac33d2d262600214d1eba3eb0929708212a/c=0-0-2426-1824&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787248261226090-XXX-IPHONE-6S-AND-6S-PLUS-76138324.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-28T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T17:08:53.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
