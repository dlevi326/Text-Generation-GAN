The change comes a day after Google introduced its own new logo with a thinner font that could be read on smaller mobile devices.\nThe new logo comes as Verizon looks to transform itself beyond a simple telecommunications giant. The nation's largest wireless carrier is set to unveil a mobile video service that will run on any phone -- regardless of carrier. This follows the rare move of hiring a non-telecom veteran, Diego Scotti, to serve as its chief marketing officer. Scotti previously served as the marketing chief for clothing retailer J. Crew.\nThe cleaner logo is meant to invoke an image of \"simplicity, honesty and joy in a category rife with confusion, disclaimers and frustration,\" the company said in a blog on Wednesday.\nThe large check mark that used to run across the entire Verizon name is reduced in size.\n\"It's a cleaner, more human design and the check mark, the universal symbol for getting things done, uniquely expresses the reliability of Verizon,\" the company said.\nHere's the original logo:", "external_links": ["http://www.verizon.com/about/news/our-look-evolving-along-our-customers", "http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/02/810dbcc4-c877-4d97-b6b4-7f2366d5d699/resize/570xauto/559cc1c0a3ec590582a469053bb07a23/vzlogo640x400.jpg", "http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/10/31/424307b9-4de3-11e3-945a-14feb5ca9861/resize/570xauto/78322ceeedb6d39b147a39061a91959e/verizon-logo-470x310_270x177.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-02T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T01:04:37.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
