At present it is not clear whether the Japanese tech giant is working on delivery drones to compete with Amazon and Google, or is it going to be part of the military equipment.\nWell the drone seems a lot like a miniature plane rather than the conventional-looking four/eight arm copter. The Sony prototype under test is more like an unmanned airplane (UAV) with wings and tail rudders. The drone can take off and land vertically, can obtain speeds of up to 170 Km/h, fly up to 2 hours with its onboard batteries and carry a payload of up to 10Kg.\nFor now, the test flight of the prototype seems to be a success and the drone looks pretty impressive.
