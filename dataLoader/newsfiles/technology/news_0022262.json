Vascular damage that occurs during these kinds of procedures produces no outward symptoms, meaning the patient can bleed undetected, sometimes even for hours after the procedure, amounting in significant blood loss. The Saranas Observer System consists of a standard introducer sheath and dilator set fitted with electrodes and a user interface device mounted on the flush line. \nSuch bleeding complications arise in approximately five percent of vascular access cases, totaling about one million patients per year. These complications are associated with a nine-fold increase in patient mortality, a threefold increase in hospital stay duration, and a twofold increase in cost. In an accountable care organization model, it is unlikely that the costs associated with these complications would be reimbursed, providing a strong financial incentive for early detection. \nThe SOS uses electrical resistance to detect blood loss in real time and alert the physician. The system consists of a standard introducer sheath fitted with electrodes that measure the difference in electrical resistance across the blood vessel. If the artery is punctured, blood begins to accumulate outside the blood vessel, causing a change in the electrical resistance. The SOS is able to detect this change and notify the physician. The user interface device being developed by Cambridge Consultants transmits and receives signals from the sheath electrodes and uses an algorithm to interpret and display the result. \nCambridge Consultants is developing the user interface device (UID) subsystem – the portion of the SOS that generates the electrical current transmitted via the sheath and that receives the return signals from the sheath. The core technology behind the device is an algorithm which extracts meaningful information from the collected data, analyzes it, and displays the result at the user interface. It is challenging to detect a small bleed in an area where there is already a lot of blood, but the algorithm makes detection possible even amidst noise from normal motions during the procedure or from the use of common interventional tools. \nThe product concept has evolved significantly since the partnership began. An earlier concept paired the system with a wireless tablet to provide a rich graphical user interface. However, it turned out that users preferred a more integrated product approach that was simpler to set up and use. Having an integrated team of human factors engineers, industrial designers, and mechanical, electrical and software engineers enabled Cambridge Consultants to quickly create a new product concept shortly after receiving that feedback from an initial user study. \nSaranas has already seen what it believes to be promising results from a preclinical study performed with an early functional prototype developed by Cambridge Consultants. Looking ahead, further human factors engineering work will define how the user interface conveys this information to physicians, while the hardware and software engineering efforts will determine just how precisely this electrical change can be detected in the body.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:48:26.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
