They even managed to snag Lenny Kravitz to play a set. But news broke over the weekend of the EPA investigation into software tweaks VW installed to make a previous generation of diesel engine run cleaner during emissions tests. The timing put Volkswagen USA CEO Michael Horn in the uncomfortable position of admitting the company’s wrongdoing before the new Passat saw the spotlights. \nIn my German words, we totally screwed up. \nIt was Lenny Kravitz who earned his pay that evening, doing a show that temporarily got people’s minds off all the questions behind VW’s actions that were still unanswered. Jalopnik ‘s summary echoed our feelings regarding the event. The situation isn’t one we’ve seen before at this scale and it will likely serve as a cautionary tale going forward of corporate honesty. In fact, this is a very different situation from past automotive debacles like the Ford Explorer/Firestone failures, the Toyota unintended acceleration issues or the GM ignition coverup. \nVW’s case involves something that isn’t physical and no one can actually see. \nThe vast amount of tech that has been added to cars in the last decade is only the beginning of what is to come. You’ve likely heard stories lately of car hacking concerns and in a way dieselgate falls into that category. The TDI models were designed to be more fuel efficient and cleaner operating diesels which they actually were during emissions testing. Owners weren’t getting the same benefits they expected during daily driving though. \nIn isolation, the new Passat looks quite good. VW showed three versions: an all new R-Line performance model, a standard version and weirdly a diesel which little was said about. The exterior of the cars sport wide horizontal grilles and sharper, angular forms. There’s less separation between the styling vocabulary of VW and big brother Audi these days. For people who like the look and want to move up to more premium models, this isn’t a difficult transition. \nEverything we see about the design of the Passat looks well resolved. The designers probably agonized over proportion, shape and balance issues for months to get the car just right. Design is never just about looks, however, and claiming that a product does something when in truth it functions another way can’t be trusted. It is unlikely that any of the designers were aware of the software tweaks that were installed and sadly their past work is now essentially contaminated. \nThe forthcoming government hearings will hopefully shine a light of who knew what about the plan in implementation. But if there is an immediate lesson from this story, especially for designers, it is to constantly ask questions and seek out responsible solutions. In this case, it isn’t a responsibility of the designers to fix. But being informed and challenging issues about how a product functions should be something designers are comfortable with doing. People will now likely look at a VW and think, “that’s a bad car.” They won’t think, “that’s bad software.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:26:09.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
