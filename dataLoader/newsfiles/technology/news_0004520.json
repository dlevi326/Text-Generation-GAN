(Head office: Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo; Representative Director & CEO: Akira Tanae) today announced that Electroplating Engineers of Japan, Limited (Head Office: Hiratsuka-shi, Kanagawa; Representative Director & CEO: Koichiro Tanaka; EEJA), which operates the Tanaka Precious Metals' plating business will establish EEJA Shanghai as a local subsidiary in Shanghai in order to expand and enhance the plating business in China, with operations set to start on September 10.EEJA has been offering non-cyanide plating solution that contains no highly toxic cyanide for several decades. EEJA Shanghai will also offer non-cyanide solution in addition to conventional plating solution using cyanide. It will be the first company to introduce non-cyanide plating solution for printed circuit boards in China. EEJA Shanghai will mainly engage in plating solution analysis, plating technology consulting, and offering advice on customer trials using pilot line and laboratory work, while coordinating with local Chinese companies. Plating solution product sales will continue to be consigned to Tanaka Kikinzoku International (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. With the establishment of EEJA Shanghai, the number of days required until customers within China are supplied with technology services will be reduced by 90%, and improved analysis/evaluation turn-around times are also anticipated. It is feared that cyanide has harmful effects on the environment due to inadequate waste water treatment systems, and restrictions on cyanide have been put in place in China as part of environment conservation policies. Although this is expected to lead to increased demand for environmentally-friendly non-cyanide plating solution, limited Chinese sourcing and production of these solutions have constrained supply. EEJA has developed a cyanide-free electroless plating solution LECTROLESS IGS2020 for printed circuit boards, with lead supply starting in June 2014. The establishment of EEJA Shanghai has hereby created a system for supplying LECTROLESS IGS2020 ahead of our competition. EEJA Shanghai will endeavor to increase the diffusion of non-cyanide plating solution in the Chinese market to meet future customer needs. Within China, EEJA is targeting sales of 720 million yen per year in the first fiscal year and 3.6 billion yen per year in FY2020. Overview of EEJA (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.
