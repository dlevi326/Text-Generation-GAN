Adjusting for currency fluctuations, the company said sales would have improved 2.2%.\nBed Bath & Beyond's sales at stores open for at least a year, a key metric for retailers, rose 0.7%, or 1.1% adjusted for currency fluctuations, well below the company's projected 2% to 3% increase.\nThe company's shares set a 52-week-low at one point during regular trading hours at $58.81 on Thursday and were at $59.00 in recent after-hours trading.\nFor the current quarter, the Union, N.J., retailer projects profit of $1.14 to $1.21, compared with analyst projections, according to Thomson Reuters, of $1.19 a share. In the like year-ago period, Bed Bath & Beyond, which has been aggressively buying back shares, earned $1.23 a share.\nThe company also affirmed its financial projections for the year, calling for sales at established stores to increase 1% to 3% in the third quarter.\nBed Bath & Beyond started in 1971 by selling largely bed linens and bath accessories. It now has more than 1,500 stores under its namesake brand, along with Christmas Tree Shops, Harmon, World Market and others.\nAs part of its expansion, the company is opening stores in Canada and Mexico and is adding specialty departments, such as beauty care, baby and specialty food.\nHigher spending on technology upgrades, sales promotions and digital advertising, however, have eroded the retailer's profit margins in recent quarters. In the most recent reporting period, gross margin narrowed to 38.1% from 38.5% a year earlier.\nThe company's board also has authorized an additional $2.5 billion to share buybacks. As of Aug. 29, Bed, Bath and Beyond said it had about $305 million left for such repurchases under a previous authorization.\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T00:19:52.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
