(NGL), a leading provider of managed freight services, transportation management software (TMS) and supply chain consulting services, announced today it has officially launched a direct integration of its Dynamics TMS® software with multiple versions of Microsoft NAV.\nWritten by Microsoft Dynamics specialist Mark Brummel, this turnkey integration means faster implementations, deeper functionality, and guaranteed backward and forward upgrades for NAV users.\nNGL is a Microsoft Certified Independent Software Vendor (ISV), and Dynamics TMS is a registered Microsoft application. This integration gives users a TMS option that is part of the Microsoft NAV ERP product line, and just has to be configured.\n“The new interface methodology dramatically reduces version update compatibility problems. Since the systems are integrated there are no connections to update or custom work to do,” Brummel says. “We’re proud of this integration and are confident companies will see major transportation cost savings through the use of the integrated Dynamics TMS solution.”\nArchitected using the newest design patterns and development methodology, the Dynamics TMS software behaves like a piece of Microsoft NAV.\n“This is a game changer for shippers using NAV. Dynamics TMS extends the capabilities of NAV for companies that have advanced shipping requirements,” says Ari Smith, CEO of Next Generation Logistics. “The Dynamics TMS application is truly a turnkey solution that can help solve logistics problems for many companies that don’t have a TMS today.”\nAbout Next Generation Logistics, Inc.\nNext Generation Logistics is a leading provider of Managed Freight Services, TMS Software, and Supply Chain Consulting.
