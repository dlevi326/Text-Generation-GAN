This all-in-one industrial stainless touch panel PC supports the low power consumption Intel® AtomTM processor E3827 at 1.75 GHz and supports maximum memory capacity up to 8 GB. The GOT812LR-834 is an excellent human machine interface platform for applications in the following operational environments: marine, food factories, steel mills, gas pumps, outdoor information kiosks, and point of sale terminals.\nTo meet different application needs, GOT812LR-834 has rich expandability interfaces with M12 connectors, including two COM ports (RS-232/422/485), two USB 2.0 ports, and one Gigabit Ethernet port. It offers two LCD options: one is a 12.1-inch XGA TFT LCD with 1000 nits brightness and a low reflection resistive (GOT812LR-834) and the other one is SVGA TFT LCD with 500 nits brightness (GOT812L-834). Additionally, two PCI Express Mini Card slots are available for wireless network connections.\n“Axiomtek’s new GOT812LR-834 has a stainless steel type 316, IP66-rated enclosure and five M12 I/O connectors for protection against water and dust,” said Debbie Tu, product manager for Axiomtek’s Product Marketing Division. “Its sunlight readable technology with high brightness 1000 nits color display and low reflective touch screen allows the screen to be legible even under direct sunlight. Also, it supports a 9V – 36V wide-range DC power input. This robust stainless panel unit is best suited for extreme humidity, dusty or wet spaces.
