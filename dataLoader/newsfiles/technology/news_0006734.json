At their booth the two business divisions will present tires for vehicles used in passenger and aircraft handling. In addition they will introduce the new ContiFlexBox telematics solution for specialty tires as well as the field-proven ContiPressureCheck tyre pressure monitoring system for specialty and commercial vehicle tires.\nThis system will complement the successful ContiPressureCheck™ tire-pressure-monitoring system, by collecting and deploying tire- and vehicle-referenced data, and forwarding it to a central server.\nThe information collected enables fleet managers to minimize the risk of tire damage and downtimes as well, and to reduce the outlay required for regular, time-intensive maintenance.\nFleet efficiency can thus be upgraded, reducing operating costs and the environmental impact downsized, thanks to lower emissions of CO2 and a longer useful lifetime of the tires.\nThese two products aim to make a significant contribution towards enhancing the efficiency and safety levels of vehicle fleets in ground-handling operations.\nJulian Alexander, Business Line Manager Material Handling at Continental CST, said: “In view of rising passenger numbers and freight volumes, speed, efficiency and minimal downtime are crucial factors in apron logistics. With our innovative tire and telematics products, we offer fleet managers in ground-handling operations customised solutions that meet the high requirements of companies operating in the airport sector.”\nContinental CST will also be unveiling a new tire solution for freight and luggage trucks.\nBoth technologies can be used in almost all vehicles for ground-handling operations. The combined system comprising ContiFlexBox and ContiPressureCheck will be available from 2016.\nFor all the latest on Continental, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T18:34:45.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
