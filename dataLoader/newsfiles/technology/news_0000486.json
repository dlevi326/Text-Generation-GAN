Nick Moir Share on twitter by David Ramli Australia's demand for mobile services will grow despite falls in consumer confidence and a flagging national economy, according to telecommunications industry executives and analysts.\nTelstra has relied on the explosive popularity of its mobile services over the past few years to offset the falling level of cash it makes from older products like home-line phone calls.\nConsumer confidence softens Continuing falls in consumer confidence and the launch of Apple's new iPhone 6s smartphone last week have refocused attention on whether rising competition will dent the ability of mobile providers like Telstra to continue growing their profits and revenue.\nBut Bank of America Merrill Lynch research analyst Sameer Chopra told Fairfax Media that rising demand for mobile services showed that all of Australia's mobile providers could get a win.\n\"The mobile industry grew at 11.5 per cent year-on-year in the first half of 2015, which is the best growth rate in over the decade,\" he said. \"Data usage is doubling and could accelerate further, which gives customers an incentive to spin up to higher value plans.\n\"The Australian telecoms sector is immune from the economy with churn levels compressed and average revenues per user trending up.\"\nRetail players like Myer have faced pressure in recent months as consumer confidence continues to soften, resulting in Australians being less willing to spend money.\n But Vodafone Australia's chief executive Inaki Berroeta said last month he did not expect this to affect the telecommunications market.\n\"We don't see the softening at all,\" he said. \"Our churn level [the number of customers who leave the telco] has gone down by 3 per cent.\n\"Usually in economies that are going through trouble you see churn go up significantly and we haven't seen that â€¦ and customer in-flows are good.\"\nTelstra still dominant Telstra remains Australia's dominant mobile player with 16.7 million subscribers compared to Optus' 9.38 million and Vodafone Hutchison Australia's 5.25 million. Many senior analysts have warned that Telstra's market share is set to slip as its rivals ramp up the competitive pressure.\nBut BAML's Mr Chopra said the more important sign of a healthy mobile division was its growth in revenues and not its place in the general market.\n\"In this environment absolute revenue growth is most important rather than relevant market share,\" he said. \"Australia revenue growth currently is top decile globally and comparable with the best emerging markets.\n\"You're not going to get this kind of top-line growth in other markets.\"\nHowever, Deutsche Bank research analyst Craig Wong-Pan had a less rosy forecast for Australia's biggest phone and internet provider. He predicted Telstra would continue to grow its pool of mobile subscribers but added that the market faced a challenging future.\n\"While the mobile market is currently growing at 5 per cent we expect growth slowing to 1-2 per cent from increased price competition,\" he said. \"We expect Telstra to suffer a 70 basis points (0.7 per cent) mobile market share loss, although we expect the company to continue reporting positive net subscribers.\n\"We expect ongoing competition will maintain pressure on average revenues per user.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/consumer-confidence-down-sharply-in-september--westpac-20150909-gjiajp.html"], "published": "2015-09-27T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T16:22:09.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
