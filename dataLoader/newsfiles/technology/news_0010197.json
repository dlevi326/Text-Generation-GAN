The HIL402 Hardware-in-the-Loop system has been designed to revolutionize the way power electronics control software and firmware are designed, tested, and deployed.\nBACKGROUND:\nAs the penetration of renewable power sources increases worldwide, it is of paramount importance that the computer aided design, testing, and test automation tools keep the step too. Indeed, if the end of the 20th century was all about bits, the beginning of this century is for sure about joules; eco-friendly, efficient, controllable and networked joules. Typhoon HIL, the award-winning , global technology leader in Hardware-in-the-Loop for power electronics has recognized this trend and is supporting it with its game changing HIL innovations.\nThat is why Typhoon HIL has created its latest technological marvel, it's HIL402, a notebook sized ultra-high fidelity Hardware-in-the-Loop system. HIL402 runs the industry leading software/firmware from the more powerful family of Typhoon HIL 6-series devices which power HIL test laboratories at ABB, Schneider Electric, General Electric, Woodward, Liebherr, Toshiba and many others.\nAPPLICATIONS:\nHIL402 enables engineers to design, test and verify controllers and control systems for smart inverters, micro-grids, battery storage systems in the safety and comfort of offices using the same tools the power electronics industry leaders use. In addition, HIL402 enables complete test automation. Furthermore, the power electronics educators and researchers can perform research with HIL402 at a fraction of the cost of traditional power electronics laboratories, while giving their students industry-relevant hands-on practical assignments.\nKEY FEATURES:\nTyphoon HIL vertically integrated solution offers ultra-high fidelity real-time simulation, combined with the flexibility and ultimate ease of use. HIL402 builds on this rock solid foundation in the direction of ever more flexibility, numerical algorithm robustness, and simulation speed. Thanks to Typhoon HIL’s streamlined Test Suite package, complex testing scenarios are just a click away, while simulations run accurately for days, weeks or even months thanks to the innovation and the high-end engineering sophistication built into its hardware platform and advanced numerical algorithms. Oh, and one more thing. HIL402 comes with a brand new Signal Processing Toolbox which comprises a comprehensive library of signal processing components that can be seamlessly integrated with electrical domain elements.\nAbout Typhoon HIL, Inc.\nTyphoon HIL, Inc. is a technology leader in ultra-high fidelity Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) real-time emulators for power electronics. The company was founded in 2008, and since then, it has been creating products distinguished by their leading edge technology, unrivaled performance, ease of use, and affordability. Typhoon HIL believes in building and supporting a strong international power electronics innovation ecosystem, to benefit our society’s quest for a green and sustainable energy future.
