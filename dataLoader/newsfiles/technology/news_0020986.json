It gives these travelers what they’re looking for: seamless hotel navigation through keyless access.\nIt is all about choice, convenience and control.\nGuests now have the power to be in control of their hotel stay. They may use their phones to access hotel amenities such as the pool, fitness center, or business center, and will soon have the option to share a mobile key with others. In return, hoteliers will be able to personalize marketing offers based on the guests’ preferences.\nHotels are attempting to eliminate the cumbersome hotel procedures and are focusing on building brand loyalty with mobile integration. “Knowing consumer behaviors and preferences are key to building brand loyalty, and offering personalized and contextual experiences. Data collection and proximity awareness technology enable hoteliers to streamline processes, automate operations and reduce costs,” conveys Robertson.\ny!kes’ solution also allows an easy integration with the major Property Management Systems, through an API-based system. The technology company plans to launch in the coming months its y!kes engine, allowing its system to be part of major hotel chains’ mobile experiences. The engine will offer a single platform to manage guest communications and access.\nIf hotels prefer guests to stop by the front desk to check in, y!kes’ proximity-aware solution allows the hotel staff to reduce the transaction time and engage with their guests on a more personal and productive level. “The front desk staff acts more as a concierge thanks to our solution,” says Robertson.\nAbout y!kes\ny!kes is a proximity-aware solutions company. Combining proximity hardware and software technology, the Indianapolis-based startup builds the platform leading to increase in customer brand loyalty, as well as in automation and streamlining of business operations. y!kes’ solution is lock agnostic. Hotels do not need to change or upgrade their locks. The solution easily retrofits in existing locksets. Hoteliers have the ability to allow access to any amenity doors around the property based on type of room or floor; and the ability to control time access to these amenity doors.\nFor further information:\nProduct inquiries\nMauricio Ramos\nDirector of Sales\nPhone: 877.50.YiKES (877.509.4537)\nEmail: mauricior(at)yikes.co\nhttp://www.yikes.co\nMedia inquiries\nStephan Vincent\nCreative & Marketing Director\nPhone: 877.50.YiKES (877.509.4537)\nEmail: stephanv(at)yikes.co\nhttp://www.yikes.co", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy55aWtlcy5jbw=="], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:49:27.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
