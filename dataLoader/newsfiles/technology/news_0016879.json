Amol Sawarte Director of Engineering for Qualys an information security and cloud computing company told Khaleej Times that Windows 10 provides local users with the much needed protection from malware the most commonly used method with which cyber criminals hack into systems. \"Windows 10 has a couple of new security features and although it's difficult to judge them face value they sound promising\" he said. \"When an app is executed Windows 10 makes a determination on whether that app is trustworthy and notifies the user if it is not. It uses hardware technology and virtualisation to isolate that decision-making function from the rest of the Windows operating system which helps provide protection from attackers or malware. Additionally Sawarte noted that Windows 10 includes a biometric system called \"Windows Hello\" which uses fingerprinting iris scans and face recognition software to prevent unauthorised users from gaining access to one's device. \"The new browser on Windows 10 'Edge' also has a host of security features that should help users against phishing attacks and have better reputation checks\" he added. But not all businesses have been so quick to adopt the new operating system. Arthur Dell Middle East Director of Technology and Services for software company Citrix said many local companies may delay their move to Windows 10 because they are unsure if the programmes they use will continue to function. \"Project Spartan is the next-generation browser coming to Windows 10. It's set to give users an exciting new web experience that will surely increase the adoption rate of Windows 10\" he said. \"However Spartan's arrival could also mean that older browser-based apps on which businesses depend - many of which require specific versions or plug-ins - might pose issues.\" According to Dell Windows 10 has the added benefit of allowing employees to work across various devices allowing them to work from multiple locations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:11:03.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
