The second leading firm, Hansen, handles only six of the top 50.\nThe new system would replace an in-house, makeshift tracking program city staff created nearly 15 years ago to handle projects and code enforcement cases, a city staff report said.\nA more modern approach is needed to remain competitive with other cities on the time it takes to process applications. Locally, Chula Vista and San Diego’s county government use Accela.\nIn a typical year, San Diego issues 46,000 permits, processes 4,000 code enforcement cases, conducts 97,000 project reviews and handles 137,000 construction inspections.\nThe five-year contract would cost the city $7 million during the first year and $967,000 per year in years two through five. The higher costs the first year include a $2.7 million software licensing fee and $3.4 million to implement the system.\nAfter that, the city would only pay a hosting fee and maintenance costs. At $967,000, that is $217,000 more than the $780,000 the city spends annually on the existing project tracking system.\nCity officials said they will complete a study by the end of the year to determine whether any developer fees must be increased to cover the higher software costs.\nMoney for the first year costs would come from the code enforcement civil penalties fund and some city lease revenue.\ndavid.garrick@sduniontribune.com (619) 269-8906 @UTDavidGarrick \nDavid Garrick   More from David Garrick SD may spend $11M to track projects Boat races wow crowds Convention center tennis courts waste away", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:13:29.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
