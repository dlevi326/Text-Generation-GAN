However, Koh decided such an award would be an inappropriate “windfall” for the lawyers, and awarded about $40-million instead. \nThe antitrust class action lawsuit was filed in 2011. It has been closely watched because of the possibility that big damages might be awarded and for the opportunity to peek into the world of some elite U.S. tech firms. \nThe case was based largely on emails in which Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt and some of their rivals detailed plans to avoid poaching each other’s prized engineers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T23:18:54.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
