New EMV (chip-enabled) credit cards will help remedy this situation--and cards with Chip and PIN, in particular, are more secure than those requiring just a signature. \n\"We encourage all businesses that missed the October 1 deadline to make the move to the EMV standard as soon as possible and to press banks for uniform adoption of Chip and PIN vs. Chip and Signature. The country's lead in credit card fraud is one that we all should be eager to relinquish.\" \nBackground on EMV Deadline By October 1, 2015, banks and merchants should have completed their transition from the old magnetic stripe readers and credit cards to new EMV (chip-enabled) cards and card readers or risk incurring liability for credit card fraud. On this date, liability for fraud is supposed to fall to whichever party--bank or merchant--has the less advanced technology (not chip-enabled). Yet according to a new survey on EMV readiness from Randstad Technologies , as late as this summer, 42 percent of businesses had either taken no steps or were unaware of any progress toward the transition. \nAbout Randstad Technologies Randstad Technologies has been connecting top companies around the globe with the expert technology talent and solutions that drive their success since 1984.
