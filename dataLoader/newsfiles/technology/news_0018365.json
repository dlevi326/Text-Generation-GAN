It is creating a first-of-its-kind offline ad network already reaching more than 25,000 consumers per day across Delhi NCR and more than 5,000 consumers per day on trains,” Mehrotra, who is also CEO of online restaurant reservation website Dineout, said. \n“It is connecting the brand to the consumer at a fraction of the cost incurred through the digital platforms, and at a moment when the consumer has spare time. This represents an exciting opportunity for brands to interact directly with their customers,” Mehrotra added. \nAdurcup enables advertising on procurement inventory. In doing so, it converts a cost centre for QSR businesses, disposables, which accounts from 5-12 per cent of the bill value, into an asset. \nThe startup was incubated in the first batch of BW Accelerate, an acceleration programme by media organisation Business World.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T19:14:35.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
