It was a massive event to coincide with this massive tablet which at 12.9-inch is ridiculously big on size but is incredible on everything else. - Advertisement - \nCome November, iPad Pro should see the light of day as it starts to roll out to the market in huge numbers. There were also mentions about the innovations that the latest iPad Pro will introduce along the line of an Apple Pencil, the latest smart keyboard as well as iOS 9 improvements. All this is packaged beautifully in a large tablet that is light, thin and designed to perform just as you would expect a standalone computer would perform. \nFor starters, the iPad Pro comes in with a body measurement of 305.7 x 220.6 x 6.9 mm (12.04 x 8.69 x 0.27 in) and weighing in at just 713 g for the Wi-Fi version and 723 g for the LTE version. The body itself feels strong and solid thanks to the aluminum unibody that presents a perfect balance of lightness and uncommon strength. \nFeaturing a 12.9-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 2048 x 2732 pixels (~265 ppi pixel density), it is amazing how it can fit that many pixels on the screen. It has the most advanced Retina display yet by Apple which incorporates all-new technologies to enable unparalleled levels of precision and responsiveness. Under the glass lie a revamped Multi‑Touch subsystem and 5.6 million brilliant pixels, making it the highest-resolution display of any iOS device. That extreme resolution, along with remarkably lifelike colors and deeper blacks, makes everything from photo editing to intense 3D games more vivid and deeply engaging. The Multi‑Touch subsystem was designed to accommodate two types of touch, either with your finger or with an Apple Pencil. \nSo let’s meet the Apple Pencil, or as we’ve seen it being called, a Stylus from other manufacturers. Using incredibly fine‑tuned pressure and tilt sensors, Apple Pencil instantly recognizes when you are pressing harder or shifting its angle. So you can vary line weight, create subtle shading, and produce a wide range of artistic effects, just like how you would interact with a conventional pencil and a drawing board. But with Apple Pencil, it can turn out to be a fountain pen, a watercolor brush, and even a calligrapher’s nib. You have to try it to believe it. \nThen what’s under the hood of the iPad Pro then? This is where the Apple A9X chipset and 4GB RAM plays a big role. The performance is in the range that of computers and workstations but is incredibly efficient and won’t affect battery consumption that much. \nThe A9X chip is capable of processing data so quickly; it demanded a new memory architecture. iPad Pro features a revamped storage controller that helps deliver performance better than some desktop computers. This will cause an increase in read and write speeds, so you can quickly open even the largest of files that you may have. - Advertisement - \nCamera-wise, we can see that Apple’s focus is not really on this aspect. We can see how difficult it might be to hold a tablet this big and to maintain a good posture or even to steady your hands so you can take pictures with it. And for your information, it comes with an 8 Megapixel primary camera with 3264 x 2448 pixels, autofocus, 1.12µm pixel size, geo-tagging, touch focus, face/smile detection, HDR (photo/panorama) and a 1.2 Megapixel secondary camera for all your Face Time needs. \nAs far as storage is concerned, there will be two options that you can take. You can either go for 32GB or the maximum 128GB. There will be no expansion slot that you can tap into, just like any other Apple products. \nThe iPad Pro will be featuring the latest iOS 9.0. You can now have Slide Over, Split View, and Picture in Picture that unlocks new and amazing ways for you to multitask on the iPad. With Slide Over, you can now open a second app without leaving the one you’re in. So you can quickly browse the web, respond to a text message, or jot something down in a note, then slide that app away and get back to the one you were using before. With Split View, you can go a step further and have two apps open and active at the same time. Work on a sketch with the reference photo beside it. Or write a paper while copying citations from a book in iBooks. When everything you need is right in front of you, it’s easier to focus. Next we have Picture in Picture where while using FaceTime or watching a video, press the Home button and your video screen scales down to a corner of your display. Tap to open a second app, and your video continues to play — even while you use the other app. So keep watching your favorite TV show while you reply to the email that just came in. The new QuickType features make formatting and text selection even easier which put shortcuts right at your fingertips. \nAs for the selection of iPad apps, you can be sure that they are being built just for iPad. You will find incredible apps on the App Store made to take advantage of every inch of the stunning Retina display and powerful capabilities of iPad. Whether you want to get more productive, play a game or edit some photos, the App Store makes it easy to search and even easier to buy. \nAs far as the battery is concerned, although it wasn’t revealed the battery’s rating, it can power up the iPad Pro for a cool 10 hours of screen-on-time that is just amazing. Even with its high-resolution Retina display and groundbreaking power, it manages to maintain great endurance and efficiency. - Advertisement - \nApple iPad Pro is what technology is all about. The newly-introduced Smart Pencil will surely make your life much easier, and then we have amazingly powerful hardware that can run just about anything you ask of it. Great battery life, as well as huge amount of apps and games that are readily available, will ensure that you have so many things to do, but so little time. It all then boils down to whether you can afford it or not. \nFor the WiFi models, the Apple iPad Pro will be selling the 32GB model for $799 USD while the 128GB model for $949 USD. Then we only have one option available for the WiFi + Cellular model (4G LTE) which is 128GB for $1,079. It will be available in Space Gray, Silver or Gold. \nEditor’s Note: Just in time to shop for the Christmas holidays!
