It takes no energy and never hurts! Learned that from the Street!! septemberstillloveyou\". \nHorowitz earlier said that there are many other black actors who deserve the role more than Elba. \n\"Idris Elba is a terrific actor, but I can think of other black actors who would do it better. For me, Idris Elba is a bit too rough to play the part. It's not a colour issue. I think he is probably a bit too 'street' for Bond. Is it a question of being suave? Yeah,\" he said. \nHowever, Horowitz soon apologised for his comments on Twitter.
