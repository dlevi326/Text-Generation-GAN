The post is adjacent to the city. \nThe cause of the malfunction wasn't known but it might have been a battery or computer problem, the investigative report said. The Gazette obtained the report under the Freedom of Information Act. \nInvestigators also said Fort Carson air traffic controllers weren't notified the drone was missing and learned about it from television news reports the next day. \nThe report said the drone was being flown outside authorized airspace and in violation of Army regulations and Federal Aviation Administration rules. \nThat contradicted Fort Carson's initial statements on the crash. Fort Carson spokeswoman Dani Johnson said Friday commanders first thought the flight did comply with regulations but discovered the violations later. \nThe man who found the drone called police because it had no markings to indicate it belonged to the Army. \nFort Carson commander Maj. Gen Ryan Gonsalves ordered the military police battalion that was flying the drone to complete remedial training. He also ordered improvements in the way drone flights are planned.
