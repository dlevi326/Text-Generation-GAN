Mexico City was among the new signatories to the \"Under 2 MOU\" agreement launched last year which aims to cut emissions blamed for climate change \nCities leading nations? \nWith the pledges, 38 jurisdictions that cover $8.7 trillion in GDP have now signed the declaration, larger than any country except the United States and China, according to Brown's office. \nThe signatories promise, although without binding penalties, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95 percent from 1990 levels by 2050. \nJeffrey Sachs, a prominent economist and UN adviser on development, said that cities and regions played a critical role in fighting climate change by making decisions on pivotal issues including infrastructure and building codes. \n\"I think the US is the perfect case—a country where politics at the national level have been log-jammed for two decades but a tremendous amount is happening at the local and state level,\" he told AFP. \n\"And what is actually happening is also becoming a model for national and international policy.\" \nStill, the UN conference in Paris will rely on commitments by national governments that have proven elusive in previous negotiations. \nScientists say that the planet must check temperature rises at two degrees Celsius or lower to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, including a growing number of droughts and disasters. Tourists look out at the Los Angeles skyline as heavy smog shrouds the city \nSpace for innovation \nAnother group of mayors signed a statement that commits more generally to the new UN Sustainable Development Goals, which include a call for action against climate change. \nSignatories, some of whom attended a climate meeting initiated by Pope Francis in July, included the mayors of Bogota, Dakar, Johannesburg, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Oslo and Sao Paulo. \nMinneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges said that her city, which has among the coldest winters in the United States, was obliged to act as it was forecast to be especially hard hit by climate change.
