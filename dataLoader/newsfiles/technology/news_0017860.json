The test provides a score based on a tumour’s genetic signature that describes the risk that the cancer will recur.\nIn the study, less than 1% of women who skipped chemotherapy based on a low risk score had a recurrence of cancer beyond the breast five years later, researchers said. Just 1.3% had a recurrence of the original cancer anywhere.\n\"We knew these patients were going to do well, but we didn’t dream they would do this well,\" said Joseph Sparano, associate chairman of medical oncology at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York, and lead author of the study. The results were to be presented on Monday at the European Cancer Congress in Vienna and published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.\nOncotype DX, developed by Genomic Health in Redwood City, California, analyses 21 genes in tumour tissue. More than half a million women have used the test since it was launched a decade ago, with about 175,000 changing their treatment as a result, the company said. The test lists for about $4,200 and is widely covered by insurance, but it had not previously been validated in a large prospective trial.\nThe study enrolled 10,253 women with breast cancer that is fuelled by the hormone oestrogen and contained within the breast — a group representative of more than 100,000 of some 231,000 women diagnosed with the disease annually in the US. After surgery to remove the tumour, a combination of hormone therapy — either tamoxifen or one of a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors — and chemotherapy is the main strategy for most such patients to prevent the cancer from returning and spreading.\nExperts credit the combination for helping to reduce breast-cancer death rates by more than one-third over the past 25 years.\nBut research suggests that the addition of chemo extends lives for only a fraction of women — perhaps about 5% — meaning that most early-stage patients face bearing the cost and harsh side effects of the treatment without getting any benefit. In the study, 1,626 or almost 16% of patients had a low Oncotype DX recurrence score — below 11 on a 100-point scale.\nAnother 6,897, or two-thirds of the participants, scored between 11 and 25 and were considered at intermediate risk. Patients in both groups were randomised to either chemo or no chemo, and both got hormone therapy. The other nearly 17% were in the high-risk category and assigned to hormone therapy plus chemo. Jennifer Litton, a breast medical oncologist at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who wasn’t a researcher on the study, said she is eager to see results for patients in the midrange, where earlier data are ambiguous. \"That’s the tougher conversation with patients,\" she said.\nLonger follow-up of participants is necessary to make a determination on that point, which is the primary goal of the study, researchers said. The current findings provide assurance for oncologists who already use the test to guide treatment of low-risk patients. \"This is a group of patients that we are likely over-treating with chemotherapy,\" Dr Litton said. \"Using this test, we can spare these patients from chemotherapy.\"\nLynda Neff, a 61-year-old office manager for a plumbing company from New Braunfels, Texas, said that after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007, she knew \"immediately\" that she would have both breasts removed and have chemotherapy. She had three children, a grandchild and a strong marriage, she said. \"I had everything to live for. From the beginning I made the most radical choice,\" she said.\nIn cases like hers, a double mastectomy is controversial, but she said precancerous tissue was in her other breast as well. After she healed from the surgery and breast reconstruction, her doctor urged her take the Oncotype DX test before deciding on chemotherapy. Her score was 5. \"Once I got the result and it was a low number, it was a no-brainer for me,\" she said. She skipped chemo. She continues to take an aromatase inhibitor.\nNext month, Ms Neff will celebrate eight cancer-free years. Her 10th grandchild is due in April. \"I haven’t looked back,\" she said.\nThe study was funded by the National Cancer Institute and run by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group without commercial support.\nMore Africa news from The Wall Street Journal\nMore news from The Wall Street Journal\nPremium access to WSJ.com: $1 a week for 12 weeks", "external_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/public/page/news-africa.html?mod=TMGSAlink1", "https://join.wsjeuropesubs.com/tmg1", "http://online.wsj.com/europe?mod=TMGSAlink2", "https://www.wsjeuropesubs.com/wsj12offer/?tagsrc=/tmg1&rnd=54622c7ae7d81"], "published": "2015-09-28T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:35:23.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
