The latter uses Google's Content ID software, which finds videos posted without permission and flags them automatically. \nThe Facebook tool, in contrast puts the burden of finding violations on the creators. \nCreators will have access to a web-based dashboard that will allow them to identify videos they would like to monitor. \nIf the system finds a matching video on Facebook, the creator has the option of reporting the clips to the company. \nBesides helping to identify duplicate videos, Facebook said it is continuing to improve its policies aimed at consumers who repeatedly post videos without permission.
