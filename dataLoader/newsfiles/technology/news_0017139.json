Lafourche government, Ducks Unlimited and ConocoPhillips are partners in the effort designed to protect the community's levee system and improve the habitat for fisheries and wildlife, according to the website.\nLafourche Parish Administrator Archie Chaisson described the terraces as small levees, constructed with material dredged from water bottoms and planted with grass. The first project has yielded about 25 acres of new marsh, Houma Today said.\nCreating marsh using terraces is also cheaper, $1,000 per acre compared to $30,000 for traditional methods, Chaisson told Houma Today.\nFor more details on the Houma Today article, click here .", "external_links": ["http://www.houmatoday.com/article/20150904/ARTICLES/150909832/0/FRONTPAGE?p=1&tc=pg"], "published": "2015-09-05T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-07T23:58:10.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
