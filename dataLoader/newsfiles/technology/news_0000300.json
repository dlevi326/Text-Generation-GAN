ET Bureau | 30 September 2015, 7:51 AM IST By Sanjay Singh PATNA: Commercial vehicle owners in Bihar can look forward to an unusually easy ride this election season. For the first time in years, they don't have to worry about arbitrary seizure of vehicles for election duty and troubles in getting payment for the same, thanks to a new software.The Election Commission of India has introduced a software, 'Completely Integrated Vehicle Management System', to manage all vehicles on election duty and make online payment to their owners.\"This software is helpful for us to expedite disbursement of payment to the owners whose vehicle are hired for election,\" additional chief electoral officer R Lakshaman told ET over the phone.It is estimated that at least 80,000 vehicles will be required to manage the movement of forces and government officials during the assembly elections to be held in five phases starting October 12.While commercial vehicle owners may not have much of a say on whether to lend their vehicles for election duty given the requirement, the vehicle management software will ensure that intermediaries do not eat into rent payments.The system auto-calculates charges for each vehicle hired and the payment is deposited directly to the bank account of owners concerned, Lakshaman said. It will also enable the administration to prepare a data bank of commercial vehicles for future elections, he said.A source in the office of chief electoral officer said the system will help eliminate intermediaries in the business. \"Several travel agencies arrange vehicles from different sources to run their business. In this system, only owners can get the payment in his bank account,\" the person said. The system also contains details of commercial vehicles registered with the state's transport department.Once a vehicle is hired, a log book automatically gets opened and details of the vehicle, including bank account number of its owner, is entered into the system, the source said. \"There is a system for part time payment also,\" the person said. \"After a gap of three days, we make payment of 80% of the total auto generated charges of the vehicle.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T10:57:54.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
