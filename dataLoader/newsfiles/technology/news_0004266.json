That’s where Asus Zenfone Max will overcome that issue once and for all with its humongous Li-Po 5000 mAh battery. - Advertisement - \nFirst of all, do you want that big of a battery? You have to ask yourself honestly, especially with the price of a power bank reaching an all-time low right now. In the case of Zenfone Max, definitely you have to sacrifice in terms of processing power and surely it won’t be that thin anymore. \nExpected to be released during the IFA event this week (4 th to 9 th September 2015), the Zenfone Max certainly has its target audience. It is primarily targeting at those who are constantly on the go and for those who want the absolute best in terms of battery life. \nIt will be sporting a 5.5-inch HD IPS capacitive touchscreen that displays 720 x 1280 pixels or ~267 ppi pixel density. The big screen might not be the sharpest tool in the trade when it comes to clarity, but if you are a fan of a big screen; then you certainly wouldn’t mind. Then there’s also Gorilla Glass 4 which will add extra protection especially when you need it the most. \nIn terms of performance, the Zenfone Max will be equipped with the Qualcomm MSM8916 Snapdragon 410 chipset paired with Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, Adreno 306 graphics and 2GB RAM.You should expect it to perform somewhere in the mid-range, and the 2GB RAM does help a lot to run most of the apps and games out there. - Advertisement - \nAs far as the camera goes, the Zenfone Max will be having a 13 Megapixel primary camera with 4128 x 3096 pixels, laser autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, panorama and HDR. It will also be getting a 5 Megapixel secondary camera to cater for all your selfies. It also features PixelMaster cameras with a wide f/2.0 aperture, and the rear camera also boasts laser auto-focus for sharp, near-instant shots. Quite a good setup I must say. \nSoftware-wise, it is built on top the latest Android Lollipop 5.0, and you will also get to experience the ZenUI which is a simpler, smarter and more personalization. It might take some time to adapt, but it will all be worth it in the end. \nAs for storage, there are two options available, and you can choose to go for 8GB or 16GB. There will also be a microSD slot that supports up to 128GB for your expansion needs. \nNow for the moment that you all have been waiting for. As mentioned earlier, it will be blessed with the non-removable Li-Po 5000 mAh battery that is an absolute monster. If based on paper alone, surely it can easily last you for 2-3 days or even more. That’s the main reason you choose Zenfone Max right? - Advertisement - \nIt is indeed good that we see Asus Zenfone Max makes it to the market as it manages to overcome the poor battery life of smartphones. But will that feature alone be enough to be a pull factor? Especially now that we can see that it won’t be that high-end of a device but is more than sufficient to cater for most users. \nAt the moment, Asus Zenfone Max has been kept under the wraps and seems that we have to wait for it to be launched during the IFA event in Berlin from 4 th to 9 th September 2015. Pricing and the colors that will be available are also kept as a secret for the time being. Stay tuned for more updates.
