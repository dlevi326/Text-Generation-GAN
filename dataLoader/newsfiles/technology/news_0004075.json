A residential building in Abu Dhabi is planning to open a robotic car park for its residents, in which robots guide the cars into spaces. Is this the future of your local multi-storey? ParkPlus' semi-automated lift-slide parking system in New Jersey Photo: ParkPlus Inc Comments \nThere are few technology trends more closely watched than that of driverless cars, but before that happens, robots will be parking your regular car. \nA 12-storey residential building in Abu Dhabi is planning to open a car park with 110 spaces in which residents' cars are parked and even cleaned by robots in the next six months . \nDesigned by US company ParkPlus, the new system uses Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to park the cars, scanning and taking pictures of vehicles to prevent damage. There is also an explosives detection system for security purposes and owners can opt to have their car cleaned in their absence before retrieving them via a kiosk. \nParkPlus already operates in Maryland, New York and New Jersey, including JFK Airport, Mount Sinai Hospital and various residential properties as well as in Shenzhen, China, where space is at a premium. \nThe company creates two types of storage systems for residential use, automated and mechanical. The automated system, which will be deployed in Abu Dhabi, shuttles cars into a loading bay using robotic dolly grids. A trained operator stacks up to four vehicles vertically in the mechanical vehicle storage system.

The technology has been integrated into the 2015 Volvo XC90, which the company claims can park itself in both parallel and bay situations.

Self-parking cars were found to hit the curb 81 per cent less often than human drivers in a road test by the American Automobile Association (AAA), using 47 per cent few manoeuvres. \nHowever, the association found that some automated systems were prone to parking cars too close to the curb, leaving the vehicles vulnerable to damage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:40:57.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
