It is sometimes used in conjunction with, and often as a replacement for, classical burn-in. HASS uses vibration and thermal stresses to quickly force latent defects in a product to fail or to become detectable through marginal performance, thus increasing the out of box quality and reducing warranty expenses. \nLearn more about Qualmark Corp.
