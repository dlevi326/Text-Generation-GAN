Business Insider | 05 September 2015, 9:57 AM IST Microsoft Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella \nMicrosoft is considering a multibillion-dollar revamp of its headquarters that could include on-site apartments, restaurants and retail spaces, according to a Bloomberg repor t. \nThe overhaul of Microsoft's campus, which is about 13 miles outside of Seattle, would be primarily designed to create more open space for workers to collaborate, instead of the private offices that currently make up much of the square footage in the buildings, the report says. \nMicrosoft has hired the big architectural firm, Skidmore Owings & Merrill for the project - though it has not yet made the final decision on whether to proceed, Bloomberg said, citing an anonymous source. \nMicrosoft has maintained its headquarters in Redmond, Washington since the mid-1980s and owns most of the property. Right now, the headquarters contains about 80 buildings spread over a 500-acre campus. \nThe new campus could potentially include apartments to house visiting employees and interns, as well as public artwork, retail spaces and restaurants, the report says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T12:26:28.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
