Doctors weren't able to save the eye. The accident happened following a birthday party for Mr. McDermott's father. Spokesman Daniel Reinhardt declined to disclose the location of the brother's home where it took place.\nNew York-born Mr. McDermott, 54 years old, has had a steady rise to the top at Europe's largest software company. Mr. McDermott has been sole CEO of the business software maker since 2014. He joined SAP in 2002 and became a member of the executive board in 2008. In 2010, the supervisory board named Mr. McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe co-CEOs. Mr. McDermott became sole chief when Mr. Hagemann Snabe stepped down.\nMr. McDermott has been able to work in recent months despite his injury, though he has had to undergo medical treatment, the spokesman said. He participated in a conference call with investors following the release of SAP's second-quarter results on July 21. But he has been unable to fly and has stayed in the U.S. since the accident, which happened on July 1 or 2, according to the spokesman.\nIt is anticipated that Mr. McDermott will be able by October to begin traveling again to Walldorf, the German town near Heidelberg where SAP's headquarters are located. The CEO normally commutes between the U.S. and Germany.\nSupervisory Board Chairman Hasso Plattner said Mr. McDermott is fit to work. Emergency plans for his succession aren't up for discussion anymore because he is getting better, Mr. Plattner told the German magazine WirtschaftsWoche in Quote: s confirmed by SAP. His current term expires in 2017.\nMr. McDermott told the German newspaper Sü ddeutsche Zeitung he is fit to fulfill his CEO duties.\nUnder his aegis, SAP has moved the focus of its product portfolio to cloud-based software and away from programs installed on client's computers. Mr. McDermott also has boosted SAP's high-speed analytics application dubbed HANA. The company has a strong market position globally with software for tasks such as accounting and customer-relationship management.\nWrite to Archibald Preuschat at archibald.preuschat@wsj.com and Friedrich Geiger at friedrich.geiger@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"SAP SE\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007164600\nAccess Investor Kit for \"SAP SE\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US8030542042\n 16, 2015 16:55 ET (20:55 ", "external_links": ["http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007164600", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US8030542042", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T03:16:57.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
