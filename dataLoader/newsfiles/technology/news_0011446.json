The software is loaded onto a tablet computer, which many airline pilots already use for charts and flight calculations.\nWing and his team have tested the TASAR software twice aboard a Piaggio P180 Avanti aircraft, a high-performance technology test bed owned and operated by Advanced Aerospace Solutions, LLC of Raleigh, North Carolina. The system worked well on its initial test flight from Virginia to Kentucky, according to its test pilot.\n\"We used it to make a route change request from air traffic control, which they granted. We got a shortcut that saved four minutes off the flight time,\" the test pilot said. Even four minutes of flight time shaved off of each leg of a trip made by an airline could result in massive fuel and time savings, according to researchers.\nThe software provided similar results as flight tests continued in the northeast corridor. A second round of flight tests was recently completed to ensure readiness for operational use by partner airlines. The TASAR flight tests came after a dozen pilots provided feedback on the technology in a simulation at the University of Iowa Operator Performance Laboratory.\nIn addition, aerospace systems manufacturer Rockwell Collins of Cedar Rapids, analysed TASAR to make sure it is safe and can be readily certified by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n technology Science and Trends NASA Also Read We teach you how to download and store Windows XP updates InFocus M2 review: Great smartphone, excellent price Google refunds buyers of fake antivirus app, Virus Shield Facebook CEO wants more students to explore tech", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150923/technology-science-and-trends/article/nasa-technology-help-airlines-cut-fuel-consumption", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/airplane-airlines_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/airplane-airlines_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share"], "published": "2015-09-24T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:20:52.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
