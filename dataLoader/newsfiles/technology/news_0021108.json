The platform has been developed to help retailers meet the ever increasing delivery demands of today's consumers. \nElectio offers 100 services, including international and click and collect, from the world's leading carriers. This enables retailers of all sizes, as well as third party logistics organisations, to connect directly to those services through a single portal, immediately enhancing the delivery options they can offer to customers. \nThe SaaS platform houses a dynamic allocation engine which selects the best carrier for each delivery based on criteria that is pre-determined by the retailer, such as basket value, location, weight, and the day the customer expects their parcel to arrive. Electio then automatically produces all labelling and customs documentation where appropriate. The software offers rapid and simple integration as well as full tracking and reporting functionality. \nIts flexible pricing model means that, for the first time in the industry, retailers have the ability to import their own negotiated delivery rates or use Electio's wholesale ratecard, discounted using its buying power. \nAndy Hill, commercial director at Electio said: \"Ecommerce continues to grow at a phenomenal rate. This brings huge opportunities for retailers but it doesn't come without its headaches. It's the customer that controls delivery and ecommerce businesses need to be able to deliver when and where their shoppers demand. Having the right carrier relationships, knowing which carrier to use for which delivery, and automating the whole process is a big step towards getting delivery right, and making retailers more operationally efficient.\" \n\"Retailers have been crying out for an easy to use, easy to integrate and easy to finance delivery management solution. Electio has been developed to make this a reality for ecommerce businesses, regardless of their size or delivery volumes\", added David Grimes, CEO of MPD Group. \nThe launch of Electio follows the recent announcement of a Â£3.5 million investment package secured by the MPD Group. The investment was led Praetura Capital with follow-on investors, Seneca Partners, as well as funding from the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) which is linked to job creation in the region. \nMPD Group has its heritage in delivery, having developed the software that powers the multi-award winning My Parcel Delivery, the consumer and SME parcel delivery comparison website. Over two million items are delivered using the site each year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:03:39.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
