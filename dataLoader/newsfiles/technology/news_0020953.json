Arctic marine organisms capture CO2 October 14, 2014 \nArctic marine organisms act as a reservoir for CO2, according to research published in the international journal Geophysical Research Letters. Study reveals 'two faces' of phytoplankton April 21, 2015 \nPhytoplankton, commonly known as plant plankton that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, are potentially a key driver of Arctic warming under greenhouse warming, a study reveals. Protein identified in certain microalgae changes conversation about climate change June 3, 2015 \nAdrian Marchetti and his team of oceanographers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have identified —for the first time—that a protein called proteorhodopsin could allow a major group of phytoplankton to ... Ocean algae will cope well in varying climates, study shows June 30, 2015 \nTiny marine algae that play a critical role in supporting life on Earth may be better equipped to deal with future climate change than previously expected, research shows. Are marine ecosystems headed toward a new productivity regime? July 16, 2015 \nPhytoplankton have been projected to produce less organic material as the oceans' temperatures rise—with carry-on effects for higher levels of the food web. Based on new climate model simulations, a team of scientists from ... Recommended for you Arctic study finds CO2 helps plants grow but only at low temperatures September 2, 2015 \nA new international study involving researchers from The University of Western Australia has found that carbon dioxide (CO2) has a positive effect on producing organic material at low temperatures in the Arctic Ocean, but ... Study provides scenarios for assessing long-term benefits of climate action September 2, 2015 \nSince the 1990s, scientists and policymakers have proposed limiting Earth's average global surface temperature to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, thereby averting the most serious effects of global warming, such ... Ancient cold period could provide clues about future climate change September 2, 2015 \nResearchers at The University of Texas at Austin have found that a well-known period of abrupt climate change 12,000 years ago occurred rapidly in northern latitudes but much more gradually in equatorial regions, a discovery ... Climate change will irreversibly force key ocean bacteria into overdrive September 1, 2015 \nImagine being in a car with the gas pedal stuck to the floor, heading toward a cliff's edge. Metaphorically speaking, that's what climate change will do to the key group of ocean bacteria known as Trichodesmium, scientists ... How wind sculpted Earth's largest dust deposit September 1, 2015 \nChina's Loess Plateau was formed by wind alternately depositing dust or removing dust over the last 2.6 million years, according to a new report from University of Arizona geoscientists. Oxygen oasis in Antarctic lake reflects Earth in the distant past September 1, 2015 \nAt the bottom of a frigid Antarctic lake, a thin layer of green slime is generating a little oasis of oxygen, a team including UC Davis researchers has found. It's the first modern replica discovered of conditions on Earth ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T15:26:15.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
