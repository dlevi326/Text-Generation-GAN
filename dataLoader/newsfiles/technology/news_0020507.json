The US government, led by the FBI, has been making increasingly strident calls for technology companies to stop providing ubiquitous encryption to customers, arguing that the tools harm the American people by making it harder to catch terrorists, paedophiles and other criminals.In September 2014, the director of the FBI, James Comey, specifically criticised Apple’s decision to enable “end-to-end” encryption in its then-new mobile operating system, iOS8, which is what prevents the company from reading its users’ messages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T15:50:52.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
