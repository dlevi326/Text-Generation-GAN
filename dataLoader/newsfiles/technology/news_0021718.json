Some 200,000 civilians are sheltering inside UN bases. \nCeasefire monitors from the regional East Africa bloc IGAD, which led efforts to negotiate the peace deal, said their teams would investigate the claims. \n\"These are serious allegations that need verification,\" an IGAD spokesman said. \nThe civil war began in December 2013 when Kiir accused Machar, his former deputy, of planning a coup, setting off a cycle of retaliatory killings that has split the impoverished country along ethnic lines. \nFaced with the threat of international sanctions, Kiir finally signed the peace deal but annexed a list of reservations that he said would have to be addressed for the deal to take hold. \n\"We question the political will of the government to implement the peace agreement,\" Machar added. \nThe UN Security Council has threatened sanctions against anyone who undermines the accord. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T08:01:55.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
