The rash of school shootings in the last decade, from Virginia Tech in 2007 to Sandy Hook in 2012, has spawned an ongoing debate about whether troubled students should be found and dealt with before their anger turns them into school shooters. Now a team of researchers is proposing a controversial solution: They want to use science to analyze students’ blog posts—in essence using words to separate those who are merely angry from those who are truly dangerous.The proposed technique, featured in a recent edition of the journal Frontiers in Psychiatry , uses a technology called “natural language processing” (NLP) to identify patterns of words that the researchers believe would signal impending violent behavior. To test their theory, they took blog posts written by six school shooters, including Seung-Hui Cho, who murdered 23 people at Virginia Tech. Then they compared those posts with 6,056 texts written by non-violent males.They found that the school shooters scored significantly higher on three personality dimensions that are key to predicting violence: narcissism, humiliation and revenge. “We’re excavating the deeper layers of text to determine which people are expressing the highest levels of depression” indicative of potential violent behavior, says lead author Yair Neuman, a professor in the Homeland Security Institute at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel.[caption id=\"attachment_160099542\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Scientists in Israel are proposing that schools use language-processing technology to identify troubled teens before they commit violent acts.

For example, the word “depressed” would only be suspicious if it appeared in close proximity to words such as “lonely,” “anxious” and “suicidal.” The researchers established 13 collections of words, or “vectors,” that can be automatically analyzed and scored to determine the degree to which violent personality traits are present.The vectors describe a range of personality variants, from commonly studied states like depression and paranoia to more volatile emotions, such as “chaotic,” “helpless” and “revengeful.” Of the 6,000-plus texts Neuman and his colleagues analyzed, 210 ranked high for violent tendencies, including those written by all six of the shooters who were studied.Still, the idea of picking students out based on their blog posts troubles some practicing mental health professionals, including Sherry Hamby, a research professor of psychology at the University of the South in Sewanee, TN and an editor for the Psychology of Violence journal. Hamby points out that most of the bloggers who were identified in the study as potential shooters were not violent at all. “They are talking about labeling thousands and thousands of children who not only have done nothing wrong but never will do anything wrong,” Hamby says in an e-mail. “We cannot let our fears about violent offenders lead us to stripping away the rights of innocent people.”Neuman says the goal of using NLP technology is not to pinpoint the students who are planning violent acts, but rather to narrow down the field of people who may need psychological help or some other intervention. “We are not trying to find the needle in the haystack. We are significantly reducing the size of the haystack,” he says. “If you’re an FBI agent and you need a tool to help you to find the candidates for a second inspection, this technology could narrow the field down to 3% of the original haystack.”Neuman acknowledges that implementing NLP in schools would present both ethical and practical challenges. One solution, he suggests, would be for parents to give written permission to school administrators to monitor their teens’ Facebook pages and other social media.Perhaps, but some experts believe that the first line of defense against violent youth should not be the schools, but the parents. Carole Lieberman, a psychiatrist, author and radio talk show host in Beverly Hills, CA, says there are more obvious predictors of who is likely to become a school shooter, including obsession with violent video games and anger over a divorce. “Parents know—or should know—whether their child has any of these predictors in his life. They do not need a computer scan to tell them,” Lieberman says in an e-mail. She adds that the mere act of giving a school permission to monitor a child’s blog post should be a big red flag. “The parent is saying he is scared at how out of touch he is with his child’s thinking, or he has unconsciously picked up on some worrying clues about his child’s unpredictable violent impulses.”Neuman contends that NLP technology could pick up on clues that parents might otherwise miss. “High school can be a very depressing place. Think about the kids being bullied or victimized by humiliation,” he says. “Parents are not experts. They don’t have access to the full emotions of their teenagers.”", "external_links": ["http://aabgu.org/identifying-school-shooters/", "http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00086/full", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/160099542/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-09-10T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T17:22:54.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
