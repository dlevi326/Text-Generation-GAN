The development will consist of two high-rise towers and provide over half a million square feet of office space. \nMarwan Abdulaziz, executive director of DuBiotech and EnPark said: \"New business partner growth at DuBiotech and EnPark continues to rise steadily each year, a feat that we are extremely proud of. Our business community is as active and vibrant as ever. \n\"The 45 new business partners we welcomed in the past year is a testament to our state of the art facilities and world class business communities. I expect demand to remain strong as the opening of our new headquarters in 2016 grows closer.\" \nTECOM Investments announced last year an investment of AED4.5 billion as part of a broader Dubai National Innovation Strategy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T08:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:10:05.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
