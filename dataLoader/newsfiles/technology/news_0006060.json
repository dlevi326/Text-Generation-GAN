The company introduces a refreshed brand with full integration of an electronics lab and manufacturing tools and supplies business -- significantly expanding the scope of products it is offering to customers. \nFrom its beginnings as a supplier of refurbished test equipment in the early 1970s, TestEquity has grown to be the world's leading distributor of products from Keysight Technologies (formerly Agilent Technologies' Electronic Measurement Group) and products from Tektronix and its Keithley brand. In addition, the company serves as a major distributor for more than a dozen other A-list manufacturers including Rohde & Schwartz, Anritsu, Viavi (formerly JDSU), Fluke, and FLIR. Remaining true to its roots, TestEquity stocks both new and used equipment from the top manufacturers, and has long been a manufacturer itself of a highly respected line of environmental chambers. \nWith the acquisition last year of EWD Solutions, a regional distributor based in Texas, TestEquity expanded the scope of its business beyond test and measurement equipment to include all of the related tools and supplies involved in the assembly, repair, and rework of printed circuit boards. Between solder, static control, and production supplies, more than a million additional products from more than 300 vendors are now available to TestEquity customers. \n\"TestEquity is quickly becoming a leader to watch in the test and measurement industry,\" said Jessy F. Cavazos, Industry Director, Test & Measurement, at Frost & Sullivan. \"In particular, the company sets itself apart with its flexible purchase options, rock-solid tech support base, and commitment to the Internet of Things, as demonstrated by its freshly designed data-driven website.\" \n\"At TestEquity we've always emphasized quality over quantity, but part of our mission as a value-added distributor is to simplify our customers' buying experience as much as possible,\" said Dan Copsey, TestEquity President and CEO. \"That's the idea behind our consultative selling approach and the post-sale support for which TestEquity is so well known. It's also our motivation in having acquired EWD Solutions. As a consequence we've gone from offering everything that sits on and around the engineer's design and test bench to offering the bench itself, the chairs that pull up to it, and all the tools and supplies associated with the electronics manufacturing process. Adding EWD solutions to our lineup is a logical extension of our core business into an adjacent space. It also extends our expertise to a broader array of products, minimizing our customers' acquisition costs and ensuring they'll find the perfect solution to meet their specific needs. It's just part of the way we're working to prove our value every day.\" \n\"We work very hard at TestEquity to offer our customers the expertise to minimize their acquisition costs and to present an informed and cost-effective solution to their needs,\" Copsey added. \"Having educated customers on this point, our goal is to reduce their total cost of ownership, and our role as value-added distributor puts us in the best position to do this.\" \nMore information on TestEquity is available at http://www.testequity.com . \nAbout TestEquity LLC TestEquity is a value-added distributor of electronic measurement solutions and electronic lab and production solutions.
