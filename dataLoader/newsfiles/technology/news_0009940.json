The NJ-8’s ReadiSet™ 2-piece jet cartridge is quickly and easily removed, cleaned, inspected, and re-installed without tools, maximizing equipment utilization and up-time. The NexJet system is an integral part of Nordson ASYMTEK’s comprehensive closed-loop dispensing systems and fully-integrated software-control of the precision jet dispensing process. \nThe NexJet NJ-8 is long-lasting, durable, and has been tested on many fluids, from high-viscosity silicones to low-viscosity reagents, in board-level underfill, chip-scale packaging, ball grid array, package-on-package underfill, precise coating, silicone jetting, and adhesive dispensing applications. With the 2-piece cartridge, cleaning and changing is simple– it’s ReadiSet and jet. Only the parts that come in contact with the fluid have to be removed from the system for cleaning and maintenance. The NJ-8 system saves fluid, resources, time, and cost-of-cleaning, produces a clean dispensing environment, and delivers a reliable result. Cost-of-ownership is reduced with the NexJet NJ-8 by as much as 20% over other jets. \nNordson ASYMTEK’s patented software manages the dispensing process, controlling fluid velocity, adjusting dot sizes, regulating the amount of fluid dispensed, and compensating for fluid viscosity changes to center the process window. These process controls, combined with the high quality and capabilities of the NexJet NJ-8, ensure stable and repeatable outcomes for high-yield production. \n“The NexJet is a proven workhorse,” said Chris Marion, director of marketing and applications technology for Nordson ASYMTEK, “and the ReadiSet cartridge is a real differentiator. Nordson ASYMTEK pioneered jetting with the development of the DispenseJet ® in 1994. The NexJet is integrated as part of an automated, total system solution. Combined with the process expertise of our application engineers available throughout the world, we deliver industry-leading capability and cost-of-ownership.” \nThe NexJet NJ-8 with ReadiSet cartridge comes in a range of cartridge sizes and is available as an upgrade for the Nordson ASYMTEK Spectrum ™ , Quantum ® , and DispenseMate ® Series platforms. It will be featured at SMTAI, Rosemont, Illinois, USA, September 29-30, 2015, Booth #706 .
