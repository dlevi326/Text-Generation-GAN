Vitter, a U.S. senator, voted against the legislation, known as the Marketplace Fairness Act. \nAngelle, a state utility regulator with the Public Service Commission, has said it's only fair to treat online retailers the same as brick-and-mortar stores. \nPeople in Louisiana are already supposed to pay these taxes even if companies don't collect them, according to a 1994 law that Vitter supported when he was in the state legislature. Vitter was among 75 lawmakers who approved charging sales tax on products bought by mail from catalogs, television shopping channels and other sources, according to the legislature's official journal. \n\"If it costs them $900 a year, then it's not Scott that'll cost them that. It's David Vitter that cost them that,\" said Angelle's political and media consultant, Roy Fletcher. \"Scott Angelle didn't have much to do with it.\" \nThe state revenue department says Louisiana consumers must pay sales taxes directly to the state on Internet purchases if an online company like Amazon doesn't charge the tax. But few people do, costing Louisiana and other states millions of dollars in revenue each year, a problem only remedied with a federal law. \nJoel DiGrado, executive director of the Fund for Louisiana's Future, suggests Angelle's campaign is mixing two different issues. \n\"We stand by our ad, and we feel that it's well-cited. We believe we have Scott Angelle saying he supports the Marketplace Fairness Act, and Sen. Vitter voted against that same policy,\" DiGrado said. \nThe super PAC isn't allowed to coordinate with Vitter's campaign, which also rejected the Angelle campaign's claims that Vitter is the true Internet taxer. \n\"I don't know about you, but I wasn't making any online purchases in 1994. Sen. Vitter has opposed the Internet sales tax at least three times in the Senate,\" Vitter campaign spokesman Luke Bolar said in an email. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T03:23:48.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
