Thai junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha, pictured during a trip to Myanmar, in October 2014 \nInitially Thailand's internet flowed through a single gateway that was owned by the government. \nBut the sector was deregulated in 2006, allowing dozens of companies to open their own access points resulting in dramatically increased internet speeds and Thailand emerging as a regional IT hub. \nAkamai, which ranks countries on their connectivity levels, says the kingdom's average internet speed this year is 7.5 mbps, on a par with nations like Australia, New Zealand and France. \nThailand's junta, which seized power in a coup last year, has vowed to expand the country's appeal as a regional internet hub unveiling a plan it has dubbed \"The Digital Economy\". \nBut the generals have also ramped up censorship, blocking scores of sites and pursuing online critics with criminal charges and so-called \"attitude adjustment\" sessions. \nProsecutions under the notoriously strict lese majeste legislation have also sky-rocketed, with the vast majority of cases brought over comments made online, including a record-breaking 30-year sentence for one man over the content of six Facebook posts. \nCritics of the single internet gateway plan say it will allow the military to further increase censorship as well as leave the country's IT hub status vulnerable if the gateway fails. \n\"A return to the gold old days of a (government) monopoly would be disastrous,\" wrote technology analyst Don Sambandaraksa on Telecoms Asia. \n\"The people of Thailand can kiss a fast internet goodbye purely from technical incompetence, not to mention all the monitoring, censoring and deep packet inspection the military want,\" he added. \nMany ordinary Thais have flocked to social media to oppose the plan. \n\"It contradicts policy of promoting Digital Economy,\" wrote Twitter user @NataliePP. \n\"It's irrational. State paranoia is driving irrationality,\" she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T11:46:44.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
