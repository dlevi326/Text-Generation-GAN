But the text had no information about the threat and no location. Related Content \nThe location was added a short time later, and the location was changed shortly after the first location was released. \nABC 17 News learned Thursday night not all MU students received the alert. \nAfter shots were fired near campus Friday night, another alert was sent out. \nThe location of the suspect vehicle in the shooting was later changed after the alert was sent. \nABC 17 News reached out to the University of Missouri police department, but was told to contact the MU News Bureau for questions about the MU Alert system. \nAn MU spokesman said he was unavailable for an on-camera interview, but sent ABC 17 News an email with MU Alert tips for students. \nAccording to that email, if an MU student did not receive a text alert, they need to check to make sure information, including their cell phone number, is correctly entered on their myZou page. \nSecondly, officials said to make sure the \"opt-in\" option is selected. \nIf that doesn't work, students are encouraged to call the help desk at 573-882-5000. \nThe University said they've had issues with certain cell service providers in the past. If that's believed to be the case, the University said it will work with students. \nABC 17 News still hasn't been told how or why the information that was put out last week was later changed. \nCopyright Â© 2015 KMIZ - The Networks of Mid-Missouri.
