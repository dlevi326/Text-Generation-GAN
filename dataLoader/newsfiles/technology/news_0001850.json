We’re working on a lot of things; our mapping’s getting better, sensor technology is improving and so is safety. Eventually there’ll be no more accidents. But that’s quite a ways off.”\nMr Zetsche told Reuters that his company’s current car rental services, which have been operating for some time now, and opportunities related to autonomous vehicles would be a strong economic driver for Daimler.\n“I think you don’t need too much imagination to see that by combining these strengths, attractive business models are possible in future,” Mr Zetsche said.\nEarlier this year Daimler, in conjunction with fellow German auto firms Audi and BMW, acquired Nokia’s mapping division HERE.\nGoogle has also been working hard on driverless cars, and says it plans to have automated cars on the road by 2020, while Tesla is also developing its own driverless technology.\nIn related news, driverless cars will hit Australian roads for the first time in November this year, with the South Australian government conducting a trial.\nThose trials, which will be held on the Southern Expressway, at Tonsley Innovation Park and also at Adelaide Airport, will establish how driverless technology needs to be engineered and manufactured for Australian driving behaviour, climate, road conditions, markings, surfaces and roadside signage.\nDavid Swan travelled to San Francisco as a guest of Salesforce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T07:24:04.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
