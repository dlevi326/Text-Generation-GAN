ALSO READ The 'M' of Android is finally here Refurbished goods retailer Greendust ties up with Amazon for buyback, exchange Android M: It's marshmallow, not malai barfi Nexus 6: The six commandments Upward mobility Buying refurbished electronic goods have become all the rage nowadays. But for a layman, the term would fly right above his head. A refurbished item basically means an electronic item that has been returned due to some defect and which has been restored to optimum working conditions. I got my hands on a refurbished Google Nexus 4 by LG from Greendust (available at Rs 15,000) and since I'm familiar with the phone, I tried to find out how a refurbished phone is different from a new one and whether it's worth it. When I took it out of the box, I checked the device for scratches but I found none. Upon switching it on, the phone had factory settings. The touch was smooth just like a new device would have. It was running on Android 4.1 so I decided to upgrade it and see if it heated up, which it didn't. I successfully installed Android 5.1.1 and the phone worked perfectly. I installed various apps and the phone didn't slow down at all. I took the opportunity to play the RAM-heavy Order and Chaos Online on it, and I was happy with the results. The refurbished phone worked in the same way as a new one would. They're a great option and doesn't bring down the quality of a phone in any manner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T19:05:57.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
