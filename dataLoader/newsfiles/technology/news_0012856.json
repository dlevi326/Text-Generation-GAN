It enables South Carolina to recruit and serve the needs of companies with international supply chains, and in doing so, spurs economic development opportunities and generates well-paying jobs for people across the state. \n“Here in the Lowcountry, the port is an important part of our history and will be a driving force in our economy well into the future.” \nMr Newsome previously made a statement that the ports that are not making the relevant investments in infrastructure are at risk of losing business to the larger ports in the US. \nHe added that the top 10 largest would be the ones receiving the majority of trade and the smaller ports would be at risk of closure if they fail to adapt. \nBill Stern, Board Chairman of the SCPA, said: “Port expansion is vital to the continued growth of South Carolina’s economy in the coming years, and SCPA’s strategic priorities ensure that our port system is prepared for the future.” \nStern concluded: “By the end of the decade we will achieve the deepest harbour on the East Coast, open a new container terminal on the former Charleston Navy Base and modernise our existing facilities. We are well-positioned to achieve strong volume growth that will benefit not only our port, but the entire state.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T15:44:25.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
