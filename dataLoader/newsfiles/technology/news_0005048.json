That we consider an act of aggression that has to stop.\"\nHe said the United States is preparing measures to show the Chinese \"this is not just a matter of us being mildly upset, but is something that will put significant strains on a bilateral relationship if not resolved and that we are prepared to take some countervailing actions.\"\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest later said Obama was \"intentionally non-specific\" in the comments but added that the economic sanctions the United States has used over cyber espionage have had a deterrent effect.\nLast week, U.S. officials said Washington was considering sanctions against Russian and Chinese individuals and companies for cyber attacks against U.S. commercial targets.\nWith that as a backdrop, Obama called at the conference for a \"basic international framework\" on cybersecurity, perhaps resembling existing global nuclear agreements. At the same time, he said the United States is equipped to strike back.\n\"And if we want to go on offense, a whole bunch of countries would have some significant problems,\" he said.\n\"We don't want to see the Internet weaponized in that way. That requires, I think, some tough negotiations. That won't be a one-year process, but we'd like to see if ... we and the Chinese are able to coalesce around a process for negotiations. Then I think we can bring a lot of other countries along.\" (Reporting by Roberta Rampton and Lisa Lambert; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Grant McCool )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:12:00.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
