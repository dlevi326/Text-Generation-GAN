The result of this partnership will bring enhanced cybersecurity to the \"Internet of Things,\" specifically, to the documents (electronic files) that bring them all together. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150923005752/en/ \nSmartFile is an electronic sensor that can be inserted into a digital file (including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF) that reports back to the document owner whenever a file is opened, viewed, printed, or shared from anywhere in the world. It thus provides an early warning system of unauthorized use of documents, i.e., Intellectual Property or any other sensitive information, and of possible IT system compromises. When SmartFile is deployed by a user, group, or organization it generates a large volume of sensor data that needs to be quickly analyzed and visualized for cybersecurity and other corporate use cases, such as detecting insider threats or external hacks by unauthorized flow of documents across the Internet. \nBinary's data analytics and business intelligence capabilities including its Performance Optimizer Dashboards™ have provided Government clients actionable insights and visualization into workflow inefficiencies and asset optimization by correlating disparate sources of data. This approach, coupled with advanced cybersecurity analysis techniques such as Cyber Kill Chain Analysis, can identify active ongoing attacks before critical documents or data are compromised. \n\"This partnership represents an incredible opportunity to solve some of the toughest problems in the areas of cybersecurity, privacy, and intellectual property,\" said Mark Gray, Chairman and CEO of Cybergy Holdings. \"SmartFile will create a tremendous new big data stream while Binary's agile analytics and visualization approach will make it actionable, quickly.\" \nFor its part,Binary Group gains access to a powerful, high-visibility cybersecurity tool in Cybergy's managed cybersecurity platform as well as to its commercial and government clients. \n\"This is the coming together of the front and back ends of cybersecurity to create a holistic solution as opposed to separate, disjointed silos of data, processes, and analysis,\" said Rose Wang, Founder and CEO of Binary Group. \nTerry DiVittorio, VP of Cyber Operations for Cybergy Labs, sees the partnership expanding and further enabling the Cybergy family of companies' overall cyber technologies and operations capabilities. \n\"Applying the analytics capabilities developed and implemented by the Binary Group will optimize the power and functionality of SmartFile,\" said Mr. DiVittorio. \"The Internet of Things further exasperates the Big Data challenge and with Binary's applied analytics now integrated with SmartFile, we can aggregate, correlate, and disseminate cybersecurity information in new ways that provide our clients more timely intelligence and decision support in managing their business and mission risks.\" Binary's analytics capabilities are also being integrated into Cybergy Labs' Managed Security Services Platform, (MSSP). \"Analytics are an integral component of our MSSP strategy and incident response capability. Binary's thought leadership and deep expertise in applying analytics in and around large data streams will enhance our sensor network and threat intelligence analysis and further enable our detection, reaction, and response capabilities.\" \nWyly Wade, Cybergy's Chief Technology Officer, adds \"that while SmartFile provides a new data stream, analytics is the key to determining what is actionable intelligence. Binary's unique approach to mission oriented analytics is a critical component to building our cybersecurity offering.\" \nFor more information on SmartFile and its relation to the \"Internet of Things,\" including a short video presentation, see LINK . \nAbout Cybergy Holdings, Inc. \nCybergy Holdings, Inc., is a national leader in cybersecurity, smart grid technologies, renewable energy and mission-oriented government services.
