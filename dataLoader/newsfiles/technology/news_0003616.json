Based on its successful eBook implementations at colleges and universities, Ambassador will show educators across Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin how to leverage eBook usage data to further engage students and produce stronger learning outcomes. \"The insights that accompany eBooks give educators greater visibility into student progress - how often students are engaging with their course materials, and to what extent they are relying on them to study,\" said Steven M. Blicht, COO of Ambassador. \"This information is invaluable to educators, helping them understand how students learn and how course materials support student progress. eBook analytics empower institutions to proactively reach out to students, personalize the experience, and increase retention.\"\n\"The Power of eBook Analytics: Lowering Costs, Maximizing Personalization and Improving Outcomes,\" will do a deep dive into the data analytics that are available, as well as the ways educators can apply these analytics in order to identify and reconcile students' engagement and study habits. Attendees will explore the role of digital content and how it can be used as an alternative or supplement to required course materials.\nAmbassador's experience with eBooks runs deep, having implemented comprehensive course materials programs that give students a choice between print books and eBooks, which can be accompanied by professionally produced Print-on-Demand (POD) versions too. The company's reporting capabilities enable educators to capture and assess relevant usage data so they can recognize trends, predict outcomes and support student success.\nEducators will gather in Chicago September 21st - 23rd.
