(Source: Bradbury, D., “Microsoft buys into cloud security market with Adallom,” IT World Canada web site, September 10, 2015; http://www.itworldcanada.com/article/microsoft-buys-into-cloud-security-broker-market-with-adallom/377018.) \n“This is a significant move by Microsoft and also a symbolic one,” says Matthew Zarrillo, IT Specialist at Zarr Tech. “Online security has been a major concern with companies around the globe and as a leading software provider, Microsoft needed to increase the level of security it offers its customers. Purchasing Adallom is a step in the right direction and shows the public they are serious about security.” \nAdallom works by tracking regular users of its services and identifying “zombie” accounts or groups of users who have never accessed their services. Spotting those accounts and labelling each as a threat to the system is one way Adallom is able to better protect real users. \n“It’s a relatively simple but very powerful service,” Zarrillo continues. “The threats that have invaded companies and continue to do so every day are very real. Microsoft recognizes that and the company wants to be sure that its individual and business clients are protected.” \nMicrosoft had intended to acquire Adallom since July, based on its signed letter of intent. This purchase comes in combination with Microsoft offering “Advanced Threat Protection” for Office 365, which essentially expands on its ability to scan malware. \nAdallom also supports other cloud-based services, such as “Salesforce,” “Dropbox,” and “Google Apps.” Microsoft says it will continue that support. \n“With the IT services Zarr Tech provides for small and medium-sized businesses, security is important for each network served. That’s why Zarr Tech really makes a strong effort to get to know clients intimately, so both parties are equally invested in ensuring the safety and security of all networks. Microsoft’s acquisition of Adallom offers one more way to do just that,” Zarrillo concludes. \nLearn more about the IT solutions Zarr Tech provides its customers by visiting http://www.zarrtech.com. \nFor more information about us, please visit http://zarrtech.net/ \nContact Info:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:27:05.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
