Advances in Sound Quality in Today's Mobile World,\" from the Startup City Networked Society Stage . Cypher's award-winning voice isolation software - which uses math, neural networks and pattern matching techniques - shows a virtually complete elimination of background noise on cell phone calls and a significant improvement in audio quality. \n\"As today's workforce becomes increasingly mobile, so much emphasis has been placed on making cell phone features and functions smarter that sound quality has been left behind,\" said Walker. \"Cypher has developed an affordable, software-based solution that wipes out background noise and makes it possible to enjoy clear audio calls from noisy places like tradeshow floors, taxi lines and traffic jams. We believe CTIA SuperMobility is an ideal place to showcase our breakthrough mobile solution product.\" \nInstead of relying on hardware, infrastructure upgrades or network capability (the traditional attempts at improving audio quality), Cypher's software isolates the target speaker's voice and ignores everything else. It can be adapted to operate on most of today's popular mobile processors such as the CEVA TeakLite 4 DSP . Cypher showed as much as 17 times more background noise reduction than the most popular cell phones on the market in recent third-party standards-based testing conducted by global telephony test and measurement company Spirent Communications, plc. \nThe company will also demonstrate its award-winning voice isolation software in Startup Pavilion booth #4769 throughout the show. Show attendees are encouraged to attend the presentation or visit the booth to hear Cypher's technology in action - listening to demonstrations taken from a battlefield, a cafe and a traffic jam - and see it installed on a popular mobile phone. \nAbout Cypher Cypher is a leader in delivering next-generation pattern recognition and audio enhancement solutions for mobile communications. Cypher software algorithms detect and separate acoustic signals on today's mobile devices in real time, dramatically reducing background noise and significantly improving voice quality and intelligibility.
