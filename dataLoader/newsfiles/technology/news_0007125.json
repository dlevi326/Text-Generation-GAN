Comcast plans to trial the STB browser software enhancements for use on its RDK-based X1 Platform later this year. \nThe browser software resides in the set-top box (STB), and enables high performance rendering of HTML5 apps and next-generation user interfaces (UIs) across STBs. Notably, the new software will help increase browser performance, with a smaller software footprint, and requires significantly less memory usage. Technically, it relies upon open-source WebKit for Wayland components to render UIs, and provide better windows management to control multiple applications and resource management. \n\"At Liberty Global we set out to optimise the browser to deliver a high performance consumer experience with support for rich UIs and HTML5 apps on Horizon TV,\" said Balan Nair, EVP and CTO at Liberty Global. \"This browser capability will enable us to more easily customise user experiences and offer high performance TV services, such as our integrated app experience based on the Metrological *** Application Platform ** \n, to our customers in ways that weren't previously possible.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T12:10:35.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
