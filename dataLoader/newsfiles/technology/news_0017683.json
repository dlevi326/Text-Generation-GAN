Based on the in-depth evaluation, Kony achieved the highest possible rating of 5.0 in all of these criteria: Identity and Security Services, Data and Offline Access, App Management, Deployment, and Client-side Development, along with the highest ranking among the vendors evaluated for Quality/Life Cycle Management. \nThe authors of the Forrester Wave research, Michael Facemire and Jeffrey S. Hammond stated in the report, “Kony achieved its position (as a Leader) through its overall breadth of offering, successfully distinguishing their front-end services from back-end services, and providing a highly differentiated set of development tooling.” \nThe Forrester Wave report cited that “Kony is a market Leader in mobile infrastructures services due to its multiyear re-engineering effort that separated the KonyOne mobile middleware solution into separate front-end design tools and services for back-end data access (Kony MobileFabric). This reflects in the Wave with strength in both enterprise data access and robust offline data support along with front-end strength in engagement and identity services. Rarely is the topic of ‘enterprise middleware’ accompanied by ‘intuitive design tools,’ but the Kony Visualizer sets the standard here. Tying this all together is a solid set of business partners that help Kony fill nearly all needs in the mobile software development life cycle.” \n“We believe Forrester’s acknowledgement of Kony as a market leader is a strong validation of our relentless commitment to innovation excellence, and focus on delivering the industry’s best and most comprehensive enterprise mobility solutions for our customers,” said Thomas E. Hogan , chief executive officer, Kony, Inc. “As the complexity and scale of enterprise mobile applications expands, the need for a robust standard for mobile middleware is quickly becoming an imperative. Open and easy-to-consume services for synchronization, orchestration, security, API Management, IoT, and connectors to a wide range of data sources, is a foundational enabler for business agility and efficiency, as well as providing a rich user experience. We could not be more pleased that Kony’s MobileFabric has emerged as a leader in this important category.” \nThe Forrester Wave methodology includes a rigorous process of surveys and scenario-based demos addressing current offering, strategy, and market presence. For the report, Forrester evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of the 10 leading mobile infrastructure services vendors, looking at the depth of their capabilities across seven classes of mobile infrastructure services that development teams need. Specifically, in the current offering category, Forrester looked for: Good current capabilities across seven types of mobile infrastructure services Flexible delivery of mobile infrastructure services via public cloud, on-premises, or hosted options Client-side support for front-end developers via software development kits (SDKs) or plug-ins that support native or hybrid app development Life-cycle management support that aids testing and staging of pre-production apps, including gathering beta feedback. \nKony MobileFabric , one of the most comprehensive and open mobile backend-as-a-service solutions available for enterprises today, was designed and built from the ground up to deliver a seamless, integrated experience for enterprise customers.
