Featuring a prominent and persistent brand bar, which remains on the screen even after the video is complete, GlassView's new product promotes increased engagement and attention compared to the dynamic expand-collapse functionality of existing versions of In-Read, which disappear altogether when readers scroll away from them. \nBranded In-Read is designed to allow publishers to dynamically inject advertiser messages into related editorial content. While so-called 'always in view' ad formats have been in demand to ensure that ads get seen, other video solutions dissolve once the video is complete. Branded In-Read, however, is designed with user experience in mind, allowing readers to finish an article, then choose to return to the ad to engage with the branded bar, which remains prominently visible. The result is the same increased attention that brands achieve with regular In-Read delivery, but with the added element of engagement, including increased clickthroughs and shares. \n\"We've identified a distinct mechanism for video that's innovative, non-intrusive and continues on where people are still engaged with the page,\" says James G. Brooks, Founder & CEO of GlassView. \"This launch reinforces our mission of delivering innovative products and services to help our ad partners reach their desired audiences, drive both attention and engagement, and demonstrate quantifiable ROI for their advertising initiatives.\" \nGlassView performs semantic analysis around editorial content to determine ad relevance. The product is also interactive and ensures viewability; if at least 50% of the unit isn't viewable or if the reader scrolls around screen or leaves the page, the video stops playing. \nIn preliminary testing of more than 2 million video views across multiple verticals over the past month, Branded In-Read garnered over 2.7 times higher clickthrough rates and 1.4 times higher share rates than a regular In-Read, or inventory without a brand bar. \n\"GlassView's Branded In-Read goes beyond the technical parameters of pre-roll, where agency buyers have historically used repurposed 15 or 30 second television spots to fill their online video ad buys\" said Michael Goefron, Managing Director of Accounts and GlassView Chief Brand Safety Officer. \"The result is a new format that provides an elegant native experience for readers as well as expands publishers' inventories.\" \nGlassView's Branded In-Read is also very affordable. Prices for the product start at only $0.05 per view. \nA live example on leading lifestyle blog Beauty and Wellbeing can be viewed here: http://beautyandwellbeing.com/well-being/editors-picks/psg-paris-saint-germain-jolival/ \nThe launch of Branded In-Read comes as GlassView continues to expand its team, with the recent addition of Jo Ben-Atar as Executive Director of GlassView's international sales team.
