More than 100 laboratories encompassing 63,000 square feet help catalyze innovation in science, engineering and production. These spaces include: Labs for research into human perception, sensory immersion and other fields Mixing rooms for work in Dolby Audio™, Dolby Atmos ® and Dolby Vision™ A recording studio with a mixing room Playback rooms for quality assurance, content review and testing of audio and visual technologies, including laser projection Living room and small cinema theatre rooms to mimic real-world contexts for testing and research Support rooms, including facilities for prototyping, fabrication and assembly \nThe new Dolby headquarters features approximately 300,000 square feet of renovated space to house more than 750 employees and generate new opportunities for focus, exchange of ideas and work/life harmony.

Artists were given three principles to guide their process: celebrate Dolby’s past, look toward the future and reflect on Dolby’s globally diverse culture. Each artist created a unique interpretation of this request, working in an artistic medium of choice to create stunning and thought-provoking installations. The installations vary from a literal interpretation of an early Dolby circuit board rendered in neon to an abstract expression of how musicians layer sound and an interactive piece that responds to the movement around it. \nDolby has documented the art installation process on the Dolby Lab Notes blog, and artists have shared their work on social media using #DolbyArt. \n#DOLBYCARES \nDolby reaffirmed its commitment to the city of San Francisco with its community relations program dubbed Dolby Cares. Dolby Cares encourages and supports employee volunteerism and drives the company’s overall giving and community involvement. The program has two areas of focus: Educational efforts that inspire passion, excellence, and innovation in science and art Collaborative efforts that address critical needs in the city of San Francisco and in Dolby’s local communities around world \nIn the past year, Dolby’s community engagement effort has provided grants to multiple San Francisco nonprofit organizations. In addition, Dolby volunteers have provided more than 2,000 hours of community service. Nearly 40 percent of Dolby employees have volunteered in at least one company-sponsored volunteer project. \nIn addition, to celebrate the dedication of 1275 Market Street, more than 400 Dolby employees volunteered 1,200 hours of service to 20 local organizations as part of Dolby’s Care to Share Day on September 28. \n“Dolby has been a great partner for us and is clearly committed to inspiring girls and young women to explore fields in science, technology, engineering and math,” said Terri Winston, founder and executive director of Women’s Audio Mission, a nonprofit group dedicated to advancing women and girls in music production and the recording arts. “Not only have they provided support for our program for middle school girls and for our new recording studio, they have also hired WAM students for positions in their labs.” \nABOUT DOLBY LABORATORIES \nDolby Laboratories (NYSE: DLB) creates audio, video and voice technologies that transform entertainment and communications in mobile devices, at the cinema, at home and at work.
