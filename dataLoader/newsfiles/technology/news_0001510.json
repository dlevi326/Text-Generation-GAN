This is actually a new record for Apple, easily beating last year’s record of 10 million sales in the first weekend.\nOver the past few months, several analysts had been predicting that this year’s new iPhones may not enjoy the same success as last year’s models, or at best only match their success. However, the first weekend sales suggest Apple may have successfully captivated buyers yet again, this time with the new 3D Touch and upgraded 12MP camera with 4K video recording.\n Apple has also announced that the new iPhone models will launch in Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Greenland, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Maldives, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Taiwan on October 9th.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T11:03:30.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
