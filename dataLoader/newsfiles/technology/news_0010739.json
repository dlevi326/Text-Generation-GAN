The command Get-ScheduledTask returns all or select scheduled tasks of the local computer. Open a command prompt window. You can do that with a tap on the Windows-key, typing cmd.exe, right-clicking on the result, selecting \"run as administrator\" and hitting enter. Note that the get-scheduledtask command does not require elevation while all management commands do. Type powershell to open the PowerShell prompt. Type Get-ScheduledTask \nThe basic command lists all tasks of the local computer sorted by path. It only includes the task path, task name and state of the task which may be sufficient at times. \nThe name helps with the identification of the task while the state highlights whether it is enabled or disabled. \nWhat makes this more powerful however are the parameters that you may add to the command to display additional details or filter tasks. \nHere are some command examples that you may find useful: Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName Google* returns all tasks that start with Google. Get-ScheduledTask -TaskPath \\ returns all tasks that are placed in the TaskPath root. \nWhile it is useful to display scheduled tasks this way, you may also manage tasks using the PowerShell. Please note that you need elevated rights to run disable or enable tasks on a system. This means that you need to run PowerShell from an elevated command prompt. \nThe commands Disable-ScheduledTask and Enable-Scheduled-Task have been designed for that. As the names suggest, the first disables tasks you select while the second enables them. \nIf you run the commands directly, you need to specify task names or paths explicitly. There is a workaround for that though that you can use to enable or disable multiple tasks at once. \nCommands that you may find useful are: Disable-ScheduledTask -taskname \"Adobe Flash Player Updater\" disables the task Adobe Flash Player Updater. Enable-ScheduledTask -taskname \"Adobe Flash Player Updater\" enables the task Adobe Flash Player Updater. Get-ScheduledTask -taskname Google* | Disable-ScheduledTask disables all tasks the get command returns (starting with Google), \nOther task related commands of interest are start-scheduledtask , stop-scheduledtask and unregister-scheduledtask .
