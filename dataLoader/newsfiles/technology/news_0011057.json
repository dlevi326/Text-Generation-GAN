Li Jianhong cited the reason for the good performance as indicative of contributions from overseas ports and the Sri Lanka project. \nContainer throughput from the group’s mainland ports in China reached 30.36 million TEU, which was an increase of 5% year-on-year. \nIn H2, 2015, Mr Li Jianhong aims to increase synergies among port projects in China and overseas, as well as balance short-term gain with long-term growth. \nFact File: Kumport is the third largest container terminal in Turkey and is located within the Ambarli Port Zone on the northwest Marmara Sea, which is on the European side of Istanbul, the capital of Turkey, and an important strategic location at the junction in the Eurasian region. The six-berth terminal currently has a shoreline of 2,180 metres and maximum water depth of 16.5 metres, which is capable of accommodating the world’s largest container vessels currently. The container handling capacity of the terminal is currently 1.84 million TEU, which can potentially be expanded to 3.5 million. \n(Source: China Merchants)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:01:26.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
