The key difference with platforms such as Discus and Reddit is that you receive notifications of feedback and can actually have meaningful discourse instead of just casting your two cents into the void for it to be swept up in all the noise Sites like that, while not without their trolls, generally have vibrant, creative and overall positive comment threads that actually mushroom into fascinating and often hilarious discussions on the parent topic. One often learns a great deal more about the original post from them. I was told something to the equivalent of “we’re testing something out soon and might implement it.” That was a couple of years ago.\nNow look where we are.\nFrom Friday we will be dealing with a very different N24 and I don’t think I’m alone in thinking that this is going to have some kind of impact on their web traffic.\nI don’t prescribe to the commonly-capslocked notion that this is something to do with free speech or that users are being silenced in some kind of governmental media crackdown. This is simply N24 turning off a poorly-implemented and impossible to moderate feedback system that got way out of control and horribly corrupted, leaving them with no choice but to pull the plug. What happens after that is the big difference.\nDespite what they have said about using other news sites that don’t have comment threads as examples, I believe that commentary is part of the evolutionary process of how news is delivered to people in the age of social media. There are many examples of other news sites that have commentary successfully implemented.\nThe cowboy days of Facebook and the like are long over. People are starting to take responsibility for their social media activity and realise that it is possible to abuse free speech and be held accountable for reckless postings.\nN24 totally pulling the plug on user commentary, with it to never return is a gigantic step backward, but if they’re planning on reintroducing it in a manner in which many other news sites have successfully done then they have my full support on that.\nOtherwise, it’s not like they’re the only news site in SA anyway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T14:09:19.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
