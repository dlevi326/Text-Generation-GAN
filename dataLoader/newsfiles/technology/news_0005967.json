Neighborhood SOS seeks to be a viable private, partner to municipalities, supplementing community improvement through an innovative online web experience. Their proposed concept allows individuals, community organizations, and businesses to identify revitalization projects, or “SOS’s.” These can be located, assessed, donated to, and tracked to completion, all within a simple, intuitive website.\nNeighborhood SOS seeks to build a grassroots-inspired web application dedicated to allowing community members and businesses to create neighborhood improvement projects as Kickstarter-like campaigns which can be donated to on a tax deductible basis. The concept builds upon communities’ desire to drive their own revitalization and builds in a multitude of tools and measures to ensure that projects are funded in a scalable and responsible manner. However, before this helpful website can launch, Neighborhood SOS needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $100,000 by November 1, 2015. The funds raised will go towards building and creating the website as well actual case study SOS projects that will help launch the non-profit company.\nTo help bring this innovative web application to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered between December 2015 and March 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help Neighborhood SOS reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.
