The power plant was constructed on a site owned by Yamanashi Prefecture by a joint project between the Yamanashi Prefecture Enterprise Bureau and Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). The power plant was one of the largest in scale when the operation started in January 2012 and set a precedent for the era of mega solar.

The prefecture started solar power generation projects in response to the start of the feed-in tariff (FIT) policy and currently operates solar power plants with a total output of about 11MW. \"Komekurayama Solar Power Plant\" is the core of the solar power generation projects. The location of Yamanashi Prefecture is suitable for solar power generation because the prefecture is among the top in Japan in daylight hours. \nThe enterprise bureau is engaged in the electric power business as a public corporation and uses the income from the business for the growth of local industries. \"Yume Solar Kan Yamanashi,\" which was opened at the same time as Komekurayama Solar Power Plant on a site adjacent to the plant, is one of the facilities of the business (fig. 2). Yume Solar Kan Yamanashi, which was established to explain Komekurayama Solar Power Plant and solar energy, also assists in the advancement of new industries, anticipating large-scale expansion of the solar power generation industry.
