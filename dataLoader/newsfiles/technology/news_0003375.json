Within the warehouse, this demands impeccable stock accuracy and a dynamically orchestrated fulfilment operation. To achieve this, a best-in-breed warehouse management system is a must.\" \n\"The advent of cloud computing has made Tier 1 WMS functionality more affordable and accessible and our new edition helps level the playing field, giving smaller organisations a fighting chance when it comes to fulfilment.\" \nSnapfulfil WMS is helping a growing number of eCommerce retailers, including Bensons for Beds, The Cotswold Company, The Hut Group and Oak Furniture Land, to streamline their fulfilment operations, typically improving operational efficiency by up to 30% and helping them to deliver excellent service, in line with ever higher customer expectations. \nSnapfulfil can be found on Stand 614 at eCommerce Expo which takes place from 30 September-1 October at London Olympia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T10:27:49.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
