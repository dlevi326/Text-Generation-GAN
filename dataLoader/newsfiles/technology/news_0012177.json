In the present scenario, almost every electrical or electronic device is manufactured to perform several functions and is more prone to getting affected because of the presence of EMI. For instance, even a tiny amount of silicon housed in a small plastic package can create a significant level of disturbance. This would affect the functioning of the device and any other device working in its environment. To reduce or eliminate such disturbances, the EMC processes and standards followed during the development of the devices need to be constantly updated with the evolving technologies. \nAccording to the report, the Chinese EMC test market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 10.61% over the period 2014-2019. Demand for EMC test systems is expected to surge with increase in the number of electrical devices and EMC test facilities that test automotive and medical components. The CCC system has been established to make manufacturers more concerned about the design and production of products that do not create electromagnetic interference pollution. \nEMC test equipment is costly and requires a large investment for its maintenance and services. This hinders them to act as a one-stop shop for EMC testing. \nKey Topics Covered", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T15:53:18.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
