She has consistently declined to comment about it.\nAguilar told Reuters on Friday that he has \"no current plans\" to leave the agency.\nTechnically, he can stay on board until December 2016 or until his successor is nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n(Reporting by Sarah N.
