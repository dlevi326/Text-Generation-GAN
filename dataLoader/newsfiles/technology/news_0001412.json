The prospect of rising interest rates in the United States and China's slowdown are contributing to uncertainty and higher market volatility,\" IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said in a speech in Washington, according to the prepared text.\nMs Lagarde also pointed to the \"sharp deceleration\" in the growth of global trade and the \"rapid drop\" in commodity prices, which is hammering the finances of commodity-exporting emerging market economies.\nMany of the recent economic gains in Asia, Latin America and Asia \"now seem in jeopardy\", Ms Lagarde said, addressing the Council of the Americas ahead of next week's IMF and World Bank annual meetings to be held in Lima, Peru.\nThe IMF chief said that the Fund's World Economic Outlook report, to be published on Tuesday, would project weaker growth this year than in 2014 and only a slight pick up in 2016.\nIn her speech, Ms Lagarde emphasised the Fund's concern about the Federal Reserve's plan to raise its benchmark interest rate, held at zero since late 2008 to support the US economy's recovery.\nThe rate rise, still on the Fed's track for this year, could drive investors to pull funds from emerging countries into the United States and further strengthen the strong US dollar, the currency on which the debt of many companies is based.\n\"Rising US interest rates and a stronger dollar could reveal currency mismatches, leading to corporate defaults - and a vicious cycle between corporates, banks, and sovereigns,\" Ms Lagarde said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:30:06.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
