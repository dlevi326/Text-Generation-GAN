But in typical fashion, Apple is only dropping vague clues about its plans.\nInvitations sent to reporters and analysts on Thursday were headlined, “Hey Siri, give us a hint.” Apple has previously said it plans to expand the capabilities of Siri, its voice-activated personal assistant, in an upcoming version of its operating software for iPhones and iPads.\nIndustry insiders have also speculated that Apple may introduce other products, such as a larger iPad for business users. The company, however, has not confirmed any plans.\nWhile Apple usually holds such events on a regular schedule, they are still the subject of much anticipation in the tech industry, since Apple products tend to be popular and influential.\nApple says the Sept. 9 event will be held at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in downtown San Francisco. The auditorium seats up to 7,000 people, which is a much larger capacity than San Francisco’s 750-seat Yerba Buena Theater, where Apple often holds such events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T15:26:54.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
