Source: Dado Ruvic/Reuters\nMicrosoft confirmed its internet-calling, video and text service Skype suffered an outage Monday, affecting multiple users of the popular messaging app.\nIn a post on its “heartbeat” website—used to monitor how Skype products are performing—Skype said users are experiencing several technical issues, including problems with logging in, calling, changing status, contact-list management and updating forum pages.\nIn particular, it said for users that are already signed in, contacts will show as offline even if they are online, which prevents starting calls.\nMicrosoft is “working hard to fix an issue which is preventing some users from logging in and using Skype,” said a spokesman for the technology giant.\n“We apologise for any inconvenience and will keep our users updated,” the spokesman added, without providing detail on the geographic scope of the problem, the number of users affected or the timeframe for fixing the issues.\nA similar statement also then appeared on Skype’s official Twitter feed and Facebook page, as well as Skype’s support Twitter feed.\nComplaints about Skype flooded Twitter and Facebook starting around 2 a.m. Eastern time, or 7 a.m. UK time. Some users said the outage affected the services across the world, including US, UK, Australia and Ukraine.\n“Skype not working in Japan,” said Sachiko Sasha M on Skype’s Facebook feed.\n“Hong Kong cannot login too,” added Josephine Wong, another user.\nDown Detector, a website that monitors the running of consumer technology services, posted a map indicating the outage is focused on Europe and Japan.\nRedmond, Washington-based Microsoft bought Luxembourg-headquartered Skype for $US8.5 billion in 2011.
