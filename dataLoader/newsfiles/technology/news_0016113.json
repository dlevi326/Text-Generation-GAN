The container can be adapted to include power, air conditioning, heating as well as plumbing for showers or toilets. It can be fitted out for a variety of purposes, from a control room or office, to secure storage area or accommodation for use off-shore. \nThe container is designed to be compatible with both the PSA, PSA-FT and PSA-FT R helipad variants, which have been designed by FAUN Trackway to create stable, temporary landing surfaces. The modular structure enables the panels to be laid in varying configurations to accommodate different helicopters. \nThe full product will be showcased for the first time in North America in the outdoor area of the exhibition. \nFAUN Trackway USA vice-president Mike Holdcraft said: \"We saw a need in the market for a solution that could offer additional operational features to those active in remote areas and following extensive consultations with the UK Royal Engineers and the United Nations, the helipad multi-role packaging solution was developed. \n\"The technology can be used as both a landing area and a temporary base, having been designed to add versatility to both expeditionary and civilian operations. It will be particularly valuable in places where infrastructure has been damaged or is non-existent.\" \nThe Modern Day Marine exhibition provides a platform for premier military equipment, systems and service providers from around the world to demonstrate their products to senior decision makers in the defence industry, most notably from the US Marine Corps. \nFAUN Trackway USA will be positioned at booth number 3303 and the helipad multi-role packaging solution will be at stand 261.
