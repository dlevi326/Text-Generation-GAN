Reuters/Arnd Wiegmann/Files \nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Google Inc ( GOOGL.O ) stifled competitors' access to its Android mobile-operating system, Bloomberg reported. \nFTC officials have met with representatives of technology companies who said Google gives priority to its own services on the Android platform, while restricting others, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. ( bloom.bg/1NQqIV4 ) \nReuters reported in April that some technology companies had complained to the DoJ that the Android mobile operating system is anti-competitive, urging the U.S. antitrust enforcers to investigate allegations that Google unfairly uses its Android system to win online advertising. \nThe FTC and the Department of Justice have reached an agreement to launch an investigation into Google's Android business. The inquiry is in its early stages and could end without a case against the company, Bloomberg said. \nReuters could not immediately reach the FTC and Google for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. \n(Reporting by Sangameswaran S in Bengaluru; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi) \nOur top photos from the last 24 hours.
