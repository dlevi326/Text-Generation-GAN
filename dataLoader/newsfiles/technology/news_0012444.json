Just look around you, at the grey haze.\" \nSeveral areas in western Malaysia, including the capital Kuala Lumpur, recorded unhealthy air quality. Western Malaysia lies across the Malacca Strait from Sumatra. \nEfforts to tackle the fires with water-bombing helicopters and by chemically inducing rain were being hampered by poor visibility due to the smog, which was preventing aircraft from flying, Indonesia's disaster agency said. \nThe fires started raging intensely several days ago, prompting Indonesian President Joko Widodo to visit Sumatra at the weekend and pledge a crackdown on companies that break the law by starting blazes. \nPressure to stop the annual outbreaks of smog has increased since 2013 when Southeast Asia suffered its worst air pollution crisis for more than a decade, with haze levels hitting a record high in Singapore. \nBut attempts by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations to resolve the problem have moved only slowly, with repeated meetings on the subject producing little concrete. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:42:15.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
