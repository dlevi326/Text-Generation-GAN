When the cyclists arrive in Halifax on Saturday, September 26 for the ceremonial front-wheel dip in the Atlantic, they will have covered over 7,000 km.\nThe national riders have cycled across Canada , visiting many communities, stopping at Sears stores along the route and at pediatric oncology centres, meeting children and families from the childhood cancer community as well as healthcare and family support professionals, donors and sponsors, all united in the goal to improve the quality of life for children affected by cancer.\n\"We are honoured to play any part we can in the fight to end kids' cancer,\" said Becky Penrice , Senior Vice-President, Human Resources, Sears Canada Inc., and President, Sears Canada Charitable Foundation. \"For over 60 years Sears has been serving Canadian families from coast to coast. This is our purpose and continues to be a driving force for us as a company and aligns to our community involvement. No family should ever hear the words 'your child has cancer.' Whether you ride, volunteer or donate to the Sears National Kids Cancer Ride you are making a difference in the lives of those affected.\"\nThe Sears National Kids Cancer Ride funds programs that improve the lives of children living with cancer as well as those recovering from the physical and emotional scars that can be part of survivorship. With a 100% donation model, over $9 million has been raised and donated since 2008, and money raised this year will again fund pediatric hematology and oncology research programs at hospitals all across Canada .\n\"Money raised is critical in helping fund programs that can improve the survival rates and the quality of life for children with cancer,\" said Jeff Rushton , Co-Founder and passionate volunteer of Coast to Coast Against Cancer Foundation (CTCACF), a volunteer-based registered Canadian charitable foundation focused on improving health outcomes and quality of life of children and families impacted by cancer. \"With each kilometre pedaled, collectively we will enrich the quality of life of Canadian children burdened by this devastating disease.\"\nFamilies affected by childhood cancer are active participants in the 2015 Ride. There are ten parents of children who have battled cancer, seven of whom are cyclists and three of whom are volunteers. There are three childhood cancer survivors, two of whom are cycling and one of whom is volunteering. Included in this group is one father-daughter pair, Dean and Taylor Wheatley . Taylor has been cancer-free for twenty years and is a pediatric oncology nurse.\nFor more information or to make a donation, visit www.SearsNationalKidsCancerRide.com or call 1.866.381.4446.
