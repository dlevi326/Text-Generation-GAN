(Sanborn) announces the appointment of CEO John Copple to the Stichting Mapcode Foundation (Mapcode) advisory board. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150615/223284LOGO \n\"I'm pleased to assist in this global effort,\" says Copple. \"The idea of using mapcodes to locate and identify places on Earth is intriguing. Mapcodes can be of particular value for applications such as emergency response in emerging nations, where accurate addressing isn't always available.\" Copple adds that even physical assets, such as individual power poles or fire hydrants, can be assigned a mapcode. \nMapcode is a non-profit foundation in The Netherlands that holds the intellectual property related to mapcodes, which are a free, open way to represent every house or location on Earth with a short code. The codes are designed to be easy to recognize, remember and communicate, and are precise to within a few meters, which in most cases is adequate for everyday use applications. \n\"The idea of Mapcode came about when we saw that millions of locations around the world do not have a recognizable address and were hard to find,\" says Pieter Geelen, Mapcode co-founder. \"Introducing a mapcode system means everyone is empowered with the ability to identify any location on Earth, regardless of the country or its infrastructure.\" \nBy offering mapcodes as a standard and structured addressing system free of charge, the foundation aims to make locations for all citizens, dwellings and businesses in regions without street names or formal addressing systems throughout the globe addressable. Currently, two mobile mapcode apps are available for download: Mapcode Mobile for Android and Mapcode for iOS. For more information visit www.mapcode.com . \nAbout The Sanborn Map Company, Inc.
