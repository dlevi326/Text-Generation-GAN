You can go on Google Maps and judge for yourself.\nOne Russian UFO enthusiast spotted the possible remains of an alien craft and shared the co-ordinates online.\nThe result has now gone viral as other conspiracy theorists check out the crash site for themselves using Google's free Maps software.\nIf you want to see for yourself, type the co-ordinates: 80°34'08.4\"S 30°05’19.3\"W into the Maps search bar and set it to the satellite 'Earth' view.\nPoll loading …\n\"I found the unique object using the online service of Google Earth in Antarctica,\" said eagle-eyed Valentin Degterev who made the find.\n\"In amongst the endless ice desert, it is the most genuine UFO in its most classic shape,\" he said.\nVideo loading\nMany people have dismissed the claim, saying that it's nothing more than a crack in the ice, known as a crevasse.\nHave your say in our new comments section below\n\"It is definitely not a polar station nor a plane as there aren't any airplanes or helicopters this big in the world,\" said Mr Degterev who estimated the size of the object as roughly 204-foot across.\nReuters / NASA Could aliens have crashed into the giant continent of Antarctica without us even knowing?\nThe frozen land of Antarctica covers 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles) and many believe that if UFOs did land there, humans would never know.\nThis isn't the first time ET-hunters have seen things in the ice. Back in June, an unknown black mark caused the same kind of speculation from Mr Degterev.\nRoughly 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice measuring 1.9 kilometers thick.\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/v1/unsecured/media/4221396001/201509/1863/4221396001_4478208022001_4478204155001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-09-14T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T20:57:11.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
