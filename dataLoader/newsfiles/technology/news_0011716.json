(Staten Island Advance/Kristin Dalton) Comments \nSTATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Techies took over LiGreci's Staaten in West Brighton on Monday during Tekamorphosis, a public technology exposition. \nThe West Brighton Local Development Corporation (WBLDC) held the event in commemoration of the organization's 35 th anniversary and to highlight its evolution from WBLDC into the Staten Island Business Outreach Center (SIBOC). \nThe organization believed the name West Brighton Local Development Corporation was misleading to many, who assumed that the group's services were specific to the neighborhood of West Brighton. \n\"We morphed...our name had to change with the change in technology,\" said Lorette Cauldwell, executive director of the Staten Island Business Outreach Center. \nA handful of technology-based companies, many of which are Staten Island-based start-ups, had booths at the expo to show the public what they have to offer. \nAssembly 3D Printing was at one of the booths, showcasing a 3D printer. \nThe business, which is owned by Michael Perina, has an office at 75 Clinton St., Stapleton, in a building run by Techbox, a company that also had a booth at the expo. \nTechbox offers professional office space to rent to small businesses, while providing many technological services, such as networking, to help companies succeed. \nBorough President James Oddo was the keynote speaker at the expo. \nOddo spoke about making the North Shore a tech and creative hub, starting with plans to turn the vacant Department of Health building at 55 Stuyvesant Pl. into a technology epicenter . \nHe also addressed the importance of technology to small businesses. \n\"Small businesses should embrace technology. The fact is, that nationwide, approximately 63 percent of small businesses don't even have a website. That makes it awfully difficult to compete in an era when your website and social media serve as a business' virtual front door,\" Oddo said. \nTekamorphosis offered a variety of workshops and seminars on topics from using social media to grow your business to protecting yourself from identity left. \nThe expo was followed by an evening Gala Dinner, honoring Richmond County Savings Bank, National Grid and Citi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T22:51:52.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
