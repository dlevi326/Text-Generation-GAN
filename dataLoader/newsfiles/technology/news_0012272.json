It is compatible with all client and server versions of Windows starting with Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 including Windows 10. \nNote : Removing items from File Explorer or Windows Explorer affects all users on the system as the selected entry is hidden on the machine level and not user level. \nHow to use wenpcfg \nDownload the latest version of the application from the official Github project page. You need to extract the contents of the archive to the system. \nOnce done, open an elevated command prompt window: Tap on the Windows-key. Type cmd.exe. Right-click on the result and select \"run as administrator\". Alternatively, hold down Shift and Ctrl before you click on the result for the same effect. Navigate to the folder that contains the program you have downloaded and extracted. \nThe core command is wenpcfg /option1 /option2. The following options are available to hide items in Windows Explorer / File Explorer. wenpcfg /HideLibraries - This hides the Library link in Windows Explorer / File Explorer. wenpcfg /HideFavorites - This removes the Favorites link in Windows Explorer / File Explorer. wenpcfg /HideNetwork - This removes the Network link. wenpcfg /HideComputer - Removes Computer from Windows Explorer / File Explorer. wenpcfg /HideHomeGroup - Hides the Homegroup link in Windows Explorer / File Explorer wenpcfg /HideOneDrive - Removes OneDrive from Windows 10's File Explorer (experimental) wenpcfg /HideQuickAccess - Removes QuickAccess from Windows 10's File Explorer (experimental) \nThe program ships with options to restore these resource links at a later point in time. wenpcfg /ShowLibraries", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T16:26:05.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
