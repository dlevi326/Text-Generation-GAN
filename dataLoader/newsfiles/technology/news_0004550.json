She has long been considered a protege of Murdoch, who promoted her to senior positions in his British newspaper empire. She had casual access to senior figures in the British government, getting advice from former Prime Minister Tony Blair and frequently socializing with Prime Minister David Cameron.\nThe hacking scandal caused the shutdown of News of the World along with arrests of dozens of journalists, police and other officials, and it had seemed to put a premature end to her rise as one of Britain's most prominent media chieftains.\nBut she was acquitted in June 2014 of charges related to the phone hacking, bribing officials and obstructing police. She has said that she didn't know of phone hacking while she was News of the World editor between 2000 and 2003.\nThe return of Brooks, who had maintained a low public profile since she and her husband were acquitted, was not welcomed by Labour Party legislator Chris Bryant. He had been a victim of phone hacking.\n\"Rupert Murdoch has just stuck two fingers up to the British public and the thousands of people whose phones were hacked by News International,\" he said, referring to a gesture that is considered vulgar in the U.K. \"Hundreds of ordinary journalists lost their jobs when Mr. Murdoch closed the News Of The World, but it seems Rebekah Brooks is to get very special treatment.\"\nHe said the decision is \"ludicrously premature\" because British prosecutors have said publicly they are mulling corporate charges against News Corp because of its actions.\nThe company on Wednesday also said that David Dinsmore, the editor of the Sun, would become News UK's COO and named Tony Gallagher as the tabloid's new editor. He has worked for the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph papers.\nNews UK today includes the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times papers.\nBrooks will also work on digital efforts at News Corp, which separated from the entertainment conglomerate Twenty-First Century Fox two years ago.\n__\nGreg Katz contributed to this report from London.\n__\nFollow Tali Arbel at http://twitter.com/tarbel\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/tarbel"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:30:11.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
