Silicon Valley bigwigs chime in. by Vanity Fair \nWhen it comes to technology, five years is a long time—and no one knows just how quickly the present can grow obsolete than those working to hasten the arrival of the future. \nVanity Fair asked some of Silicon Valley’s biggest names to identify the technology they believe will have become horribly dated in five years time. “BlackBerrys,” says Snapchat’s Evan Spiegel . \n“A lot of current jobs,” offers Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator. “Time to start thinking seriously about new ones.” \nUber C.E.O. Travis Kalanick stays on message in his response: “Parking garages. Transportation will be so inexpensive that it will be cheaper than owning a car.” \nStewart Butterfield , a co-founder of the popular messaging system Slack, says that landline phones will finally become a relic of history. “People will finally stop fucking asking what your home telephone number is,” Butterfield says, adding that he thinks “postal mail” is similarly doomed. \nOn the communication front, Dropbox founder and C.E.O. Drew Houston hopes voicemails will have become outdated. \nThe answers were culled from Vanity Fair ’s New Establishment package. The annual list, a ranking of tech and media elites, will be released September 8. \nA number of entertainers were also asked to chime in on technology. “Vape pens and fish” won’t be around much longer, if Jimmy Kimmel’s view of the future is realized. And director Jason Blum says that, when “walking down the aisle of a plane,” we’ll all be “seeing more people than not with headsets on their faces”—potentially good news for the likes of Oculus VR. \nIf you run into Amy Schumer , you’d do well to ask her to read your fortune. She imagined that One Direction will have become obsolete in five years time, and the boy band broke up before we even got around to publishing this item.
