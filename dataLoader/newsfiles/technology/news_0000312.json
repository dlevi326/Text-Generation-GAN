The Taiwanese tech major has just made an announcement about the launch event of its upcoming Android Marshmallow device. \nIt will not be a regular media event, rather a virtual one that will be held here at noon ET. \"On Oct 20 we will introduce our newest HTC One smartphone. This is not your traditional smartphone so we aren't hosting a traditional launch event,\" says the company in an invite. And one more thing... We'll be one of the first to drop a new Marshmallow device. Revealed 10/20 #BeBrilliant pic.twitter.com/RuHxjCA7jk â€” HTC (@htc) September 29, 2015 \nThe company did not reveal details about the device, just noted that it will be one of the first to introduce an Android Marshmallow device, following Google's launch of Nexus 6P, 5X and Pixel C at the 29 September event in San Francisco. It is widely expected that the event will mark the debut of the long rumoured HTC One A9 handset codenamed the Aero. \nInitially rumoured to be a replacement for One M9, the One A9 seemed to be an upper mid-range handset coming in six different colour variants, such as acid gold, opal silver, deep garnet, carbon gray, rose gold and cast iron. Snapdragon 617 chip set is likely to be the driving force inside the 5in handset, coupled with 2GB RAM. Expect a 13 megapixel rear camera and a four ultrapixel sensor on the front. To know more about it, we will have to wait until the official launch.
