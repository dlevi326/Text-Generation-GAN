Eighteen patients were relocated.\nOfficials say the two heart transplant patients who died had contracted fungal infections and stayed in the unit. One was infected in October 2014, the other in June 2015.\nUPMC's quality control chief says doctors don't know if the infections played a role in their deaths. A review of patient records found their infections started nearly a year ago.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-18T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T01:22:56.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
