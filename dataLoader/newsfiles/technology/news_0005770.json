I said this is what the fare was and they proceeded to turn around and spit on me,\" she said.\nThe woman said she was shocked by the whole ordeal. None of her other passengers spoke up or acted in her defence.\n\"I didn’t say anything because he had gotten off the bus and took off,\" she said.\n\"I would rather take a punch to the face than be spit on. It’s the most disgusting thing in the world. It’s bodily fluid -- you don’t know what that person carries. You can recover from a punch, you can recover from a slap, but getting spit on? It’s the most disgusting thing ever.\"\nData provided to the Free Press by the city show the number of assaults on Winnipeg Transit drivers is on the decline since 2011, but the descriptions of assaults remain very violent.\nIn the last four years, drivers have reported 225 assaults ranging from being verbally abused, slapped, punched, pepper-sprayed, spit on, splashed with soda and Slurpees and threatened with weapons, among other bad behaviour.\nCallahan remembered one particularly awful incident that happened downtown last summer — a driver was punched in the face by an angry passenger who missed his stop. The driver’s nose was broken.\n\"If he’d knocked him out, we would have had a bus careening down Portage Avenue with 30 riders in it,\" he said. \"Luckily we haven’t had that worst case scenario like that yet, but we don’t want it to happen.\"\nThere hasn’t been any reported incidents of assault since the bus fleet decreased last week, Callahan said.\nWinnipeg Transit currently has 595 buses in its fleet, with 104 of them in the shop as of Sunday, according to Winnipeg Transit director Dave Wardrop.\nWardrop said driver and passenger safety is an important priority. He noted all buses are equipped with video cameras and Winnipeg Police Service officers and cadets will ride public transit periodically.\nBut Callahan said he wants to see officers in plain clothes riding buses on a regular schedule, for the drivers’ and passengers’ protection.\n\"It’s something that I think most people would get behind because it’s for the good of all,\" Callahan said.\nThe female driver agreed she would feel more safe on the job if she had some police backup.\n\"Having that sense of security would be nice and (getting help) enforcing fares,\" she said.\nThe woman said riders evade fares on her routes daily, but she’d rather let them go than get hurt.\n\"I’m sure we hit the underpay button I don’t know how many times… it’s going to be worn out. But I’m the type of person that I’d rather come home safe at night then end up being in the hospital.\"\nCallahan will suggest adding plain clothes officers to bus routes at a Wednesday meeting between the ATU and city officials.\nWardrop said he’s open to the discussion about having more cadets or officers ride the bus, a plan that’s been in the woodwork for years.\n\"I think we’re open to conversation right now with ATU and with WPS to come up with the best processes that we can,\" he said. \"We’ve got programs in place with WPS and we’re looking to expand on those.\"\nWardrop also said a revised fall schedule Winnipeg Transit put out Friday should curb bus delays this week.\n\"We did some minor tweaking on some of the peak-hour routes, the morning rush and the afternoon rush routes. We did some tweaking to the schedule to keep our capacity more in line with the demand. I’m more confident now… in the situation,\" he said.\nTwo Winnipeg Transit mechanics quit their jobs last week -- with notice -- which somewhat contributed to the bus shortage, Wardrop said.\nDuring contract negotiations between the ATU and the city in May and June, transit employees stopped working overtime hours, which caused a significant delay in general bus maintenance.\njessica.botelho-urbanski@freepress.mb.ca\nCommonly reported assaults Winnipeg Transit drivers reported being assaulted while on the job 225 times between 2011 and 2015.
