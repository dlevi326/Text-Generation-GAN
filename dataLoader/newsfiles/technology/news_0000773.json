Asia-Pacific Century\nGood afternoon ladies and gentlemen.\nMay I begin by thanking the People’s Liberation Army for giving me the opportunity to speak at this historic university.\nIn particular, I would like to thank Lieutenant General Zhang Shibo, the President of the National Defense University, for hosting my delegation today.\nIt was a pleasure to have welcomed you to New Zealand last year.\nThis is my first visit to China as Minister of Defence.\nI have visited China four times, and I feel more welcome every time I return.\nI would like to use this opportunity today to set out both New Zealand’s global and regional security priorities, but also how we view the Asia-Pacific as a whole.\nFirst, let me show you New Zealand’s view of the World.\nThis hemispheric view of the world is centred on Wellington, our capital city.\nBecause we are so isolated, we are a maritime nation through necessity.\nOur Exclusive Economic Zone is the fourth largest in the world.\nWith this large maritime domain also comes significant responsibility.\nThe New Zealand Defence Force must cover a search and rescue zone that stretches from North of the Equator, all the way to the South Pole, halfway to Australia, and halfway to South America.\nThis equates to 11 per cent of the planet.\n99 per cent of New Zealand’s goods trade is by sea, linked to markets far from our shores.\nWe place great importance on both freedom of navigation and maintaining open trading routes.\nThese are not just rhetorical statements.\nThey are real and critical for New Zealand.\nNew Zealand has four national security interests, which were first set out in the 2010 Defence White Paper.\nThese interests were confirmed again in the 2014 Defence Assessment, and consist of:\nPromoting a safe, secure and resilient New Zealand;\nSustaining a network of strong international relationships;\nPreserving a rules-based international order; and\nMaintaining access to international markets via secure sea, air and electronic lines of communication.\nWe also see significant security challenges within our region that accompany these interests.\nExclusive Economic Zone\nNatural resources within New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone are under increased pressure.\nIllegal, unregulated and unreported fishing and illegal resource extraction are increasing within New Zealand’s immediate maritime area.\nThere is rising interest in the Southern Oceans and in Antarctica.\nWe are already seeing increased illegal activity by poachers, and there is potential for rising strategic competition between states.\nNew Zealand currently has a claim to the Ross Dependency in Antarctica.\nWe undertake scientific and research activity there in the summer months, with logistical support from the United States and the New Zealand Defence Force.\nHumanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief\nBoth at home and in the South West Pacific, we see increasing demands for disaster response and recovery.\nAlongside our close partner Australia, New Zealand is often the first responder on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in the South West Pacific.\nA recent example of this is the combined effort that followed Tropical Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu earlier this year.\nI know China is no stranger to natural disasters and their grave consequences.\nNew Zealand shared your heartbreak for the many victims of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.\nI have experienced these circumstances first hand as Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery, overseeing the ongoing rebuild of our second biggest city, Christchurch, following a series of devastating quakes which began in 2010.\nHumanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief is a key area where New Zealand wishes to seek further cooperation with China and the People’s Liberation Army.\nSouth Pacific\nNew Zealand maintains a direct interest in security and prosperity in the South Pacific.\nWe do not expect that the South Pacific will face an external military threat.\nHowever, a breakdown in law and order or state failure resulting in instability or conflict would negatively impact New Zealand’s interests in the region.\nThe rising political, security, and economic influence of non-state actors in the region is a cause for concern.\nSouth Pacific nations face continuing economic, environmental, and governance challenges; accompanied by relatively low security sector capacity.\nThis fragility is likely to remain a key issue in the near and medium term.\nThe New Zealand Defence Force has been called upon for stability and security operations to restore law and order in the Pacific in the past and stands ready to do so if needed in the future.\nWe would seek to work alongside other partners in a regional response, as we did in Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands.\nWe see real value in working together with partners such as China to help build capacity and resilience in South Pacific communities.\nAddressing the high economic and social costs of transnational crime and illegal and unregulated fishing is one such area where we can do more together.\nI am very pleased that China was able to send a contingent of engineers to participate for the first time in the annual Exercise Tropic Twilight, which is currently underway in the Cook Islands.\nThis multinational exercise also includes forces from New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nThrough our combined efforts, engineers and other supporting staff from all nations constructed a number of fuel tanks in the Cook Islands.\nThis will help to enable the Cook Islands to maintain their own exclusive economic zone and secure their own sustainable future.\nIt also has the additional effect of getting our militaries used to working together.\nI would like to add that New Zealand and China are also undertaking a joint aid project in the Cook Islands.\nInternational Security Challenges\nNew Zealand is increasingly affected by events and tensions beyond our immediate region.\nAs a consequence of our global interests, we have an important stake in upholding a rules-based international order.\nThreats to this order cut across borders.\nCyberspace has brought New Zealand economically and socially closer to the world, but this connectivity also carries increased risks.\nCyber threats are growing markedly, both in quantity and variety.\nThey can emanate from anywhere and target any of us.\nCountries must recognise their shared interests in cyberspace, and respond effectively to malicious activity.\nTerrorism is an issue that reaches across the globe and affects many nations, including China.\nWe share the international community’s outrage at Daesh’s brutal actions.\nNew Zealand is not immune to terrorism – our security agencies must monitor a sizeable number of supporters of Daesh within New Zealand, and some have travelled to fight in Syria.\nThe New Zealand Government has responded to this threat.\nWe are contributing humanitarian assistance, and recently accepted an intake of 750 Syrian refugees displaced by the fighting.\nSignificantly, the New Zealand Defence Force is working in partnership with the Australian Defence Force to support a military training mission in Iraq.\nTo date 1600 Iraqi Armed Forces personnel have passed through our training programme.\nWe are proud of the contribution our troops are making towards a more secure Iraq.\nIn addition to terrorism and cyber threats, the rules based international order is coming under increased pressure from strategic rivalry.\nWe have observed greater willingness of countries to get involved in conflicts outside of the UN system and international law.\nWhile there is low risk of a major interstate conflict, this risk has been rising over the last five years.\nA rules based system is particularly important for ensuring continued freedom of navigation and collective maritime security.\nNew Zealand and Trade\nAs I’ve said, New Zealand is a maritime nation.\nAnd like China we rely heavily on free access to major shipping routes and sea lanes of communication for our own economic prosperity.\nOur national security interests stretch as far as our trade routes do, from those to our principal and closest trading partner Australia, to those as far afield as Europe, here in North Asia, and to the Americas.\nBecause New Zealand’s interests in the maritime domain are truly global, our contribution to preserving these interests must also extend globally.\nFor example, in the Gulf of Aden, New Zealand has been contributing to the fight against piracy off the Horn of Africa.\nSo too has China.\nThe People’s Liberation Army Navy has made a significant contribution to counter-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden through its convoy escort operations.\nNew Zealand’s global maritime trade reflects increasing economic integration and connectivity.\nNowhere is this more apparent than in North Asia and the wider Asia-Pacific.\nNorth Asia\nNew Zealand is mindful that our economic future is increasingly tied to the Asia-Pacific.\nWe take every opportunity to pursue trade opportunities in the region, helping to build mutual prosperity.\nWe have a historically significant free trade agreement with China, which I will cover in more detail shortly, and in March we signed a free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea.\nRegional economic integration is a top priority for New Zealand.\nWe actively support the Asia Pacific Economic Community vision of a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific.\nWe recognise that the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which China is part of, is a key foundation of this vision.\nThe successful conclusion of a complete, high quality Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement is currently the highest trade priority for New Zealand.\nOur commitment to increased economic integration with North Asia must be matched by efforts to build stronger security ties to the region, both bilaterally and multilaterally.\nNew Zealand has made considerable progress in our defence relationships with China, Korea and Japan.\nWhile North Asia has experienced a prolonged period of substantial economic growth, we cannot lose sight of the number of tensions in the region which have the potential to undo much of this work.\nThe continuing tension on the Korean Peninsula, for example, is a cause for concern.\nOnly a month ago, two South Korean soldiers were injured as a result of a North Korean land mine explosion.\nSubsequent exchanges of fire across the border once again illustrated the delicate balance between tension and war on the Peninsula.\nNew Zealand has consistently condemned North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes.\nWe support the Six Party Talks process, which China has been closely involved in, and encourage North Korea to demonstrate its commitment to denuclearisation and return to the talks.\nWe see our relationship with China as a crucial avenue for helping to maintain New Zealand’s interests in a stable and prosperous Asia-Pacific, and for addressing some of the region’s security challenges.\nNew Zealand – China Relationship\nNew Zealand and China have a very close relationship.\nIndeed, China is an important strategic partner for New Zealand.\nNew Zealand has consistently welcomed the rise of a prosperous, peaceful China on the world stage.\nWe have a political and economic relationship based on four firsts.\nWe were the first western country to conclude a bilateral agreement with China on its succession to the World Trade Organisation;\nThe first developed country to recognise China’s status as a market economy;\nThe first developed country to enter into free trade agreement negotiations;\nAnd the first to sign a high quality comprehensive balanced free trade agreement with China.\nWe are proud of these firsts.\nThe relationship has recently reached new heights.\nThe state visit to New Zealand by President Xi Jinping in November 2014 was the first visit by a Chinese President since 2003.\nThe elevation of the relationship to Comprehensive Strategic Partnership was a significant milestone for the bilateral relationship.\nThe economic relationship between New Zealand and China is a huge success story.\nChina is our second largest trading partner for goods and services and is our largest export market for dairy and forestry products.\nChina is our number one source of imports, and New Zealanders appreciate access to a range of Chinese products.\nThis goes both ways.\nNew Zealand continues to supply high quality products to China.\nBetween 2008 and 2014 goods exports from New Zealand to China quadrupled in value from $2.5 billion to $10 billion.\nThe initial goal set by leaders of NZ$20 billion in two-way trade by 2015 was surpassed in May 2014.\nIn March 2014, Prime Minister Key and President Xi Jinping set a new ambitious goal to reach $30 billion by 2020.\nThis momentum has also been matched by solid growth in two-way investment.\nOur cultural and people-to-people links are also going from strength to strength.\nChina is our largest source of overseas students, second largest source of tourists, and the Chinese diaspora in New Zealand is growing, vibrant, and well integrated into New Zealand society.\nMore recently, New Zealand welcomed the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as an important initiative supporting infrastructure investment and economic development in the Asia region.\nWe look forward to working closely with China and other member countries in the coming months as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank comes into operation.\nNew Zealand – China Defence Relationship\nOur security relationship has built up significant positive momentum.\nDespite the disparities between our security situations, and the respective size of our defence forces, we have developed a constructive defence relationship based on respect and openness.\nOur interactions with the People’s Liberation Army allow for real issues to be discussed in a meaningful way.\nWe are grateful for these opportunities.\nOur Five Year Engagement Plan with the People’s Liberation Army is the first agreed between China and a Western military, demonstrating the unique nature of our relationship.\nThis builds on our tradition of ‘firsts’ in the political and economic relationship.\nIn addition to Exercise Tropic Twilight, we also welcome China’s participation in the annual Phoenix Spirit and Cooperation Spirit series of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief exercises.\nThe 2014 edition of the exercise considered lessons learned from the MH370 search operation.\nThe People’s Liberation Army made a significant contribution to the MH370 search off the Australian coast, in partnership with many nations, including New Zealand.\nCreating opportunity for our junior soldiers to work together in real, practical situations is another priority for New Zealand.\nThis will boost interoperability, mutual understanding and enable us to share perspectives on the world.\nThe soldiers of today will be the generals of tomorrow – just as those in this fine institution will be the People’s Liberation Army’s thought leaders of the future.\nIn peacekeeping, New Zealand is very grateful for the force protection provided by People’s Liberation Army soldiers working under the United Nations banner in South Sudan, side-by-side with our troops.\nChina is now one of the world’s biggest contributors of peacekeepers to United Nations missions, and we commend you for your commitment to maintaining international peace and security through these means.\nThe People’s Liberation Army has also demonstrated its capacity as a responsible world actor through disaster relief efforts in Nepal, the Maldives and the Philippines, and in the search for MH370.\nPositive Security Factors in the Asia Pacific\nWhile I have covered today many of the challenges to regional and global security, I believe that overall the positive factors outweigh the negatives.\nOur region is more economically integrated that ever.\nEven in the global financial crisis, countries chose to stimulate their economies without returning to economic protectionism.\nIn fact, free trade has expanded since the downturn.\nAs I said earlier, free trade pacts, including the Trans Pacific Partnership, are crucial guarantees of economic prosperity, increased security and peace through interdependence.\nNew Zealand has welcomed the US rebalance into the Asia-Pacific.\nWe have benefited from this move, and consider the rebalance a positive factor for regional security.\nWe do not see our defence relationships with the United States and China as mutually exclusive.\nWe believe that the United States and China want the same thing for the Asia-Pacific – peace and prosperity.\nThis is New Zealand’s desire as well, and we will work with all parties to achieve this outcome.\nTo do this, it is crucial to maintain inclusive dialogue mechanisms, ensuring that all nations are well integrated into a rules-based international order.\nThis will allow us to address some of the region’s most pressing collective challenges, such as the potential for strategic rivalry around territorial disputes.\nSouth China Sea\nEconomic interdependence, and our mutual stake in maritime trade, provides clear incentives to manage maritime and territorial disputes peacefully.\nThis must be matched with equal measures to build an open and inclusive regional order where security, freedom of navigation, and overflight, and open trade routes are managed in accordance with international laws and norms.\nThe South China Sea has been a prominent issue in regional security discussions this year.\nIt is of particular importance to New Zealand, reliant as we are on seaborne trade and the security and freedom of navigation for our economic prosperity and well-being.\nOver half of New Zealand’s maritime trade passes through the South China Sea.\nWhile we take no position on the various claims in the South China Sea, New Zealand opposes actions that undermine peace and erode trust.\nWe are concerned that developments have outstripped regional efforts to manage tensions.\nWe call on all claimant states to take steps to reduce tensions.\nWe want to see swift progress in fully implementing the Declaration of Conduct and rapid conclusion of the Code of Conduct negotiations to build a better framework for managing activity in the area.\nThe role of international law and international institutions is important in finding long-terms solutions to these disputes.\nNew Zealand supports the right of states to access international dispute settlement mechanisms as well as solving disputes through bilateral negotiations.\nIt is important that we respect the outcome of such processes.\nI addressed this issue when I spoke to the Shangri-La Dialogue in May.\nAll big countries are made much bigger, in every sense of the word, by recognising their strengths and confidently sharing and defusing concerns of smaller countries.\nBy recognising these concerns and seeking dialogue in the settlement of issues, it is the mark of a big country.\nAs we would say in New Zealand, it confers what in the indigenous M?ori language we call ‘mana,’ or respect, for other nations.\nPromoting Conflict Resolution and Prevention\nFinally, I would like to draw your attention to a proposal I put to the Shangri-La Dialogue in May.\nWe encourage China, and all members of the Asia-Pacific community, to work towards the outcomes represented by the following four pillars to promote active conflict prevention and resolution.\nThe first pillar is increasing our integration with multilateral institutions and support of dialogue and preventive diplomacy. This is what motivated New Zealand to seek our current non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.\nThe second pillar is building active measures of conflict prevention and resolution. New Zealand supports efforts to develop consensus-based codes of conduct at sea and in the air to prevent the accidents and miscalculations that can so easily lead to wider conflict.\nThe third pillar is to cooperate to deliver practical security benefits to the region and build familiarity between our militaries. As I have detailed previously, the Asia Pacific is host to a range of security challenges that affect all of us and can be the motivation for our militaries to work closely.\nThe final pillar that will support active conflict resolution and prevention is increasing people-to-people links at all levels across the region.\nAll of these pillars – multilateral integration, confidence building measures, military cooperation and people-to-people links – rest on deep and solid foundations of respect for the rule of law and international norms.\nNew Zealand’s approach to security, and particularly maritime security, is anchored in strong support for international laws of the sea.\nThe pillars I have just outlined support an integrated and prosperous region where conflict and disputes are actively presented and resolved.\nConclusion\nThe New Zealand and China relationship is strong, and we are here today as true strategic partners.\nWhile we don’t always agree, we have much more common ground than disagreements.\nDespite our significant geographical distance apart, I believe that the ocean between the two countries should be viewed as a bridge, rather than a barrier.\nOnce again, I would like to thank my generous hosts here today, the People’s Liberation Army.\n© Scoop Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://Asia.us2.list-manage1.com/subscribe/post?u=8b0255d591085d1f5c2356475&id=6d9617d27d", "http://www.scoop.co.nz/about/terms.html", "http://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Government"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T09:25:08.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
