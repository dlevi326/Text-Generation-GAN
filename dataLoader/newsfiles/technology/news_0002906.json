That is the kind of revolution that is going to happen - universalization of bank accounts,\" he said. \n\nThe event, Bzzwings, offers mentorship and support to aspiring entrepreneurs in implementing and scaling up their ideas. Six startups were shortlisted for the final event, and two got NSRCEL's incubation offer and equity fund of Rs 10 lakh. \n\nYouth mentoring network, The Climbers, won the cash prize of Rs 40,000 and the incubation offer, while chronic disease management platform, Medcync, bagged the second offer. \n\nThe Climber is an online platform that helps students discover and pursue their passions by enabling them to select right career options. It was created by two engineering students, Sameer Ramesh and Mohammad Zeeshan two years ago, after facing the same problems as teenagers. \n\nMedcync was started by two management students, Sowmiya Reddy, Sachin Manishi, and an alumnus of Harvard Medical School, Dr Anupama Gangawati. Having identified chronic disease as a rising epidemic, they built Medcync as a support network for both the doctor and patient community. \n\nNilekani said the number of smartphone users in the country is expected to touch 500 million by 2018 from 150 million presently. With the rise in smartphone sales and corresponding fall in its prices in the country, most of the startup ideas today are into smartphone applications. \"Every business can be re-imagined through a smartphone,\" he said. \n\n\"With the mobile in the new world, the two factor authentication will be your phone and eye. We are working with four vendors who will embed iris cameras in their phones, which are expected to hit the market in the next six months. You can get an Apple Pay experience on every phone,\" Nilekani, also the former chairman of UIDAI, explained. \n\nNilekani also referred to the \"India Stac\" - a six layer application programme interface (API), that uses the smartphone platform. The API's can help in online authentication of identity, opening bank accounts through electronic KYC, digital signature from a mobile phone using Aadhaar authentication, electronic system of documentation, create an interoperable mobile payment system and empower individuals to access their own data.
