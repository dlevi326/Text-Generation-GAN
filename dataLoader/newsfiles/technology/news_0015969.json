The logic: logging in from home is quicker than finding parking.In another part of town, PepsiCo Chairman D Shivakumar reaches his office at 7.30 am with only one objective to beat traffic.With an increasing number of cars on the road, lack of traffic management and limited parking, companies have recognised that commuting to office and getting back home can be a long, tough haul. And they're acting to reduce commuter stress across commercial hubs, especially in and around New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru.Some have relaxed work schedules giving employees greater leeway when it comes to clocking in and out of the office. Others encourage working from home and shared transportation. Some are even taking offices closer to where their employees live so that they can worry less about the commute and focus more on work. When Mumbai-based retailer Future Group consolidated its offices in Vikhroli, 'traffic dynamics' dictated work hours. Bengaluru's SAP Labs doesn't monitor entry and exit timings employees decide when to get to work and leave. When PricewaterhouseCoopers India decided to open its third office in Mumbai, it chose the city's western suburb of Goregaon. In the National Capital region, the global consultancy firm is identifying a location at Noida. \"At the end of the day, we want our employees to maintain a work-life balance. Otherwise, it will impact their productivity,\" PwC India human capital leader Jagjit Singh said. According to a survey by Ford in India, 97% of the respondents were stressed out about bumper-to-bumper traffic, a fear of accidents and in some cases, even parking hassles. Almost half the drivers on Indian roads - more than in any other country covered in the Ford survey - spent about 12 hours every week, or about 100 minutes every day, in their cars.The local units of Coca-Cola and Sapient have introduced flexi work hours that help employees avoid rush-hour traffic. \"We start 30 minutes early at 8:30 am and close by 5:15 pm in order to beat the peak traffic hours,\" said Sameer Wadhawan, vice president for human resources & services at Coca-Cola. Bacardi, American Express, Ericsson, Samsung and Amway, which are headquartered in Gurgaon, have introduced flexi timings. \"Traffic in Gurgaon is a big challenge,\" said Bacardi managing director Vijay Subramaniam. \"We have had to resort to means such as three work timing slots in a day, encouraging working from home and car pooling to drive around this issue... We encourage members to use the metro, too.\"According to HR consultant Mercer, Indian employers are realising the issue of rising traffic and becoming more open to offering flexibility to the staff. \"In the last one year or so, the percentage of Indian employers offering flexi timing to their employees has risen from about 40% to 60 per cent,\" said Kangan S Venkataramani, benefits India leader. CAR-FREE TUESDAYS In the case of Gurgaon, even the authorities are taking steps to ease traffic congestion. In a pilot project by the traffic police starting later this month, some of Gurgaon's busiest office areas, including Cyber City, Golf Course Road and Cyber Park, will be turned into car-free zones every Tuesday. The authorities will run additional buses to help commuters.\"We are asking all our employees to make maximum use of the increased public transport facility on car-free Tuesdays. The reduction in the number of cars will also help reduce pollution,\" said Sanjay Rishi, president of AmEx South Asia, which has offices on Golf Course Road and Cyber City.Elsewhere in the country, Infosys is promoting options such as buses, cabs and cycles for its more than 1.79 lakh employees. In Pune, Infosys has launched a campaign, \"Ab Bus Karo,\" to encourage employees to take company buses to its development centre. In Bengaluru, the tech major is encouraging employees to cycle to office.In Hyderabad, Microsoft has a fleet of buses for point-topoint pick up and drop of employees within the campus and cabs for home pick up and drop after office hours.SAP allows employees to work from home once a week, a frequency that can be increased by their reporting managers. \"It's about output and not how many hours the employees spend on work,\" a spokesperson for SAP Labs said. At Philips, employees can choose to reach between 8 am and 1 pm. \"When we are aware of road diversions and blocks and advisories about traffic disruptions, employees have the freedom to work from home and head out once the traffic restrictions have eased,\" a Philips spokesperson said. Future Group allows people to come in between 8.30 am and 10.30 am and leave after eight hours of working. Future Group chief people officer Kaustubh Sonalkar said: \"We changed work hours to flexi timings and that gave people lot of relief from traffic.\" KPMG India has an agile working policy, which allows people to \"work from anywhere\" be it a client location or home, provided that the role can be executed virtually and that productivity, performance and timelines are not hampered, said Shalini Pillay, head of people, performance and culture.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T07:44:42.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
