May 2015 report is the last report we have received\".\nP-Notes are instruments issued by registered foreign institutional investors to overseas investors, who wish to invest in the Indian stock markets without registering themselves with market regulator SEBI.\nWhile Bhushan was making his submission, the Attorney General objected saying he had no locus in the matter. Dave said the issue of black money was a sensitive matter and its discussion in public like this is not proper.\nEarlier in the last hearing, noted jurist Ram Jethmalani on whose petition the SIT was constituted, had accused the NDA government and the previous UPA dispensation of failure to bring back black money stashed abroad.\nHe had also attacked the SIT, saying it is \"loaded with people who are loyal to the previous government\". Jethmalani had said the July, 2011 judgement has been frustrated by successive governments which have played a \"grave fraud\" on the nation and the people.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T06:29:13.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
