The project, launched in cooperation with DP World subsidiary Economic Zones World, involves rooftop solar panel mountings on its Jebel Ali free zone buildings and parking sheds, and several of its cruise terminal buildings in Port Rashid.\nThe announcement marks the start of the global ‘Go Green’ campaign, a maritime industry initiative involving five of the world’s largest port operators - DP World, Hutchison Port Holdings Limited, APM Terminals, PSA International and the Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG), who have come together to raise environmental awareness to make a sustainable difference in the communities in which they operate.\nSultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Chairman of DP World, said: “This project supports the Smart Dubai initiative and the vision of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, to transform Dubai into one of the world’s smartest cities through sustainable development.\n“It is a major milestone in promoting the rational use of natural resources and creating innovative solutions that replace traditional energy sources.\n“To secure a healthy sustainable society for future generations, it is necessary to take stock of our energy consumption today. Diversifying our energy mix with renewable resources such as solar power makes a lot of sense in our region where we can harness it all year round.”\nA tender has already been issued for the project and vendor bids will be accepted until October 1, with a final contract expected to be signed by the end of October, 2015.\nDP World hopes to roll out the initiative across its global portfolio in the future.\nFor all the latest on DP World, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:47:52.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
