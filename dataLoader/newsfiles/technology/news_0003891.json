Dementia already affects some 850,000 people in Britain, and a total of 35.6 million worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.\nIt is caused by brain diseases, most commonly Alzheimer's disease, which result in the loss of brain cells and affect memory, thinking, behaviour and the ability to perform everyday activities.\nThere is currently no cure for Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia, and since age is the biggest risk factor, the number of people with dementia is likely to rise as life expectancy increases. \"It's wonderful news that each generation is living longer... but it's important to ensure people can enjoy these extra years in good health,\" said Matthew Norton, Alzheimer's Research UK's head of policy. Mark Dallas, a neuro scientist at Britain's University of Reading who specializes in Alzheimer's, said that as well as the size of the potential problem, this study also highlighted the gaps in research efforts and funds \"The startling numbers of people born this year that will be affected by dementia (put) it on a par with other life-changing diseases,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:25:31.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
