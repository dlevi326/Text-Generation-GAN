Now it also includes \"Ask the Viking.\" This new service provides a mobile version of the college knowledgebase , powered by IntelliResponse . \nThe campus IT organization first adopted IntelliResponse as a self-service feature during the 2012-2013 school year to allow users to access a collection of prepared answers about the college. The new app lets users bring up the same functionality on their Android , iOS and other devices. \nThe service has also been adopted by the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Harvard Extension School among others.
