The next president will then formally take the helm in January.\n(With reporting by Sofia Menchu and Enrique Andres Pretel; Writing by Christine Murray; Editing by Simon Gardner and John Stonestreet)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T14:15:27.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
