By Michael Harris Associate Editor \nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has awarded a $2.9 million contract to Hydro Consulting & Maintenance Services Inc. to replace internal turbine hub linkage components at the 810-MW Lower Granite hydropower plant. \nThe Corps' Walla Walla District most recently sought bids for the work in May after Lower Granite's Unit 1 was blocked to be a fixed-blade runner following the discovery of cracks in the eye end and blade lever link pins. \nHydro Consulting & Maintenance Services will now use Corp-furnished parts to replace linkage components on the Kaplan-type turbine, which was manufactured by Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton, and generator manufactured by Westinghouse. \nThe Corps awarded a contract in 2013 to American Babbitt Bearing Inc. for other turbine rehabilitation work at the project. The district also called for bids in June to build fishway temperature improvements and to replace turbine hub linkage components at Lower Granite. It took information in July on small businesses able to perform fish counting services at Lower Granite -- located on the Snake River in Washington -- and seven other federal hydroelectric projects on the Columbia and Snake rivers. \nHydroWorld.com reported in March that HCMS had won a contract for cavitation repairs at the 58-MW Clarence Cannon hydropower plant in Missouri. \nFor more rehabilitation and upgrade news, visit here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T18:19:46.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
