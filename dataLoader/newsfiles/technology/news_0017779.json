With a bright sleek design, bright screen, and solid build quality, Lenovo is highlighting the slate's entertainment quality with unique multimedia features, such as a pico projector and Dolby Atmos 3D audio tuning.\nPriced at $499 (£326, AU$709), the Yoga Tab 3 Pro has some stiff competition. The Yoga Tab 3 Pro will go up against premium consumer tablets like Apple's iPad Air 2 , Samsung's Galaxy Tab S2 and even Microsoft's Surface 3 , all priced similarly. In the more affordable space, Amazon's Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 has a smaller screen size and a smaller $399 (£260, AU$567) price tag, making it more wallet-friendly. However, none of these offerings can match the multimedia features that Lenovo bundles on the Yoga Tab.\nDesign The Yoga Tab 3 Pro uses the same design language that's found on the Yoga Tablet 2 and the regular, non-Pro version of the Yoga Tab 3. This includes a very slim frame, a barrel on the left edge that houses the speaker, a pop-out kickstand and a pico projector.\nThe barrel design means that the tablet doesn't quite lay flat when you're placing it on a table top. This isn't a big deal in landscape mode, which props the vibrant resolution screen up for a more ergonomic viewing angle, but in portrait the display awkwardly slopes down to the right.\nIn the hands, however, the cylindrical barrel makes it easy to hold the tablet, giving you a nice grip. We're still waiting for Lenovo to provide us with the full specs for weight and measurement for the tablet, but the tablet feels solid, well-constructed and light in my hands-on experience.\nThe pico projector is integrated into the barrel, as is the kickstand located on the back. Before, you had to use force to pry the kickstand open, but now the stand is activated with a simple push button on the rear. Press the button, and the kickstand begins engaging. You can open the kickstand to prop the tablet up on a table, giving it an elevated height, or you can stand the tablet up. Additionally, a small cutout in the kickstand allows users to mount, or hang, the Yoga Tab 3 Pro to wall.\nI like the idea of hanging the tablet, which could be used to mount the tablet in the kitchen for watching videos, or to a wall next to by desk, so I can free up desktop space.\nThe screen is bright and delivers accurately colors. Unlike the cheaper non-Pro versions of the slate, the 10.1-inch screen has a higher QHD resolution, rather than simple HD. Images and videos look fantastic on the display, and I could not make out any pixels on the screen thanks to the high pixel density. Additionally, compared to the 10-inch non-Pro Yoga Tab 3, the Pro model has smaller bezels, giving the tablet a more compact footprint.\nWhile the frame is aluminum, Lenovo opted to use a black, textured material on the back of the tablet. Lenovo describes the material as \"leather-like,\" and I found it to be comfortable. It's a similar design to what Lenovo-owned Motorola Mobility is using on the Moto X smartphones--giving the device a glass front, metal frame and leather back.\nEven though the Lenovo Tab 3 Pro doesn't have genuine leather, the material feels more premium than the slate-like textured finish on the 10-inch Lenovo Tab 3 edition.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/laptops/Lenovo/Lenovo%20IFA%202015%20Announcements/Lenovo%20IFA%202/Lenovo%20Yoga%20Tab%203%20Pro%202-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/laptops/Lenovo/Lenovo%20IFA%202015%20Announcements/Lenovo%20IFA%202/P1011005-650-80.JPG", "http://cdn4.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/laptops/Lenovo/Lenovo%20IFA%202015%20Announcements/Lenovo%20IFA%202/Lenovo%20Yoga%20Tab%203%20Pro%203-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn4.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/laptops/Lenovo/Lenovo%20IFA%202015%20Announcements/Lenovo%20IFA%202/P1010999-320-80.JPG", "http://cdn0.beta.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg", "http://cdn4.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/laptops/Lenovo/Lenovo%20IFA%202015%20Announcements/Lenovo%20IFA%202/Lenovo%20Yoga%20Tab%203%20Pro%203-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/laptops/Lenovo/Lenovo%20IFA%202015%20Announcements/Lenovo%20IFA%202/P1011005-320-80.JPG", "http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/laptops/Lenovo/Lenovo%20IFA%202015%20Announcements/Lenovo%20IFA%202/Lenovo%20Yoga%20Tab%203%20Pro%202-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn4.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/laptops/Lenovo/Lenovo%20IFA%202015%20Announcements/Lenovo%20IFA%202/P1010999-650-80.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-03T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T01:56:22.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
