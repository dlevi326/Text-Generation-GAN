No. 168 Nanhai Avenue (Building No. 7) Haikou Free Trade Zone Haikou , Hainan Province , PRC Dear Sirs: Zhiyuan Li , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Jinpan International Limited (the \"Company\") (\"Mr. Li\" or the \"Chairman\"), and Forebright Smart Connection Technology Limited (\"Forebright\", together with the Chairman, the \"Buyer Group\", \"we\" or \"us\"), are pleased to submit this preliminary non-binding proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company not already owned by the Buyer Group in a going private transaction (the \"Acquisition\"). We believe that our proposal provides an attractive opportunity to the Company's public shareholders. While we have previously made to you a similar proposal on September 21, 2014 and have subsequently withdrawn such proposal due to various reasons, including changes in market conditions, we have re-evaluated the Acquisition and are fully prepared to pursue the Acquisition on a highly expedited basis. 1. The Acquisition. The Buyer Group will form an acquisition vehicle for the purpose of implementing the Acquisition. The Acquisition will be in the form of a merger of the Company with the acquisition vehicle. You should be aware that the Chairman who owns shares of the Company is interested only in pursuing this Acquisition and is not interested in selling his shares in any other transaction involving the Company. 2. Purchase Price. Based on the information available to us, we are prepared to pay US$4.50 in cash per common share in the Acquisition, in each case other than for shares held by the Buyer Group that may be rolled over to the surviving company of the Acquisition. Our proposal represents a premium of 24.3% to the Company's closing price on September 14, 2015 and a premium of 23.3% and 16.6% to the volume-weighted average closing price during the last 5 and 20 trading days, respectively. 3. Closing Certainty and Funding. We believe that we offer a high degree of closing certainty and are well positioned to negotiate and complete the proposed Acquisition on an expedited basis. We intend to finance the proposed Acquisition with a combination of debt and equity capital and we expect definitive commitments for the required debt and equity funding, subject to terms and conditions set forth therein, to be in place when the Definitive Agreements (as defined below) are signed. 4. Due Diligence. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP continues to serve as legal advisor to the Buyer Group. We and our legal advisor have significant experience in structuring and consummating transactions of this nature. We expect to complete due diligence on a highly expedited basis, and are prepared and ready to engage in the next stage of discussions. 5. Definitive Agreements. We are prepared to promptly negotiate and finalize mutually satisfactory definitive agreements with respect to the Acquisition and related transactions (the \"Definitive Agreements\"). The Definitive Agreements will provide for representations, warranties, covenants and conditions which are typical, customary and appropriate for transactions of this type. 6. Process. We recognize that a special committee of independent directors will be formed to evaluate the Acquisition independently before making its determination to endorse it and recommend it to you. Given the involvement of Mr. Li in the Acquisition, we appreciate that the independent members of the Board will proceed to consider the proposed Acquisition and that Mr. Li and his affiliates will recuse themselves from participating in any Board deliberations and decisions related to the Acquisition. 7. Confidentiality. We are sure you will agree that until we have executed Definitive Agreements or terminated our discussions, it is in all parties' interests to ensure that we proceed in a strictly confidential manner, unless otherwise required by law. 8.
