The earthquake was the biggest to hit Chile since 2010 and is the largest earthquake to take place anywhere in 2015.\nThe news follows a recent incident, which involved the shutting down of various port operations in the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico to prepare for a storm that was on the way to the Caribbean. \nAn operator of Terminal Puerto Coquimbo said: “Specialised personnel will evaluate the damage caused to the port terminal to then take action necessary to resume normal operations.”\nQuality assurance company GAC said: “A powerful aftershock estimated to be close to 8 on the Richter scale shook the central part of Chile yesterday afternoon (17, September). All ships were again ordered to leave port ahead of a possible tsunami.”\nAccording to the port, the port will remain closed until a damage assessment has been carried out and completed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T18:53:51.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
