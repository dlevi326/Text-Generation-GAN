La Monica"], "text": "By Paul R. La Monica @lamonicabuzz E-books make self-publishing easy The final chapter for Barnes & Noble's corporate history has yet to be written. But the bookseller's recent performance is scarier than a Stephen King novel. \nShares of Barnes & Noble ( BKS ) plunged nearly 30% on Wednesday after the company reported a surprise loss of $34.9 million, a wider loss than the same period a year ago. (The stock rebounded 4% on Thursday but is still down 20% this year.) \nSales fell 1.5% from the same period last year. It was the fifth quarter in a row that revenue was lower than the previous year. The company is continuing to close stores. \nThe reasons for Barnes & Noble's woes are fairly obvious: a shift to online sales for physical books and the increased popularity of digital books and e-readers and tablets, such as Amazon's Kindle and Apple's iPad.. \nAmazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) is eating Barnes & Noble's lunch and has been doing so for years. The rise of Amazon is one of the factors behind the 2011 closure of former Barnes & Noble rival Borders. And Apple's ( AAPL , Tech30 ) iBooks mobile app has been steadily gaining market share too. \nRelated: Microsoft loses $238 million on Nook stake \nBarnes & Noble has tried to become a bigger player in digital. But its Nook e-reader has been a flop, adding to the company's woes. Sales in its Nook business fell more than 22% from a year ago -- with device revenue falling 6% and content sales plunging 28%. \nMicrosoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) once had high hopes for the Nook. It invested in the business in 2012 but sold its stake back to Barnes & Noble last December. \nSo what's next for Barnes & Noble? It isn't in danger of succumbing to Borders' fate just yet. The company has no debt and a decent amount of cash. \nAnd even though the latest Nook results were a disaster, physical book sales were decent in the last quarter. \nSame-store sales of books, excluding Nook, rose 1% -- thanks to the releases of Harper Lee's \"Go Set a Watchman\" -- the eagerly awaited \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" sequel -- and \"Grey\" from E.L.. James. \nRelated: 'Go Set a Watchman' sells more than 1.1 million copies in its first week \nThis shows that when there are hot titles on the market, people will go to Barnes & Noble for them. \nWall Street may also be willing to give Barnes & Noble some time to try and fix things now that it has a new CEO. \nRonald Boire, formerly the head of Sears Canada ( SRSC ) , just joined Barnes & Noble as CEO. In fact, Wednesday was only his second day on the job. So much for a warm welcome from investors! \nThe company also should have some more financial flexibility following its decision to spin-off its college bookstore business. Barnes & Noble Education ( BNED ) began trading as a separate public company last month. (Barnes & Noble had originally planned to spin-off Nook but changed its mind in favor of the education spin-off.) \nBut Barnes & Noble won't have forever to turn things around. \nNeil Saunders, CEO of Conlumino, a research firm focusing on the retail industry, wrote in a report that the new management team now faces the difficult task of figuring out if more stores need to be closed. Saunders also said Boire must come up with a \"coherent digital strategy.\" \n\"These determinations are ones that need to be made quickly and prudently if B&N is to survive over the longer term,\" Saunders added. \nIn other words, Nook must be fixed. Fast. \nIf not, then you might hear more people whispering about whether Barnes & Noble will be the next Borders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:34:10.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
