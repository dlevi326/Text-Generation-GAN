Running on solar power during the day and biogas or biofuel at night, the AORA Tulip provides grid stable, clean and green power 24 hours a day in all weather. \nAORA Solar has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Arizona State University LightWorks, Addis Ababa Science and Technology University (AASTU) and Adama Science and Technology University (ASTU). \nThe goal is to promote academic cooperation for the development and advancement of renewable energy technologies to support the implementation of Ethiopia's Climate Resilient Green Economy Strategy. This strategy aims to transform Ethiopia into a carbon-neutral middle-income country by 2025. \nThe MoU seeks to expand the three academic institutions' common interest in promoting mutual cooperation in the area of education and research. Activities will take place under the guidance of the Ethiopian Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Energy and the Ethiopian Ministry of Science and Technology. \n\"When it comes to developing renewable energy technology for Africa, collaboration is the key to innovation,\" said Zev Rosenzweig, CEO of AORA. \"We are pleased to work with these three leading institutions to support the training and scientific development of new renewable initiatives. With the support of the local academic infrastructure, AORA's technical know-how has the potential to improve the economy and the sustainable livelihoods of Ethiopians.\" \nCollaboration will include joint activities for research park development, in addition to the development and strengthening of renewable energy curricula for solar electric, solar thermal, photovoltaics, wind, and sustainable fuel technologies. The cooperation also aims to lay the groundwork for the installation of AORA's solar-biogas hybrid power technology at both Ethiopian institutions. \n\"Our ongoing engagement with AORA Solar illustrates our commitment to conducting use-inspired research, engaging globally, valuing entrepreneurship and providing students with the necessary skills and knowledge to affect a transition to a sustainable world,\" said Gary Dirks director of LightWorks and director of the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability at ASU. \n\"This collaboration has great potential to enhance the lives of Ethiopians and to expand the horizons and expertise of ASU, AASTU, and ASTU students and faculty.\" \nAORA's solar-hybrid technology is uniquely suited for off-grid locations in Africa, a region blessed with great solar resources. Running on solar power during the day and biogas or biofuel at night, the AORA Tulip provides grid stable, clean and green power 24 hours a day in all weather. Requiring minimal investment and land, each Tulip provides 100 kW of electricity and an additional 170 kW of usable thermal power for a variety of applications, such as heating and absorption chiller cooling for domestic, entrepreneurial or industrial use. \n\"ASTU is dedicated to merging academia with real-world applications, and our new Research Park is serving as a catalyst for both regional and national economic growth,\" said Prof. Jang Gyu Lee, President of ASTU. \"We look forward to joining forces with AORA, ASU and AASTU to promote renewable energy collaboration for Africa that can lead to job creation and local energy independence in Ethiopia.\" \nDr. Nurelegne Tefera, President of Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, said, \"As a leading technology institute in Ethiopia, AASTU is focused on advancing innovative research and technology transfer to foster social and economic development of the country. We are pleased to join this important initiative and play a central role in advancing renewable technologies.\" .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T16:33:14.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
