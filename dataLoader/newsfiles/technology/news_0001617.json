Four more countries in the Asian region will go live early next year, nominated as South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Once launched, online users will be able to subscribe to Netflix and access a curated selection of TV shows and movies in high-definition or Ultra HD 4K on nearly any internet-connected screen. \"The combination of increasing Internet speeds and ubiquity of connected devices provides consumers with the anytime, anywhere ability to enjoy their favorite TV shows and movies on the Netflix service,\" said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. \"These four markets well represent those trends.\" China has yet to be flagged as a Netflix destination but industry speculation has suggested that Netflix has held talks with Wasu Media, a company that Alibaba founder Jack Ma has invested in. It is understood to be looking at ways of entering China, where there are large local incumbents and a protectionist government. The Asian service will operate on smart TVs, tablets and smartphones, computers and a range of internet-capable game consoles and set-top boxes. Details on pricing, programming and supported devices are to be unveiled closer to the launch. Netflix’s launch in Japan was with Japanese carrier, Softbank and Netflix was pre-installed on the phones it was selling. Netflix opened an office in Japan and soon will land another one in Singapore. The branches hope to improve the company's coordination with its local markets. On launch in Singapore, the U.S streaming giant will go up against SingTel’s VoD service Hooq. Hooq has also launched through Asia in the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand and offers an offline viewing options for downloaded content. Netflix launched in Australia in April and around 2.2 million Australians aged 14+ now have access to the video on-demand service. Based on current growth rates Netflix will be in one in every 10 Australian homes this month and pass the one-million-home mark in October. Netflix is the world’s leading Internet TV network with over 65 million members in over 50 countries. \nCombiTel \nSpecialist IPTV systems integrator focusing on service providers and enterprises.
