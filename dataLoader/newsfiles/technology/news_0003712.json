Or anywhere. Fox 2 Detroit screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET Science has taught us so much.\nThe only sad part is that sometimes it teaches us the hard way.\nThis is entirely our fault. We might learn something at school, but we forget that most of it actually applies in our real lives.\nA beautiful, mesmeric example comes from Michigan. I present a man who was filling his tank at a Mobil gas station when he noticed a spider crawling around his fuel tank.\nSome people are afraid of spiders. Some -- and I know one -- can't even look at food that has legs or tentacles when it's placed before them at the nicest restaurants.\nThe man in Center Line, Michigan, however, decided there was only one way to fight his fear. He took out his lighter and decided to burn the spider until it could crawl no more.\nThose who have taken any science classes -- or, indeed, merely lived beyond five years of age -- know that placing a naked flame near gasoline isn't the wisest of moves.\nMore Technically Incorrect I knew there was water on Mars months ago, says Ridley Scott Google teaching self-driving cars to drive like humans Cell phone video shows man didn't assault cops -- even though phone mysteriously disappeared Susan Adams, who works at the gas station told Fox 2 Detroit : \"He didn't have a cigarette. He didn't have anything on him. So all of a sudden I looked out and I seen flames.\"\nAt least she kept her wits about her. At least she actually had some. She hit the button that shuts off the flow of gas to the pumps. Meanwhile, the man rushed around the car, somehow stunned that these flames might have something to do with him.\n\"He was sorry,\" Adams said. \"He said he didn't know. It's just one of those things that happen -- stupidity.\" She also said she explained to him: \"Gas go boom.\"\nWe all have areas in our heads that house a stunning lack of knowledge of one subject or another. In this case, the man did grab an extinguisher and put out the fire.\nHis car reportedly escaped largely unhurt. There is no word on the spider.", "external_links": ["http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/24780872-story", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/56lFhpByO2s", "http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/29/0afcdc79-5696-4ba9-ba68-43df5693be77/resize/570xauto/e278be77f9cf485ab187f7c954b0db1f/flames5.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T06:15:51.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
