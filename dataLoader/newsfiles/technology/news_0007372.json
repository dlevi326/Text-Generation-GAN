But there was nothing else to talk about; the mighty Boks had lost to the men of Japan.\nMy friend tells me that people were crying in the location. My other friend drowned his sorrows with single malt and slept for eight hours straight. When he got up he complained that his mouth was still dry and he had a few more before retiring grumpily to the jacuzzi. The braai on Sunday did not happen as planned and everyone ate their Dagwood in silence...with a scotch.\nBut what a beautiful game of rugby! The Bokke were tested and found lacking in the intelligence department. Eddie Jones, you bugger! The Mighty Cherry Blossoms had the same attack plans as the Boks, the same defense plans and the same game plan. The Bokke just miscalculated how hard and fast the Japs were going to come at them. We were driven back in the tackles and on many occasions the fast and powerful Bokke found their shoelaces tied by a badger in red stripes.\nTowards the end and in injury time I was willing the brave and clever Japanese (some of whom were sent here to learn to play rugby) to win. Yes, I am unrepentant: I love their heart and guts and determination to WIN! Something we have taken for granted and forgotten about as of late. They worked for it, played for each other and thoroughly deserved it. And mark my words: South Africa will very soon not be the only “big” scalp on their wall. These fellas are going places and I think they can Beat Scotland on Wednesday. Why? Because they are playing Bok rugby.\nI cry for you, Bok squad. If Heyneke was praying for a miracle he certainly got it. You were out-thought and out-done by a coach and a team who dedicated the last four years to beating you; and they did. You spent four years trying to beat the All Blacks and now Japan has showed us how to approach it because Eddie Jones has had to play his ace in the opening match.\nStop crying, Bokke. If you have learned anything and if you have the wisdom you can become the most respected World Champions in the history of the game in 2015. As His Royal Highness said: “Game on!”.\n...and good luck to Heynecke and Fikile who were both shown up. It will be no thanks to them and so it is now up to the Bokke. Will the REAL Bokke please stand up. It is time to be counted and if you think you don’t belong then now is a good time to excuse yourselves while the men work.\nJonas Barbarossa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T20:03:51.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
