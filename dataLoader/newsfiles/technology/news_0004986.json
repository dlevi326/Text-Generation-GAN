Papal spokesperson Federico Lombardi told reporters that Francis had intended to meet with dissidents, but things had not worked out.\nThe opposition denounced scores of short-term detentions to prevent dissidents from attending papal masses.\nFrancis was the third pope to visit Cuba, after John Paul II in 1998 and Benedict XVI in 2012.\nHighlights of the pontiff's US trip will include the canonisation of Junipero Serra, a controversial 18th century missionary who established churches across California; speeches to Congress and the United Nations; a mass in New York's Madison Square Garden; and a visit to the Ground Zero Memorial.\nFrancis is also due to meet with the homeless in Washington, migrant families in New York, and prison inmates in Philadelphia, where he will close the World Meeting of Families, before flying back to Rome September 27.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T22:04:56.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
