To learn more and to register please visit: icmi.com/Contact-Center-Demo-Conference The research, Understanding Modern Contact Center Metrics, was developed after an industry wide survey of customer management professionals. The results highlight how the contact center industry has changed significantly over the last decade due to new channel offerings, shifting business priorities and underlying technologies. As such, the need for new and effective metrics is critical for organizations to align their strategic goals with contact center KPIs to deliver improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. ICMI and Five9 conducted the survey with the goal of providing contact center professionals with the data, benchmarks, best practices and case studies they need to implement metrics that will enable them to more effectively run their contact centers. \"New contact channels and the growing expectations of customers have transformed the customer management industry,\" says Justin Robbins , senior analyst for ICMI. \"It is essential that the metrics used to measure performance as well as other aspects of contact centers recognize modernization.\" The research found that contact channels and customer expectations have evolved and a new set of metrics and benchmarks are required to effectively run the modern contact center. Key findings in support of this included: Research shows 39% of contact center leaders recognize that they struggle with identifying and measuring performance. 83% of contact centers measure their accessibility. (The degree of ease a customer has in reaching them.) 60% of organizations have increased their focus on contact center efficiency in the past year. 65% of contact centers measure their efficiency. Customer satisfaction is believed by the largest percentage of contact center leaders (37%) to be the best measure of agent productivity. \"We recognize that many leaders struggle with identifying and measuring performance within their contact center. We partner with enterprises to help them identify the most critical measurements they need to increase efficiency and performance that a modern contact center requires. The momentum for cloud contact center software is being driven by these needs,\" said Mike Burkland , President and CEO for Five9. ICMI's Guide to Contact Center Metrics (First Edition) For a deeper dive into all findings through the research conducted my ICMI and Five9, hardcopies of the book and the eBook will be available beginning October 21 during the ICMI Contact Center Demo & Conference.
