Case study: Philips takes agile approach to building bridges between business and IT Download Current Issue \nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) should consider the impact on privacy and transatlantic trading should it rule against the validity of the Safe Harbour Agreement on 6 October 2015, US diplomats have warned. \nThe future of the agreement, which is used to govern the transfer of European citizens’ data to the US, has been called into question by the ECJ’s Advocate General, Yves Bots, who opined on 23 September that it fails to provide “adequate protection” for users’ information. \nHis opinion on the matter was prompted by a complaint made by Austrian Facebook user Max Schrems to the Irish Data Protection Authority (IDPA) about the protections afforded to his personal data once it reaches the social networking giant’s US-based servers. \nIn the wake of the 2013 NSA Prism surveillance scandal , Schrems argued that it cannot be assumed any data that passes from Europe across the pond will not be subjected to the alleged surveillance activities of the US government. \nThe IDPA rejected Schrems ’s claims, and in response he took his fight to the Irish High Court, which referred it on to the ECJ, which has now confirmed that it will give its final judgement on the case on 6 October 2015 . What ’ s in store for the future of Safe Harbour? \nThe uncertainty surrounding the future of Safe Harbour has led to speculation about how the 4,410 companies that use it to move EU users’ data would continue to operate. \nTo side-step the issue, Schrems previously speculated that the removal of Safe Harbour could lead to many of the tech firms that have signed up to the agreement to build European datacentres, so their users ’ data doesn ’ t have to pass to the US. \nAs such, the US Mission to the European Union has aired concerns in the wake of Bots ’s comments – which are legally non-binding – about the economic and privacy impact if the agreement was to end. \nIt also accuses Bots of misinterpreting the ongoing work between the US and Europe to “strengthen” the Safe Harbour agreement as a sign it is not fit for purpose. \n“On the contrary, the framework was conceived as a living document, and this is not the first time the two sides have engaged to improve its operation. On both sides, there has been a strong desire to make sure that we improve the framework, and these efforts should be encouraged,” the US Mission said in a statement. \nFurthermore, it has also taken issue with Bots ’s decision to base his opinion on the facts as presented to the Irish High Court regarding the US government’s alleged surveillance activities.
