The newly created group will be led by industry leader John Grannis , who recently served as a member of the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) Risk Management Supervision and Federal Examination teams. EFRA will provide a wide range of services to help clients manage the increasingly complex regulatory environment - including CCAR, CLAR, liquidity stress testing, contingency funding planning, capital planning and capital policies, Basel III compliance, Dodd Frank, Volcker and more.\nWhile serving as Federal Reserve System Governor, Susan Schmidt Bies presented her speech, A Bank Supervisor's Perspective on Enterprise Risk Management at the Enterprise Risk Management Roundtable, stating, \"At the Federal Reserve, we believe that all banking organizations need good risk management. An enterprise-wide approach is appropriate for setting objectives across the organization, instilling an enterprise-wide culture, and ensuring that key activities and risks are being monitored regularly. Senior management must be involved in ERM, since they are the ones who decide the level and types of risk the organization is comfortable with accepting and what controls and risk mitigants will be employed to ensure that risk exposures stay within the agreed-upon levels.\"\n\"Banks today are facing unprecedented regulatory pressure. Timely and accurate response to increasingly complex federal requirements is paramount to every bank officer. EFRA is uniquely positioned to help regulated entities simplify compliance, effectively understand and efficiently implement global and national regulatory directives,\" says Exzac Financial Risk Advisory President John Grannis .\n\"Since the 2008 financial crisis, regulators have increasingly scrutinized the qualitative aspect of risk management and governance across the banking industry,\" adds Grannis. \"Studies show that 80% of financial services firms say their governance, risk and compliance processes are not integrated across their enterprise. Institutions that take a pro-active approach to strengthening their risk management processes will reduce risk, and in the long run will save money and lower overall risk liability. EFRA provides valuable support to help these firms reach their goals faster and more cost effectively.\"\nMatrix-Exzac CEO Renan Levy says, \"The banking industry and the capital markets need comprehensive Compliance and Risk Mitigation services and expert guidance to continue growing. We are excited to expand our compliance offerings with the addition of expert Financial Risk Advisory Services as an extension of our ongoing commitment to delivering quality timely business and technology solutions to the financial industry.\"\nThe EFRA team is now scheduling expert Risk Assessment evaluations.
