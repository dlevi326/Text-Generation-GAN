As continued growth in subscriber demand for the mobile internet drives new rounds of network densification, the behind-the-scenes matter of small-cell backhaul has become increasingly important — and challenging. Nokia’s partnership approach to backhaul is designed to support its customers with a wide range of innovative, trusted, and best-in-class solutions that can be tailored to specific operator needs and preferences while delivering the performance gains required in this key element of the network. \nNon-line-of-sight (NLoS) backhaul solutions, in particular, are becoming much more critical to success as operators increase radio infrastructure density to meet concentrated demand in urban areas. Mobile network planners report that the majority of these target deployment sites are difficult if not impossible to reach cost-effectively with fiber or line-of-sight (LoS) wireless backhaul. Unfortunately, early industry attempts at NLoS backhaul have disappointed, given implementations incapable of handling the simultaneous challenges of severe multipath, pervasive interference, and constantly changing conditions inherent to the application. Unreliable, low performance in real-world NLoS trials left many operators deeply concerned about the viability of the entire solution category — and without a practical backhaul solution for a good portion of their deployment plans. \nOver the past year Tarana has addressed this issue, by showing in a number of tier 1 operator trials that an expertly-designed combination of many antennas, ample dedicated processing power, a suite of advanced algorithms, and highly efficient physical implementation can maintain full-rate links with perfect reliability in a wide range of completely-blocked and rapidly-changing urban conditions. (See links below for details.) Tarana’s NLoS products are now playing a key role in network enhancement projects all over the world. \n“LTE networks have matured to a level where small cells are now being deployed by the thousands to support higher-density mobile traffic,” noted Joe Madden, Principal Analyst with Mobile Experts. “Many urban centers pose difficult challenges for fiber and LoS wireless backhaul, so NLoS solutions are now critical. Operators need high throughput, strong interference rejection, and a commitment to reliability and easy deployment from their backhaul vendors in order to scale up the mobile HetNet.” \nVittorio Tagliabue, Head of Microwave Transport Partner Business at Nokia Networks, confirmed, “Our mobile operator customers are looking for reliable ingredients to implement their small cell strategies. It is essential for them to get the microwave backhaul right. Tarana’s NLoS and point-to-multipoint backhaul technology offers the required fundamental advances in the category. This is a good example of how we extend our backhaul portfolio with a partner product that we have certified for quality and security.” \nSteve Sifferman, Tarana’s CEO, added, “Nokia Networks’ Microwave Backhaul Ecosystem is a win for everyone: more mobile operators can get the NLoS performance they need, Nokia Networks gets to market quickly with a complete solution, and we get to engage in broader application of our innovations. We’re honored to become part of Nokia Networks’’extended family’ through this initiative.” \nFor more information about Tarana’s unique technology and wireless transport solutions, please visit www.taranawireless.com .

Effective solutions must be tailored closely to each application, drawing from a broad range of technologies and configurations. Nokia Networks has established its Microwave Backhaul Ecosystem to ensure customers have ready access to a complete portfolio of best-in-class, trusted solutions across that wide range of alternatives. Partners in the ecosystem cover spectrum from 2 to 80 GHz, links from pure line of sight to true NLoS, both IP- and TDM-based connectivity, and a full complement of physical packaging options. All solutions in the portfolio are certified by Nokia Networks and integrated into its NetAct management system.
