Dutch coffee, tea company to use Amber Road Jacobs Douwe Egberts, owner of Maxwell House and Tassimo brands, will use Amber Road's restricted party screening solution to being automating its trade compliance process. By Eric Johnson | Wednesday, September 09, 2015 The Dutch coffee and tea company Jacobs Douwe Egberts has signed a contract with global trade management software provider Amber Road to automate the company’s restricted party screening process. Jacobs Douwe Egberts will use Amber Road’s automated restricted party screening (RPS) solution as part of its process to develop a global corporate compliance strategy. The company targeted restricted party screening as the first step towards comprehensive protection. The company holds market-leading positions in the coffee and tea business in 18 countries globally, as well as a strong emerging market presence, and thus is connected to hundreds of thousands of trading partner entities. Among its more than 30 brands are Maxwell House and Tassimo. The Amber Road solution will batch-upload all those entities and automatically screen for potential matches against more than 300 restricted party lists. The entities will then be monitored against changes in any of the lists. As new trading partners are added, users will be able to activate ad-hoc and batch screening of the new entities. The restricted party screening solution is part of Amber Road's broader Export On-Demand solution. \"With several of the largest coffee companies in the world already Amber Road customers, we've built a close understanding of the global coffee and tea business, and the specific issues they face in terms of global trade compliance and management,” said Jim Preuninger, chief executive officer of Amber Road.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T05:30:07.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
