Under the new agreement, Telit grants FAU’s Institute for Sensing and Embedded Network Systems Engineering (I-SENSE) technical support, training and an unlimited license to the deviceWISE IoT Platform – aimed at accelerating breakthrough research projects and technology solutions for the Internet of Things. deviceWISE has already been integrated into several I-SENSE projects, with more on the horizon. With the deviceWISE foundation, I-SENSE researchers will lend their expertise to several of Telit’s upcoming initiatives. \n“FAU provides an excellent venue for creating advancements in IoT technology through I-SENSE, providing a higher education environment that blends classroom education, academic research, and industry,” said Fred Yentz, CEO of Telit IoT Platforms. “Telit is delighted to give back to our neighboring state university by providing staff and students with a real-world commercial IoT platform.” \n“Partnering with Telit increases our capacity to pursue FAU’s vision of excellence in sensing and smart systems,” said Jason Hallstrom, Director of I-SENSE. “We’ve found a great collaborator right in our backyard. Telit technologies have been at the heart of our programs for years, and we couldn’t be more pleased to have them as a partner.” \nTelit and FAU will share their vision for the Internet of Things tomorrow evening at “It’s Academic with IoT” , a public IoT information event hosted by the South Florida Technology Alliance (SFTA) on the FAU campus in Boca Raton, FL. \nI-SENSE was established to coordinate FAU's activities in the Sensing and Smart Systems pillar of its Strategic Plan for the Race to Excellence. The institute serves as a technology clearinghouse for sensing, communication, and data management technologies, providing relevant expertise and engineering support. Equally important, it serves as an interdisciplinary hub, cultivating research, education, and service initiatives that cut across disciplines, academia, and industry. \nThe Cloud-based Telit deviceWISE IoT Platform is an end-to-end solution that makes it easy to connect and manage “things-to-apps”– seamlessly integrating remote sensors, devices, and production assets with web-based, mobile apps, and enterprise systems, across any wireless network. The comprehensive platform is supported by extensive developer resources and a thriving ecosystem. deviceWISE allows students and makers to rapidly create IoT prototypes, while offering the flexibility necessary to scale to robust research initiatives. \nTelit has been engaged in comprehensive and rewarding relationships with a number of prominent universities and educational institutions for many years. Through a combination of internships, special project grants, memberships in their respective research centers, and sponsored studies, the company gains exposure to relevant leading-edge academic research and tomorrow’s top engineering talent. In 2010, Telit, then known as ILS Technology, collaborated with FAU on the “Living Learning Laboratory” in the newly constructed Platinum-Level LEED-Certified Engineering building. The following year, ILS became a technology partner of FAU’s Center for Advanced Knowledge Enablement (CAKE). \nAbout Telit \nTelit (AIM: TCM), is the global leader in Internet of Things (IoT) enablement. The company offers the industry’s broadest portfolio of integrated products and services for end-to-end IoT deployments – including cellular communication modules in all technologies, GNSS, short-to-long range wireless modules, IoT connectivity plans and IoT platform services. Through the IoT Portal, Telit makes IoT onboarding easy, reduces risk, time to market, complexity and costs for asset tracking, remote monitoring and control, telematics, industrial automation and others, across many industries and vertical markets worldwide. \nAbout Florida Atlantic University \nFlorida Atlantic University, established in 1961, officially opened its doors in 1964 as the fifth public university in Florida. Today, the University, with an annual economic impact of $6.3 billion, serves more than 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida. FAU’s world-class teaching and research faculty serves students through 10 colleges: the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, the College of Business, the College for Design and Social Inquiry, the College of Education, the College of Engineering and Computer Science, the Graduate College, the Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College, the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing and the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. FAU is ranked as a High Research Activity institution by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The University is placing special focus on the rapid development of critical areas that form the basis of its strategic plan: Healthy aging, biotech, coastal and marine issues, neuroscience, regenerative medicine, informatics, lifespan and the environment. These areas provide opportunities for faculty and students to build upon FAU’s existing strengths in research and scholarship.
