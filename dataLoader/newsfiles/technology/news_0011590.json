He stated, \"The traditional headlight is what is called a fiberoptic headlight. It is a technology that has been around for about a half a century or longer and it has not evolved much at all. What we have done is we have taken this technology and we have turned them into new types of surgical headlights . The battery is clipped to the surgeonâ€™s belt. They are brighter than a car's headlight and they are adjustable. We have created the most intense, single LED headlight in the world.\" \nThe Vice President of Programming of Worldwide Business with kathy ireland, JL Haber was quoted stating, \"Surgery is scary for anyone but knowing that there are innovative tools that make it more successful and allow the surgeons to be more precise makes it a little bit less intimidating.
