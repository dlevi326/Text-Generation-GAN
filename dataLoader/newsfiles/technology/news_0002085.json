The company said it was adding Atmel in part to gain greater scale as it vies for business in a market it estimates at $20 billion by 2019.\nDialog, spun out from Daimler-Benz AG in 2000, has grown to become a specialist in power management for smartphones and other electronic devices, and counts Apple Inc. and Lenovo as customers. It also is working on fast charging technologies. The Atmel deal is designed to add the U.S. company's expertise in microcontrollers designed to enable smartphones to control other devices\nDialog also said it was attracted to Atmel for its work on addressing emerging security concerns involved in linking multiple devices.\n\"Our new, enlarged company will be a diversified, high-growth market leader in mobile power, [Internet of things] and automotive,\" said Dialog Chief Executive Jalal Bagherli.\nIn the transaction, Atmel shareholders would receive $4.65 in cash and 0.112 of a Dialog American depositary share for each Atmel common share, or the equivalent of $10.42, Dialog said, based on Dialog's closing price on Friday. In Nasdaq trading, Atmel's shares fell 2.2% on Friday to $7.27.\nAtmel had signaled it might be considering a sale on Aug. 24, when the company said it was extending the retirement date of Chief Executive Steven Laub through the completion of a strategic review process. Mr. Laub, who had led the company since 2006, had said in May that he would retire on Aug. 31.\nThe combined company would have $2.7 billion in sales and yield earnings growth for Dialog in 2017, the London-based acquirer said.\nDialog expects the transaction to result in annual savings of $150 million within two years. The company will fund the takeover with existing cash, new debt and shares.\nWrite to Sarah Sloat at sarah.sloat@wsj.com and Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"Daimler AG\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE00071\n 20, 2015 12:59 ET (16:59 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007100000", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:30:55.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
