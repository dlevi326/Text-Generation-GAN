Our country must live within its means,\" he said in an address broadcast on radio and television, adding that steps such as tax hikes or more borrowing would drive up inflation and slow the economy.\nThe teachers' strike and threats by other unions of solidarity stoppages has added pressure to Kenya's finances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T09:17:45.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
