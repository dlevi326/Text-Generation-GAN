He didn't elaborate on what the other options besides \"like\" would be.\n \"We've been working on this for a while,\" he said.\nCritical or judgmental Facebook hasn't always thought this was a good idea. According to one engineer's post on the question-and-answer website Quora, Facebook was against any sort of \"dislike\" button because it might discourage people from sharing.\n\"What would often feel playful to the 'disliker' could often feel critical or judgmental to the recipient of the dislike,\" Tom Whitnah, who worked on the feature at Facebook for several years, said in 2012, noting that users can express any opinion they like via the comment feature.\n\"By taking the negative aspect of these comments and cementing it as a prominent interaction, Facebook would be encouraging and facilitating much more negativity than I think users want flowing through their online social community.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:22:10.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
