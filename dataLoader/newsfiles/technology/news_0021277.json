The district partnered with InfoSnap to customize an intuitive online student registration solution, resulting in increased efficiencies and family satisfaction. InfoSnap’s award winning integration with PowerSchool, Amboy’s student information system, generated real-time, on-demand data transfer between the two systems. “More and more schools are embracing the advancement of technology. InfoSnap was recommended to us by our technology consultant and the transition from a paper-based student registration process to an online solution was seamless,” notes Jeff Thake, Superintendent of Schools.\nThe electronic format allows families who have more than one child in the district to ‘snap’ data from one student to another. SmartForm™ technology, an intuitive tool built into the solution, collects relevant data based on previously entered information or choices (grade, activities, medical history, etc.). The data submitted by families is reviewed, polished, and formatted to meet the district’s policies and then delivered into PowerSchool, resulting in up-to-date records on the first day of school.\n“The InfoSnap solution is very user-friendly, so everyone quickly caught on. Families were able to register students from the convenience of their own home. We also set up chrome book stations at our schools for parents who didn’t have internet access,” said Thake.\nThe implementation of InfoSnap increased a number of efficiencies for administrative staff. Registration information was immediately available for each school and staff utilized the robust reporting functionality to generate reports for different departments. “When you move into the 21st century and implement efficient programs that are user-friendly, it creates a highly efficient registration process for all,” said Thake.\nAbout InfoSnap\nInfoSnap®, Inc. is the leading provider of cloud-based registration management solutions, including online Application, Admissions, School Choice/Lottery, New Student Enrollment, Annual Student Registration, and Staff Registration, designed specifically for Pre K-12 independent, charter, and public schools.
