EDCS Power is a Midwest power electronics firm specializing in the design and manufacturing of high efficiency electrical distribution systems for data centers. EDCS Power’s innovative new architecture will enable cloud operators to reach high meter to motherboard electrical efficiency as demonstrated by Facebook™ and other hyperscale cloud providers. The trend among the hyperscale cloud providers is to build their own custom data centers that remove the traditional UPS. These companies discovered that by placing the battery back-up system next to or inside the server racks, they simplify their power distribution system and eliminate needless electrical losses. Although these power saving improvements are well understood, there has been no practical way for the rest of the cloud compute industry to achieve these same levels of electrical efficiency.\nThe importance of EDCS Power’s new power solution is that we enable anyone to have the same streamlined power path as the large hyperscale companies. Additionally we enable the use of low cost commodity compute so specialized hardware is not required. John Meinecke, EDCS Power CEO explains, “What we’ve proven is a power distribution system that brings higher levels of electrical efficiency to commodity IT, with far fewer conversions in the electrical distribution path. We like to call it Facebook™ levels of electrical efficiency for everyone else”.\nTo demonstrate the new power distribution architecture, EDCS Power has partnered with Vaultas, a premier data center operator in Milwaukee. “We’ve been very fortunate to find our partnership with Vaultas as they are dedicated to working with us to showcase these improvements” Meinecke added. Vaultas president, John Unger agrees. “Of course energy saving technology is very welcome, but what EDCS Power has verified, allows some compelling new business flexibilities. For example, this will positively impact PUE and enable offerings we’ve not been able to bring to market. We’re looking forward to presenting these energy savings benefits to cloud operators and continuing to expand on the successes of our cloud businesses”.\nThe installation is now up and running at Vaultas.\nAbout EDCS Power: EDCS is developing a power conversion system for use by data centers that takes AC (alternating current) and converts it to DC (direct current) to offer a more efficient power distribution architecture. There will be substantial savings for cloud scale energy users. The system creates a unique, clean, uninterruptable power supply.\nTo find out more information about EDCS and to join the conversation about direct current visit us online at:\nWebsite: http://www.edcspower.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/EdisonDcSystems\nTwitter: @edcspower\nAbout Vaultas: Vaultas Companies develops, owns and operates public and private IT colocation / data centers, combined with Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BCDR) complexes that include a variety of IT continuity, data and telephony services for businesses of every size – from temporary hot seats to full office suites or a command center available for recovery of any business. Vaultas' IT vendor / carrier neutral environments help drive a reduced total-cost-of-ownership (TCO) to clients by effective use of infrastructure, vendor collaboration, network consolidation and strategic partnering for truly superior data center dynamics.\nTo learn more about Vaultas, visit http://www.vaultas.com or contact Media Contact; Joe Unger @612-709-8699 or at info(at)vaultas(dot)com", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lZGNzcG93ZXIuY29t", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vRWRpc29uRGNTeXN0ZW1z", "http://www.facebook.com/EdisonDcSystems", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy52YXVsdGFzLmNvbQ=="], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T14:33:07.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
