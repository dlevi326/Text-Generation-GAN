Suzuki decided in 2011 to dissolve the alliance and started arbitration proceedings to get Volkswagen to dispose of its Suzuki stake.\nBoth companies said Sunday that an International Chamber of Commerce tribunal determined that Suzuki gave valid notice of termination and that Volkswagen must sell its shares.\nThey also said it found that Suzuki breached the companies' agreement and Volkswagen said it reserves the right to seek damages.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
