GWS's design team brings valuable experience leveraging advanced design and process technology to enable power efficiency gains and footprint reduction in complex power systems. GWS's existing and emerging FET products in combination with Intersil's power controller portfolio, are expected to expand Intersil's addressable market and provide compelling integration opportunities to accelerate innovation in the development of next generation power stages. \"This small but experienced team will be a great asset as we continue to expand our power management capabilities,\" said Mark Downing , senior vice president of corporate strategy and infrastructure power products. \"Intersil's strategy is based on establishing market leadership through the development of highly efficient and highly integrated power management solutions. This acquisition is aligned with that effort and nicely augments our existing team with additional intellectual property and talent.\" \"GWS has differentiated itself through expertise in Lateral Power MOSFET device and processing technology combined with miniature chipscale packaging,\" said Sam Anderson , CEO of Great Wall Semiconductor. \"We have developed important intellectual property that enables energy savings and environmental progess that can now reach a broader set of customers and markets as we become part of Intersil.\" Intersil acquired GWS for initial cash consideration of $19 million , with up to $4 million additional cash consideration based on the achievement of post-closing business metrics through 2016. The acquisition is expected to be neutral to 2015 non-GAAP earnings. About Great Wall Semiconductor Based in Tempe, Arizona , GWS was founded in 2002, and has 10 employees. GWS has been awarded 22 patents related to lateral low voltage power MOSFET technology. The technology has been successfully deployed to enable efficient power conversion in cloud computing, space and mobile applications.
