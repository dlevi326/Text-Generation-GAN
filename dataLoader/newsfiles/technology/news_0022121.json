Good players have failed under him and some players are still struggling with his PHILOSOPHY. He is a manager who has come in and made some awesome signings. A few of which are amongst the most recognisable names in football today. Falcao, Di Maria, Schweinsteiger, Rojo to name just a few. In truth, the team that has been assembled should take on and destroy all comers with names like Mata, Herrera and Rooney. Players who have made a name playing football like the superstars they are.\nNow however, Manchester United are no longer a team to be feared. Teams like Swansea, Watford and Bournemouth look like they can run rings around a team who have dominated the English Premier League since it was formed in the early 1990's. What has gone wrong? After the legend that is Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United has struggled to dominate. Players he bought, nurtured and got the best out of, are now a memory. Welbeck (not a fan but he was a hard worker and had pace), Rafael Da Silva (not the best defender but good going forward and had pace), Chicharito (deadly when on form if given a run of games and had pace), Nani (ball hog but very unpredictable and can shoot equally well with both feet and had loads of pace).\nThis manager is destroying a once great club. A football club with a tradition of players who are legendary and were taken care of by the club because they were a family. The transfer fallout of De Gea was messy and unnecessary. LVG is making everything very public and destroying the legacy that is Manchester United. Very public issues with Valdes and De Gea. Two world class players and surely in the top five or at least top ten shot stoppers in Europe if not the world.\nLVG insists on playing specialist players in the positions they are not adept at playing. Mata is a classic No.10, playing on the right wing. Blind is a midfielder playing as a central defender. Wingers like Depay and Januzaj get played in the No.10 role when they are wingers with pace who can get behind defenders. If we have the players to play the positions they are best at, why play them out of position?\nI have been a Manchester United fan since 1985 when they won the FA Cup 1-0, with 10 men against Everton. I didn't follow them as religiously through the years but I was a supporter none the less. My support grew as I got older and had more access to watching the games.\nI will support my team till the day I go six feet under and nothing will ever change that. Win or lose, good managers or bad, nobody is bigger than the club. Not any player or manager. We the fans are part of the reason that manchester United are a great club and as long as we stand by our club and it's players through good times and bad we will help raise it up to the heights it deserves once again.\nSo in closing I would state that Van Gaal will not be around forever with his screwed up philosophy and we will get another manager who will bring excitement back to the club in the way that they play, scoring goals and raising the roof at Old Trafford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T16:10:42.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
