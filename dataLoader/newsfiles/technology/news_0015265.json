It took a team of expert programmers months of research, experimentation, and over $1M in funding to create 10 Gb GeoQuote: . Just minutes after submitting information to obtain a price Quote: , one of Solveforce's trained and experienced 10 Gb consultants will call to discuss the situation, analyze needs, and give unbiased 10 Gb research. Making an informed decision will be easy and quick with their revolutionary new 10 Gigabit ethernet services ( http://10gigewave.com/ ) shopping system.\n10 Gigabit Ethernet Advantages\nCurrently, the only 10G applications are fiber (with the exception of CX4, which is a 15 meter solution). Speed certainly is the dominating factor. The 10GBASE-T standard, which is now 95% complete, addresses 10G for copper cabling, 55 meters on legacy category 6, 100m on Class F/Category 7 and 100m on a newer variety of category 6 tentatively called augmented category 6 cabling. This cabling and its specifications are addressed through new TIA and ISO/IEC addendums or technical service bulletins. It has been available since January of 2003, though some vendors and others have announced later products.\nThe 10GBASE-T standard is targeted for data centers for the first iterations although anyone is welcome to adopt it. To get a listing, search TechTarget for 10 Gigabit ethernet services ( http://10gigabitethernet.co/ ) and you will see plenty. File sizes are growing gangbusters. By the end of the century, it is estimated that there will be terabyte of data stored for each and every human on earth. No wonder we need faster speeds!\nFor the first time in many years, WAN speeds are faster than LAN speeds due to more affordable pricing and Ethernet becoming pervasive in last mile operations. Since the 10GBASE-T chips are capable of auto-negotiating to lower speeds, it will eventually be the only chip available for electronics and NICs â€“ although some capabilities may be disabled from the manufacturer. It is far cheaper to make one chip for all things than have several varieties.\nThere are some companies that already use 10 Gigabit ethernet services ( http://10-gb.net/ ) to the desktop (fiber only at this point) including companies that work with graphics, CAD/CAM, simulation modeling, etc. With grid computing growing, there are more and better options for moving large amounts of data. When the bandwidth is available, you can be assured that it will be consumed.\nAbout Solveforce\nWe are committed to you in every aspect of the customer relationship. If you need to contact us for any reason, please, don't hesitate to call or email us at your earliest convenience. We will do all in our capacity to respond to your 10 Gb inquiry immediately.\nBy Phone: (888) 765-8301\nBy Email: ron (at) solveforce (dot) com\nWebsite: http://solveforce.com", "external_links": ["http://10-gb.net/", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovLzEwZ2lnYWJpdGV0aGVybmV0LmNvLw==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3NvbHZlZm9yY2UuY29t", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovLzEwZ2lnZXdhdmUuY29tLw==", "http://10gigabitethernet.co/", "http://10gigewave.com/", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovLzEwLWdiLm5ldC8="], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:33:13.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
