Apple is noted for looking at the best innovations of its rivals, then polishing them up and implementing them in Apple products. \nFingerprint identification \nThe iPhone 5s came with fingerprint recognition, allowing you to unlock a secured phone with the tap of a finger. iPhones and iPads can be unlocked using a fingerprint \nThe HP iPaq PPC 5500 PC - released in 2003 - featured a reader strip which had to be swiped to unlock the computer. \nVoice-activated personal assistant Play video \"New iPhone: Show And Tell\" Video: New iPhone: Show And Tell \nSiri is now an important part of the Apple experience, featuring on both the iPhone and iPad, and soon to appear on Apple TV. \nBut now defunct US company Wildfire Communications launched a telephone-based assistant in 1994. \nYou could speak to it and ask it to help you place calls and listen to voicemails. \nTablet computers \nApple revolutionised the tablet industry when it launched the iPad in 2010. \nHowever, the concept of the tablet computer was first realistically floated in 1968, when computer scientist outlined his vision for a portable computer aimed at children. It was never built. \nApple went on to release its first tablet - the Newton MessagePad 100 - in 1993. \nLow power mode \nIn the new iOS 9 software, Apple offers users the option to enter 'low power mode' when battery is low. \nApple trumpets the feature on its website, yet Android users have had the ability to save power in this way for four years. 1 / 10 Gallery: In Pictures: Apple's Big Launch The brand new range of Apple iPhones, featuring new '3D Touch' screen technology, were unveiled at Apple's big launch event in San Francisco \nApple Music \nApple's new music streaming service was launch in June with much fanfare. Users were offered a three-month free trial to get them on board. \nBut Apple is playing catch up: Spotify has been around since 2008, offering full streaming for around Â£10 a month. But other partially on-demand services such as Pandora have been around since 2000. \nNews \nApple's new iOS 9 app is simply called News. \nIt'll bring together the latest stories from publishers around the world, including Sky News. \nBut despite the hype, it's very similar to news aggregators which have been around since the 90s. \niOS Notes \nNotes in iOS 9 are finally fully featured, with check lists, integrated doodling, and image import options. \nBut Google Keep and Evernote already offer these features, and again, Apple is playing catch up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:20:49.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
