In 2012, NASA named the Curiosity rover's landing spot after Yellowknife because of the Northwest Territories capital's link to the exploration of North America's oldest rocks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T13:04:59.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
