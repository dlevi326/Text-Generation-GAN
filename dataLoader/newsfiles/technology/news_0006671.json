According to the developer, Microsoft Edge is currently not protected by it (but by the anti-keylogger and system protection). \nThe program itself runs silently in the background for the most part just like security software such as Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit or Microsoft EMET and will only spring to live when it detects potential threats and displays an alert to the user about them. \nPlease note that you may set the program to ask the user instead of auto-allowing (or denying) applications. This is done in the program interface under Settings > Security > Certified applications. \nYou may turn off each security component that the free version supports individually in the program interface as well. This can be useful if you notice issues with one of them or if you run another program that is protecting the system from certain threats already. \nThe premium version supports several features on top of what the free version offers. It protects against screen captures for instance which can be quite important. Some keyloggers may capture the screen in intervals as well which the free version does not protect against. \nOther features of interest include webcam protection to keep the webcam safe and under your control, sound logger protection to protect against sound-based trojan loggers, as well as full keystroke encryption and system protection. \nClosing Words \nThe lifting of the 32-bit restriction improves the anti-keylogger program significantly considering the popularity of 64-bit on Windows. Keystroke encryption is another nice addition but only if you use one of the four protected browsers. \nYou won't find recent independent reviews of anti-keylogger programs though. Raymond did publish a comparison two years ago but things have changed considerable since then.
