How, he wondered, could they still find their work fulfilling when they might not feel the gratification of seeing results in their lifetimes? \nAlong with the astrophysicists of SETI, Bateman interviewed scientists doing long-term work in fields like cancer research, biodiversity and geology, trying to determine what keeps them motivated even when results may take years to achieve. \nHis findings are instructive for anyone needing to overcome short-terming thinking and work toward a long-term goal. \nFour Categories of Motivation To Spur You On \nBateman found the scientists’ motivations could be slotted into four broad categories: possible futures, possible selves, near-term gratifications and task interest. \nThe first two categories – possible futures and possible selves – address what will happen when the long-term goal is achieved. Scientists often mentioned how their work might impact their children, grandchildren and society in general. Envisioning these possible futures and connecting them to their present work motivated them even when the end goal was only distantly conceivable. Often, that motivation was expressed via allegory or metaphor – i.e. comparing their work in space to the early exploration of the West by American settlers. \nOf course, the scientists, being human, were also motivated by the prospect of individual acclaim. How wonderful it would be, they speculated, if they could be the one to make that big discovery everyone has been waiting for and prove the naysayers wrong. They tended to use terms like “pioneer,” “explorer” and “adventurer” when describing the ideal they were aspiring to, and those self-conceptions provided powerful motivation. \nThe second two categories – near-term gratifications and task interest – address the short-term achievements that provide encouragement and progress in the pursuit of long-term goals. The gratifications could be as simple as getting a positive reaction when discussing their work at a cocktail party or seeing a child’s face light up when hearing about space. Or they could be as significant as solving one piece of the puzzle or learning about a new technology that brings the goal that much closer. \nSuch day-to-day learning experiences are critical to maintaining energy and optimism. Nearly all of the scientists Bateman interviewed found their day-to-day work inherently interesting. Even if they are not achieving their long-term goal, they told him, they are consistently learning new things and exploring new technologies or techniques that will ultimately feed their purpose. \nBuilding these short-term gratifications into your daily life can help you stay motivated and focused on your long-term goals, Bateman said. \n“People can tactically think about these four categories as they consider long-term goals,” he said, suggesting the following set of questions: What would the future hold if I achieve this goal? What would it mean for me personally? How can I build in short-term gratifications? How can I build in and appreciate the most interesting and fulfilling parts of what I do? \nSix Self-Regulation Strategies To Keep You Accountable \nIn addition to the four categories of motivation, Bateman defined six self-regulation strategies key to the scientists’ success and satisfaction in their work. Each can be broadly applied to any personal or professional goal. They include: Goal portfolio: Have a clearly defined set of goals that includes a mix of short-and long-term goals. Feedback: Receive feedback over time and evaluate progress toward your goals. Attention control: Maintain focus on how actions will impact your goals and do not attend to distractions. Motivation control: Elevate the attractiveness of your goal by thinking about how risks and work will pay off. Emotion control: Diminish negative emotions and focus on what you find interesting and amusing in your work. Coping with failure: Use failure as a basis for improvement rather than allowing it to leave you feeling discouraged – or worse, devastated. \nConsciously attending to each of these strategies in your day-to-day work could help make your long-term goals more reachable and make your progress toward that future much more enjoyable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T13:42:35.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
