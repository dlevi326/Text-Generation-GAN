(TAIEX stock code: 2311, NYSE: ASX ) (\" ASE \" or \" we \"), today reiterates our view on the proposed share exchange between Siliconware Precision Industries Co. Ltd (\" SPIL \") and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. (\" Hon Hai \"): 1. ASE is not able to comment on the strategic alliance and vertical integration between SPIL and Hon Hai (\" Hon Hai Strategic Alliance \"), as we do not have knowledge of the specific details of such alliance arrangement, and therefore, there is naturally nothing supporting the claim that ASE expressed objection against the Hon Hai Strategic Alliance and that ASE was interfering with SPIL's operations. 2. However, we believe that SPIL's proposed issuance of new shares through a share exchange with Hon Hai (the \" Hon Hai Share Exchange \") would be dilutive for SPIL's existing shareholders. As we will not be able to exercise our voting rights at SPIL's extraordinary shareholders' meeting scheduled on October 15, 2015 , we expressed to Chairman Lin our objection against the Hon Hai Share Exchange. In practice, there are various ways for companies to enter into strategic alliances with other partners. SPIL did not have to issue a large amount of new shares at a deep discount, thereby diluting all of its shareholders solely for the purpose of entering into a strategic alliance. As such, we sincerely hope that Chairman Lin and SPIL's management team will take into account shareholders' rights and interests when the management seriously re-evaluates whether the Hon Hai Share Exchange was truly necessary and appropriate, and whether the actions to implement the Hon Hai Share Exchange were in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations. 3. ASE reiterates that the content of our Chinese press release and our English press release on Form 6-K released on September 23, 2015 were not inconsistent.
