That’s what just happened at J.C. Penney.\nJohn Tighe, 46, has been named executive vice president and chief merchant at J.C. Penney, following his mentor, Liz Sweney, into the top merchandising role at the Plano-based department store.\n“I recruited John to Penney 13 years ago,” Sweney said Wednesday. “He’s done a great job, and he’s well-prepared.”\nSweney will retire at the end of this year. Tighe moves into his new job Oct. 1 and Sweney will stay on the rest of the year in an advisory role.\n“John is absolutely the right person. It’s a wonderful feeling to know it’s the right time to leave,” she said. “He’s perfect for the job. And Marvin is the right leader for the company.”\nPenney CEO Marvin Ellison started putting his team together in March. At that time, Tighe was promoted to senior general merchandise manager from general merchandise manager men’s. He continued to be over men’s but was also responsible for children’s, footwear and handbags.\nEllison promoted from within after filling some key positions from outside the company.\n“Since joining J. C. Penney, I have been impressed by the level of bench strength that exists among our merchant talent pool,” Ellison said. “John’s positions over the last several years demonstrate the importance of developing high potential leaders for the benefit of succession planning.”\nSweney, 61, joined Penney in February 2000 as president of the women’s apparel division. She came to Penney from one of the company’s big suppliers at the time, Kellwood Co. She has been chief merchant since 2012.\nSweney was among the first outsiders to be hired into a top job at Penney during a turnaround led by Vanessa Castagna and Allen Questrom. Tighe also hails from that era.\nTighe was hired in 2002 as a buyer from May Department Stores. He has experience in almost every Penney department and led jcp.com in 2009 as senior vice president. In 2010, he was named senior vice president and general merchandise manager of the company’s home division before moving to the men’s division in 2012.\nThe succession has been in the works for a while, Sweney said. “The progress that our company has made would not have been possible without the leadership, dedication and expertise of Liz Sweney,” Ellison said. “We are grateful that she will play a critical role guiding this transition through the balance of the year.”\nSweney worked with four CEOs, including Ron Johnson, who tried to reinvent the department store. She also worked through a couple of turnarounds and the recession.\nEllison has talked about merging the art and science of retail and advancing Penney’s use of analytics and allocation software. Sweney said those tools are great for enabling merchants to do their jobs better, but “retail absolutely needs merchandising skills.”\n“Nothing replaces talking with the customer and being able to understand the customer and react to them,” she said. “The store merchant does that.”\nAt department stores and fashion retailers, sometimes the president or the CEO doubles as the chief merchant, “but you still need someone to own the merchandise vision,” said Steve Dennis, president of Dallas-based SageBerry Consulting. Demands are shifting, and merchants have to understand digital sales and analytics, but the heart of the department store is still the product, Dennis said.\nFollow Maria Halkias on Twitter at @MariaHalkias.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:46:53.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
