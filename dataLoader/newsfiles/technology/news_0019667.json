The inaugural IndyIoT ( http://www.indyiot.com ) symposium, hosted by CloudOne, will take place September 24, 2015 from 1p.m. to 5p.m. at the Athenaeum Theatre, 407 E. Michigan Street in Indianapolis. The event will serve as a forum for IT professionals to learn how Indiana is shaping up in the IoT space. According to a recent TCS Global Trend study on IoT, companies predict their IoT budgets will increase year-on-year, with spending expected to grow by 20 percent by 2018. With IoT emerging as the next big destination for investment, many industries are seeking to learn best practices for the development of solutions for building a connected business. IndyIoT will emphasize an understanding of the IoT continuum and organizational framework needed for effective IoT implementation. For instance, deep dive sessions will outline seven architectural elements to consider when launching an IoT initiative, such as: sense and connect; digitize and compute; aggregate; secure; analyze; predict and act.\nAttendees will have the chance to learn from and engage with leading educators, technologists and executives in the field, including: Cummins, Rook Security, Honeywell, Roche, Blue Pillar, Freescale, Indiana University School of Informatics, Indianapolis EMS, CloudOne and Vai Logic. Forrester Research’s Frank Gillett, vice president and principal analyst serving CIOs, will provide the keynote speech.\n“CloudOne is excited to bring together those defining Indiana’s IoT community to exchange ideas and learn best practices in making it easier, faster and more economical to make things for the Internet of Things,” said John McDonald, CEO of CloudOne.\nSupporting organizations for IndyIoT include CloudOne, Vai Logic and Cedar Technology Integration.
