BGR has the news . \n“The Nexus 5X has a 5.2-inch Full HD display (1920 x 1080 resolution at 424ppi), ‘top-line performance, and an all-day battery in a compact, lightweight device that’s ready to take on the day with you,’ the presentation says.” \nBGR adds that other specs include a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, 2GB RAM, 16 0r 32GB internal storage, a 12MP camera, and a 2,700mAh battery. The device will run Android 6.0 Marshmallow and feature a fingerprint sensor. Unlike the iPhone 6s and Galaxy Note 5, it the Nexus 5X will feature dual front stereo speakers. \nWill Google’s new smartphone provide some competition for the iPhone 6s Plus, which has been praised as the best all-around smartphone? [Photo by Daryl Deino] The Google Nexus 5X will hit the market in an already overcrowded smartphone world. In terms of the iPhone, it seems more of a competitor to iPhone 6s Plus than the the regular 6s. Dan Frommer from Quartz is quite impressed with Apple’s latest smartphone. \n“It’s more of an upgrade than I had anticipated. And it has caused me to question the way I buy and own my phone, which has become my primary mobile computer.” \nFrommer notes that the iPhone 6s Plus is impressively fast and that 3D Touch is a great new addition. He also likes the “Live Photos” feature, which takes a couple seconds of video before you actually take the picture. It’s a feature that iPhone fans have come to love. There is no word yet on whether or not the Google Nexus 5X has any similar feature. \nSince the Google Nexus 5X is an Android smartphone, then it is, perhaps, more accurate to compare it to Samsung’s Galaxy Note 5, which has blown away most users and critics. CNET gave Samsung’s latest smartphone a near perfect review. \n“The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 has an eye-catching design, high-end hardware and takes great outdoor photos. Using the stylus has never felt better, and battery life is terrific.” \nCNET praises the fast processor, the great camera, and the build of the device. They think that it’s the S Pen that truly differentiates this device from the others. TechnoBuffalo , however, found a lot to be disappointed in when it comes to the Nexus 5X’s biggest competitor. \n“Samsung ditched the 128GB option with the Galaxy Note 5, though, and will instead only offer 32GB and 64GB flavors. Considering there’s no microSD card slot — another feature we wish it packed — that’s a bit of a bummer,” says author Todd Haselton. \nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 5 has been praised, but some lament the lack of a removable battery that has been the staple of previous Samsung Note devices. [Photo by Ilya S. Savenok / Getty Images] Haselton was also disappointed that Samsung didn’t have a USB-C port, which is set to be the standard on most smartphone, tablet, and laptop devices within the next two years or so. However, the biggest disappointment appears to be the lack of a removable battery — this is what differentiated Samsung from its competitors. \nIt appears that the Google Nexus 5X won’t have a removable battery either, but people didn’t expect one in the first place like they expected one from the Galaxy Note 5. The Google Nexus 5X’s other features may possibly help Google take away some market share from the Galaxy Note 5 and even the iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. Google’s Nexus smartphones have always had a loyal following. Which smartphone would you rather have — the Nexus 5X, Galaxy Note 5, or iPhone 6 Plus?
