The team solution will include an off-the-shelf EHR with the associated services needed to deploy the EHR across the Military Health System. \nThe contract, known as the Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM), is an initiative designed to modernize the military's healthcare system, enabling patients and clinicians to capture and share health data that can improve the continuity and quality of care for those who serve and have served our country and their families. DHMSM will continue the DoD's leadership in using the best healthcare technology, and can help improve medical outcomes and support the medical readiness of the U.S. military. \n\"Clinovations GovHealth is proud to be a part of the Leidos Partnership for Defense Health,\" said Anita Samarth, CEO of Clinovations GovHealth. \"We have a proud tradition supporting federal health IT programs, including for military and veteran agencies, and we fully understand the importance of the DHMSM program and the value it can deliver in improving clinical outcomes for our military. We look forward to working together with the DoD and the rest of the Leidos team to deliver a world class EHR solution; one capable of fully supporting the needs of the men and women who serve as well as their families and beneficiaries.\" \nClinovations GovHealth will support the DHMSM program as part of the Leidos team, providing training and go-live support for the EHR. Specifically, Clinovations GovHealth will provide clinicians, nurses, clinical advisors and clinically-trained technical personnel to help the delivery team ensure the resulting solution is finely tuned for the military's medical environment. \n\"Installing and using an EHR solution isn't a simple undertaking. Healthcare is a unique environment where the software end users aren't trained technologists. Their specialty is care, and because of that, the software should be tailored to their needs, and not the other way around,\" said Dr. Manan Trivedi, Chief Medical Officer for Clinovations GovHealth. \"I served as a battalion surgeon with the Marines, so I know how important it is that the DoD selected a solution can serve the needs of military care providers as well as their patients. I am proud that we will have the opportunity to participate in this mission-critical program.\" \nThe $4.3 billion indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract has a two-year initial ordering period, with two 3-year option periods, and a two-year award term which is earned through successful performance during the previous contract periods. \nAbout Clinovations Government + Health Clinovations Government + Health operates at the intersection of government and private sector healthcare.
