LOUIS , Sept. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- It's back-to-school time across America, but just because classes have already started on traditional campuses doesn't mean it's too late for busy working adults to realize their dreams of a college education this fall. To encourage those aspiring students to take the leap by October 31 , WGU Missouri will award at least five Back-to-School Scholarships . \nThe scholarships, worth up to $2,000 each, will be awarded to five new students who apply this fall to attend the nonprofit, online university. Unlike traditional schools, WGU Missouri starts new terms on the first of every month, so it's not too late to apply for one of WGU's more than 50 bachelor's or master's degree programs in business, IT, K–12 teacher education, or health professions, including nursing. \nTo be considered for these competitive scholarships, prospective students must first be admitted to WGU and then submit a scholarship application at missouri.wgu.edu/backtoschool by October 31 . Applicants must complete an essay about \"My Motivation for Earning a Degree\" and participate in an interview with a scholarship counselor. The scholarship will be applied at the rate of $500 per six-month term, renewable for up to four terms, toward WGU's already-low tuition of about $3,000 per term for most programs. \nWGU Missouri uses an innovative approach to earning a degree called competency-based education, which measures learning rather than time spent in class. Students earn their degrees by demonstrating mastery of the subject matter they need to know to be successful—real-world competencies developed with employer input. Designed to meet the needs of adult learner, competency-based education allows students to take advantage of their knowledge and experience to move quickly through material they already know so they can focus on what they still need to learn. WGU faculty members work one-on-one with students as mentors, offering guidance, support, and individualized instruction. While WGU's degree programs are rigorous and challenging, competency-based learning makes it possible for students to accelerate their programs, saving both time and money. For more information about WGU, visit missouri.wgu.edu . \nWhile multiple scholarships will be awarded, the Back-to-School Scholarship is a competitive program. Scholarships will be awarded based on the student's academic record, previous college experience, readiness for online study, current competency, as well as other considerations. The application deadline is October 31, 2015 .
