More David Gurle’s Symphony takes on Bloomberg \nWell known for his hip-hop inspired photo shoots with scantily clad women and luxury cars, Mr Dotcom had assets including computers, art works, a pink Cadillac and bank accounts holding millions of dollars frozen after the 2012 raid in the hills outside Auckland. \nUS authorities say Mr Dotcom and three co-accused Megaupload executives cost film studios and record companies more than $500m and generated more than $175m by encouraging paying users to store and share copyrighted material, such as movies and TV shows. \n“The US ... took down the entire Megaupload site, went ahead and froze all their assets and did this with great publicity and public fanfare and did it in coordination with the very powerful force in the US, from Hollywood,” said Mr Dotcom’s lawyer, Ira Rothken. \n“We feel as though Kim Dotcom ... will not have a fair procedural playing field because he won’t have any assets with which to mount a defence for the largest copyright case in history.” \nThumbing his nose at US authorities, Mr Dotcom set up a new cloud storage company call Mega after being bailed, but has since distanced himself from the business. \nMonday’s hearing will be watched by developers like Mr Dotcom working in the grey areas of the law prevalent at the Internet’s cutting edge for signs of how far Washington is willing to go to protect US copyright holders, said Tom Pullar-Strecker, who covers technology for Fairfax Media in New Zealand \n“You just have to look at what the US has achieved already through this action. Kim Dotcom’s business, Megaupload, has been destroyed really through simply taking the action,” he said. \n“It had an immediate chilling effect.” \nLunch with the FT: Kim Dotcom \nKim Jong-eun is not the world’s only cartoon villain lobbing verbal hand-grenades at the US from the sanctuary of his hermit kingdom. Kim Dotcom, the internet entrepreneur accused by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) of abetting massive online piracy, fits pretty much the same description. Except his hermit kingdom is Mordor-on-the-Shire, also known as New Zealand. And unlike the North Korean leader, Dotcom is, in the eyes of many, closer to cartoon hero than cartoon baddie. \nContinue reading \nMegaupload accounted for about 4 per cent of total traffic on the Internet in its heyday as users stored and shared files containing everything from wedding videos to Hollywood films. \nSince his arrest, Mr Dotcom, a German national and New Zealand resident, has been barred from leaving the country or venturing more than 80 km (50 miles) from his mansion, and is required to report to police twice a week. \nThe prosecution must prove that a crime was committed in both the US and New Zealand in order to trigger an extradition treaty between the allies. \nIn an opinion submitted in support of Mr Dotcom, Harvard law professor and copyright expert Lawrence Lessig argued that Washington’s case does not meet those requirements. \n“An attempt has been made to extract facts from multiple sources and over a wide span of time, to organise a large number of otherwise disconnected facts by using systematic phraseology and to juxtapose phrases in order to create an impression of coherence and substance,” Mr Lessig wrote. \n“However, the attempt fails to reach its goals.” \nA spokeswoman for the New Zealand Crown Law service declined to comment.
