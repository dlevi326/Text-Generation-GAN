The launch of version 1.0 comes just one month after Ignite was featured in the Apple Store in more than 20 countries worldwide while still in Beta.\n“Ignite comes from a personal need to remove the hassle of unnecessary back-and-forth communication when planning gatherings,” said Founder, Vlad Enache. “Ignite streamlines the planning process while increasing the variety of potentially exciting experiences.”\nWhile most event planning apps start the process only once the details of an event have already been set, Ignite uses a simple unifying concept: Start the planning process at the idea stage. Users can pitch get together ideas and others can follow them. Once they get the desired traction, they can make them happen. Within these ideas they can similarly follow or suggest the best times, locations, create lists or polls, and even chat.\n“We believe this form of testing and validating get-together ideas empowers all of us to get more stuff done, ideas we might otherwise abandon, or worse, we might unnecessarily take a gamble on,” said Enache. “Lack of validation in private gatherings is never pleasant, but for a professional event, the risk of having too few or too many attendees can also lead to monetary losses and unhappy attendees.”\nLook for the Ignite app team’s exhibitor booth at Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt SF on Sept 21st-23rd and DC Techday on Oct. 6th, 2015. Stop by for free prizes.\nDownload Ignite for free as a mobile app for iOS and Android from the App Store and Google Play.
