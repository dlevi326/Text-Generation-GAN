Please note that it requires the Microsoft .Net Framework 4 and that it will only run on Windows Vista and newer versions of Windows as older versions don't support MIC. \nMicEnum displays a list of root drives on start which you can click on to display information about specific folders or files stored on them. \nThere is no search which means that you will have to click your way through the navigational tree to display information about specific files or folders you are interested in. \nThe enumeration may take a moment depending on factors such as the speed of the drive and the resource usage of the computer in general at that time. \nThe integrity level of each file and folder, e.g. Medium or High, is displayed by the program automatically. \nWhile that is certainly useful on its own, for instance to verify these levels, the option to edit integrity levels is what makes MicEnum a mighty useful tool for Windows administrators, developers and even end users. \nA right-click on a file or folder displays a set level context menu option which you can make use of to change the integrity level of the selected object. \nMicEnum can enumerate Registry objects as well. Just switch to the Registry view tab in the application and use it in the same fashion as the default folder view tab. \nAnother interesting feature of the Windows program is the ability to save and load sessions. This saves the entire information information displayed in the interface -- all drives and Registry information -- to an XML file that you can load later on again using the file menu of the program or process otherwise. \nClosing Words \nThe initial release version works really well despite it being version 0.1 of MicEnum. The program can be mighty useful for a variety of things, for instance to find out why you or a program you run cannot access certain files on the system.
