This alone had made me more determined to succeed not just for myself but for the Deaf community as well. Hence my motto in life is to live a purpose driven life, be an example to the lost in the world and to leave a legacy. I was also one of the intelligent lass in school and campus getting distinctions with merit.\nI have been an inspiration to people and I am also a part time model and actress as well as a humanitarian.\nModelling and acting allows me to display my creative side as a skilled craft. I am also talented in Art, dancing and fashion and one day hoping to open an agency.\nDetermined, intelligent and confident – these are all attributes that make Durban’s Jenelle who is an inspiration to those around her. Despite the fact thatJenelle was diagnosed with hearing loss, this has not stopped her from successfully becoming one of South Africa’s most inspiring up and coming models. In the last two years she has been a finalist in the Miss Deaf South Africa pageant 2009/2010; she was awarded the ‘Fresh Look’ title at Miss India South Africa KZN 2010 contest, and recently made the Top 5 and 'Miss photogenic' for the Xtreme Models Search competition in February 2011. “I have always believed that modelling is a stepping stone to something greater for me. I want to motivate those who are both ably hearing and deaf/hard of hearing,” explains Jenelle. Achieving her goals is definitely not a foreign concept to this budding model. She was the first hard of hearing person in her school to pass her Matric with a merit and distinctions, thus enabling her to attend a mainstream college where she passed a national diploma in Business Management. It was this need to inspire and to show people that being deaf is merely an obstacle that led Jenelle to becoming LifeSound’s newest ambassador & ambassador for House Of Tai Tei Lija (cosmestic) and first hard of hearing model in FHM TOP 20 2012\nI have always believes that, “your mind is the most powerful tool or you can do anything you have set your mind to”.\nI volunteered for charity work such as reach for a dream.\nI have appeared on numerous newspapers and magazines.\nTALENT\nMy dance segment is about my life struggle and how I have overcame many challenges. Music is in my heart, I feel its rhythm and I hear with my heart and beneath me. It not only about me, it’s also relates to women who face challenges while reaching to the top. This song *The Climb* by Miley Cyrus (a contemporary dance), it motivate me to overcome life struggle and shine on this platform\nHere are some of my other achievements:\n2nd princess for Miss Beauty Pageant 2000\nFinalist for Miss Deaf KZN 2004\nFinalist for Miss Deaf SA 2009/2010\nFresh Look for Miss India SA KZN 2010\n2nd princess for Miss Deaf KZN 2012\nAppeared in LX seth music video 2010 - *let it go*\nCameo role in Jimmy Gait music video Makekes 2014\nCameo role video in Buffalo Souljah music video Turn up 2014\nTop 5 in Xtreme search Models 2011 and Miss Photogenic 2011\nWas a judge for Miss Summer Heat Semi 2011/2012 and Fashionation casting 2011\nand also for miss/mr mzini pageant 2012\nA Ambassador for Lifesound 2011 smile emoticon\nAmbassador for House Of Tai Tei Lija\nAmbassador for Ralo Cosmetics\nAmbassador for JobvineSA\nCurrently a Mollbabe for Moll Magazine (international magazine)\nFHM top 20 2012 (the one and only hearing impaired model been selected for top fhm 100 from thousands of hearing women and through all the people votes I ended up to top FHM 20, which is my biggest achievement)\nTop 12 for GND (girl next door)\nTop 13 for Face of KZN 2012\nContestant for SA Swimsuit 2013\nContestant for FHM GF (need votes)\n4th Princess for Face of Sutra 2012\nModel of the day for FHM - 31/05/2011\nModel of the day FHM - 11/01/2012\nModel of the day FHM - 12/01/2012\nWinner for KimKardashian LookaLike competition by Supermodels Sa\nOne of the 12 girls in SA men (girl next door calendar)\nIn GETIT magazine nov 11 issue\nWere into fhm world sexiest woman in fhm competition.\nAppeared in international magazine Bikini competition 2014\nInterviewed by international hearing center about my campaign i created \"HearingAidsRock\"\nActed as lead female role as a seductive woman who preys on rich man for money and who then change her heart, named Tessa.\nin movie called *HOME*\nSee trailer : HOME (Official Trailer 2013)\nhttp://m.youtube.com/watch…\nBeing interviewed by DTV (deaf TV)\nSee in youtube : www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLbRIE2ySd8\nFace of Sutra – 4th princess\nSee in youtube: www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCXbxBPoHjs\nCheck a promo video of me near Nelspruit http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMhNnKDWgTc\nMy blog\nmissjenjo.blogspot.com/\nlist of interviews:\nBeauty With A Purpose.

I create beauty with my hands and I radiate beauty from within. I make a fashion statement wherever I go and I always see beauty wherever I go. Life is an experience that brings out the best in me. I triumph when my days are blue because I know my next experience will be much brighter than my worst. I am unique, beautiful, positive , strong-willed lady and above all, I welcome a challenge because thats what makes me who I am and I am an overcomer ..\nHaving achieved all of the above, I believe that I should not plateau but move onto new beginnings.", "external_links": ["http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.looklocal.co.za%2Flooklocal%2Fcontent%2Fen%2Fnorth-durban-and-umhlanga%2Fnorth-durban-and-umhlanga-news-general%3Foid%3D5010036%26sn%3DDetail%26pid%3D1171317%26Deaf-model--overcomes-the-odds&h=vAQHByQgUAQHyDF3cbHK6-gv4ymPtBYbaacWfUirGiyZzFw&enc=AZPFHAnx6Zox0rycTRc6O9pPPNMWyoWLtm1pecD1Z2Ld-uAurzpIH_abwDL2A2jspBa_nbHxQwKyek2p8quumgQ7WlEgEXhJBb9P_RUOhqiCzgkp9GscMw-9kocd3uMZXLvNLKqg1VvJAFCmHoP_Ov45K8t8pglcaXH9ie5HY_6cQNKEjaEOtkoLk3sImULYsys&s=1", "http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fm.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D49EGyn-pyuo%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26desktop_uri%3D%252Fwatch%253Fv%253D49EGyn-pyuo%2526feature%253Dplayer_embedded&h=OAQFgYCrJAQFYOPaD7PCigXXNqVWAPcHxn4wlXwdohb_ZZQ&enc=AZPA5FPhEsmy-d7OBL9fIPQvB3UKRFFu_4OQzPESmPgeQwCcqBcb6428Rmcrr3zEi27fkY4M4eHQoMKOiT-LtknN37-cyNtU742RAR6IaFMKxfizwH56TuD8Mfe69EmJ07Uw6BvFJhsg91Qov9clt5v7R-QQNIu7_Jt181KUqbyBzoQVLyaoNc389eWHcZf2O_8&s=1", "http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoMhNnKDWgTc&h=FAQEsFiL4AQEvpTRFyRezvy8WY79e5hAksACOg-YtaTSUwA&enc=AZME7XBlel23WU-NLJroGC-lVuBbUDgyZ9RHfCYhccnDVLc0pyscze8O-NWRJ-8TU0IUc_6plgmWYrwHLAhnFLVmt1Gh0Q3jsntTUkKMv3ES7ABgByC8rpV8j6UOnZ6qIDEFMMAghjAow1TSMEZh6DL3DRFPMuQLNc7gq6u9rCrgetHVzW5aVZgkaHWIID8vE2g&s=1", "https://www.facebook.com/jenjocaptures", "https://www.facebook.com/hearingaidsrock", "http://www.looklocal.co.za/&hellip;/north-durban-and-umhlanga-news&hellip;", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jenjolicious-Designs/645451448855558", "http://www.pinterest.com/iamjenjo_", "http://m.youtube.com/watch&hellip;", "https://www.facebook.com/jenjo.fhmtop20", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMhNnKDWgTc", "http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzLbRIE2ySd8&h=hAQEMzUBhAQHTvUT53F8Ab21sC0cZoN8HLTAAcIMSteayeQ&enc=AZMyZJV6YUQN7BwxSf37lwaF8plMLvRTkemZUOmR68SVy-DffkCiuiZkPwhSLppi0Y8U3H_BRljEPd8_BCyVJXlRAYsx7a-dPTHvoog3krnxmYZfD3f6xBX-cvHMi9Tl_5tO3D8j3JyKjYWW8LKrIqUbwUe289FMUKW4FGLqHkan_qZwOIWWxo4lIlNT6jOeD-w&s=1", "http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKCXbxBPoHjs&h=lAQGgDbstAQEzEnG_ARkvbf0-2WP3L39tfKUfTV3jwJS2TQ&enc=AZPEjQui4w1u9aHuMnbJGD_VvqINMyhpD9JhgAaur9AY-SgRBwYzuLuQ8YIebGRhCinhA6YURO7NySZe0rpO7hJlwDxdQSnEda72y6v9m1LNzjKNeLyLRcMz3lq0afx7B-JTz1h8sS4K1Ex6-qgHOuXwFDRNJ6bEOqs8EYXPqYCJs7vah9w7xv6Xz77zWvnuhrM&s=1", "http://www.twitter.com/iamjenjo_", "http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.looklocal.co.za%2Flooklocal%2Fcontent%2Fen%2Fnorth-durban-and-umhlanga%2Fnorth-durban-and-umhlanga-news-general%3Foid%3D5917488%26sn%3DDetail%26pid%3D1171317%26Vote-for-uMhlanga-beauty&h=yAQEgtUmSAQEknfUp0wAwpH06HpYaIvsaPXboDjj792V1Yg&enc=AZOrCHwo5uc5_UUVS3MOSy0eqdB6LThNTAPf0caLG8ZEwyPUWCgfxGz6lz2w4giy1JEg-lK5fnE54BLaq9QVF7VS95nAFT_5Td1A8-SZ4xhyKIbRlU8wsHdcvuaoe54PboTlnuGkk2fzXTkXW2xS6i72aQXIm8O6HITQAtlxiagh7RMPDHC3bQQ_roe6gRtWVGQ&s=1", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/charityinsa/", "http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmissjenjo.blogspot.com%2F&h=JAQFA5aPpAQF1NW4FyPuYn3oB7xqyZGBdwrpmu8jZGdIq4A&enc=AZNCbbwrutzYtg3lEpuBiqseWxjJMIgmY9ulSK3SLaD9ea505j0c9o50UdwF_ZE-sFtj40arD-kaY9niPHsMmwyDDndcC5qYZgPapQeeleeEKHGdRir1zeR8WBX3u0RUjIxd1Xx8LXLVw1orIInoDj-BN043ppr1jUWbvk3PgvzXnLJPhhwcSjXQCX6QsCk905I&s=1", "https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/deafawarenessmonth?source=feed_text&story_id=10208052460497274"], "published": "2015-09-01T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T12:04:45.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
