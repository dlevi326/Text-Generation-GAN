The typical pay-TV bill is about $99, Leichtman says, up 39% since 2010.\nLeichtman Research says 83 percent of households still subscribe to pay TV services:\n http://t.co/MpE77Pz98y @deep_beige\n— Swanni (@SwanniOnTV) September 4, 2015 However, some good news for pay-TV providers emerged. More than 15% said that in the future they might consider getting pay-TV service — those most likely to say so were 18-34, an age group that pay-TV providers have bet on joining the ranks once they settle down, buy homes and begin raising families.\nAnd two-thirds of current pay-TV subscribers (66%) said they planned to keep their programming package. (As pay-TV defections and the number of U.S. homes both increase, IHS expects the pay-TV penetration rate to decline to 76% in 2016.)\nUS #payTV cord-cutting fears validated by subscriber losses in Q2 2015 http://t.co/c2kbL45TmP pic.twitter.com/32glNcu42g\n— IHS Technology (@IHS4Tech) September 7, 2015 Of course, even when subscribers defect, they need broadband connections to stream video, so Internet service providers keep those customers on board.\nMore than half of respondents (58%) watch streaming video services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Instant Video, the survey found. A majority of them (38%) watch only on computers, smartphones or tablets, while fewer than one-third (31%) watch only on TVs. Another 31% watch across multiple devices, including TVs.\nNot as many (28%) watch video on the go, but when they do their favorite devices are smartphones (69%), tablets (56%) and computers (37%).\nFairly common is the practice of sharing passwords to access streaming-video services and pay-TV apps such as HBO Go. More than one-third (36%) say they do that. Among them, more than half (54%) said they use passwords given by family and friends, while another half (55%) say they share their own passwords with family and friends.\nRCA Antennas, which commissioned the survey, received good news and bad news. Less than one-fourth (23%) of those who responded currently have a digital-TV antenna and more than four out of 10 respondents (41%) didn’t know they could get local high-definition TV broadcasts over the air from ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC using one. That 41% figure was \"a shocking number\" to RCA Antennas Vice President Ian Geise.\nBut that knowledge gap also presents an opportunity for antenna makers to help cord-cutters supplement their Net-delivered video. \"We have people coming into stores to buy their Roku or Apple TV box who had no idea, and I think this is validated in the survey, that if you got an antenna and connected it to your new digital television that you could be getting free content,\" he said.\nMore than two-thirds said they would at least consider getting an antenna. To that point, retailers such as Best Buy, Target and Walmart have begun showcasing antennas to increase consumer awareness, Geise said. \"They have realized that is the best value for their consumers that are looking for a less-expensive option,\" he said. \"Most streaming boxes don’t have an option for live television or live sports. (Retailers) realize it can be a great bundling opportunity.\"\nUSA TODAY\nCord-cutting of pay TV may continue to intensify\n\"Cutting the Cord\" is a regular column covering Net TV and ways to get it.
