(AP) — The book \"The Martian\" is earning high praise from space, and the astronaut-reviewer can't wait to see the soon-to-be-released movie.\nNASA astronaut Kjell Lindgren (Chell LEND-grin) said Tuesday from the International Space Station that both he and crewmate Scott Kelly have read the novel. Lindgren told reporters he really enjoyed the book and hopes to get a copy of the film beamed up to orbit on October 2, the day of release, or shortly thereafter.\nThe astronauts chatted with the star of the film, Matt Damon , last month by phone. They called him while he was touring Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nKelly — who's almost halfway through a yearlong space station stay — says it's difficult to compare his experience in orbit with a Mars trip.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-08T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:31:24.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
