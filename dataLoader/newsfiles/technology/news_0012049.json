This release includes several new languages to choose from, catering to customer needs around the world, as well as advanced reporting capabilities for sterilization and pasteurization cycle monitoring.\nWarner, NH (PRWEB) September 22, 2015\nThe medical, pharmaceutical, sterilization and meat and food industry users will also see many useful reporting enhancements, helping to streamline calculations that are necessary for compliance.\nEnhanced Multilingual Support\nFor international MadgeTech users and organizations, the software has been fully translated and may now be installed in simplified Chinese, French, German, Portuguese, Finnish, Japanese, Korean or Spanish.\nJapanese and Portuguese had been included in a previous release, but now all support materials and Help files have been translated and included as well, for all languages. These new languages were implemented in response to growing customer demand in many industries, on all continents.\nMultiple Cooling Flags\nOther feature enhancements in this release include the ability to set multiple cooling flags within one dataset. This feature is of particular interest to the meat and poultry industry, making it possible for a single data logger to monitor the cooling for multiple, consecutive cycles. Being able to configure multiple flags for the cooling cycles saves time and simplifies the monitoring and reporting process required for validation.\nSterilization Graph Reports\nFor sterilization and pasteurization needs, calculations such as F0, Fd, Fh and A0 can now be viewed on report graphs . This gives users a visual representation of the entire process and more detail regarding the elimination of pathogens. Advanced calculations are easier to view, present and save, as a record for future verification.\nAll MadgeTech Data Logger Software is compatible with the Microsoft Windows platform, including the latest release of Windows 10.\nFor more information on the software, visit MadgeTech's website here .\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12976432.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.madgetech.com/software-download", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12976432.htm", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQVCxBs5jqw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RCjMwxRxnw"], "published": "2015-09-22T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T09:45:38.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
