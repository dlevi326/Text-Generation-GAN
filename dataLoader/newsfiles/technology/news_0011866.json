Instant response: teams can communicate at the touch of the button, and the easy-to-follow voice prompts and menus virtually eliminate any learning curve. Rugged and durable design: the radios are built with rugged, durable design and therefore can withstand usage in industrial environments – compared to smartphones that can break or crack. Enhanced audio clarity: the radios operate in the 900 MHz ISM, which ensures static-free communication across an extended range. License-free operation: the radios do not require licenses or administrative fees. Lightweight design: teams can wear the radio on their belt or in pockets. Extended battery life: the radios feature 14-hour extended battery life.\nOther special features of the new DLR Digital two-way radios include: enhanced privacy through the use of Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) technology, private reply, direct call, call all available, instant mute, talk permit tones, and home channel.\nMore information on the groundbreaking new DLR Digital two-way radios can be found on the Radio Waves website: http://www.twowayradiowaves.com .\nAbout Radio Waves\nHeadquartered in Parker, Texas, Radio Waves serves customers throughout the U.S. We focus on stellar customer service to best fit a customer's communications needs and are able to provide ongoing superior technical support.
