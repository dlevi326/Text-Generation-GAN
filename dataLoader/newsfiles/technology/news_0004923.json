Photo: Supplied\nIt was a tough conversation for Melbourne medical students Andrew Lin and Hon Weng Chong telling their parents that, after studying for six years, they were going to walk away from careers as doctors to become tech entrepreneurs.\nMedicine is, after all, about minimising risk. Entrepreneurship is built on uncertainty.\n\"You get into this argument with your parents,\" explained Lin.\nCliniCloud co-founder Dr Andrew Lin demonstrating the products in the home environment.

But we really did know what we wanted to do. We wanted to achieve something.\"\nAdvertisement Parents â€“ you need not be concerned. All indicators suggest the boys (Lin is 27 years old and Chong is 26) have most definitely achieved something. The two young doctors are behind CliniCloud, a start-up that has developed a no-contact thermometer and digital stethoscope that allows parents to take readings from their children and interact with doctors over the internet.\nThe start-up is expected to announce a funding round and major retail partnership to sell the product in the US in the coming weeks\nUp close: Andrew Lim and Hon Weng Chong's invention, CliniCloud. Photo: Supplied\nThe two University of Melbourne graduates met during the final years of medical school at a tech hackathon. Chong, inspired to study medicine by his brother, had been coding since he was 14 years old. In time off from studying, he built apps including one that could be described as an early prototype of Uber and similar transport services.\nCliniCloud received a boost when Lin and Chong received a grant after entering the Imagine Cup, a global technology competition sponsored by Microsoft. Their idealistic early idea was a low-cost digital stethoscope to distribute in developing countries . The research money led them to discover, among other things, that parents worldwide shared concerns about quickly diagnosing children's illnesses.\nA trip to Texas to attend South by Southwest Interactive, the music festival that spawned film and technology conferences, offered investment opportunities and more momentum for CliniCloud.\nMelbourne medical students Hon Weng Chong, Andrew Lim and others with Microsoft's Australian managing director Pip Marlow after they entered the Microsoft Imagine Cup.

CliniCloud is no different. Retailing for under $150, the device allows patients to stay home rather than journey to a doctor and also allows medical professionals to potentially treat more people in less time.\n\"With our service a doctor can prescribe medicine as well so you can get prescriptions through a pharmacy,\" said Lin. \"You can get treated at home and you can get told what to do at home.\"\nAlthough developed in Australia by Australian doctors, CliniCloud's primary market is seen as North America. Australia sits behind China and Europe as future markets.\n\"We are trying to pick our battles,\" said Chong. \"The US is more mature than Australia. The incentives are not quite there yet. In Australia, telemedicine is only reimbursable by Medicare if a GP dials into a specialist and even then the patient has to go to the GP first. We are waiting for this to change.\"\nAdds Lin: \"It is all about pain points, really. The Australian healthcare system is relatively good. You don't pay much out of pocket for a GP and most people tend to live in the city. For a start-up, we need a good number of customers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T09:48:05.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
