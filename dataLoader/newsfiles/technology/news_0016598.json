It controls the body systems and regulates the uptake of amino acids by body cells. It helps cells absorb glucose from the blood. In diabetics, cells stop responding to the insulin produced. As a result, glucose in the blood cannot be absorbed by the cells of the body. This condition damages body tissues over the period of time and causes disabling and life-threatening health complications such as diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produces sufficient insulin to regulate blood glucose level. Individuals with this type of diabetes need to take insulin daily. Patients with type 2 diabetes also need doses of insulin coupled with medication. Different types of insulin such as human insulin and insulin analogs are available as insulin replacement therapy. \nTechnavio's analysts forecast the global human insulin market to grow at a CAGR of 10.29% over the period 2014-2019. \nCovered in this reportThe report includes the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global human insulin market for the period 2015-2019.
