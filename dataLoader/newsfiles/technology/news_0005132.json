Currently the only brand-focused DSP with access to Opera’s Instant-Play™ HD video technology, Adelphic exclusively enables its clients to leverage this offering to deliver superior ad experiences in premium, in-app video environments. \nThe availability of quality video in premium, in-app environments is essential as more people watch video on mobile now versus last year and as compared to any other medium.

With partners like Adelphic, premium brands can take advantage of our innovation to engage with users in compelling ways while ensuring their creative appears the way they intend it to be seen.” \nFor consumers, the speed and quality of video is helpful to foster positive experiences. On the publisher side, making video available programmatically enables greater transparency into audience preferences and behaviors. The benefits to buyers are even more robust, offering greater price control and efficiency in the bidding process as well as scale and performance. \n“The smaller screen real estate of mobile devices creates a great need and opportunity for high quality video,” said Michael Collins, CEO of Adelphic. “By working with Opera Mediaworks and incorporating the Instant-Play technology into our buying platform, we give our clients the benefit of both the deep brand engagement of video and the efficiency of programmatic buying.” \nAbout Adelphic: Adelphic is the leading mobile and cross-channel demand side platform, providing an enterprise-ready solution for agencies, brands and other large media buyers who aim to have meaningful engagements with consumers on the move.
