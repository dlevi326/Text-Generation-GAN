Providing a maximum lifting capacity of 84 tonnes and an outreach of up to 40 metres, the crane is equipped with two winches for cargo handling. Liebherr has recently been involved with the supply of STS for Russia’s Port Bronka. \nKarin Zipperer, Technical Director at the Port of Vienna, said: “Our new mobile harbour crane helps us to improve cargo handling efficiency. Thanks to its versatility and mobility, we are able to expand our service portfolio which is important for the future development of our port. This investment also strengthens the attractiveness of inland waterborne transport.”\nHafen Wien has already successfully operated a Liebherr mobile harbour crane, type LHM 1080, for more than 25 years.\nThe new cargo handling solution will be used for container handling, bulk handling as well as general cargo operation.\nTo read more about Liebherr in our Supplier Directory, click here \nTaking a major step towards low-emissions, the LHM 280 is equipped with Liebherr’s Pactronic hybrid drive system.\nPactronic is regenerating the reverse power while lowering the load. In addition, the surplus power of the primary energy source is also used for charging the accumulator.\nThe stored energy is transferred back to the system when the crane requires peak power during hoisting. In terms of turnover capacity, that means an increase of 30% compared to a conventional machine with equal power rating of the primary energy source.\nThe port of Vienna is situated at three TEN-T corridors and is one of the main hinterland hubs in Europe, and for the major North Sea ports and the Adriatic ports.\nFact File: With its facilities in Freudenau, Albern and Lobau, Hafen Wien is the largest public port on the Danube in Austria, handling 13 million tonnes of cargo per year. The new investment in the Liebherr LHM 280 will further strengthen their market position.\nFor all the latest on Liebherr, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:39:55.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
