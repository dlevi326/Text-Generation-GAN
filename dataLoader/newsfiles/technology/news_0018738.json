It was quickly joined by the LG Watch Urbane , Huawei Watch and, most recently, the Samsung Gear S2 . \nThe new Moto 360 models take inspiration from the traditional watch world, featuring lugs specifically tailored for men and women and polished bezels in new styles, as well as customisable colours, materials and straps via the Moto Maker design studio. \nThey also offer up to two full days of battery life and all-round better specs than their predecessor, while continuing to run the Android Wear operating system, which is now compatible with Apple's iPhones . \nThe new Moto 360 smartwatches are dust and water resistant, and allow users to get notifications and important information from their phones delivered to their wrists, as well as respond to messages using voice commands. \nThey can also carry out actions like starting the car, unlocking the front door, hailing a cab or showing a boarding pass at an airport with apps like MyFord, Kevo, Lyft and Delta. \nThe Moto 360 is WiFi-enabled, keeping users connected even if their phone is out of Bluetooth range, and features Live Dials, which offer shortcuts to their favourite apps directly from the watch face. \nIt can also track your heart rate and the calories you burn, and translate that information into feedback and coaching to help you improve and stay fit. \nThe original Moto 360 was 2014's best-selling Android Wear device, according to research firm Canalys. However, more recent data from IDC indicates that the Apple Watch has sold in much larger numbers. \nMotorola, which is now owned by Lenovo , did not make its top five list of wearable tech manufacturers for either of the first two quarters of 2015, but it will be hoping to reverse this trajectory with the new Moto 360 models. \nThe new Moto 360 will launch in various countries across North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia, priced between $300 (£196) and $430 (£281), with the Moto 360 Sport to follow soon after. UK pricing has not yet been announced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T09:54:59.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
