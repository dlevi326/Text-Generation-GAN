The article titled “7 Out Of 10 Americans Say Debt Elimination Is Not Possible” talks about the prevalence of debt in a consumer’s budget and if it is totally possible to eliminate them. The article starts off by pointing that there are a lot of Americans who are already resigned with the fact that they will never be able to fully eliminate debt in their lives. Whether it be a mortgage loan, credit card debt and even student loans, consumers feel that they seem to have more debt than assets. But the article also stresses the fact that debt is something consumers need at some point in their lives especially if they are looking to grow their finances.\nBut there are a few things that will really prevent the exclusion of debt in a consumer’s life and one of them is the credit score. For people who want to keep their scores high, they would need debt to prove their ability to pay. A credit report requires consumers to use debt in order to gauge their behavior towards it. If they exhibit good behavior in handling their debts, then it will reflect well in their credit score.\nAnother item the article explains that expenses seems to be a ready component of consumers looking to improve their finances. One example is when a consumer wants to put up a business in order to earn more. But the capital requirement needed to start a business is not a small amount and people are relegated to taking out a loan from traditional lenders. There are some who uses crowdfunding but even then, they have to repay the donors that contributed for their business.\nTo read the full article, click this link: https://www.nationaldebtrelief.com/7-out-of-10-americans-say-debt-elimination-is-not-possible/", "external_links": ["https://www.nationaldebtrelief.com/7-out-of-10-americans-say-debt-elimination-is-not-possible/", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0aW9uYWxkZWJ0cmVsaWVmLmNvbS83LW91dC1vZi0xMC1hbWVyaWNhbnMtc2F5LWRlYnQtZWxpbWluYXRpb24taXMtbm90LXBvc3NpYmxlLw=="], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T19:20:41.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
