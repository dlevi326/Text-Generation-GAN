The panel subpoenaed Pagliano last month.\nMaryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Benghazi panel, said he was not surprised that Pagliano would refuse to testify, given the \"wild and unsubstantiated accusations\" against Clinton.\n\"This investigation has turned into a 'derail Hillary Clinton's nomination by any means necessary' \" committee, Cummings said.\nThe committee was launched last year to investigate the Obama administration's response to the Benghazi attacks that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador. The investigation has widened in recent months to focus on Clinton's use of a private email account and server.\nClinton has dismissed both controversies as \"partisan games.\" She also has said she regrets using a personal email account to conduct government business.\nNick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton's campaign, said in a statement Thursday that Clinton and her team \"have been confident from the beginning that Clinton's use of a personal email was allowed and that she did not send or receive anything marked classified, facts confirmed by the State Department and the inspector general\" for the department.\nClinton \"has made every effort to answer questions and be as helpful as possible, and has encouraged her aides, current and former, to do the same, including Bryan Pagliano,\" Merrill said.\nClinton is set to testify before the Benghazi committee next month.\nMeeting behind closed doors on Thursday, members of the House panel were questioning Cheryl Mills, Clinton's former chief of staff. Jake Sullivan, another former top aide who now works on Clinton's presidential campaign, was set to be interviewed on Friday. Both sessions are off limits to the public.\nRepublican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the committee chairman, said before the interview began that Mills \"is no different from any other witnesses\" who also have been interviewed in private.\nGowdy told reporters they were \"free to claim whatever inference you want\" from the fact that Pagliano was refusing to testify.\nThe panel was likely to ask Mills about her role in preparing \"talking points\" for administration officials following the attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi.\nCummings called for the committee's GOP majority to release a transcript of Mills' testimony as soon as possible, a request that appeared unlikely to be granted. No other testimony has been made public since the committee began interviews last year.\nPagliano was a State Department employee from 2009 to 2013 and is now a private contractor working in the department's bureau of Information Resource Management, according to a department official who asked not to be identified when discussing personnel matters.\nWhile Pagliano was well-known to Clinton, another computer system worker apparently was unaware of Clinton's private account and server.\nChristopher Butzgy, who identified himself as a \"Help Desk analyst\" at the State Department, sent Clinton an email in February 2010 asking about \"permanent fatal errors\" in her email address.\n\"Do you know what this is?\" Clinton asked aide Huma Abedin.\nAbedin later cleared it up, telling her that someone had sent her an email that bounced back and then called the State Department help desk.\n\"They had no idea it was YOU, just some random address so they emailed,\" Abedin wrote.\nThe email exchange was included in thousands of emails released by the State Department Monday under a court order.\n___\nAP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow Matthew Daly: http://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T20:45:15.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
