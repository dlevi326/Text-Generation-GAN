Candidates should be university graduates or research students who will either be in their final year of doctoral research, or within one year of first submission of their PhD (note: submission and not award of the degree). \nResearch Fellowships are awarded to men or women judged to be the most able with an exceptionally strong academic record who have demonstrated outstanding capacity to conduct original and innovative doctoral research in Science or the Arts. The College entertains applications in all academic disciplines. \nThe Fellowships will be tenable for four years from a date to be agreed between 1 July and 1 October 2016. Research Fellows are expected to spend the tenure of their Fellowship in Cambridge, and to contribute to the life of the College. Permission may be granted for periods of research away from Cambridge. \nThe current stipend of a Research Fellow resident in College who has no other emoluments except College teaching is £20,202 p.a., rising by three annual increments to £22,663 p.a. Assistance with housing is given to non-resident Research Fellows. Reimbursement of certain research expenses totalling up to £1,000 p.a. will also be available. \nProspective candidates should be aware that the College requires the submission of the written work the candidates would wish to be read by assessors at the same time as the application; although there is some variation between disciplines, it is generally expected that the work submitted will be at least 30,000 words in length, including in some cases a complete PhD of about 80,000 words, and/or published work. The main body of written work must be submitted in English, apart from quotations. \nThe initial review of applications will be undertaken by Fellows; this will involve consideration of the CV, research work to date, proposed area of study during the Research Fellowship and of the quality of the references provided. Applications are then considered by sub-committees in the Arts and Sciences with responsibility for drawing up a shortlist of candidates whose work is sent to expert readers for further assessment. A small number of strongly recommended candidates are then invited for interview. \nApplications must be completed by Wednesday 30 September 2015. The election will be held on 15 January 2016 and candidates should ensure that they will be available for interview that day if so required. Candidates who are offered a Research Fellowship at Gonville & Caius College will be required to accept or decline the offer immediately. \nFull details of our application procedures for 2016 are now available online at http://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/jrf_vacancies \nThere are 31 colleges within the collegiate University of Cambridge. Each college is an independent institution and appoints its own staff.
