We have talked about privacy in length here on Ghacks and while things are definitely worse than in previous versions of Windows, most of them can be fixed with privacy tools . \nThis article is not about privacy but about features or programs that feel incomplete or disappoint because of a lack of functionality. \nMicrosoft Edge \nMicrosoft's Internet Explorer replacement lacks many options and features that have been part of mainstream browsers for a long time that it is difficult to list them all in a single article. \nIt lacks customization options, settings in general, management options to control things like cookies on the system, or tools to display information about sites you visit. \nAnd that does not even take into accounts features such as extensions that were not the strong suite of Internet Explorer. \nMicrosoft is working on Edge and one of the things that the company will release soon is extensions support. It is still too early to tell how this will look like and how well it will work though. \nWindows Apps and Store \nIf you run Windows apps regularly on your system then you have probably experienced crashes, slow downs and other issues related to apps already. \nWe have covered this before in Microsoft needs to fix Windows Store and the universal app platform already. \nThe whole universal apps system seems highly unstable at this point in time. Two of the apps crashed constantly of the ten or so applications I reviewed today for this week's best of Windows apps article over on Betanews so that I gave up on them and did not mention them in the article. \nWindows Store offers similar functionality as Google Play by displaying curated lists on the frontpage and in categories which reduces a user's ability to discover apps greatly. \nThe problem that Windows Store has is one of size (availability of premium apps) when compared to other big stores out there plus it is largely ignored by desktop users who have often access to better choices in form of programs or web applications. \nThe Start Menu This is the smallest it gets. \nThe start menu is an improvement over Windows 8's Start Screen, at least on the desktop. As a desktop user however, I find it lacking in many regards. \nFirst, these tiles don't make a whole lot of sense on the desktop regardless of whether they are live tiles or static tiles. \nI don't need big squares in the start menu as I can move and click precisely where I want using the mouse. \nI can see the advantage on mobile devices where you use your finger to activate these but on the desktop, they are not useful in my opinion. \nLive tiles are fairly useless on the desktop as you need to open the start menu first to see them at all. Even then, you are probably not opening the start menu to find out what's new in the Pictures application or News, as there are better ways to do so. Plus, you would have to keep the start menu open if you want to get a constant stream of updates. \nThe start menu lacks customization options apart from that. Why is the All Apps link above the \"power\" options link? Why cannot I resize the start menu to my liking (there is a limit that you cannot go beyond)? Why cannot I reorder items? \nSettings and Control Panel \nTwo tools to manage settings of the operating system. This is just confusing and will get even weirder once Microsoft decides to move more Control Panel tools to Settings. \nThere should only be one central tool to manage core System settings. I never found the Control Panel to be very appealing and would not mind using Settings completely, but Microsoft should make up its mind and stick with that decision. \nSearch is broken \nSearch in Windows 10 fails to work at times for some users. It is unclear why and how, only that it is an issue that is affecting more than just a handful of users. While there is a fix for the issue, it is only temporary and needs to be applied whenever search fails. \nSince searching is essential, it is quite the problematic bug. \nNow You : What's your take on Windows 10's overall state? Summary These are the things Microsoft needs to improve in Windows 10 Author Martin Brinkmann Description The article looks at features and programs of Windows 10 that Microsoft needs to improve in the near future to improve the overall system.

Then stopped in the middle and said: Lets force this down the publics thoat and see what happens. \nOne thing that made windows 7 such an wesome OS is that it really felt mature straight out of the box. It had been build very solidly on top of vista and the codebase before it, whereas Windows 10 didn't do the same with Windows 8.... In many ways Windows 8 actually stands out as being better then Windows 10 just by virtue of having a decent excuse. Reply Dave September 18, 2015 at 7:17 pm # \nI would have liked if they'd updated the core OS with all the improvements, and not added all the crap to it. It's an OS. It shouldn't come with cloud storage, skype, or an app store. They should all be optional. Arguable the entire modern runtime environment should be optional too, in the same way that .NET used to be. Install it by default if you must, but let me remove it. \nThe world really needs an open platform to gain a footing. Ideally something based on BSD. Reply anon September 18, 2015 at 8:40 pm # \nWinRT is not going to be an optional component when it's going to replace WinAPI (including Win32) in the long term. Reply insanelyapple September 18, 2015 at 7:35 pm # \nMicrosoft in first place need to change and fix how \"telemetry\" is working: it should be truly (no, now it's not) optional in default everyday installation and mandatory in Insider Program. ddk September 18, 2015 at 7:36 pm # \n\"What's your take on Windows 10's overall state?\" \nAwful. Becoming like Linux. Something could break at any moment. It's free to many users so it was rushed and the final product shows a lack of detail & polish that was evident on their previous os...Win XP and 7. \nSwitched to Mac and OSX. Reply Boko September 18, 2015 at 8:05 pm # \nPrivacy concerns make it a dealbreaker for me. I try to be forgiving towards each Windows release. I'm stuck to my choice of apps I have carefully picked up for selective tasks over the years. But Windows 10 made me downgrade back to Win 7. By the time Win 7 goes out, I'm sure a Linux distro will be mature enough to switch over to. With Steam, apps moving to cloud and Flash being phased out, Linux is looking like a more viable workstation everyday... ilev September 18, 2015 at 8:10 pm # \nWindows 10 is shaping up to be the most unstable release since Millennium Edition (ME) anon September 18, 2015 at 8:29 pm # \n>using BetaNews as valid source>implying that the Windows ME instability issues aren't exaggerated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_ME#Reception \nByron Hinson and Julien Jay writing for ActiveWin took an appreciative look on the operating system. On the removal of real mode DOS, they had noted \"The removal of DOS has clearly made a difference in Windows Me in terms of stability (Far less Blue Screens Of Death are seen now) and booting speed has greatly increased.\"[46] Reply anon September 18, 2015 at 8:27 pm # \nThe Control Panel is already set to go away when Settings is good enough to replace it. This was officially confirmed even before Windows 10 hit RTM. Reply yannikkohm September 18, 2015 at 8:37 pm # \nMartin, you sound like you aren't sure but Microsoft really did release Windows 10 prematurely to catch the holiday season. Everyone, including Lisa Su, the AMD CEO, knows that. \nAnd yes, a lot of things in Windows 10 are half baked and unfinished. Microsoft should know it was stupid move and their reputation would take a hit for it. I suppose they knew this but were prepared to suffer the consequences. Well then errr... so be it. Jeff September 18, 2015 at 9:52 pm # \nThey knew they could release prematurely because of the whole 'free' thing. \nFree goes a long way in the realm of public opinion, and a lot more will be forgiven. If people were paying $100+ for this \"upgrade\", then a lot more angry people would be shouting. Reply Brian September 18, 2015 at 8:45 pm # \nAnother thing I really dislike about the start menu is the large tile icons beside every app when you go into the All Apps menu. Even on a just installed machine, I find myself scrolling multiple times to see all of the apps. My machine is pretty clean and I have to scroll six times. In the previous start menu, I had to scroll twice. This is a very inefficient use of space. It makes using the start menu a painful process which is probably what MS wants to push us toward those stupid tiles. It's pretty sad that MS brought back the start menu but did such a poor job that I'm still considering buying a start menu app like I had to do on Windows 8. \nAnd I especially agree with your comments about Edge. I was initially excited about it but it is so barren that none of my users are going to use it. My first reaction to seeing it could open pdf files was that I could finally stop installing Acrobat reader and the endless stream of updates across thousands of computers. However, after using it myself for a few weeks, it is not an acceptable replacement and my users will still insist upon having Acrobat reader. Reply hirobo2 September 19, 2015 at 12:54 am # \nOMG, pratically all modern browsers today come pre-packaged with their own PDF plugin. Using Edge just to view PDF's without installing Adobe Reader is a very poor excuse to adopt a new browser! Reply Ai September 18, 2015 at 8:57 pm # \nmicrosoft is not obligated to do what you want - it needs to have a vision and execute. Whether they choose to conform their vision to conservative users or not is their choice as an entity in the free market Reply Jeff September 18, 2015 at 9:54 pm # \nWho has claimed MS is \"obligated\" to do anything? They are free, as you say, to do as they please, and the end user is also just as free to complain about MS' choices or to make suggestions for improvement. Reply Robert Swift September 18, 2015 at 9:36 pm # \nI think in spite of the minor complaints, Windows 10 is a breath of fresh air. I like it better than OSX now and certainly find it far more usable than any of the Linux distros (my favorite is mint and ubuntu). I get that there are some unfinished features, but moving to a base that allows incremental feature improvement is important and necessary. I completely disagree with Dave who said \"It shouldn't come with cloud storage, skype, or an app store. \" I love those features. Cloud storage is a wonderful tool to help leverage the mobility of experiences. Skype is a wonderful communication tool that is used by more of the world than any other tool. The app store is critical for delivering trusted applications and reduce the crapware, spyware, malware that infects so many of the applications on the web today. The app store will be getting desktop apps too in the future which will be a huge boon. Even Apple acknowledges this fact with the Mac store on OSX, although if you want to talk about barren...lol. \nI do wish Edge was further along when they released Windows 10, but just like Chrome had to grow up over time, so too will Edge. I'm impressed with its speed and its memory efficiency....something that Chrome seems to have lost sight of lately. \nIt is easy to point out all the missing features from Windows 10 but that is a disservice to it as you gloss over all of the great features it has introduced....and the promise of more to come. \nMy overall assessment of Windows 10 is that it is a slam dunk win. Haters gonna hate, but I think the overwhelming majority of consumers are really enjoying Windows 10. Reply Bryan September 18, 2015 at 10:22 pm # \nWhat Microsoft needs to add to Windows 10 is the return of update details and control over driver and feature updates. Period. Having been left with an inoperable system from a faulty or misidentified driver update more than once has taught me to not trust Microsoft update...at all. I like 10 but won't upgrade to it because of this single issue. My time is important to me and Microsoft has demonstrated time and time again that they care nothing at all about customer's time. \"Please wait \" flyli5411 September 18, 2015 at 10:46 pm # \nWill try Windows 10 when it is complete and ready to use! this sucker makes windows 8.1 look great Yeah il wait! Reply Mark September 18, 2015 at 10:52 pm # \nAs a developer, I look at the Event Logs every so often. There are many DCOM-persmission-related errors showing up and I have seen this reported by others on various sites. So there is more that needs fixing than just the visual things that regular users see. I can't imagine they have fully tested Win 10 before releasing it. Either that or they don't have a good test suite and use production as their test bed. Reply hirobo2 September 18, 2015 at 11:50 pm # \nI'm staying away from WX for the sheer ludicrous reason that it's the only OS I would have to configure extensively (ie. privacy settings/hacks) just to gain some sort of control over it out of the box. W7/8.1 are relatively simple --- I only need to turn off automatic updates and away I go!
