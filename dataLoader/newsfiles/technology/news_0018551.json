Most consumers don’t want to carry several mobile wallets on their phone, just like they don’t want to carry several credit cards in a physical wallet. So consumers will opt for a few of their favorites. As a result, the multi-merchant wallets, such as Google Wallet and Apple Pay, will be the winners, while consumers move away from single-merchant payment vehicles. \nPhilbin added that merchants need to focus more resources on mobile marketing and less on online marketing. \n“The desktop is going away,” Philbin said. “Search queries have grown from 50 percent from mobile to 70 percent from mobile.” Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:09:43.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
