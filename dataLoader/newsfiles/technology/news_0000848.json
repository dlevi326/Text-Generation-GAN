Announces Launch of Second Generation ICLOAK Stik Privacy and Anonymity Device ​Orlando-based privacy and security tech startup ICLOAK Inc. today announced the launch of its second generation ICLOAK Stik online privacy and anonymity device. The second generation device follows the successful development, launch and sale of the first generation ICLOAK Stik device, which has been in operation since July of 2014. Orlando, Florida - September 18, 2015 - ( Newswire.com ) \n​Orlando -based privacy and security tech startup ICLOAK Inc. today announced the launch of its second generation ICLOAK Stik online privacy and anonymity device. The second generation device follows the successful development, launch and sale of the first generation ICLOAK Stik device, which has been in operation since its successful Kickstarter campaign in July of 2014 that had over 1,800 backers and raised over $100,000 in funding. \nPrior to the launch, ICLOAK Inc. had been working on the second generation ICLOAK Stik using the extensive feedback received from buyers of the first generation device. This feedback included bug reports, compatibility issues, ideas and suggestions for improvements among a number of other critical points. This was in line with ICLOAK Inc.'s desire to develop better tools using feedback from users, something CEO and founder Eric B. Delisle intimated from the very beginning: \" ICLOAK Stik was always going to be an evolving device. We built it with the full knowledge that for it to deliver the sort of privacy and anonymity our users need, it must evolve with their needs and the changes in the technology and online landscape. Finally launching ICLOAK Stik version two is a great achievement for us and for the privacy and anonymity movement.\" \nThe new ICLOAK Stik has been built and packaged for the mass market and for good reason. Privacy tools tend to be very technical in nature and only tech savvy individuals with a background in IT can use these tools effectively. ICLOAK's vision is to create a consumer-friendly version of these tools and devices that any lay person can use. \"From a stay-at-home full-time mom, to a teacher, to a university student,\" said Delisle , \"these are the regular folk that ICLOAK Stik has been built for.\" \nTo use the device, plug it into any USB port of any Mac or PC computer. Reboot to USB to initiate the operating system loaded on the ICLOAK Stik . You now have an independent and safe \"computer\" with robust privacy and anonymity tools built in to protect your data, identity, browsing habits and history, and any other web activity you perform. To erase all traces of your activities, simply log off from the ICLOAK Stik and switch it off, unplug it from the computer and then restart the computer normally. The ICLOAK Stik leaves no traces whatsoever of your browsing activity. \nABOUT ICLOAK INC. \nICLOAK Inc. is a tech startup based in Orlando FL, passionate about designing and building consumer-facing online privacy, security and anonymity tools and devices. Founded in 2013 by current CEO Eric B. Delisle , the company launched its flagship device, ICLOAK Stik , an autonomous computing system mounted on a thumb drive, on Kickstarter in 2014. The campaign went on to attract over 1,800 backers and to raise over $100,000 in funding. ICLOAK has sold thousands of units since then and continues to strive to put the device in as many hands as possible in order to push back the advances of those seeking to erode and displace the rights of web users across the world. \nFor more information, contact Ilea Petsel at ilea@icloak.org or call (407) 442-0876.
