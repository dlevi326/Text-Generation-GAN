By Michael Hart 09/15/15 \nA maker of constituent relationship management (CRM) systems for higher education has introduced three new apps it says will streamline relationship management, enhance communication within institutions and create more stimulating student experiences. \nEnrollment RX , a CRM system which comes from a company of the same name, is built on Salesforce.com and runs on the cloud. Its primary focus has been to digitize student applicant information and manage communication with those contacts. \nThe three new apps are Import Rx, Events Rx and Reader Rx. \nImport Rx is intended to help schools load large volumes of data into its CRM from a number of sources including ACT, College Board, GRE and GMAT. Officials say the import tool can reduce the time spent importing data. \nEvents Rx is expected to help with higher ed event management with a drag-and-drop configuration that can make it easier to track participants from sign-up through attendance. It also allows schools to generate custom registration Web pages for events and use QR codes to track event attendance. \nReader Rx will allow all those in the institution who review applications to view materials, comment and score applications online from a single screen. Reviewers in different locations can access a centralized digital file on the device of their choice. \n\"Our new apps extend the power and flexibility of Enrollment Rx's cloud-based CRM solutions, embracing our philosophy of 'clicks-not-code' and delivering a rich user experience that helps admissions teams work quickly and intelligently,\" said Enrollment Rx President Lawrence Levy.
