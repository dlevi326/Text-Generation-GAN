The infamous Soweto uprising and the killing of people as a consequence.\nAnd now 39 years later we are back at the same situation with the exception that this time around it is not Afrikaans, but indeed Mandarin (Chinese) that are being brought into schools.\nThe question that need to be asked is when will students in the South African environment would have to use Mandarin to communicate, this irrespective of the fact that 80% of our goods that are on sale are being imported from China?\nThe use of Afrikaans in South Africa will always outweigh the use of Mandarin especially so in South Africa, and how many learners would be travelling to China in any way to be able to communicate whereas most Chinese are fluent in the command of the English language,\nBut no, Mandarin is now being introduced within Schools in South Africa, but I see no protest against it.\nAmazingly in the Grade 12 final year students (650 000) over 480 000 chose Afrikaans as a second language as they claim it is easier that to learn Zulu! Amazingly how things have changed right under our noses.\nWe are indeed between colonialized (regal, royally, imposing, grand, majestic) and all this because JZ and now even CR flying with a chartered jet from the Guptas to Japan and then the Minister of Defense says that the owners of the jet had no obligation to disclose who they are, are spending so much time in China and Japan, rubbing up with the Chinese and the Japanese for that matter and it is exactly them that need to start learning Mandarin and not the learners that will never travel to China of Japan..\nThey should take a close look at the collars of their shirts to make sure it is still its original colour and not brown for that matter (and we all understand that idiom).\nMandarin in South Africa – how ludicrous.\nThe Chinese are building a new town at Modderfontein worth R 86 billion and not one single labourer is South African and not a single brick is made here – all imported from China as it is cheaper than buying the local product – right under our noses, and we are all blind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:12:24.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
