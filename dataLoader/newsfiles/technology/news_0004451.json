Out of the pool of applicants, 26 innovative and high growth companies were selected to present to a select group of technology industry experts and judges, the Demo team, as well as 300 executives and senior IT leaders in the audience. \nPresenting during the Enterprise segment of the event, LiquidPlanner CEO Liz Pearce spoke to the audience about how integrating estimation methodology into everyday work can help people tame the uncertainty hidden in projects and in business today. In addition she spoke about how LiquidPlanner enables companies to prioritize work, accurately predict project completion dates, and ensure that employees can’t be overbooked. Together these benefits radically separate LiquidPlanner from other project management solutions that are incapable of compiling this information into a predictive and automated online solution. \n“In 2008 we launched our predictive project management solution at Demo and the initial response was exceptional. Since then we’ve watched it take hold in the market, as more companies realize they need a new approach to managing the complexities of large-scale technology projects,” said Liz Pearce, chief executive officer at LiquidPlanner. “Our customers do amazing things with LiquidPlanner, from eliminating project failure costs to accelerating product delivery to drive revenue. This award is a testament to them; they inspire us every day to continue our mission of reinventing project management from the ground up.” \n\"We were thrilled to recognize LiquidPlanner as a DEMO Traction Champion. LiquidPlanner solves the very real problem of adjusting project plans and deadlines dynamically across an entire work group as circumstances change for each individual contributor,” said Erick Schonfeld, Demo Traction co-founder and executive producer. \nIf you are ready for a more flexible, fluid project management experience, we invite you to request a demo or try LiquidPlanner for free for two weeks. \nAbout LiquidPlanner \nFounded in 2007, LiquidPlanner is predictive project management technology for modern business.
