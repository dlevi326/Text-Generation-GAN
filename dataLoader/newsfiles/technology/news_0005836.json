A long term user of Linetime for conveyancing matters, the firm has expanded its use of the system to cover all its private client and commercial work. \nBased in East Kent, Boys & Maughan has five main offices and is a regular recipient of accolades for its services. Last autumn, for example, the firm was highly commended for its client focused approach to conveyancing at the prestigious Law Society Excellence Awards. \nPeter Rodd, Senior Partner at Boys & Maughan said: “Having offices at multiple locations brings a challenge of maintaining fully centralised records. Using the latest version of Liberate enables us to develop an electronic history of activity on every case. Correspondence is stored, along with copies of all inbound and outbound emails, helping us streamline the delivery of a consistent service to clients no matter which branch they visit or who deals with an enquiry. \n“We are also looking forward to the opportunity for residential conveyancing clients to be able to track their house move online at any time of the day. Estate agents will also be able to check progress towards exchange and completion. This will improve our service and it could mean fewer interruptions, enabling fee earners to become more productive,” adds Peter. \n“We see particular benefit in using the system to carry out procedural work where it will ensure tasks are carried out in accordance with the Law Society’s Conveyancing Quality Scheme standards. The system will additionally benefit areas of the business where work is less process driven and be useful for audit and compliance purposes.” \nPeter Rodd is the immediate past chair of the Law Society Property Section and a member of its Conveyancing Quality Scheme (CQS) technical panel. \nShare:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T01:15:38.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
