The Swedish and Norwegian companies said Friday in a joint release they were unable to agree with the EU's executive Commission \"on acceptable conditions\" to create \"a robust mobile operator\" in Denmark based on a deal agreed on in December. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a separate statement that discussions with the parties on the merger \"were not able to fully address the Commission's competition concerns\". She added: \"What the parties offered was not sufficient to avoid harm to competition in Danish mobile markets.\" TeliaSonera and Telenor said they would review other options to co-operate in the Danish telecoms market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:49:26.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
