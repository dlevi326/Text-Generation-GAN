I like it, we have a good team, my family feel good and it's just positive with Paris and PSG. But they wanted, they wanted much,\" he added. \nWhen pressed about Arsenal's reported interest, the striker replied, \"No, so the interest that existed, I have not committed myself to.\" \n\"It is Mino Raiola (Zlatan's agent) who takes care of the pieces. When I give notice that I want something to happen I get involved. But this summer I have been resting up, I enjoyed the holiday, but I know that Milan were a bit desperate,\" Ibrahimovic said.
