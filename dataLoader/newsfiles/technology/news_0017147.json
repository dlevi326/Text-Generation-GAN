And a country held its collective breath.\nArmed only with his \"now famous\" Number 6 jersey and that irresistible trademark, his ice-melting smile, our dear President Nelson Mandela took those bold steps fearlessly. He had come in peace... To unite and not to fight.\nIt was South Africa's very own 9/11. As world leaders on so many fronts, South Africa experienced the maiden \"Ground Zero\" back in 1995 when our very own twin towers fell, at the hand of Nelson Mandela.\nRugby's fortress, Ellis Park was breached & the racial divide which had characterized one of our greatest sporting codes for decades was destroyed in a single moment - albeit temporarily, as it later proved to be.\nOur great President had reached out, extending an olive branch. He not only allowed the Springboks to retain their name, but he showed all his fellow countrymen, that the Springbok team belonged to all South Africans.\nIn that poignant, heart-stopping, magical moment, as the Great One raised the Webb Ellis Cup, alongside our beaming captain Francois Pienaar, South Africa stood united, on top of the world.\nNever have I felt so close to tears and so proud to be a South African, ever!\nIn that seminal moment of our new democracy, all our country's woes were seemingly washed away in an instant. We watched, spellbound and awestruck, as Nelson smiled down on us, and the world, from the winner's podium. The divisions, racial hatred, resentment, pain and anger, yes, all of our painful past was suddenly forgotten in that famed magical moment.\nSouth Africans of all colors & creeds were joined in heart. We shook hands, high-fived, embraced, laughed and cried. We danced, partied and celebrated wherever we were, even in the streets, as traffic ground to a halt...\nWe were on cloud nine for days afterwards, as we relived our famous victory, sealed with that superb Joel Stranskey dropped goal.\nThis absolutely monumental day in our history was the main topic in clubs, pubs, shebeens, taverns and in our homes for days and weeks and months. An event I will never forget.\nOur great Tata Madiba, the Father of our new nation - Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela - had once again shown us the way in his own very special trend-setting way... What more could we say?\nSo how could we allow things to slide so horribly, to where we find ourselves today?\nIn order for us to honor this great icon's legacy, surely racism in rugby (and all our other sporting codes) MUST fall...\nThose who believe that they can take our country back to its darkest days with their polarizing, destructive & divisive actions MUST fall...\nTherefore SARU, Roux, Hoskins and above all Meyer with his overtly racist philosophy, MUST FALL...\nWe are obliged and compelled to resist any and every attempt to take our country back to our ignominious past...\nWhy?\nBecause Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela - who paid for our freedom with 27 years of his life - has said it: \"NEVER AGAIN!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:15:24.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
