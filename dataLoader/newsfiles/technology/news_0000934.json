The agency wants to determine if the technology will provide dependable access to the internet. \nCEO Don Orseno says if customers like the level of service and it's financially feasible Metra will seek funding or sponsorships to install Wi-Fi on more railcars. \nThe six-month pilot project will cost about $35,000. \nMetra also plans to provide free wireless access in waiting areas at all five downtown Chicago rail stations within 45 days.
