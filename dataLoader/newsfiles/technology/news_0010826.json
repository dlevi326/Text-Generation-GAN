It's been a major tourist attraction since the 19th century, and scientists say the area is becoming increasingly unstable.\nSki stations at mid-altitude are particularly vulnerable to increasingly inconsistent snow, threatening jobs in a region that depends heavily on tourism. Valls is visiting the region to highlight France's role as host in the global summit on climate change in November.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-25T13:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:33:13.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
