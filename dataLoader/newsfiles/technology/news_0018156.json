The live presentation, entitled “The True Cost of Using End-of-Life Software,” begins at noon local time on Friday, September 25, 2015. The focus of the webinar is to warn both small and medium-sized businesses about the dangers of continued use of outdated business software, such as operating systems like Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.\n“Using unsupported software is a risk that businesses should not want to take,” said Jeffery Sneed, CEO, Onsite Computer. “However, while nearly every small business thinks it’s important to keep software updated, many of them, for example, are still using Server 2003 beyond its end-of-support date. The costs of this continued use can be harmful for a small business.”\nOnsite Computer’s webinar takes a look at the costs of using outdated business software, the most common outdated business software being used, and the risks being taken by businesses using outdated software. Most at risk is vital business data and information, as well as businesses becoming non-compliant.\nTo sign up for the complimentary webinar “The True Cost of Using End-of-Life Software” scheduled for September 25, 2015, please visit https://ocrdfw.com/events/ .
