In addition, the new analysis shows Sprint in a dead heat tying for 1st place in overall, reliability, data and text network performance. \nThis is the first time Sprint has received an outright win for network speed performance in Denver. This testing marks the ninth time RootMetrics has tested Denver, with the last test occurring in March 2015. \n“The Mile High City is an amazing place to live and work, and we’re proud to provide our customers with the fastest mobile network,” said Marcelo Claure, Sprint CEO. “Customers in Denver and across America can expect to have the best and fastest wireless service from Sprint – this is our #1 priority and there’s never been a better time to join Sprint.” \nFastest Network in Denver \nRootMetrics drove a total of 1,065 miles and conducted more than 20,000 tests in Denver. During testing Sprint recorded the fastest median download speeds, and RootMetrics was able to experience Sprint’s newly deployed carrier aggregation technology on the 2.5GHz spectrum band. This feature of LTE-Advanced essentially creates a wider lane that allows more traffic to travel at higher rates, enabling Sprint to provide Denver customers with even faster data speeds. \nIn addition to deploying some of the most advanced technologies in wireless, Sprint has relentlessly focused on expanding and fine-tuning the network in Denver. In the past year, the company added hundreds of new 2.5GHz cell sites, and increased its 1.9GHz and 800MHz 4G LTE coverage. Sprint’s network teams then systematically optimized each cell site to maximize overall performance, coverage, capacity and speed. \nSprint has also improved service and upgraded the wireless systems in high-traffic areas such as the Colorado Convention Center, Sports Authority Field, Coors Field, Pepsi Center, and Civic Center Park. The company also brought in additional network capacity to support a number of local events such as the Colorado Renaissance Festival and Denver County Fair. \n“Wireless connectivity drives economic and civic progress. We’re pleased to give Denver a top-ranked network, one that fully enables entertainment, communication and collaboration across the city, its workplaces, and its homes,” said Dr. John Saw, Sprint CTO. \nBut what about Sprint’s network across multiple cities? That’s also getting better every day. According to RootMetrics, in 125 metro markets measured in the first half of 2015, Sprint was awarded a total of 180 first place (outright or shared) RootScore® Awards for overall, reliability, speed, data, call, or text network performance. 1 Those numbers sound even more impressive when compared to last year’s results. In these same 125 markets, Sprint achieved 27 first-place award wins in the first half of 2014. \nDenver, We Have Great Offers for You! \nIn addition to offering the fastest wireless network in Denver, when current Verizon and AT&T customers bring their wireless bill and their old phones to Sprint, the company will cut their rate plan in half . 2 Yes…in half. \nSprint also has an unprecedented, one-time offer exclusively for DIRECTV customers : free wireless service – unlimited talk, text and 2GB of data per line – for one full year when they switch to Sprint, or available to existing Sprint customers adding a new line of service on a new smartphone through Sprint Lease, iPhone Forever, Sprint Easy Pay 3 or paying full retail price.
