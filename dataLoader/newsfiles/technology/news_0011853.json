Law enforcement is increasingly taking advantage of outdated privacy laws to turn mobile phones into tracking devices and access sensitive emails, digital documents, and text messages without proper judicial oversight. \nAn overwhelming majority of Californians (82%) have spoken up loud and clear that they want change – they want the police to “get a warrant” for digital information. The California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (CalECPA, SB 178) would make this happen. \nCalECPA makes sure police go to a judge and get a warrant before they can get access to electronic information about who we are, where we go, who we know, and what we do. The bill’s notice, reporting, and enforcement provisions make sure that there is proper transparency and oversight and mechanisms to ensure that the law is followed. And the bill also includes appropriate exceptions to ensure that the police can continue to effectively and efficiently protect public safety. \nCalECPA is supported by the state’s leading technology companies and organizations (see full list below) and has broad bipartisan support, jointly authored by Senator Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) and Senator Joel Anderson (R-Alpine), Principal co-author Assemblymember Gatto (D-Glendale) and co- authored by Senators Canella, Gaines, Hertzberg, Hill, McGuire, Nielsen and Roth and Assemblymembers Chiu, Dahle, Gordon, Maienschein, Obernolte, Quirk, Ting, and Weber. \nCalifornians should not have to choose between using new technology and keeping their personal lives private and California’s technology companies shouldn’t be burdened with privacy laws stuck in the digital dark ages. Get involved \nThere are lots of ways to push CalECPA forward.
