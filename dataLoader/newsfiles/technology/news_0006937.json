Public: ok but will the charger stay intact for more than 2 days??? — Ellen Russell (@ellenmarie_123) September 9, 2015 20.52 Commenting on the Apple TV announcement, Forrester analyst James McQuivey said: For Apple TV to succeed it will have to give people what they already want on a TV: TV shows. But for that to happen, the companies that own the best shows have to give Apple those rights and from my conversations with them, Apple along with Google are the two companies that nobody wants to give that content to. The other option is to make your own content, a strategy Netflix denied it would ever do until the day that it did so. And it may be Apple's only hope to really make a dent in the world of TV content given how little content it can acquire rights to on its own. 20.35 People are kicking off about the Adobe on iPad Pro demo, in which a picture of a model's face was edited to make her look like she was smiling.

At John Lewis we receive many customer requests for the latest mobile technology, so we can imagine demand for the two new handsets in Silver, Gold, Space Grey and Rose Gold will be extremely high. Attractive new features such as 3D Touch, 4K video, Live photos, 5MP FaceTime HD with Retina Flash and the new 12MP iSight Camera with 50% more pixels and Auto Focus will be key draws for customers seeking high quality image capabilities. 22.11 Here's what the new animated backgrounds on the iPhone 6s look like: If you're wondering what the new animated backgrounds look like, wonder no more: pic.twitter.com/DUjZPfjSZi — Rhiannon Williams (@RhiannonJudithW) September 9, 2015 21.50 Over in San Francisco, Rhiannon is getting her hands on the new devices. Here's the iPad Pro: And the Apple Pencil: 21.42 Commenting on the launch of the new iPad Pro, Forrester analyst Frank Gillett says: \"Apple's iPad Pro presents an alternative vision of what a tablet or a portable PC is. At more than $900 it is no threat to mainstream Windows convertible tablets or laptops, which usually sell for less. But the incredible MultiTouch, 5k display, dynamically reconfiguring stereo speakers, and sensitive Apple Pencil set a new bar for a creative, high end personal device, and will blur the line between tablet and laptop. And it joins the Microsoft Surface Pro as an alternative vision of a personal portable computing device for creatives and professionals. 21.38 Third party accessory companies are already showing off their new cases for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Proporta's new cases offer everything from high level protection to contactless payment security: Ted Baker also announced a new Rose Gold Shannon for iPhone 6S and 6Plus, to go with the Rose Gold iPhone: 21.23 Here's another look at Craig Federighi showing off the \"emergency selfie\" feature with 3D touch on the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s plus: 21.20 Apple didn't make much of it at the event, but iOS9 will allow ad-blocking extensions, allowing people to keep their online behaviour private from businesses and brands. Marta Janus, Security Researcher at Kaspersky Lab, said this is a clear indication that some consumers want to be protected from targeted marketing efforts: Recent research we conducted found UK consumers feel helpless about increasingly complex online threats to their personal data and identity, freezing them into a state of indecision around how best to protect themselves from cyber threats – a state we have defined as Privacy Paralysis. What is concerning is that only about 20% of surveyed users claim to implement all the appropriate security measures to protect their privacy. The remaining three quarters either doesn't know how to protect themselves, putting their trust into the websites that manage their personal data, or doesn't realise the dangers of privacy leakage at all. 21.03 The Sony Mobile social media team are still at it: Up to 2 days' battery life, 23 MP camera, 4K video capture AND display? #Xperia Z5 series: http://t.co/n7KuPge34V pic.twitter.com/8kw8HrHALB — Sony Xperia (@sonyxperia) September 9, 2015 20.56 Here's some UK pricing info for the new iPhones and Apple Watches: The iPhone 6s will be available in the UK for a suggested retail price of £539 for the 16GB model, £619 for the 64GB model and £699 for the 128GB model. iPhone 6s Plus will be available for a suggested retail price of £619 for the 16GB model, £699 for the 64GB model and £789 for the 128GB model. The Apple Watch Hermès starts at £1,000 for the 38 mm stainless steel case with the Single Tour, £1,050 for the 42 mm stainless steel case with the Single Tour, £1,150 for the 38 mm stainless steel case with the Double Tour and £1,350 for the 42 mm stainless steel case with the Cuff. UK pricing for the 32GB model and a 64GB Apple TV will be announced when it goes on sale at the end of October. 20.51 Commenting on the introduction of 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, Abby Francis at Mobiles.co.uk said: With similar technology already available on the Apple Watch and the latest MacBooks, the introduction of 3D Touch into the iPhone product line offers exciting ways to interact with our smartphones. User gestures such as taps and holds will allow the iOS 9 software to understand the intent of the user as they request to view content on their iPhone. For a quick peek or a request to see secondary menus, 3D Touch will help iPhone users to get the information they want on the go without waiting around. An eventual next step for Apple could be to remove the home button in favour of touch sensors, but considering how rare it is for Apple to make drastic body changes to s models, this would be a significant step. 20.47 Want to know how long it is until you can pre-order your new iPhone 6s? Look no further: The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are available to pre-order in 20.44 We've had a few confirmations about who will be stocking the new devices. Safe to assume all the UK operators will have the new iPhones, but only Vodafone and Three have confirmed so far. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will also be available at Carphone Warehouse and Currys PC World. 20.35 Has anyone noticed how much Tim Cook looks like Paul O'Grady? Apple CEO Tim Cook introduces the new iPad Pro during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California Photo: Reuters Paul O'Grady delves into Bob Monkhouse's personal archive 20.27 Rhiannon is getting a demo of how you can navigate Apple TV's content using Siri's voice commands, though these photos don't give much away: 20.25 First reactions already in on the new iPhones. Ernest Doku, technology expert at uSwitch.com, says: The iPhone 6s takes the popular redesign of last year's iPhone, and revamps it both inside and out. Stronger glass and a new aluminium body should put 'bendgate' to bed once and for all, while the widely-anticipated 3D Touch delivers a new way to interact with our phones. Rarely does Apple innovate for innovation's sake. 3D Touch takes established functionality and embeds it in a phone, meaning this isn’t a gimmick, it’s a natural evolution - much like Fingerprint ID. Peek and pop introduces pressure sensitivity, enabling multitasking throughout the device and breathing new life into once familiar apps, complete with vibration feedback for physical confirmation of actions. Whilst Apple doesn't traditionally engage in resolution wars, introducing a camera that can record in 4K resolution means this new device truly delivers bleeding edge technology. This is an iPhone 7 in all but name. Given the engineering tweaks, 3D Touch and a rose gold version, Apple could probably have got away with naming it so. 20.21 And that's it. Tim Cook waves goodbye to the audience and the live stream is over... phew! 20.18 And they're doing ANOTHER song! Lead singer just said something about being drafted in at the last minute... wonder what that's about? 20.15 Here's a lovely information grid on the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus from our new formats department: 20.12 They're doing another song, while the audience taps away furiously on laptops. 20.07 And it's time for a music act. Tim Cook announces... One Republic. (Sorry Taylor Swift fans!) here's a Vine from Rhiannon: 20.06 He's thanking the people from Apple who have worked on all the new products. 20.05 Tim Cook winding up. Will there be one more thing? 20.02 iOS9 will be available from September 16th. Capacity for iCloud from 50GB for $0.99 per month. 20.00 Pricing same as iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Tht's $199 up to $399 for the 6, and $299 to $399 for the 6 Plus. Meanwhile, the 6 and 6 Plus both decrease by $100. You can preorder from Sepetember 12th and they'll be available from September 25th. 19.59 He's emphasised the \"eco-friendly\" credentials a couple of times today. 19.58 There's a new Android app that makes it easier to transfer all your data over to an iPhone. Schiller says it's \"the neighbourly thing to do\". 19.57 Schiller insists they are photos, not videos. They are 12MP high-quality photos, but Apple extends the capture before and after. Apparently they dont; take up much storage space and you can view them on your phone or watch or any apple product. 19.55 He shows how you can press with 3D Touch on your photo and it will come to life (bit weird). They can also have sound... so kind of like a 2-second video really. 19.51 Ooh now you can shoot 4K videos on the iPhones (that's 8 million pixels, according to Apple). You can also edit them on the iPhone (but not watch them on Apple TV as far as we know). 19.49 He's showing us some pretty pictures taken on a phone. Some scenes and some birds. They looks pretty detailed and sharp. 19.47 Now we're seeing Siri on the iPhone, as well as the new 12-megapixel camera, which should make photos sharper and more detailed. There's also a thing called \"deep trench isolation\" which helps to reproduce more accurate colours apparently. 19.44 Andy Wafer from Pixeltoys is showing how the A9 chip makes his game look great on an iPhone 6s. Loads of special effects simultaneously at 60fps. 19.41 Schiller is back and says the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will use the A9 chip, which is \"optimised for real-word use\"... well you would hope so! 19.40 3D touch also makes it possible to navigate across apps. If you apply force on the edge of the screen it allows you to flick between different app cards and open up the one you want. 19.37 Craig Federighi shows how you can hold down on an email message to \"peek\" at the contents, and then either let go to return to your inbox or tap to open it up properly. 19.35 Apple now has a more advances method of haptic feedback. The taptic engine has been updates so it can give different feedback for different gesture touch commands. 19.31 They're made from aerospace-grade aluminium, and there's a rose gold version. They feature \"3D Touch\" (which presumably is the same idea as force touch). As well as gestures, the iPhone now recognises force, for \"peeking\" and certain functions Phil Schiller Apple iPhone 6s 6s Plus Phil Schiller Apple iPhone 6s 6s Plus 19.29 They're called the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Tim says while they may look familiar, Apple has changed everything about the new iPhones. They're the most advanced iPhones ever. 19.27 He's introducing the newest iPhones and the first thingw e're seeing is animated screensavers - which were widely rumoured and already appear on the Apple Watch. 19.26 Tim Cook is back and we're onto iPhones. The iPhone 6 is the most popular iPhone ever, he says. 19.24 Apple TV features a 64-bit A8 chip, and power, HDMI and ethernet connections. The remote communicates by Bluetooth, and can also control TV volume so no need for another remote. There's a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope, and 3-month battery life. TV OS is available for developers today. Oh, and it will cost $149. 19.22 Now sports on Apple TV. You can watch two games side by side, or swipe back and forth on the Apple remote to switch between different games. You can also get notifications on one game while watching another. 19.19 Now we're hearing about how you can use Apple TV for online shopping. Get a virtual fashion show in your living room and buy straight through the TV. (This is using the Gilt app for Apple TV by the way) 19.18 Apple TV welcomed by the gaming industry. Jason Kingsley, co-founder of Oxford-based games developer Rebellion and chairman of TIGA, says: Apple excels at making tech products for non-tech people. Tonight is no exception. The new Apple TV will help to widen our market, which from the UK games makers’ viewpoint is fantastic. It’s a developer’s dream to have your work played by an expanding class of consumers. Just in time for Christmas too. Whether talking mobile or console, there is always a physical interface challenge which can enhance or diminish which games are successful dependent on the platform. It’s hard to translate the same experience from modest mobile screens to large TV ones. It will be interesting to see which new contenders surface. For Apple’s App store it might enable a much needed shake-up as whenever there’s a ‘new toy’ to play with, there are disruptive companies which rise to the top to capitalise on new gameplay styles and take over from previous platform titans. Change helps creative ideas thrive, but impacts heavily on entrenched business models. 19.16 John Carter from Harmonix on stage now, introducing a new game called BeatSports designed specifically for Apple TV. It's showing how you interact with new remote controllers that let you swing, swipe and click. Apple TV gaming Photo: Bloomberg 19.12 Now seeing a demo of the game Crossy Road on Apple TV. There's a multiplayer mode that lets you play with family and friends. 19.08 Apple TV gives access to prime time TV shows from Hulu, as well as games - including Disney Infinity and Guitar Hero 19.07 You can also filter by genre, or age range. If you ask \"who stars in this?\" it will being up a list of actors. You can also ask abouyt sports stores and weather and it will bring the details up on a bar at the bottom of the screen. 19.02 The home screen gives access to movies tv shows, the app store, photos and apps. With Siri, you can say \"hey, I just missed what she said\", and it will skip back 15 seconds and temporarily turn on subtitles. 18.59 Eddy Cue is on stage talking about voice and touch. With the Siri remote, you hold down the Siri button and say something like \"show me funny TV shows\", and it will bring up a list of comedies. Eddy Cue and Apple TV Photo: REUTERS 18.58 Cook announces the new Apple TV and plays a video. At the moment it's looking not unlike any other set-top box or smart TV interface. 18.57 He says the future of television is apps. This transition has already begun, with things like Netflix and Hulu, and experiencing TV through an app makes you realise how much better it is. Apple wants a new platform for TV featuring powerful hardware, a modern OS, a new user experience, new developer tools and a new app store. 18.55 Tim Cook is back and onto Apple TV. He says it's the golden age of television, but the TV experience hasn't changed that much in decades. Today Apple says it's going to do something about that. 18.53 Now the iPad mini 4. It's got the specs of the iPad Air 2 in a smaller form factor. That's all they're telling us 18.52 Apple is now showing a video telling us everything we've just heard again. Phew! Breather. 18.50 Schiller is back, summing up. the iPad Pro has a 12.9-inch retina display, an A9X chip, 4-speaker audio, 10-hour battery life, a 8MP camera. It comes in silver, gold and space grey and starts at $799 for 32GB, version. The pencil costs $99 and the keyboard costs $169, available from September. 18.47 Now we're seeing how the iPad Pro can be used to visualise human anatomy. Irene Walsh is rotating a tibia on the screen and showing how a skeleton and muscles interact. Presumably this is to emphasis the medical applications of the device. 18.44 Observations from Rhiannon Williams in the room: Tim Cook is sitting between Craig Federighi and Eddy Cue in the front row.

Word and Excel can also run side by side. 18.38 Here's a graphic showing the iPad Pro specs: 18.37 Oh wow, Microsoft is there to talk about Office for iPad. This is definitely a first. 18.34 You can use it as a pencil a pen, a paintbrush or a caligraphy pen, and charges using a lightning connector on the base.

It has a smart connector for transferring power and data. ipad pro smart keyboard presented by apple's phil schiller 18.29 iPad Pro has a 4-speaker audio system which balances left and right. Despite having a larger spcreen area, it only weighs 3lbs more than the iPad Air 18.25 The new A9X chip is 1.8x faster - which Schiller claims is desktop-class performance -a nd the GPU performance has gone up 360 times. He claims it's 80 per cent faster than 80 per cent of the portable PCs available today. 18.24 The iPad Pro has a 12.9-inch display, which is the same as the Macbook. It has 5.6 million pixels. 18.22 Phil Schiller is on stage talking about the larger display. You can have a fill size software keyboard, a piano keyboard, and the multi-tasking in iOS 9 were designed with this in mind 18.21 It's the iPad Pro! (Surprise). Tim Cook says it's the most powerful and capable iPad created. iPad Pro Apple Photo: Apple 18.19 Tim Cook is back and he's onto the iPad. Today he says it's \"the biggest news in iPad since the iPad\". 18.16 Apple is introducing two new Apple Watch finishes - rose gold and anodised aluminium, and a bunch of new straps - including that rumoured red sports band. New models shipping today, and watchOS 2 from September 16. 18.15 Jeff Williams is back and is now talking about the Watch collection.

Most of them appear to be wearing black - a trivute to Steve Jobs perhaps? 17.52 The live stream has started and we can hear Zane Lowe on Beats1 radio as the camera pans over the audience. 17.50 Rhiannon Williams is inside the 7,000-seat Bill Graham Civic Auditorium and says it is already packed: inside apple event apple event inside apple event inside 17.45 This is your 15 minute call... last chance to go and make a cup of tea 17.35 Interested in how today's announcement could affect Apple's share price?

Let us know using the poll below: 17.16 Former Telegraph technology editor, and current MP for Boston and Skegness, Matt Warman, assures me he's been following the live blog all day.

Last week a marketing firm started its own campaign begging Apple to name their impending iPhone the iPhone 7 to avoid confusion with their own name. In what some might perceive as a shameless PR stunt, US-based 6S Marketing has purchased billboard space in Times Square asking Apple to buck their naming convention and jump straight to the iPhone 7. They also parked a truck with the same billboard outside the fifth avenue Apple store. Not a shameless marketing stunt: 6S Marketing's truck parked outside the fifth avenue Apple store 16.51 What to see how far Apple has come since 2007?

According to App Annie, there are now 11,469 Apple Watch apps live in the iOS App Store - a notable increase from the 6,352 apps in June, and the 7,567 in July. The company is also expected to unveil some new straps for the Apple Watch, including a red version of the Apple Watch Sport band.

Huge crowds have already gathered and there's a large police presence to keep order. 16.15 Ahead of the new iPhone launch, the National Trading Standards eCrime Team is urging consumers to be on the lookout for criminals trying to exploit the hype by flooding popular social media platforms with misleading adverts and bogus offers. The team has already spotted misleading advertising on social media sites leading to a mock-up of a BBC News article: Now the team is warning people to be aware of these scams, and if in any doubt to report them to Citizens Advice via the consumer helpline on 03454 04 05 06. 16.07 Apple's Phil Schiller has tweeted ahead of the event, amid teasing that he uses a lot of superlatives in his keynotes: Incredibly excited for today! (Probably will run out of superlatives) http://t.co/i78Nzio9qb — Philip Schiller (@pschiller) September 9, 2015 15.58 Two hours to go until the big event kicks off in San Francisco. You may think we've covered a lot already but there's so much more to come. Let's just hope it's not in German ... 15.52 You may have noticed that Apple's iPhones have been getting bigger over the years, with rumours suggesting the new devices will be the biggest yet. See how they've grown: 15.39 Wondering which apps to download on your new iPhone? The Telegraph has launched a new site featuring 500 must-have apps for iOS and Android. Check it out here .

After the events of this week, I've decided to put 1989 on Apple Music...and happily so. — Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) June 25, 2015 Try to contain your excitement. Taylor Swift Photo: Rex Features 15.13 One interesting aspect of the Apple TV story is the integration of artificial intelligence into everyday devices. Mike Weston, chief executive of data science consultancy Profusion, comments: When most people think of artificial intelligence their mind conjures up images of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. However, the truth is that artificial intelligence is now all around us even in Apple TV. Siri runs on machine learning – complex algorithms that adapt to new information without the need to be rewritten – a form of artificial intelligence. So too are the recommendations you receive for TV show or movies. The more data scientists experiment with and develop these algorithms the more accurate and powerful they will become. We’re only at the start of the journey, artificial intelligence will soon be what we rely on to run self-driving cars, the Internet of Things and smart cities. In the not so distant future, data science techniques such as machine learning will play a crucial role in all our lives, businesses and the economy in general. 15.01 The latest rumours about the iPhone 6s suggest that it will feature a \" 3D Touch Display \" - a revamped version of the pressure-sensitive screen and touchpad current used in the Apple Watch and new MacBook, known as Force Touch . The new screens will be able to differentiate between three modes; a tap, a press and a prolonged press - an advancement on the press/long press sensitivity of the Watch and Mac, according to 9to5Mac.

We can’t wait to show you what we’ve been working on. http://t.co/DeBsAD67p5 pic.twitter.com/DLIPTK2m1L — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) September 9, 2015 That may seem early to you, but in an interview with The Telegraph in February, Mr Cook revealed he wakes up at 3:45 every morning ! 14.13 Speaking of iPads, Apple is expected to unveil its long-rumoured iPad Pro at tonight's event. Reports suggest the iPad Pro will measure between 12.2 and 12.9 inches, with dimensions of 305.3 x 220.8 x 7mm. It could also come with a stylus, despite Steve Jobs saying this in 2007: Find out everything you need to know about the iPad Pro here 14.08 In the UK, Apple is expected to account for a 32.2 per cent share of smartphone users this year, compared to 30.8 per cent last year, according to analysts at eMarketer. Meanwhile, Android will account for 56.2 per cent of UK smartphone users this year, compared to 55.9 per cent last year. eMarketer expects there to be 16.7 million iPad users in the UK in 2015, representing 25.6 per cent of the country's total population. That figure also represents 51.0 per cent of UK tablet users, down from 53.0 per cent share of all tablet users last year. 13.59 Interesting piece in Bloomberg Business , showing that Apple's dependence on the financial success of the iPhone continues to grow: For Apple, nothing matters as much as the iPhone http://t.co/F0FhQA3k0M pic.twitter.com/ZNzeXewtek — Bloomberg Business (@business) September 9, 2015 13.53 Oh dear, looks like the Sony Mobile social media team is a bit too keen to jump on the Apple hype bandwagon: #SonyBanter pic.twitter.com/1XbbEbsxx8 — Sony Xperia (@sonyxperia) September 9, 2015 13.48 One of the more talked about features of the new Apple TV box is integration with Siri voice control, through a tool known as \"universal search\". This would allow users to search Apple TV content from both iTunes and video streaming services, and find the shows they want to watch more easily. It could also give media publishers a new way to both promote exclusive content and differentiate their content programming, as universal search will expose content gaps in competitive offerings, according to David Mendels, CEO of Brightcove. Data from Strategy Analytics shows that TV trailers are still by far the most common way for people to find out what TV/video programming is available, followed by browsing the electronic programme guide and word of mouth. New methods such as social media and automated recommendations are still relatively unpopular: 13.29 Over in San Francisco, Apple has been busy getting the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium ready for the big event, with flags and banners featuring Apple logos: Apple plants its flag at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium http://t.co/CbbJeWJnJ5 pic.twitter.com/B0AVeuIFOZ — Cult of Mac (@cultofmac) September 5, 2015 Apple Decorating Bill Graham Civic Auditorium #AppleEvent #iPhone6S pic.twitter.com/vTxHBtDugD — AR7 (@AR72014) September 5, 2015 Giant Apple Logo Going Up At Bill Graham Civic Auditorium: http://t.co/o61LrqAszU pic.twitter.com/gtS6gSiWwB — Hoodline (@HoodlineSF) September 5, 2015 13.20 Don't forget, today's event isn't all about iPhones. One of the more interesting announcements is expected to be a new version of Apple's set-top box, Apple TV - perhaps even with a digital TV subscription service to compete with Netflix and Amazon Instant Prime Video. Will Apple unveil the fourth generation of its Apple TV box? Forrester analyst James McQuivey notes: Original programming is the only solution to Apple's biggest problem in the video world:3410094 nobody wants to sell Apple content rights. And why would they? After watching what happened to the music business when Apple was given the keys to the kingdom, video producers and programmers are more than gun shy about handing the same power to Apple in the world of TV shows. Add to that, Apple is coming into the game after Netflix and Amazon have already bid up programming costs, not to mention established a thriving marketplace of content designed for over-the-top distribution. In other words, Apple's opportunity to shape the market is gone, they're just joining this program already in progress. Even Microsoft tried the original content strategy before Apple did, partnering with names as big as Steven Spielberg, even though that never came to fruition. 13.08 In anticipation of the launch of the iPhone 6s, comparethemarket.com has ‎conducted a flash poll of its users and has found that, despite the excitement, most people will not be switching to the new phone immediately. Although comparethemarket.com anticipates a huge spike in tariff enquiries, driven by interest in the best deals and special offers, the flash poll of \"cost-conscious consumers\" ‎found that only 6 per cent would consider breaking their current contract in favour of getting the new iPhone 6s - whilst nearly half (48 per cent) will wait at least six months, and up to a year, before upgrading to the new iPhone in hope that prices will come down. 13.02 Here's something else that might excite you. It looks like there could be a PINK version of the new iPhone 6s: Will the iPhone 6s be pink? Photo: http://ww.daliulian.net/ Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities had previously suggested there would be a rose gold version of the iPhone 6s along with the traditional gold, silver and grey versions. However, these images posted by Chinese rumour site Daliulian.net show devices that appear to be more baby pink than rose gold. 12.49 What will the new iPhones look like? As usual, there have been loads of leaks ahead of tonight's event, giving us a pretty good idea if what to expect. These pictures of the outer casing, leaked to 9to5Mac , suggest that the new models will look almost identical to the old models: 9to5Mac obtained images of what appears to be the iPhone 6s Photo: 9to5Mac However, they could be slightly bigger and thicker than the iPhone 6 models. These photos leaked to MacRumours shows the device measuring 138.19mm tall and 67.68mm wide, compared to 138.1mm and 67.0mm for the corresponding measurements on the iPhone 6. It is also expected to be 0.2mm thicker than its predecessor at 7.1mm. Photo: MacRumours This could be due to a change in the aluminum being used for the shell, thickening of weak spots in the case - to help address concerns over bending - or new support for \"Force Touch\" functionality in the display. Check out our full picture gallery of leaked pictures , to get a better idea of what to expect. 12.34 Analysts are already weighing in on what the announcements tonight could mean for Apple. Jeremy Davies, chief executive and co-founder at CONTEXT, says: There will be those who ask whether we really do need another iPhone. Individually, maybe not, but Apple does. The consistent renewal and refresh is not only to keep up the competitive pressure on rivals, but to ensure that first time buyers are swayed by the latest models, loyal iPhone users have reasons to upgrade, and people switching from Android - already at record numbers according to Apple - have even greater incentives to change. 12.22 Good afternoon, Sophie Curtis here, taking over the live blog for the rest of the day. Here's a GIF of the message currently showing on Apple's online store: Apple Store Photo: Apple 12:15 - APPLE STORE GOES DOWN Don't panic - this happens every time before a big launch, because Apple updates it with new information following the event. This is what you get when you try to go on: Apple store down 11:50 - What does Siri say about what's happening? Apple's event invitation, which was sent out a couple of weeks ago, bore only the words \"Hey Siri, give us a hint\" . Apple's September 9 media invitation Photo: Apple We asked Siri for a few hints , but nothing it said was particuarly helpful: 11:30 - Today's event is probably going to Apple's biggest-ever It looks like there's going to be lots to go through tonight. Apple usually holds two events in the autumn - a September one for the iPhone and then an October one for the iPad. This year, it's apparently going to be different. Whispers going around San Francisco suggest that Apple isn't going to hold a October event this year. Which means that as well as new iPhones and an Apple TV tonight, Apple is going to have to announce everything it might have unveiled next month. Most significantly, this means iPads - the company is believed to have developed a bigger \"iPad Pro\" - but other things we might be waiting for, such as details of the Apple Watch's new software and Apple Music for Android could come tonight. 11:00 - New iPhone will be all Siri, all the time Here's a new tidbit. Apparently Siri is getting a big upgrade today that means you'll be able to talk to it whenever you want. Currently, Siri is activated by holding down on the home button, or holding your iPhone to your hear (does anyone do this?). If your iPhone's plugged in, however, Siri responds whenever you say \"Hey, Siri\". But according to 9to5Mac , this feature will now be turned on all the time in the new iPhone. Always listening, always alert. I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords. 10:30 - Your old iPhone is about to plunge in value See that iPhone in your hand? It's depreciating in value as you read this. Trade-in website CompareMyMobile has put together a graphic of what happened to second-hand iPhone prices when the 6 and 6 Plus launched last year. They seem to hold up for a little bit but fall spectacularly after that. Interactive: iPhonegraph 10:05 - Exciting box news! Dutch website TechTastic has a picture of what it claims is the packaging for the new iPhone, which appears to back up the suggestion that the 6s will incorporate the animated screensavers of the Apple Watch . This had already been expected , but if you want a look at a torn, slightly grubby version of what your box might look like, here you go. iPhone packaging Photo: TechTastic 09:43 - More about that camper Via Mashable , we have more details about Australia Tent Man, whose name is Lindsay Handmer. It seems that the website he's plugging is his own, and he's also raising money for charity. Here's what he had to say: \"I thought I was really original … and then I googled it, and people have done it in every [Apple] line for the past few years.\" Either way, thanks to time zones he'll be the first person to buy the new iPhone from an Apple store when it goes on sale. Let's hope he fares better than the man who was at the front of the queue last year . 09:30 - What Apple's venue tells us about the event Back to San Francisco. One interesting thing we do know about today's event is that it's being held in the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium , a 7,000 capacity venue. This is a lot bigger than Apple's usual venues - last year it used the Flint Centre which seats 2,400. What gives? It's unlikely Apple is inviting this many journalists, PRs and other assorted special guests. Here's a bit of speculation from well-connected Apple blogger John Gruber : Remember that white pop-up building Apple built outside the Flint Center last year? It was a big hands-on area for all the new stuff that had been announced that day. My guess is that Apple is building something similar again this year — inside the auditorium. It would be like the world’s biggest Apple Store, for one day only. Apple always has a big \"hands on\" area at its events. If it's unveiling an Apple TV, it's going to need a lot of space for a lot of televisions. The outside of the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium Photo: AP 09:15 - ALERT: We already have people camping outside stores You know those bands of campers that always line up outside Apple stores the night before new iPhones go on sale? Well it's hit a whole new level this year. Nothing has even been announced yet, let alone put on sale, but someone in Sydney is already camping outside the store. Can anyone be that big a fan of Apple? Oh, no, wait: it's a marketing stunt for a website called mysparetech.com. A sizeable proportion of the people in Apple queues these days are walking adverts. Oh my. Peak Apple. Someone is queuing in Sydney before THEY HAVE EVEN ANNOUNCED ANYTHING!!! pic.twitter.com/G16X0ze8eN — Seamus Byrne (@seamus) September 8, 2015 09:05 - What to expect What can we expect tonight? Well, Apple likes to maintain an aura of secrecy around its events, but since there's a complicated supply chain in Asia and a huge amount of interest, there are inevitably some leaks. In a nutshell, we're probably getting new iPhones - the 6s and the 6s Plus - which will look a lot like the 6 and 6 Plus, but with a couple of new features. Perhaps more interestingly, we'll also get a new Apple TV, which is going to be a big upgrade on the last version. Years ago, Apple boss Tim Cook called Apple TV \"a hobby\", but he's talked about it in more glowing terms recently, highlighting impressive sales figures. For the lowdown on everything to expect, head here . And there's a great history of the Apple TV here . Or check out our vid below. 09:02 Morning! James Titcomb here. We'll be with you through all the build-up and predictions ahead of tonight's event, which starts at 6pm. If you also want to tune in, we have a very handy guide to how to do that here . If you don't have an Apple device, I'm afraid you're out of luck, but that's what we're here for. 09:00 Apple is holding an event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco today, where it is expected to unveil its latest iPhones - thought to be called the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus - as well as a new version of the Apple TV set-top box and possibly an iPad Pro. The event starts at 6pm BST this evening, and we'll be posting updates here throughout the day.
