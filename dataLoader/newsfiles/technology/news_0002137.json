This order was received in the third quarter of 2015 and is expected to ship in the third and fourth quarter of 2015. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150923/270289 \n\"We're currently in a climate where what we do as law enforcement officers is increasingly put under a microscope,\" says Police Director Toney Armstrong . \"The body cameras will not only help capture a thorough record of every police incident, but it will also help foster a relationship with our community built on trust and accountability.\" \n\"If our Axon cameras were a revolution in police technology, Axon Signal is this technology's newest evolution. By programming our cameras to turn on automatically, we reduce the possibility for user error, which helps to ensure the sorts of overwhelmingly positive results we've seen in dozens of agencies across the country,\" says TASER Founder and CEO Rick Smith . \"We couldn't be more thrilled to be offering this new technology, and we are extremely excited to see major agencies like the Memphis PD beginning to adopt it.\" \nAbout Axon Signal: \nOur Axon Signal technology integrates with TASER's increasingly iconic Axon Flex body-worn camera, offering automatic activation integrated with TASER's SmartWeapons and light bar. Axon Signal will activate all enabled cameras within range to ensure events are not missed and multiple perspectives are captured, thereby reducing the potential for user error and bolstering the overall effects of the cameras. Axon Signal has already been adopted by a number of agencies, including Mobile, AL and Lakeway, TX. Learn more here: www.Axon.io/signal . \nTASER's Axon cameras are small, yet highly visible, and can be attached securely to sunglasses, a cap, a shirt collar, or a head mount. They are powered by a pocket-sized battery pack, which ensures recording capability during an entire shift. When recording, the cameras capture a wide-angle, full-color view of what an officer is facing. The video automatically uploads via a docking station to Evidence.com, a cloud-based storage and management system, where it can be easily accessed for review. The video files stored online or on the Axon video camera are secure and cannot be tampered with. \nEvidence.com helps law enforcement capture, manage, and share their digital evidence without the complexity or cost of installing in-house servers. It enables greater transparency through seamless integration with the industry-leading Axon body-worn video cameras. Evidence.com is the most secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for managing all types of digital evidence. Evidence.com automates the upload process to ensure security and integrity while keeping officers in the field rather than sitting at computers. \nThere have been several studies conducted recently on the positive effects body-worn cameras can have on a police force and community. These studies include a year-long Cambridge University study conducted at the Rialto, CA, Police Department that showed an 88% reduction in citizen complaints and a 60% reduction in uses of force after implementation of TASER's AXON flex cameras. The San Diego Police Department also released a report showing the use of AXON body-worn cameras resulted in a 41% drop in complaints, 60% drop in total allegations and a 47% decline in \"personal body\" force by officers. The use of pepper spray was also reduced by 31%. In a study by Arizona State University , the Mesa Police Department's use of AXON cameras revealed a 48% reduction in citizen complaints against camera officers for misconduct during the study period, and a 75% decline in use of force complaints. \nFollow the TASER and Axon brand here: -- Axon on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Axon/117780381886687 -- TASER on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TASER.International -- Axon on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AxonTechnology -- TASER on Twitter: https://twitter.com/OfficialTASER \nAbout TASER International, Inc. \nTASER International makes communities safer with innovative public safety technologies.
