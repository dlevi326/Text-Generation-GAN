She immediately rang her husband after assuming the package contained drugs. He told her to call the police. \nOfficers responded saying that an aircraft probably dropped the load while smuggling drugs from Mexico to the US. \nPolice chief Derek Arnson said that it was the first time in his career that he had seen damage to a house done by drugs dropped from the sky. \nHe said: “Someone definitely made a mistake, and who knows what the outcome of that mistake might be for them,” \nThe drugs are now in police custody after the family handed them in. \nThe family will have to pay the money for the repairs to their house themselves, and buy a new house for the dog. \nMrs. Donnelly said that friends and family had joked that she should have kept the drugs to pay for the repairs. \nShe said: “That’s what everybody says: ‘Why did you call 911?' But how can you have a clear conscience, right? We could have made lots of home repairs with that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T14:53:41.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
