The Pacifica app launched just 6 months ago on both iOS and Android, and has already signed up more than 300,000 users. Its rapid organic growth can be attributed to the quality of the tools as well as the supportive communities. Unlike its competitors, Pacifica offers a holistic set of activities for managing stress and anxiety based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, mindfulness & wellness. Over time, users can learn which activities work best for them.\nPacifica 2.0 is based on 6 months of learning and makes the app’s experience even more empathetic and enjoyable. For starters, when users rate their mood each day, Pacifica will now suggest a matching activity to help. Each activity is guided by the app and takes less than 5 minutes to complete. “The point is to help folks take a proactive approach to improving their mood. So if you’re feeling anxious, let’s do something about it,” said Chris Goettel, the designer of Pacifica.\nAdditionally, thousands of users participate in Pacifica’s communities where they openly share personal stories about their own experiences with stress and anxiety. With the new release, users will now be able to comment on each other’s posts, creating an opportunity for additional discussion and peer support.\nPacifica 2.0 launched 9/8/15 and is available now for download on both iOS and Android.\n###\nABOUT PACIFICA LABS\nThere are over 40 million people in the United States who have an anxiety disorder yet only one-third of those suffering receive treatment.

The app is based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness, and focuses on being a solution for anyone experiencing stress, anxiety and depression - in particular students, working professionals and parents. The app has been showcased in BuzzFeed, Bustle, Upworthy, and Fast Company and was featured in Apple’s App Store.
