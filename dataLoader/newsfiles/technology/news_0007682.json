This enhancement applies to students and alumni ordering from institutions utilizing the TranscriptsPlus(®) ordering platform. \nAfter a successful launch with the Schools of Public Health Application Service (SOPHAS) on August 28(th), the remaining seventeen application services shown below are now live with PDF receiving. Credentials collects a student's unique User ID during the transcript ordering process and automatically generates an XML header for each PDF to expedite processing. \nOver the last 12 months, Credentials schools have sent nearly 45,000 paper transcripts to Liaison. In past experiences deploying PDFs with AMCAS and LSAC, Credentials has sent almost 60% of applicant transcripts electronically. As a result, the entire process has been streamlined for Liaison, allowing for more efficient application processing. It also gives students peace of mind by shortening the amount of time it takes for transcripts to reach their destinations. As the Credentials eScrip-Safe Network continues to grow, the percentage of PDFs sent will increase, resulting in an even greater financial impact. \nThe application services covered by this enhancement are: AADSAS Associated American Dental Schools Application Service AAPIC Association of Psychology Postdoc Internship Center ADEA PASS American Dental Education Association Postdoctoral Application Support Service AHCAS Allied Health Centralized Application Service CASPA Application Service Physician's Assistants CSDCAS Communication Science & Disorders Application Service DHCAS ADEA Dental Hygiene Centralized Application Service DICAS Dietetic Internship Central Application System HAMPCAS Healthcare Administration, Management & Policy Centralized Application Service NDCAS Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine Application Service NURSINGCAS Nursing's Centralized Application Service OPCAS Orthotics & Prosthetics Application Service OPTOMCAS Optometry Centralized Application Service OTCAS Occupational Therapy Centralized Application Service PHARMCAS Pharmacy College Application Service PTCAS Physical Therapist Centralized Application Service SOPHAS Schools of Public Health Application Service VMCAS American Veterinary Medical Colleges \nAbout Credentials Solutions Credentials Solutions develops innovative transcript solutions to fit the unique needs of higher education.
