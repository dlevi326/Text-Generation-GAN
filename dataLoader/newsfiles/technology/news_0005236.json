I just picture that scene when he was confronted by a mob with whatever armament in their hands. It is said that, he knelt down and prayed. How pathetic it was!\nI was watching TV on the day of his beatification and I heard Pope Francis addressing thousands of Catholics about the beatification of Daswa. Everybody in each and every corner of the world, who was watching TV when Pope was speaking, has heard the name Benedict Daswa. Today Daswa is known to the world posthumously. Little did his killers know that killing him would ultimately make him popular.\nThere are some people who are being called martyrs of faith. But when one follows what prompted them to be called as such; the reasons that are given are not strong and convincing enough for them to be called so. Unlike Daswa, regardless of whatever odd, he remained firm and unshakable in his faith. Faith in prayer, that a lightning strike is not an act of witchcraft but an act of nature. He sustained his faith that people cannot be killed because they were suspected to be witches. He refused to join the fellow villagers in consulting an inyanga about a lightning strike that burnt down huts. It is therefore that his killers took advantage of his faith to end his life, since they regarded him as trouble maker for not cooperating with them with what they were doing.\nIt is unmistakably true that he is indeed martyr of faith because he prayed when he found himself face to face with death. He lived with his faith and sustained it until the last minute of his life. He did not sacrifice to do what he believed to be wrong at the expense of his faith. He knew very well that even if he had gone through the deepest darkness, he would not be afraid because the Lord was with him. I regard him like Stephen in the Bible who was stoned to death for his faith.\nI believe that the beatification of Daswa is not only a thing for the Catholics, but it affects all of us as human beings, especially that he was a victim of crime. Crime affects all of us regardless of our religious and denominational status. Let us take his beatification as a strong message that killing of people suspected to be witches, witch hunt and killing of people for muti must stop.\nWe must all of us as South Africans live in harmony and refrain from wrong and criminal activities like what Benedict Daswa was killed for.\nRev Maudu Morudu\nTemba, HAMMANSKRAAL\nPO Box 1934\nHAMMANSKRAAL\n0400\nCell: 0780694844", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T12:06:40.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
