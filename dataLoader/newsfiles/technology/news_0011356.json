The Samburu community of Laikipia County uses water both at home and to raise the thousands of goats, sheep and cattle they keep as their sole source of livelihood.\nBut he also knew that it would be almost impossible to find reliable data on groundwater in the thirsty area.\nWachira spent weeks checking with fellow drillers, local non-governmental organisations and ranchers in the area to see if they had any statistics to help him figure out where the water was, whether it was good to use and how much was available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:05:40.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
