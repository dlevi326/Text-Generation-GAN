Divided into local and final rounds, the competition challenges students to design a start-up business offering a product or service that can improve our communities and the way we live. \n\"Entrepreneurship today knows no age limit, and young people are more inspired than ever when it comes to reimagining the way we live,\" said Sarah Day, Senior Vice President of Small Business and Consumer at Windstream. \"As part of Windstream's commitment to technology and education, we wanted to give students a creative outlet and the opportunity to experience what it's like to walk in the shoes of an entrepreneur and bring a start-up to life.\" \nHigh school students in Lincoln, Lexington and Sugar Land may enter the Smart Tomorrow contest individually or in teams of two. The contest is divided into two parts to determine local finalists and the overall winner. For the local round, students will provide an overview of their start-up idea using WordPress, a free, user-friendly website platform to explain the company's mission, how it operates, its founders and more. \nOne winner will be selected from Lincoln, Lexington and Sugar Land to advance to the finals, where they will be tasked with creating a short, 2-3 minute video as if they are pitching the business to a team of investors. All three videos will be hosted on Inc.com for one week to allow visitors to vote for their favorite start-up idea. The results of the online vote will be considered alongside a vote from Windstream and an industry expert to determine the overall winner. \nThe winning student(s) will receive $20,000 and an additional $20,000 for their school's parent-teacher association. Further, the two runners-up will receive $5,000 and matching donation of $5,000 for their parent-teacher association. \nDeadlines to Know: Entry forms are due by 11:59 pm CT on Wednesday, October 7, 2015 WordPress sites must be complete and submitted by 11:59 pm CT on Wednesday, November 11, 2015 For finalists, videos are due by 11:59 pm CT on Monday, January 11, 2016 \nFor more information and contest materials students can visit www.windstream.com/startupchallenge .
