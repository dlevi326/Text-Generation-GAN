The new 6s model has a better camera, faster processor and a pressure-sensitive screen for the first time. \nQueues formed outside Apple Stores around the world as the new phones went on sale on Friday. \nThe company's chief executive Tim Cook said of the figures: \"Sales for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any previous first weekend sales results in Apple's history. \n\"Customers' feedback is incredible and they are loving 3D Touch and Live Photos, and we can't wait to bring iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus to customers in even more countries on October 9.\" \nFollowing the launch of the iPhone 6 last year, Apple went on to see more than 70 million units in three months, and post the largest ever quarterly profit by a public company in history of £11.8 billion. \nThere had been suggestions that given the huge sales last year, and the modest upgrades on the device that demand could drop, however the addition of China as a launch day country for the first time is likely to have boosted demand once again. \nApple confirmed the new iPhones will also launch in 40 more countries on October 9, and reach 130 countries by the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T17:27:46.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
