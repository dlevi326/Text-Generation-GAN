In some cases the entire article would be skipped merely to read the comment section and take a position based purely on the title of the article and peoples responses. Thus the editor in his alleged wisdom determined to make a fundamental change and cut the entire section. The problem though is that he, and all the yes men, miss the point entirely.\nIn 1994 when the ANC won their first election there was much animosity between clusters of people, in some cases is was inter party, in others based upon ethnic lines, much damage was done and individuals and groupings harbored ‘bad blood’ towards one another. In a stroke of genius, Mandela and Tutu dreamed up the Truth and Reconciliation commission, the entire point of which was to allow people to express themselves and be heard, this was not merely for the victims, but also for the perpetrators of heinous crimes, to each a platform to rid themselves of shame, guilt in an attempt to seek redemption in the eyes of the community and the public at large.\nThis is of course not new, after the Vikings went to battle almost 2000 years ago, the men used to sit around in a large circle with their families and friends and explain what they did in the battle. In this way it allowed people to know them, but more importantly allowed them to evict the horror of the moment. In addition to this, Steven Pinkers recent book on the decline of violence, pointed out the benefits (cited South Africa as a case study) of allowing forgiveness in the eyes of the public by open discourse between injured parties, in fact, it is considered one of the only paths to true forgiveness.\nThus whilst I understand the irksome nature of the comments section to the moderators and editor of N24, the reality is that they miss the point of the cathartic benefit achieved by a platform like this. Strong negative members of society have their opinions tempered in a cauldron of counter comment, true that they also attract similar minded individuals, but in most cases they pick up a seed of counter comment that forces them to see that the public at large no longer thinks the way they do, that their thinking is no longer really tolerated and needs to be modified or kept to themselves. Platforms such as this, in my opinion, are critical to allowing an equalization of common thinking regarding topical issues, they are critical in allowing us to know that we are not the only ones out there that disagree with issues that are relevant in our times. It allows to not merely be the victims of media headlines, but to express our opinion and have that opinion tempered by a mass audience who will either reject it or gravitate towards it. In this way, we know we are not alone and together, maybe, have a chance to change ourselves and society at large.\nJust saying.\nJ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T11:23:19.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
