Getty Images There's been fascinating data afoot for digital marketers to learn from in the last week, and we've identified seven particularly interesting numbers for your reading pleasure. Enjoy. 1. Parse.ly looked at four recent episodes of CBS' 60 Minutes and comedian John Oliver's news-based HBO comedy, Last Week Tonight, to see which Sunday evening program was winning the online buzz battle. During that span of time, in terms of all the Web articles written about the two shows, respectively, 60 Minutes had 120,585 pageviews, while Oliver's show got 1.5 million. Wow, that's quite a difference. 2. Remember Serial, the breakout hit podcast of 2014? Well, there's a new season coming this fall, though the company behind the production, Podtrac, hasn't announced the release date. At the Interactive Advertising Bureau's first upfronts event for podcasting on Friday, Podtrac said Serial has been downloaded 100 million times. But here's what's really crazy: After almost a year since its October 2014 debut, Serial is still averaging 1 million downloads a month . 3. Amanda Oleander tried to become a social-media star in recent years, but she only built up her audience to a combined 3,000 followers on Twitter and Instagram. Then she tried her hand at livestreaming app Periscope earlier this year while showing viewers what it's like to be an artist in Los Angeles. Voila! She now has 410,000 Periscope followers , and last month, she signed a deal with United Talent Agency. Read Adweek's guide to livestreaming influencers here . 4. Gilt Groupe said it saw an 85 percent increase in shopping app installs after running an Instagram campaign that promoted downloads. 5. If you are in retail like Gilt is, it's probably never too early to start thinking about holiday-season sales. According to The Trade Desk, nearly half of retailers will likely start their yuletide marketing as early as October. The ad-tech company also found that nearly 47 percent of online holiday traffic last year came from mobile devices . 6. Donald Trump has more Twitter followers— 8 million —than any other presidential candidate in either party. The Republican has over 2 million more than Democrat Hillary Clinton. Check out how other candidates fare here . 7. Social marketing company Mavrck studied 1 million Instagram posts across 2,000 accounts. It found that for each year a user's age increased, there was a 0.15 percent decrease in the number of followers . Read Adweek.com next week for an exclusive look at Mavrck's full findings. Bonus stat that's intriguingly fun but has little to do with digital marketing: A study from Havas Worldwide surveyed 10,000 adults around the world and found that 42 percent admitted to overstating their work duties , while about 60 percent believe other people are pretending to be busier than they really are.
