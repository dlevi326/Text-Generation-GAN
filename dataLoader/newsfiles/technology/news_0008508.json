Macy’s is committed to honoring and recognizing the significant contributions Hispanics have made in entertainment, music and beauty through this campaign,” said Dineen Garcia, Macy’s vice president of Diversity Strategies. “Diversity is at the heart of our business and we look forward to celebrating these achievements with our Hispanic Heritage Month events from coast-to-coast.” \nMario Lopez is an accomplished host, actor and author, currently hosting “Extra” and his own nationally-syndicated radio show, “On With Mario.” He became an overnight teen idol in 1989 playing A.C. Slater on the television sitcom “Saved by the Bell.” He has since appeared in several films and on Broadway, as well as hosted numerous television shows, including “The X Factor” and MTV’s “America’s Best Dance Crew.” \n“I’m grateful to Macy’s for recognizing the significance of Hispanic culture in America, and for providing an opportunity for me to share the importance my family and my heritage have played in my life,” said Lopez, who is first generation Mexican-American. “I am proud of my culture and always hope to be a positive influence for others.” \nWith two Latin Grammy awards under his belt, Don Omar became one of reggaeton’s first international superstars with his debut album “The Last Don” in 2003. He is also an acclaimed actor, known worldwide for his role as Rico Santos in the “The Fast and the Furious” movie franchise. \n\"First and foremost I'd like to thank Macy's for the opportunity and interest in having me participate in such a grand event. A corporation like no other uniting brands of fashion, style and most of all, uniting cultures,” said Omar. “I am a proud Hispanic because it means I am part of a group that has unique cuisines, music, morals and artistic traditions. I am a proud Hispanic because our language has broken barriers and enhanced multiculturalism merging Latino communities while adding respect and honor to the United States of America.\" \nAngel Merino is an international makeup artist and style icon who has worked closely with the industry’s top photographers and celebrity clients such as Christina Milan, Cassie, Mel B and Chanel Iman.
