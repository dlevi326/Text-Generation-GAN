Trimble (NASDAQ: TRMB ) announced today that it has been ranked as the No.1 telematics service provider in ABI Research's 2015 Commercial Telematics Competitive Assessment for a third consecutive year. The annual survey was assessed based on a variety of \"implementation\" and \"innovation\" criteria where Trimble ranked as the top provider for both, which included market share of subscribers, vertical segmentation, quality and reliability, range of product features and organization health. The survey analysed 20 global vendors serving the commercial telematics industry. For over 35 years, Trimble has developed advanced positioning solutions which, today, are used in over 150 countries and span industries ranging from agriculture and construction to geospatial and utilities. For those organizations operating workforces, vehicles and assets out in the field, Trimble technology can provide significant operational efficiencies and improve productivity to transform work processes. As part of its portfolio, telematics has played a central role in Trimble's fleet solutions as an area of both strength and growth, particularly in its Transportation & Logistics and Field Service Management Divisions, which were recognized in the ABI report. ABI Research said that Trimble's success can be attributed to its geographical footprint, wide range of innovative solutions and technology versatility, organic growth, acquisitions and increasing subscriber base. Through its strategic acquisitions, no other company offers the same depth and breadth of products and services to as many verticals in as many countries as Trimble. \"We are extremely pleased to be recognized as the leading telematics service provider by ABI Research for a third consecutive year,\" said Brian McLaughlin , president of PeopleNet, a Trimble Company and part of the Transportation & Logistics Division. \"The ultimate metric of our success is to provide added value to our customers by developing best-in-class solutions that deliver significant operational efficiencies. While we operate globally, our fleet mobility technology is tailored to meet the individual needs of the customers and regions that we serve, ensuring that customer service, driver and vehicle safety and regulatory compliance are met at the highest possible level.\" \"For businesses operating workforces, vehicles and assets out in the field, we have witnessed a clear demand for more flexible, cloud-based solutions to help them in managing all aspects of their field operations,\" said John Cameron , general manager of Trimble's Field Service Management Division. \"Businesses are increasingly looking to integrate their fleet management capabilities with plug-and-play hardware, mobility options, OEM implementations and open platforms, all of which Trimble has added to its portfolio of solutions as part of its innovation strategy.\" While the strength of Trimble's telematics solutions play a central role to the success of its Transportation & Logistics and Field Service Management Divisions, its wider portfolio of solutions position Trimble as an end-to-end, productivity-based solutions provider. As part of its global strategy, Trimble continues to focus on developing solutions and tools to empower workers in the field with enhanced visibility to transform fleet and field service excellence.
