Rumu Banerjee | 21 September 2015, 9:29 AM IST Share NEW DELHI: As autorickshaw apps debut in the city, more drivers are moving to a brand new world. Technology has managed to do what the transport department hasn't in years get autorickshaw drivers go by the meters willingly.The reason, says Anand Subramanian of Ola Cabs, which runs one such service, is that the technology \"guarantees\" the next ride for the autorickshaw driver.\"For those on our platform, it pays to go by the meter. With our app, they are sure to get the next ride, so there's no need to overcharge,\" says the Ola official.It's a point that Mintu Kumar, an app driver, agrees with. \"How much you earn in a day depends on how hard you want to work. I went by meter earlier too, but customers would haggle or be suspicious about my meter. Now, with the app, it's a smooth ride for me,\" adds Kumar.Drivers connected with apps like Ola and Pooch-O, a government app, say that the bonus of working with the app-based services is the \"extra\" they earn. \"The company pays bonus depending on the number of bookings you do. For instance, if you complete five bookings in a day, you are paid Rs 75 per booking. However, you have to do at least three bookings in a day to get that money,\" says Akhtar Ali, another app-driver.Autoricksaw drivers will also have to log in for a minimum of seven to nine hours a day depending on the company. \"Ola pays Rs 50 for every new customer that I get, while Uber pays Rs 100 but only if the new customer books a taxi with them,\" says Beeru, a Burari resident using an app.The earning, say drivers, is not bad. The average is between Rs 700-800 per day on the meter. Besides, drivers can earn between Rs 200-300 per day from the bookings.And more than money, it's the smooth and seamless functioning that attracts most of the drivers. Subramanian says the fact that the app also makes financial inclusion possible is what draws many.\"Around 80% of our drivers get an instant credit to their account once the ride is over as the customer can pay by cash or by Ola Money,\" he says.Add the fact that drivers have the flexibility to be on the platform or not, and it's a win-win deal, feels Subramanian. He cites the addition of 10,000 new autorickshaw drivers to the Ola app as proof of the app-based service catching on.For the drivers, it's also about a better life. \"My children are growing up and I don't want them to be ashamed of my profession. The company is helping me acquire a car at cheaper rate,\" says Beeru.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T19:24:20.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
