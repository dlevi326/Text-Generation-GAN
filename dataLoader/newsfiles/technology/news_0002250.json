The cuts announced Tuesday will be within the newly formed Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which is splitting from the Palo Alto, California , company's personal computer and printing operation. The split is scheduled to be completed by the end of next month. HP Enterprises is trimming its payroll as part of an effort to reduce its expenses by $2 billion annually. Even before the spinoff, HP has been jettisoning tens of thousands of employees during the past few years to help boost its declining profits as a technological shift from personal computers to smartphones and other mobile devices reduced demand for many of its products. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:25:43.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
