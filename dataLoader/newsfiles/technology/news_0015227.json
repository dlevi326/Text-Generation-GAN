A little over a month from now, the big story will be the 100th anniversary of Einstein's completion of General Relativity .

'Our quest on Mars has been to follow the water in our search for life in the universe, and now we have convincing science that validates what we've long suspected,' said Grunsfeld.

Stars near the disk of the Sun had their apparent position (relative to stars farther from the Sun) shifted slightly, as the rays that passed close to the Sun were deflected by its warping of spacetime. The measured deflection agreed nicely with Einstein's prediction, and the rest is one of the great hyperbolic headlines is history .Of course, relativity makes lots of predictions about what should happen near a massive object like the Sun, and the bending of starlight only tests one. Another thing that ought to happen is a slight \"stretching\" of space-- which is why discussions of relativity almost always include stretched rubber sheets . The distance between two points in space will be slightly longer along a path that passes close to the Sun than along one that never goes near it.[caption id=\"attachment_177\" align=\"\" width=\"789\"] Embedding diagrams showing the spacetime distortion in the vicinity of a massive object, and the trajectories of different orbiting objects in the resulting gravity well.

In special relativity, what one observer sees as purely a distance in space, somebody moving at constant speed relative to them will see as a mix of space and time-- the position of the two endpoints is measured at two slightly different times. This is the root of most of the \"paradoxes\" of relativity. The exact mix of space and time depends on the speed of the observer, and the equations of relativity tell you how to calculate that.General relativity tells us that the exact mix of space and time for a particular measurement also depends on the presence of gravity. What an observer near the Sun sees as purely a distance in space will look, from far away, like a mix of space and time. This mixing changes the result for distance measurements.It might seem like there's no way to measure that distortion-- how can you measure the length of a path near the Sun without passing near the Sun? But in fact, you can get the \"expected\" value of the length to compare to fairly easily, something I illustrated using toddler toys last year when I taught this. You can measure the length of a straight line through space passing near the Sun directly, and you can infer what it \"ought\" to be by measuring the circumference of a circle that stays a constant distance from the Sun. If spacetime is \"flat,\" then the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is everybody's favorite irrational number, Ï€. If spacetime is curved as you expect from general relativity, though, the length across gets stretched, and will seem longer than it ought to.[caption id=\"attachment_692\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Credit: 20th Century Fox[/caption]What does this have to do with Mars? Well, sending an astronaut with a bunch of meter sticks to fly close to the Sun and measure the diameter of Earth's orbit is more than a little impractical, but we can indirectly measure the distance by sending signals across the orbit, and using one of the other headline predictions of relativity, the constant speed of light. If space is stretched near the Sun, that \"extra\" distance will show up as a small delay in the arrival of a signal.Of course, doing this requires a sender and receiver on opposite sides of the Sun, and the Viking missions to Mars in the 1970's provided exactly that. The Viking probes that landed on Mars were parked on a planet whose orbital parameters are extremely well known from 300-odd years of careful measurements, and in the fall of 1976, Mars and the Earth were on opposite sides of the Sun for a while. The [entity display=\"NASA\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"nasa\" natural_id=\"fred/company/102607\"]NASA[/entity] team monitoring the probes sent signals back and forth in November of that year , and verified that the signals were, in fact, delayed slightly. The total shift is tiny-- the paper gives an expected value of about 250 microseconds, which would correspond to about 47 \"extra\" miles along the path close to the Sun, out of around 230 million-- and everything works out in accordance with General Relativity.(I am, of course, skipping over a lot of details-- that kind of signal timing is really difficult, and making this all work took a huge amount of effort from the scientists responsible. This includes things like sending signals via two different radio bands to sort out the effect of the charged plasma in the solar corona, which also tends to delay light passing through. It's a nice reminder of the impressive ingenuity of the people who work on space exploration, even the ones who never leave California.)Most of the grand rhetoric about Mars missions revolves around the search for life and the changes such a discovery would demand, philosophically, in terms of understanding our place in the universe (rightly so, as that would be awesome). Whether the various probes currently on Mars or on the drawing board find life, though, going to Mars has already helped confirm our place within space and time and fundamental theories of physics.", "external_links": ["http://www.space.com/30684-the-martian-celebrates-water-on-mars.html", "http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9b0de3df1e38ee32a25753c1a9679d946896d6cf", "https://xkcd.com/1158/", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/490420754/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.wired.com/2009/05/dayintech_0529/", "http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2014/11/10/general-relativity-with-toddler-toys/", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gravity_Wells_Potential_Plus_Kinetic_Energy_-_Circle-Ellipse-Parabola-Hyperbola.png", "https://www.aip.org/history-programs/einstein-centennial-2015", "http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4424827/Viking-Project-tests-general-relativity--November-25--1976"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T17:54:13.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
