The prince, who turned 31 on Tuesday, celebrated his birthday the following day in a pub with his friends, including former girlfriend Cressida Bonas. \nA source told the publication that Harry and Cressida are “part of the same group of friends,” adding that “she was invited along to a birthday party with the big group of people and that was it.” The royal and the actress are said to be “friends.” \nThe Sun reported recently that Prince Harry and Chelsy Davy met up during his three-month conservation projects in Africa. \n“Harry still holds a candle for her. Chelsy has his heart,” a source told The Sun. “They saw each other recently. There’s still very much something between them.” \nChelsy and Harry split up after Kate Middleton and Prince William’s wedding in 2011, after a seven-year on-and-off relationship. In 2012, Princess Eugenie, Harry’s cousin, introduced him to Cressida Bonas. They broke up in April 2014.
