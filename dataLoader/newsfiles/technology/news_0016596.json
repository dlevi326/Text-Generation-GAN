Russia was actually one of the last countries in that sequence that I applied for.\"\nDespite his extraordinary situation, Snowden described his life as \"normal\", even if he'd rather be living in his own country.\n\"Exile is exile,\" he said.\nAnd his criticism of Russian internet restrictions and laws encroaching on freedom of speech notwithstanding, Snowden said he feels he is allowed to express himself in Russia.\n\"I do. And I think it's primarily in the context of the fact that most activities happen online. I mean, when people ask me where I live, the most honest answer is on the internet.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:54:34.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
