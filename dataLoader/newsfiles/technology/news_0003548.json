So here’s my view on News24’s comments ban – and unlike News24, I welcome your views – so please feel free to comment!\nYesterday I read what I can only describe as a pathetic opinion piece headlined “Turning off comments protects writers from abuse,” in which the author, Laura Shortridge, moaned about the abusive comments she frequently received. My immediate response was well, you’re obviously writing stuff people don’t appreciate, and if you can’t handle abusive comments then maybe you should find something else to do with your time!\nI’ve written about 20 articles for News24 – and the reason I write them for News24 rather than sending them as letters to newspapers is because I value the immediate feedback I get. If I write an article which gets few views and few comments then I know I’ve written something boring that no-one’s interested in. If I get a load of abusive comments, as I did when I wrote an article in which I admitted to occasionally parking in disabled parking bays, then I read the comments and take note. For the record I haven’t parked in a disabled parking bay since! And if I do get a lot of views and positive feedback then I know I’ve written something worthwhile….and that gives me a boost and clear direction as to the tone and content of my next article!\nWith regard to comments on news items, News24’s editor Andrew Trench appears to have forgotten that there are many platforms other than News24 on which news can be accessed. The very reason why so many of us DO access News24 is because we want to be a part of what’s happening…and by commenting on what’s happening in SA and the world, we feel we may be able to influence people’s opinions.\nYes, there are many comments which are racist, abusive – or just plain stupid – but then surely the obvious way to combat those is for News24 to delegate a staff member to monitor all incoming comments and to immediately delete those which are indeed racist, stupid or abusive. And if the same people keep submitting such comments, to ban those people’s comments entirely! This is a logical solution which doesn’t appear to have occurred to News24.\nOK, that’s it from me. Unless News24 accepts that it’s made a big mistake and reverses its decision by the weekend, this will be my last article for News24. As I said above, I WANT to see people’s comments – and I want to be able to express my opinions on news events. Personally, I think that unless News24 does an immediate rethink on why it’s presently so popular, it’s going to lose a lot of users…..it might even go out of business!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:58:54.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
