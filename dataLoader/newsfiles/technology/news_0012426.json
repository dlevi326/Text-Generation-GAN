Embedded computers provide 24 hour uninterrupted operations, making it incredibly reliable. Fanless enclosures designed to resourcefully disperse heat while protecting internal components from environmental damage ranging from dust and airborne debris to extreme temperatures, moisture, and vibration. This aspect makes it ideal for outdoor advertising, POS/kiosk, transportation, and industrial control automation.\nThe function of the embedded board uses Celeron 1047UE 1.4 GHz dual core processor with two 204-pin DDR 1600 MHz SODIMM, up to 16 GB memory, and provide a mSATA/mini-PCI Express shared slot, delivering extraordinary computing performance while consuming low amount of power. With Celeron 1047UE, it can handle multiple concurrent threads or applications. To fulfill immense storage capability, it adds a 2.5” SATA3 HDD. Moreover, it is fully compatible with 32/64 bit versions of Window 7, Window 8, and Linux.\nThe micro box is built of black rugged aluminum, making it light, durable and low maintenance. It can withstand a wide range of operating temperature from 0°C to 40°C (32°F to 104°F) and storage temperature of -20°C to 85°C (-4°F to 185°F). With a dimension of just 10.39\"(W) x 1.5\"(H) x 7.85\"(D), DIN rail and wall mounting can be easily installed on any locations where space is critical.\nThe full feature I/O port compartment consists of HDMI, VGA, audio, RJ45, 9-24V DC in jack, four COM, seven U.S.B. 2.0, two antenna holes, and in support of Intel i211AT Gigabit LAN. In case of a system crash or error, the watchdog time features 10-255 min/sec, reducing the need for maintenance. To compliment it all, it sustains a power supply of 9-24V DC power input with 120V AC 60W power adapter. The FES 8685 is aimed to provide quality performance, quality efficiency service.\nTo learn more on the FES8685, please visit our website at http://www.acnodes.com/fanless-embedded-microbox-system/atom-fanless-embedded-computer/FES8685.htm\nTheir product line’s configurations are located on www.acnodes.com.
