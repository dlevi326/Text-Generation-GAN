The upgraded system enables M1 to meet the current and future needs of its growing customer base, and provides M1 with a comprehensive, unified view of all customers across its business lines. \nThe enhanced system has improved the operational efficiency at M1’s retail outlets, as well as service provisioning, by up to 35 per cent. In addition, by capturing all customer transactions and consolidating this data into a single system, M1 is able to serve its customers more effectively, and use data analytics to determine and address customers’ preferences. \nAs technology consultant and system integrator, Accenture provided program management, design, development and testing, data migration and deployment services for the Oracle and Comverse solutions implemented, and then integrated the systems with Microsoft’s .NET framework that was delivered by Avanade. \n“Accenture helped us consolidate our multiple legacy systems, integrating our charging, billing and customer relationship management systems to provide us with a holistic view and better understanding of our customer base,” said Alan Goh, chief information officer, M1. “This enables us to further improve the customer experience, better support our growing businesses, and deliver new services to meet our customers’ changing needs.” \nA recent Accenture report on the trends in communications service providers’ (CSP) networks found that an overwhelming majority of CSPs believe that managing service quality – which includes customer care and billing – is more important than ever, and is one of their biggest challenges. \n“To become key players in the digital value chain, CSPs must fully embrace the understanding that everything revolves around the customer,” said Ho Seong Kim, managing director of Accenture’s Communications, Media and Technology operating group in Singapore. “User experience and customer experience-led design is the key foundation of successful BSS transformations, such as the one M1 just achieved.” \nAbout M1 \nM1 is Singapore’s most vibrant and dynamic communications company, providing mobile and fixed services to over 2 million customers. Since the launch of commercial services in 1997, M1 has achieved many firsts, including the first operator to offer nationwide 4G service, as well as ultra high-speed fixed broadband, fixed voice and other services on the Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (NGNBN). With a continual focus on network quality, customer service, value and innovation, M1 links anyone and anything; anytime, anywhere.
