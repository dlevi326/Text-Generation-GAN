Canadian author Naomi Klein is in Sydney for a FODI talk that will also be streamed online.

I hope that Tony Abbott, having taken notes from Canada’s prime minister, is still paying attention.” \nCOMPANIES ARE FIGHTING HARD \nThis Changes Everything argues there is a conflict between what the planet needs in order to continue supporting human life, and what the current economic system needs to thrive, which is short term growth and “putting profits above all else”. \nKlein said she owed Abbott a “debt of thanks” because the PM was her book’s best marketer. \n“This is a government (Abbott’s) that shows perhaps more than any other government on Earth what that conflict looks like and what the costs of that conflict actually are,” she said. \nOn this battlefield, corporations are the ones which are on a war footing as they have a lot to lose. \n“We see that fossil fuel companies have five times more carbon in their proven reserves than is compatible with life on Earth,” Klein said. \n“This is why so many young people, faith organisations (and) local activists are joining the fossil fuel divestment movement. \n“Australia, by the way, has what appears to be the fastest growing fossil fuel divestment movement in the world ... this is all because people have done the math.” \nShe said 80 per cent of proven fossil fuel reserves needed to stay in the ground if the world was to meet the two degree warming target that governments agreed to in Copenhagen in 2010. \n“That represents trillions of dollars to those companies so they are fighting hard to protect their future profits and I think we see the outlines of the struggle very, very clearly here in Australia.” \nBut she said those who were trying to get the country on to a safe path were winning, with victories including against the Carmichael coal mine and the decision of Newcastle City Council and others to divest from fossil fuels. \nKlein said Australia was filled with “climate heroes” including a powerful indigenous rights movement helping to protect land, air and water. \n“In so doing, (it) is protecting the planet as a whole,” she said. \n“This is a tough place to be an environmental activist and because of that we see some of \nthe most exciting campaigns, the Bentley blockade (against coal seam gas), Lock the Gate (and the) historic struggle against the Adani coal mine which the world is watching and cheering every victory,” she said.

On sunny days renewables can make up to 80 per cent. \n“They’ve created ... 400,000 jobs in this transition, they’ve also deepened their democracy because they have taken back control of their energy grids in hundreds of cities and towns in Germany and are able to keep the profits of energy generation and use them to pay for services,” she said. \n“So this is not just about flipping the switch from one energy model to another, it’s also about changing our economy to make it fairer. \n“It is true that some of the most powerful actors in our current economic system ... stand to lose a lot.” \nTOP QUOTES: THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING \n“If enough of us stop looking away and decide that climate change is a crisis ... then it will become one, and the political class will have to respond, both my making resources available and by bending the free market rules that have proved so pliable when elite interests are in peril”. \n“We will not win the battle for a stable climate by trying to beat the bean counters at their own game — arguing, for instance, that it is more cost-effective to invest in emission reduction now than disaster response later. We will win by asserting that such calculations are morally monstrous.” \n“The shift will require rethinking the very nature of humanity’s power — our right to extract ever more without facing consequences, our capacity to bend complex natural systems to our will.” \n“Preliminary data shows that in 2013, global carbon dioxide emissions were 61 per cent higher than they were in 1990.” \n“So far, temperatures have increased by just 0.8 degrees celsius and we are already experiencing many alarming impacts.” \nNaomi Klein will be appearing at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas on Saturday, September 5.
