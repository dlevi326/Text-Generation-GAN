Impacted by explosive development of the new energy vehicle market, CATL, Lishen, Guoxuan, BYD and other influential Chinese power lithium battery manufacturers have invested in production expansion, which is expected to further drive the growth in demand for lithium battery equipment. In 2018, China's lithium battery equipment market size will be up to RMB16.6 billion.Traditional consumer electronics, power lithium batteries and grid energy storage act as major consumer markets of lithium battery equipment in China, accounting for 60%, 28% and 10% in 2014 respectively. Among them, power lithium batteries and grid energy storage will be major drivers prompting China's demand for lithium battery equipment, with the respective anticipated market share of 64% and 16% in 2018.At present, China's lithium battery equipment market is featured with a low concentration rate. Japan HIRANO and Kaido are the top two lithium battery equipment producers in China, enjoying 9.0% and 7.8% market share in 2014 respectively; meanwhile, the leading local Chinese players -- Shenzhen New Katop Automation Technology Co., Ltd, Wuxi Lead Auto Equipment and Yinghe Technology only seized 18.7% market share together in 2014.In 2015, Chinese lithium battery equipment manufacturing enterprises witness rapid development. Wuxi Lead Auto Equipment, Yinghe Technology and other major Chinese peers have fortified their expansion and lifted market share.Wuxi Lead Auto Equipment: In 2015, the company raises funds to build a new-type automation equipment project to enhance its capacity in power lithium battery winding machine, digital lithium battery winding machine, lithium battery four-in-one molding machine.Yinghe Technology: In 2015, the company raised funds to erect Huizhou Industrial Park (annual capacity: 700 sets of lithium battery automation equipment) and Jiangxi Industrial Park, of which the former has been successfully put into operation, while the latter will begin production in October 2015.In addition, Youngy, Dalian Zhiyun Automation and lithium companies are also deploying the field of lithium battery equipment through capital increase or acquisition.In June 2014, Youngy Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Luxiang) that specializes in lithium ore resources acquired Tec-rich Engineering (a famous Chinese reforming machine maker for RMB169 million in cash.In March 2015, Dalian Zhiyun Automation took over 53.5948% stake in Geesun which is a lithium battery automation solution provider via equity acquirement and capital increase.
