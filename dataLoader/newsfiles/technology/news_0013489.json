This is a reward, and a show of our thanks, for their ongoing commitment and support,” said Ahmed bin Byat, du’s chairman. \nShareholders that are registered in the company’s sharebook on September 27 will be entitled to receive the dividend payout, the company said in a statement. \nDu previously announced a 3.1 percent rise in Q2 net profit before royalty to AED978.5 million, with fixed line revenue increasing by 20.2 percent, data revenue jumping by 4.9 percent, and EBITDA climbing 3.5 percent to a record AED1.34 billion. \nDuring the first half of the year, du also announced the rollout of network sharing across fixed line services with rival Etisalat. \n“Network sharing between du and Etisalat is a major step towards healthy competition between the two operators, and will allow du to build a greater share of the fixed-line market, reinforcing our competitive position. This fits the UAE agenda of encouraging the best in service through healthy competition.” Bin Byat added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:35:59.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
