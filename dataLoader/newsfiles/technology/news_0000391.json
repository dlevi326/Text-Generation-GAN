This latest update offers even more programmatic control over campaigns on the ExoClick network by allowing clients to create or modify existing campaigns. This builds upon the features of being able to copy campaigns and pull statistics that were made possible with v1 of the API.\nExoClick founder and CEO Benjamin Fonzé commented, “Our API empowers our clients to create their own bespoke software to control their campaigns and have the flexibility to monitor statistical data, be it through their own custom web applications and/or mobile apps. For example, many advertisers use a range of different ad networks to promote their offers, rather than logging into each networks platform they can now create one software tool that will automate all of their campaign processes across all their networks, providing those networks have APIs.”\nDevelopers, clients and partners are encouraged to plug into ExoClick's ad network and some suggested software applications utilising the API include:-\nSetting custom bidding limits Monitoring performance in different GEOs and programatically changing them to improve ROI Automate targeting of different devices and mobile carriers Creating custom dashboards for more in-depth metrics Fonzé continued, “I believe that this new update provides the entertainment industry with the most powerful and advanced ad network API available.”\nExoClick has created a dedicated developers page on their corporate website that contains links to the API and its documentation.
