Invented at MIT in 2013, the purpose is to make things self-assemble when exposed to air, water or heat due to the chemical interaction of the materials used in their manufacture. 4D printing consists of smart materials that adapt and reprogram their properties, functionality or shape on demand based upon external stimuli. Researchers are combining different types of plastics and fibers to create smart materials that self-assemble or change shape when they come into contact with stimuli such as heat, water or any other environmental change. The 4th dimension time refers to the self-transformation.This report is based on an extensive research study of the 4D printing market and aims at identifying the entire market and all its sub-segments through extensively detailed classifications.
