Picture: STEPHANIE LLOYD/DAILY DISPATCH Related articles Vodacom to improve coverage as usage grows Vodacom builds base stations on spaza shops Vodacom in talks with Naspers over content deal In this article JSE-listed companies: Vodacom VODACOM Business is on track to grow its revenue contribution to 30% of the group’s services revenue in three years from 18% now, as more businesses adopt its products and services, the unit said on Wednesday.\nVodacom Business offers products and services to clients across the continent, including converged mobile and fixed line access, virtual private networks and voice over IP (VoIP)-hosted facilities. It also uses UK parent Vodafone’s platforms and systems to enhance its products and services.\nVodacom Business’s current revenue contribution to group services revenue is about 18%.\nVodacom Business CEO Vuyani Jarana said growth would come from areas such as machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, enterprise mobility, which is the management of an array of mobile devices, wireless network and related services, and cloud computing. The small-to-medium enterprise market and further expansion into Africa are other areas of growth for Vodacom.\n\"This strategy should help us get there. Rolling out enterprise mobility, driving cloud services and accelerating converged services, should get us there,\" he said.\nThe adoption of cloud is also gaining strong momentum. \"A lot of our customers are asking how to migrate to the cloud vis-a-vis whether or not to, which is very different from three years ago,\" said Mr Jarana.\nOn M2M, he said the market was still in its early stages of development. The M2M industry is driven by the automobile and insurance sectors. But the adoption of smarter meters by municipalities, among other things, will also drive growth.\n\"We are still at the tipping point. What we see today is just a start. SA has not done a fully fledged smart city, when we get to that we will see an explosion (in M2M),\" said Mr Jarana.\nAccording to a M2M report released by Vodafone in July, more than 35% of businesses surveyed in SA have already implemented M2M projects, with a further 26% planning to implement some in the next 12 months. At least 69% of businesses see M2M as an opportunity for innovation; while 53% see it as a chance to make process and productivity improvements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T13:41:51.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
