Almost as quickly, however, a significant number of scholars, especially those trained as experts in the study of ancient papyri and languages, deemed the piece to be a modern forgery. By early 2014, the two sides had dug in deeper: Those in favor of authenticity produced lab tests on the papyrus and ink that supported their position, while those opposed produced more detailed analysis of the handwriting and the phrasing of the text, which pointed in the direction of fraud.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T19:12:30.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
