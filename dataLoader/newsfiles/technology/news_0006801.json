Tinder's video shows a superhero 'rescuing' a woman from unwanted suitors \nWhen swiping through potential Tinder matches, users will be able to see whether another user has Super Liked them thanks to a blue footer appearing on their profile. \nThe new feature was announced in a movie trailer-style video, which shows a woman being harassed by potential matches she doesn't like. \nThen she is rescued by a superhero, and presented with a suitor who has Super Liked her. \nTinder chief executive Sean Rad said: \"A 'like' or 'swipe right' has long served as an anonymous way to express interest in someone, similar to a glance across the room. \n\"Because they're so limited in number, a Super Like, or a 'swipe up', sends a more powerful signal, conveying an especially high level of interest. \n\"People like to know that someone finds them special, and we think this will lead to even better matches.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T12:31:33.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
