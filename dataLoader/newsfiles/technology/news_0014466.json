Not only does MRC's redesigned website have a new look and feel, but navigation is much more user friendly, and access is readily available from any device and browser. The goal behind the new website is to provide members with a transformative new platform to share information, utilize education and network with other like-minded industry peers. Other new features of the website include: improved functionality, advanced search engine optimization and customizable member profiles. The MRC also released their Cost of Fraud Calculator in partnership with Riskified , a venture-backed fraud prevention solution provider for eCommerce merchants. This tool will present a holistic picture of an organization's true cost of fraud and visualize the business and financial impact in which risk and fraud professionals can share with executives. Furthermore, the new and improved website will also host MRC Communities, an interactive forum members can use to discuss the latest industry trends, ask questions and share ideas. MRC Communities are segmented by the following categories: payments, fraud, law enforcement and gamer safety alliance. Members will have the opportunity to converse about current or future issues, industry trends, best practices, industry data, vendor solution support to merchants and merchant feedback to vendors about solution needs. MRC Communities will be available to members in the coming weeks. In addition to the roll out of their new website, the MRC also released an updated logo to better represent the direction of their organization. The refreshed logo provides a more modern visual dynamic to the brand and the MRC's identity. \"As the MRC looks to the future, a continued goal of ours is to provide members with the most relevant education, innovative resources and rewarding networking opportunities. Therefore, we're excited to continue building upon this productivity to make significant transformations and additions to our organization,\" says Danielle Nagao, CEO.
