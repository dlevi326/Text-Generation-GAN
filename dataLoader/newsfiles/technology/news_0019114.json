Before that he held leadership roles at Apple Inc., — where he spent 16 years — and Palm Inc. The 13-year-old Silver Spring, which runs a hardware and software network that helps utility companies tap the “smart grid” to help lower costs and optimize energy use, is one of the 50 percent of Bay Area companies that had an IPO after 2013 that are now under water. Twitter Inc., Ooma Inc., and Rocket Fuel Inc., are some of those other companies, according to Renaissance Capital. Stock for Silver Spring Networks has slightly rebounded since January, when it hit a low of about $7. The company did take in $77.2 million in revenue in the quarter that ended on June 30 , up from $41.6 million the same time a year earlier. Silver Spring Networks has been trying to move beyond its hardware and software services into the Internet of Things, an area that Bell is familiar with from his work at Intel and Apple. Currently, the company has more than 21.5 million critical infrastructure devices connected across five continents. “As we accelerate our innovations for utilities, smart cities and additional emerging markets, Mike’s proven track record makes him ideally suited to lead Silver Spring in our next phase of growth,” Lang said in a press release. \nGet Silicon Valley  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:14:50.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
