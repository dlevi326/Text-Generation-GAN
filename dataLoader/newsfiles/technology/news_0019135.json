CEO Elon Musk announced that the founders series of sports utility vehicles will be delivered in California on September 29th. The limited edition electric cars will set customers back $132,000 for the 'signature model,' ramping up another $10,000 for added extras like the 'ludicrous speed update,' which allows the vehicle to accelerate from 0-60 mph in just a few seconds. Musk explained in a conference call that the new acceleration feature has been an engineering triumph, despite some critics comparing the experience to riding a roller coaster: 'Nobody was asking for Ludicrous Mode because it was too ludicrous,' Musk said. 'Insane Mode has been incredibly well received. We figured out from an engineering standpoint how to go beyond Insane, so we figured we should release that,' he added. The SUV is Tesla's second model, following in the tracks of the original Model S sedan.
