Boasting beauty and brains, MOCAheart is an elegant smart device that gives people an intuitive new way to track their heart health without the need for bulky cuffs or complicated monitors. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150928/271500 \nMOCAheart aims to help combat the issues relating to heart disease which, according to the CDC, is responsible for 1 in 4 deaths in America. Utilizing a \"press and go\" technique, MOCAheart combines thumb scans with sophisticated algorithms that measure blood flow and velocity to determine heart rate and blood oxygen levels, as well as an easy-to-understand indicator of overall cardiovascular health called the MOCA INDEX - a qualitative measurement of blood flow that is correlated to blood pressure. While systolic and diastolic figures can be hard to understand or remember, the MOCA INDEX is a simple 1-5 scale that provides an instant snapshot of your cardiovascular health. \n\"We are excited to introduce MOCAheart and realize our ambition of empowering people to proactively monitor their heart health without interrupting their lifestyle,\" said Naama Stauber, co-founder and COO of MOCACARE. \"By combining the latest developments in technology and medical science we have been able to deliver a device that will empower millions to effectively and effortlessly track cardiovascular health in taking action to prevent or minimize the well-known risks associated with heart disease.\" \nWith a gentle grip of the MOCAheart device, the optical sensor scans both thumbs then displays results on the accompanying iOS app within 25 seconds. The simple MOCA INDEX 1-5 scale (Low, Ideal, Raised, High or Very High) provides an immediate, understandable overview of cardiovascular health, explanation of indicators and recommendations on next steps, should any be required. \nThe MOCAheart App allows users to see their heart health insights over time and track progress. It enables users to set reminders to take readings, and easily text and share health status updates among loved ones and with their healthcare providers. \nMOCAheart is not a replacement for recommended medical testing, but is a simple and quick tool that empowers people to track their health and take action when results are outside the normal range. \nThe MOCA INDEX was created with reference to multiple and extensive research studies by institutions including MIT & Stanford that have consistently shown a correlation between the pressure exerted by the heart and the speed at which blood travels through the body. \nPriced $149.99, MOCAheart is available online at www.mocacare.com . \nSince MOCAheart does not offer medical recommendations or is used to diagnose or treat medical conditions, it does not require FDA clearance. MOCACARE does plan to pursue FDA clearance in the future to enhance its offerings using the data collected from MOCAheart for a clinical indication for use. \nFor further information visit www.mocacare.com . \nAbout MOCACARE MOCACARE's mission is to improve the quality of life for its users by creating solutions that bring together the very best in health, technology, science and care.
