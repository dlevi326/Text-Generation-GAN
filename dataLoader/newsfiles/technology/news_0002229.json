In 2007 the company began selling on Amazon, and now the majority of business comes from that source, and sales--and net profit--are climbing every year. The business also markets products on eBay, its own website, and other venues. The company has been invited to be a member of the Amazon Prime Vendor Program and other invitation-only programs. Product price management is done automatically by a vendor partner. This business would be a good candidate as a bolt on to an existing consumer electronics business; as a new revenue stream for an IT-related business; or a very nice living for an owner/operator. $250K in inventory is included in the sales price. Business is booming, with over $1M in annual sales and still growing! Don't let this great opportunity pass you by! Call Kim now at 305-439-9326 before it's gone!
