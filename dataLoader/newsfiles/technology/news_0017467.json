Uber's standard app-based service remains legal in France. \nThe two men face up to two years in prison and fines of 300,000 euros ($337,000). \nUber is under increasing pressure to work with skeptical European governments. It is banned entirely in Spain and Italy, but French lawmakers say they understand the demand for such services. \nDuring protests in France this summer, taxi drivers infuriated by Uber competition smashed livery cars and set tires ablaze.
