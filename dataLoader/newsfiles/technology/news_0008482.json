Fourteen corporate partners have signed on to sponsor SCOPE teams made up of Olin seniors: Boeing, Harley-Davidson, SpaceX, Raytheon, LIMBS International (funded by Autodesk), the Santos Family Foundation, OnShape, Dassault Systemes/SolidWorks, Bose, Boston Scientific, Facebook, Ivani, Locus Robotics and Indico.\nEach student team spends a year working on a significant engineering problem facing the sponsor company.\nThis year, the Boeing 737 SCOPE team will be working to improve the ergonomics of installing cargo liner panels in the belly of the airplane. According to Boeing engineer Edward White, installing cargo liners is one of the top ergonomic challenges during final assembly of the 737 in Renton, WA. During the installation, mechanics currently crawl on their knees and reach out overhead to install hundreds of fasteners. That activity can result in wear-and-tear injuries to the body over time. Addressing that ergonomic challenge will be a top priority for the Boeing team this year.\nIt isn’t the first time Boeing has sponsored a SCOPE team; the airline industry leader is a multi-year partner. In referencing the relationship with Olin, White said, “The 737 Advanced Manufacturing team believes our on-going relationship with the Olin SCOPE program is advantageous for the production system innovation. Olin students are well prepared to help solve production system engineering challenges.”\nAnd, for the first time, a company launched by Olin students is one of the SCOPE partners. Indico is a machine learning start up based in Boston. Former Olin students Slater Victoroff and Madison May worked together to hatch the idea for indico while taking classes at Olin. \"I'm thrilled to be back at Olin. It's not every day that you get to work with some of the best and brightest undergraduate students in the country to push the envelope and develop something incredible,” said Victoroff, indico’s CEO.\nOther projects include a team of students who will be working on creating a new intelligent prosthetic knee for LIMBS International. The Dassault/Solidworks team will be working on a new app “that will open young eyes to the inspiration and fun of the design process.” And the Bose team will use data mining and design techniques to improve the user experience of the Bose SoundTouch system,\nFor Olin seniors, SCOPE is the culminating experience of their education. In this full year course, students work in multi-disciplinary teams of 4-6 students, engaging in real-world engineering projects for their partnering corporate clients. The students are responsible for virtually all aspects of the project.\n“The SCOPE program is a centerpiece of the Olin curriculum, in which our students bring together all aspects of their Olin education to solve a real world engineering challenge. The projects span a range of disciplines and represent a wide variety of product development stages from basic research and market investigations through to manufacturing. The seniors also develop professional skills during their SCOPE experience including project management, budgeting, teaming and protection of intellectual property,” said Rebecca Christianson, director of the SCOPE Program.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12985852.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12985852.htm"], "published": "2015-09-29T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T09:17:30.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
