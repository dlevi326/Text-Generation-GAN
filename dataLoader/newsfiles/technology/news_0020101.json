Nokia achieved this by using self-organising networks for transport in combination with a multi-supplier software-defined network (SDN) fabric control that acts across SDN domains. It uses a single rest application program interface (API) to ensure the network control does not have to talk to every SDN controller . \nThe introduction of programmable APIs in the virtual core network elements will ensure core network changes can be made in real-time – currently this can take several hours. Accordingly, the core network can adapt to dynamically changing needs, such as the creation of new network slices or mobility profiles. \nMeanwhile, dynamic experience management will deliver automated quality of experience optimisation of each application session. Service-determined connectivity features will free devices and services from being tied to single point-to-point IP connections and allow connectivity paths to be freely chosen according to service demand. \nNokia also added a distributed telco cloud structure through its AirFrame datacentre system to support critical services for verticals and mobility on demand to ensure resources are used more efficiently. \n“With our cognitive and cloud-optimised architecture for the 5G era, we have outlined an end-to-end architecture that will allow unprecedented and cognitive customisability to meet stringent performance, security, cost and energy requirements,” said Nokia chief architect Volker Zeigler. \n“It will fuel economic growth through new business models across vertical sectors, such as network-as-a-service for other industries to use network functions as they need them.” Read more about 5G development Huawei commits to pan-European 5G Public Private Partnership (5G-PPP) plan to strengthen five separate 5G research projects .
