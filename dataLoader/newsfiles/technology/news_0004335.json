Effective immediately, this new endorsement will provide a comprehensive, compliant and affordable secure communication service, which will help member dentists, specialists, staff and patients easily communicate within a HIPAA compliant environment. HIPAA regulations require that all patient healthcare information is protected, and violations may result in penalties and fines (refer to chart at right). With PBHS’s Secure E-mail and Collaboration system, patient data remains encrypted from start to reception. This data is stored and transmitted using secured military-grade encryption, so only recipients can decode message data, documents and radiographs. Through the collaboration platform, general practitioners and specialists have the ability to seamlessly and securely share their patient charts and notes. Patients can even be invited to be part of their treatment discussion when and if it is deemed appropriate.\nDeborah Doherty, Managing Vice President of ADA Business Resources, commented on the new endorsement. “After carefully evaluating and vetting the leading secure communications vendors serving the healthcare community, PBHS surpassed our rigid qualifications of security, liability, functionality and ease of use. As an innovator in HIPAA compliant messaging and collaboration, PBHS understands how to easily facilitate secure communications between practices as well as patients. PBHS operates on a business model focused exclusively in the dental space, unlike many of the other candidates we evaluated. With PBHS we know that ADA members are their top priority. The company is strong financially, and provides members with the white glove approach to customer service that is of the very highest standards.\n“PBHS’ secure communication and collaboration services have been reviewed and validated by an outside HIPAA auditor, and we are thrilled to offer them to our members. HISP integration services are available upon request, per the recommendation of the ADA Standards Committee for Dental Informatics (SCDI). Of course, as with all other ADA Business Resources endorsed services, immediate help is here should members have any questions or concerns.”\n“We are honored and excited to be endorsed by ADA Business Resources,” said Jay Levine, President of PBHS. “HIPAA compliancy is of the utmost importance when sharing or releasing protected health information. Our mission is to help dentists achieve and maintain compliance within the minefield of data privacy requirements. PBHS Secure Mail is a mature solution for HIPAA compliant, encrypted messaging. With our latest release, all ADA member accounts are pre-certified and setup. Account initiation is as easy as entering your ADA Membership ID #, verifying your practice and creating your first secure email. PBHS identified the needs and habits of dentists, staff and patients, and provided a simple to use but powerful application that protects, guides and facilitates sharing of protected health information.”\nThe PBHS Secure email interface has an inbox and sent folder with a look and feel similar to Outlook or Apple Mail.\n“This is an intuitive interface, and users can message anyone,” explains Mr. Levine. When an email address is entered, the application detects if the recipient is a system user already or not. If the recipient is not a user, they are invited to participate.\n“Most importantly, the information never leaves the military grade encrypted servers, so the email message content and attachments are completely secure.”\nADA members receive special member pricing and set up fees will be waived on a tiered solution that ranges from $10 per month for a typical secure email solution to $200 per month for enterprise case collaboration.
