This announcement will only strengthen consumer trust in KitKat as a responsible brand.\" \"Sustainable cocoa sourcing helps safeguard the livelihoods of farming communities and delivers higher quality cocoa beans.\" \nThe new initiative is part of Nestlé's commitment to source 150,000t of sustainably produced cocoa by 2017 through the Nestlé Cocoa Plan, which aims to enhance the lives of cocoa farming communities, as well as the quality of its cocoa. \nIt will enable farmers to run profitable farms, improve social conditions, and source good quality, sustainable cocoa for Nestlé's products. \nIn February, Nestlé USA decided to remove artificial flavours and FDA-certified colours from all of its chocolate products by the end of the year. \nThe manufacturer will avoid using artificial flavours and certified colours, including Red 40 and Yellow 5, in more than 250 products and ten brands, including Nestlé, Butterfinger, Crunch and Baby Ruth. \nImage: KitKat will use exclusively sustainability-sourced cocoa in all of its products from the first quarter of 2016.
