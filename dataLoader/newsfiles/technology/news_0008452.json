This award recognizes professional services firms who demonstrate excellence in the implementation, use and results achieved using work product management solutions. \nShepherd and Wedderburn is a leading UK law firm. With over 500 partners and staff and offices in, Edinburgh, Glasgow, London and Aberdeen, the firm delivers comprehensive multi-jurisdictional legal advice across all business sectors as well as offering the full range of private client and wealth management services. \nAs a founding member of World Services Group, the global multidisciplinary professional services network, Shepherd and Wedderburn is able to respond to clients’ needs swiftly and effectively anywhere in the world and currently serves clients in more than 92 jurisdictions. \nRegarded by many as the go-to firm for specialist sector advice in energy and natural resources, real estate, finance, competition and regulation, Shepherd and Wedderburn also has an impressive track record in advising clients from across other industries and sectors. FTSE 100 blue-chips, AIM companies, large SMEs, and public service organizations are counted among its clients. \nFollowing its acquisition of Scottish law firm Tods Murray last year, Shepherd and Wedderburn evaluated the technology systems in use and chose to consolidate the incoming cloud-based NetDocuments system to the firms’ iManage Work, which is Shepherd and Wedderburn’s firm-wide solution for document management. \n“Efficient and secure document management is integral to the work we do day in and day out for our clients,” said Lynn Beaumont, Head of Quality at Shepherd and Wedderburn. “The firm’s lawyers simply can’t afford to have situations where their work product is unavailable due to instability or an outage — a problem we unfortunately encountered with the previous cloud-based system. Our experience with iManage has shown that it is extremely reliable, comprehensive and simple to use. Most importantly, our lawyers like it because it helps them do their jobs more efficiently.” \nThe successful migration to iManage, which involved documentation concerning approximately 15,000 live matters, was handled by iManage partner Ascertus Limited, a professional services firm with a proven track record converting existing NetDocuments systems. Ascertus completed the migration in a single weekend. More than 100 new users were trained on iManage Work, and since the conversion, response to iManage’s integrated workspace has been positive. Additionally, the firm will integrate iManage with third party solutions such as ethical wall and financial systems with work product management. \n“iManage is intuitive and user-friendly, and it enables lawyers at the firm to be more productive,” said Hamish Patrick, a partner at Shepherd and Wedderburn. “Everything is integrated, so people don’t have to click in and out of multiple windows to do their work or to search for information on open matters. Automatically filing documents direct from Outlook is a huge plus — it’s much faster and simpler than manually transferring information from email to the DMS.” \n“In IT, we usually don’t get much user feedback unless there’s an issue,” said Paddy Toner, IT Director for Shepherd and Wedderburn. “The fact that I didn’t hear a single complaint after moving from one system to another and transferring more than 2.5 million active documents in a few days speaks for itself. The implementation was exceptionally smooth.” \n“When it comes to managing work product, system reliability, uptime, and an ability to access mission-critical information in real-time is paramount,” said Dan Carmel, \nCMO, iManage. “Whether, cloud-based, on-premise or a hybrid, the architecture of a prospective solution matters less than the outcome: Does it empower your professionals to work more efficiently, securely and productively? If it doesn’t, then why deploy it? We are proud that Shepherd and Wedderburn identified iManage as the right solution for its lawyers, and applaud the firm’s successful migration.” \nShare:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:56:36.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
