The company is extending its leadership in hyperscale data centers into the enterprise private cloud and hybrid cloud space.\nQCT will offer a standard 19” rack, with QCT QuantaGrid D51B server and QCT QuantaMesh BMS series switches, powered by VMware EVO SDDC.. The two companies are also working together on an OCP (Open Compute Project) specification. At VMworld 2015 US, visitors can find QCT at booth #747 and in the Hyper-Converged Infrastructure Zone.\nMike Yang, general manager of QCT said, “We’ve built a close, collaborative relationship with VMware. Our work together has touched every aspect of the cloud data center, bringing the power of software-defined data center through hyper-converged infrastructure to customers of many sizes, not just the hyperscale players. The relationship between VMware and Quanta provides our mutual customers with new solutions optimized for different applications, workloads and business objectives.”\nIn addition to showcasing VMware EVO SDDC, QCT will have its Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Series solution on display. These products, based on VMware technologies, are optimized for a diversity of VDI use cases. The VDI Series includes three configurations:\n1. VDIBlock G2, a hyper-converged appliance with the QCT STRATOS S910-X31E microserver. This 3U, nine-node high density microserver is energy efficient and comes bundled with VMware Virtual SAN technology, leveraging direct-attached storage resources to drive down storage costs for office desktop workloads.\n2. VMBlock is a hyper-converged infrastructure solution with the QCT QuantaPlex T41S-2U , designed with flexible configuration in hardware and available for various software modules. VMBlock is appropriate for versatile workloads including VDI and hybrid cloud environment.\n3. VDIBlock 3D Advance is the result of a three-way collaboration among QCT, VMware and NVIDIA. The solution enables easy scale-out of performance and capacity for the most demanding 3D applications and use cases in VDI environment, especially for graphic intensive applications such as AutoCAD, PTC Creo.\nAbout QCT\nQCT (Quanta Cloud Technology) is a global datacenter solution provider extending the power of hyperscale datacenter design in standard and open SKUs to all datacenter customers.
