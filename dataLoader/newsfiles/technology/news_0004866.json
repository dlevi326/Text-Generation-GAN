Agency Workspace is an agent’s hub for keeping track of tasks, creating new notes, and viewing recent notifications, such as reminders and incoming text messages – all from one easy-to-access location.\nFrom any page in EZLynx, quickly create a note for any applicant without having to navigate to a new page. Just click the Note icon in the top-right area, search for the applicant, and add in the details.\nIn addition to easy note creation, EZLynx adds powerful organizational features to your notes and tasks. Add labels to keep related notes and tasks grouped together. When viewing your activity log, you can click on a label to see only the notes and tasks that were assigned to that group, such as everything related to your upcoming renewals.\n“Often when you log a note, it leads to an action item,” said John McKay, Sales Director at EZLynx. “That’s why we made it possible to add a task from within a note. For example, when a customer calls to ask about making a change to their policy, it is important for E&O purposes that you log that request in EZLynx. However, you also need to assign the task of making the requested policy change to either yourself or someone else in your agency. Agency Workspace makes that possible.”\n“Agency Workspace also makes it possible to add several reminder options for your tasks, all of which can be assigned separate dates and times,” McKay continues. “If you have EZLynx Text Messaging, you can also have EZLynx text you a reminder. All of this, and more, is possible in EZLynx.”\nAbout EZLynx\nEZLynx develops industry-leading cloud-based software for the insurance industry. Their software has helped independent agents operate their businesses more effectively for over ten years.\nEZLynx is proud to be the innovator of several products available on its ONE PLATFORM solution, including real-time Rating Engine, Retention Center, Agency Pulse, Policy Sync, eSignature, and Agency Management System.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12944360.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12944360.htm"], "published": "2015-09-08T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:44:39.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
