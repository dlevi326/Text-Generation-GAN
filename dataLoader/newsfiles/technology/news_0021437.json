Conversely, cubic boron nitride possesses superior chemical inertness but only about half of the hardness of diamonds. In an attempt to create a superhard material better suited for a wide variety of materials on an industrial scale, researchers at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, have created an alloy composed of diamonds and cubic boron nitride (cBN) that boasts the benefits of both. \"Diamond and cubic boron nitride could readily form alloys that can potentially fill the performance gap because of their affinity in structure lattices and covalent bonding character,\" said Duanwei He, a professor at Sichauan University's Institute of Atomic and Molecular Physics. \"However, the idea has never been demonstrated because samples obtained in previous studies are too small to test their practical performance.\" A and B show a bulk diamond-cBN alloy samples synthesized at 20 GPa/2200 Â°C with a diameter of ~3 mm, over a copper screen to exhibit its transparency C and D show polished rake faces of diamond-cBN alloy cutters. (Image: D. W. He/SCU) He and his colleagues at the University of Nevada and the Chinese Academy of Sciences detail their procedure this week in Applied Physics Letters , from AIP Publishing ( \"Diamond-cBN alloy: A universal cutting material\" ). To synthesize diamond-cBN alloys, the researchers subjected a homogenous mixture of diamond and cubic boron nitride powder to a vacuum furnace at 1300 K for two hours, then pressed the material into 3.5 millimeter pellets under pressure greater than 15 gigapascals and temperatures above 2000 K. The pellets were then polished and sharpened into cutting implements. American Institute of Physics   .
