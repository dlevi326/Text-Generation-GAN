ClimateCentral.org Scientists at the Natural Resources Defense Council have issued new reports warning of the likelihood of increasing hordes of mosquitoes, including expanded ranges of tropical species known to carry such diseases as dengue fever and West Nile virus.\nOther findings in the reports include favorable conditions for the spread of ticks that carry Lyme disease, plus increasingly lush and extensive growths of poison ivy and ragweed.\n\"These are the things that keep scientists up late at night. It's all bad news,\" said Mariam Rotkin-Ellman, a San Francisco-based senior scientist for the NRDC who specializes in the public health impacts of pollution and climate change.\nAll of these changes can be linked to climate change, and bear more serious consequences than being mere pesky annoyances, Rotkin-Ellman said.\nDeer ticks, such as this one, are the primary carriers of Lyme disease. AP file photo MOSQUITOES and TICKS:\nMilder winters projected for the Midwest in the coming decades can have a significant impact on pests, Rotkin-Ellman said. Fewer mosquitoes and ticks die off during the shorter and warmer winters, and a more aggressive population returns earlier in the spring, she said.\nAs warmer climates spread northward, the ranges of mosquito and tick species shift, too, following the favorable living conditions, she said. Heavy rainfall and flooding predicted as part of climate change will also provide more standing water to breed in.\nScientists are most concerned about the migration of two species of mosquitoes known to carry dengue fever, characterized by high fever, headaches, bone and joint aches, and a rash. Recurrent infections can lead to bleeding, seizures and death.\nThe dengue-carrying species of Asian Tiger mosquitoes is known to be living in 28 states. Nearly 4,000 cases of dengue fever were reported in the U.S. from 1995-2005. More than two dozen dengue cases were in Florida in 2009-10, and thousands more have been found along the Texas-Mexican border.\nThe chart depicts the projected increase in toxic oil potency of poison ivy in the coming decades. ClimateCentral.org Those same conducive weather conditions produced more than 16,000 cases of West Nile virus since 1999, when it first entered the U.S. About 5,600 people were infected with West Nile in 2012 following a streak of unusually warm and wet weather.\nTicks benefit from many of the same climate change environmental conditions as mosquitoes, Rotkin-Ellman said.\n\"Milder winters are heaven for things like ticks,\" she said. \"More ticks survive, you have an earlier and longer growth season, and a greater threat from shifting ranges.\"\nPoison ivy is expected to grow larger and more potent in the coming decades due to climate change. Plain Dealer file photo The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 300,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with Lyme disease each year, primarily in the Midwest and Northeast.\nPOISON IVY and RAGWEED\nScientific predictions for a profusion of larger and more lush poison ivy and ragweed plant production have more to do with the causes of climate change than the global warming itself.\nCarbon dioxide trapped in the atmosphere not only has brought about climate change, it also acts as a fertilizer for plants, which use it as a building block for more vigorous growth, Rotkin-Ellman said.\nExperiments have found that poison ivy grows faster when exposed to increased amounts of carbon dioxide, and that it produces greater amounts and more toxic forms of the plant's oil, which causes an itching and often painful rash when touched, said Doug Inkley, a scientist with the National Wildlife Federation.\nStudies also have found that pollen production increases as carbon dioxide and temperatures climb, and the growing seasons last longer.\n\"These particular plants have a more significant effect on humans,\" Rotkin-Ellman said. \"Ragweed, on the surface, may seem like a minor annoyance, causing sniffling and sneezing. But it actually has a significant effect on people with asthma and severe allergies, possibly triggering a serious attack and a trip to the emergency room.\"\nLonger allergy seasons also translate into less productivity at work and school, and incalculable increases in health care costs.\nRED FIRE ANTS\nHere's one bit of good news: these invasive pests, which bite and sting in a single mass when disturbed, are not expected to reach Ohio until 2080, at the earliest, according to scientists. Fire ants arrived in North America nearly 80 years ago, and have remained concentrated in the Southern states, although they are expected to migrate northward as the climate warms.", "external_links": ["http://www.nrdc.org/"], "published": "2015-08-20T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:09:51.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
