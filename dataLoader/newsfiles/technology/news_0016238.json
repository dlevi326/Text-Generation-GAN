The research, published this month in the academic journal the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, offers new insights into how diseases spread among birds. House finches visit a bird feeder.

These observations showed that birds that spent the most time at the feeders were more likely to contract the infection. \nThe team also studied small flocks of house finches in captivity and kept track of which birds spent the most time visiting feeders and which ones spent the least time. The results complement the findings from monitoring wild birds. Experimentally infected birds that spent a lot of time at bird feeders were more likely to spread the infection, while infected birds that spent less time at the feeders were less likely to be disease vectors. Researchers used small tags attached to the feet of finches to track how frequently they visited bird feeders.

The feeders provide plenty of health benefits for birds, including a source of sustenance during lean winter months. \n“The overall health outcomes related to bird feeders are likely quite good,” he said. “They can help birds maintain weight and good health, especially in the winter.” \nRather than removing feeders, Adelman recommended that feeders be disinfected regularly to combat the spread of pathogens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T15:19:04.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
