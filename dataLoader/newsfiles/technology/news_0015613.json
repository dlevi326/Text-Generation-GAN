(Photo: USA TODAY)\n14 CONNECT 47 TWEET LINKEDIN 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE NEW YORK â€” Apple has started delivering its watchOS 2 operating system software.\nThe company was supposed to deliver the software for the Apple Watch last Wednesday but held off at the last minute due to an undisclosed bug. Consult the Apple Watch app on your iPhone to fetch the update.\nThe new software is supposed to deliver faster performance to your wrist and supply new watch face options, including the ability to use your own photos as the watch face. Apple also says there'll be more \"native\" apps for the watch that don't require you to use your phone.\nApple has refused to disclose sales figures for the Apple Watch but said that there are now 10,000 apps available for the company's high tech timepiece.\nThe competition for the watch space has been heating up with new smart watches coming from Samsung, Motorola (Lenovo), LG and Huawei. And some Android Wear watches are now compatible with the iPhone thanks to recently announced software from Google.\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\nRead //usat.ly/1FbcH35 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FbcH35&text=Apple%20releases%20delayed%20watchOS%202%20software&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1FbcH35", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/71c863fa97f6025ba81b0ba461a34d5a38b89141/c=0-298-2400-2103&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635784378882407963-AppleWatch-34R-ModularClock-3rdParty-PRINT-2.jpg", "http://twitter.com/edbaig", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c711c85d58e411988f13438d0dec93db9715f141/r=400x400/local/-/media/2015/09/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635784378882407963-AppleWatch-34R-ModularClock-3rdParty-PRINT-2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635784378882407963-AppleWatch-34R-ModularClock-3rdParty-PRINT-2.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FbcH35&mini=true"], "published": "2015-09-21T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:58:12.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
