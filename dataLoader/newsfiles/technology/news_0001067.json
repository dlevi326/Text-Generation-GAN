Later that day, the US Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep rates unchanged.\n\"Copper prices [are] rising this morning as...some key copper mines paused production last week to give time for engineers to check their operations,\" said SP Angel, a brokerage, in a research note. \"The US Fed's decision to hold rates also weakened the US dollar, helping prices push higher.\"\nCopper is a dollar-denominated commodity, and it becomes cheaper for other currency-holders to buy when the greenback weakens.\nDespite the earthquake in Chile, some analysts say that supply remains robust and copper production will outpace demand in the medium-term.\n\"Outright production curtailments, the most effective measure to rebalance oversupplied markets, have been few and far between,\" BofA Merrill Lynch said in a report. \"As such, we forecast surpluses all the way to 2018 at present.\"\nEconomic weakness in China, which consumes roughly 45 per cent of the world's copper, is also still unsettling market participants. According to Barclays, a survey by Chinese metals research firm, Antaike, revealed the continuing weakness in key sectors of downstream copper demand.\nOthers in the market, however, see copper prices moving higher on the back demand from China.\n\"We expect renewed demand out of China to lift prices further following the restart of industry following the WWII parades two weeks ago,\" said SP Angel.\nMost of the other base metals were higher at the start of the week.
