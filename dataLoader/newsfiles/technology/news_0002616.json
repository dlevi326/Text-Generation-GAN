The company decided to suspend its low-cost service in France after a nationwide taxi strike in protest against Uber turned violent. \nDidi Kuaidi, Uber's main rival in the massive Chinese transport market, is close to raising $3 billion from investors, Bloomberg reported. \nReached for comment in Beijing early Tuesday, Didi Kuaidi declined to confirm or deny the reports. \nmdl/rl", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T16:06:23.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
