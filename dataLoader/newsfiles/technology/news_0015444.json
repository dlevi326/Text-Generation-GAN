By using driver safety information during pre-employment screening, commercial carriers will be able to better assess the potential safety risks of prospective driver-employees. PSP also gives drivers additional opportunities to verify the data in their driving history and correct any discrepancies. All individual driver records are strictly protected in accordance with federal privacy laws. \nAccording to a study released by FMCSA in 2013, PSP positively impacts the safety of America's roadways. The study shows that carriers using PSP have, on average, decreased crash rates by 8 percent, and driver out-of-service (OOS) rates by 17 percent. It is estimated that in the 12 months studied, the carrier group using PSP prevented 863 crashes and more than 3,500 driver OOS incidents.
