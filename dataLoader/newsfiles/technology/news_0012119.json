On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, U.S. sales so far in the calendar year 2015 are on pace to surpass $1 billion for the third consecutive year.\n“5775 was another momentous year for Israel Bonds,” said Bonds President & CEO Izzy Tapoohi. “As we look ahead to 5776, we anticipate that an increasingly diverse number of individual and institutional investors will continue to become stakeholders in Israel’s economy by investing in Israel bonds. In the face of those seeking to weaken Israel’s fiscal standing through illegitimate boycotts and calls for divestment, Israel bonds offer an opportunity to invest in one of the world’s most resilient economies .”\nBelow are highlights from the past Jewish calendar year 5775 (September 2014 through September 2015).\nIn November, Bloomberg Business interviewed Israel Bonds President & CEO Izzy Tapoohi.

Bush spoke at the Israel Bonds King David Award Dinner at the Omni Hotel in Dallas, where more than $60 million in Israel bond investments were announced. With over 1,500 attendees, the dinner was among the largest Israel Bonds events since the organization’s launch at Madison Square Garden in 1951.\nOn March 30, in Chicago, Ambassador Ron Dermer praised Israel’s decades-long relationship with Israel Bonds, declaring to an audience of over 500 that the organization “has helped transform Israel from a small agricultural backwater to a global technological powerhouse.”\nIn a new video released in April, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Israel bond investors, saying their investments were “an investment in the Jewish future.

Scalise announced that Summit County had invested $1.3 million in Israel bonds, including an increase of $300,000, to bring its total Israel bond holdings to $2.8 million.
