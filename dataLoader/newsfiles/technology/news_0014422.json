(NASDAQ:CONN), has terminated the Company’s stockholders’ rights plan, effective as of September 10, 2015. The Company adopted its stockholders’ rights plan in October 2014 to enable management and the Board to explore strategic alternatives while reducing the likelihood that any person or group would gain control of Conn’s through open market accumulation or otherwise without appropriately compensating all of the Company's stockholders. \nAbout Conn’s, Inc. \nConn’s is a specialty retailer currently operating approximately 95 retail locations in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
