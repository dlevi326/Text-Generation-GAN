NEW YORK, NY, September 02, 2015 /24-7PressRelease/ -- \"Today The world of video games is never constant - every year brings new technologies to improve gamer enjoyment and experience,\" Internet marketing maven, entrepreneur and tech-lover Chad Lieberman began his talk on trending technologies in the world of gaming. \"By carefully tracking changes in the gaming industry, we have come up with a list of five technologies likely to transform the gaming experience altogether in the coming years. Marketers in this industry will be interested to follow and leverage their capabilities for overall better performance,\" Lieberman continued. Mr. Lieberman outlined the following technologies in detail, examining effect of each on gaming. The list below is a summary according to the marketing expert's analysis. 1. Immersive gaming - demonstrates the reemergence of head-mounted displays to the world of gaming through Oculus Rift. It will offer a more successful VR interactive experience by increasing the field of view, improving head-tracking systems among other improvements. Another example is the MS IllumiRoom, which uses the geometry and appearance of your space to create a digital VR through use of a projector and Kinect camera technology. 2. Multiscreen gaming - examples include Wii U, SmartGlass and Sony Cross-play. The first two function similarly, with a controller that includes an in-built touch screen with different applications for specific games. Users can perform primary and secondary tasks using the GamePad on Wii U and any compatible mobile device for SmartGlass. Sony's Cross-play merges its PS3 with PS Vita, enabling you to pause and continue action on the go. 3. Cloud Gaming - this leverages more reliable, high-speed Internet connections to enable gamers to stream their games using various file streaming techniques. Video streaming allows titles to be stored on a company server and streamed on-demand to computers, without the need for consoles. File streaming uses thin clients to run actual games on consoles, PCs or mobile devices, by downloading parts of the game in bits as the game continues. 4. Modular computing - this provides a simpler way to upgrade PCs for non-technical gamers. It involves the use of a tower, which holds ports for modular components of all types e.g. Blu Ray players, hard drives and graphics cards. This adds a completely new level to PC customization for gamers. 5. Open source gaming - Finally, this concept allows for independent development of web-based and mobile games simply and affordably. The Ouya micro-console is a perfect example. It acts as a development kit to enable game sharing and development without expensive SDKs. There are many other such tools in the market, like Flying Monkey Interactive and YoYo Games. \"Given all these concepts, we can safely say that the world of gaming is looking at a bring future ahead,\" Mr. Ian Lieberman concluded his talk.About Chad Lieberman Chad Ian Lieberman was started over 13 years ago and it boasts a cumulative experience in easy and cost effective search engine marketing services, including search engine optimization, affiliate marketing, online reputation management, linking and PPC management to help businesses of all kinds remain competitive and increase their visibility on the major portals and search engines.
