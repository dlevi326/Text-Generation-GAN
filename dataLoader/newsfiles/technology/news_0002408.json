They added noise to an already-noisy digital environment, and didn't contribute to anything constructive.\nDo the same people who feel offended that News24 is removing their comments also grab pens and papers and scribble comments onto all stories in their newspapers, and then wave the newspaper around and insist that all passersby read their little gems of wisdom?\nI'm sorry, it's not that special. If your comments really WERE that special or ground-breaking, you will find the time to flesh it out into a full-fledged opinion piece for MyNews24 and then let your opinion take front-and-centre ... opening yourself to criticism. You can still do that under the new regime, so I recommend you do.\nOf course, I'm not guaranteeing that I'm going to read bile-filled drivel in essay form, but chances were I wasn't going to read every comment you may have diligently posted on every news story either in an attempt to advance your negative worldview. That's how the cookie crumbles: you influence those you can convince to read you, and you lose the others.\nMore than opening your average News24 story and skimming through all the (unoriginal) Jacob Zuma jokes, ANC puns and racism of various blatant and covert shades and getting incredibly depressed, I'd feel genuinely angry that a vocal bitter minority would be seen to represent an entire racial group.\nIn South Africa we need to be encouraging open and constructive discussion between all racial groups towards our mutually-inclusive future, not give the most vocal radicals the microphone and let them drool all over it and only inspire hatred. How often have I read the comments and thought that if I was in the ANC,\nI'd happily send all white people into the sea? How often have I thought that if I was an impressionable young white guy, I might be so stirred by the oppressed white voice crying out in agony that I'd grab the nearest application form for the Broederbond or whatever is fashionable these days for people wearing white sheets?\nToo many times.\nNews24 comments were NOT a barometer of South African public opinion. They were only ever going to be a barometer of the opinion of people who were the most confident in advancing their opinion (we forget that many people are chronically shy), were the most motivated to do so (i.e. angry), and were the most fluent in English (sometimes even not so much) and had access to computers (still cutting out the majority of our country's population there).\nIs this censorship? No. You're free to go wherever you want online and create your own platforms. You're free to say and think whatever you want, and god help your souls.\nNews24, however, is not a public space. It is not a soapbox paid for by your tax rands, and your 'freedom of speech' does not have to be guaranteed here.\nThis website - like all others - will live and die by its readership figures, and that readership will continue as long as it continues providing news (albeit sometimes shoddily reported or with grievous typos - infusion of skilled journalists notwithstanding).\nWell done to News24 for taking a real stand in South Africa. It is incredibly rare to see people take unpopular decisions with the vocal minority, and refreshing.\nHere's to less anger with our daily news. Less uninformed speculation. If the cost of that is less 'context', then I'll happily pay that price ... figuring out the context in all the noise had been next to impossible anyway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:04:54.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
