Previously, the four schools were using ResNet services from big cable companies, but according to Kyle Brown, chief information officer at SUNY Potsdam and Canton, the schools were receiving \"subpar service.\" \nSince so many other SUNY schools were satisfied with Apogee, IT administrators at the four SUNY schools decided to join the club. The new service will provide students with high-speed networking and wireless access throughout the residential buildings, including laundry rooms, game rooms and other common areas. A dedicated full-time Apogee coordinator will be on site to provide student support, and the company will also provide 24-hour support and troubleshooting by phone, email, chat and text message, including network support for all student devices, and enhanced network protections, testing and 24-hour network monitoring. \nIn addition to the other services, SUNY Cobleskill will offer its students video-over-IP service from Apogee, including all-digital, high-definition and digital video recorder packages and custom channel lineups. \nSUNY Canton, Cobleskill, Delhi and Potsdam implemented the Apogee ResNet service over the summer, so it would be in place in time for the fall 2015 semester.
