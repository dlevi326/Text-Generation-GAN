These games can in some cases be only four days apart.\nCome the knock-out stage of the tournament, the break between games is seven days, which gives the players sufficient time to recover from (most) of the knocks and tissue damage.\nThe initial selection policy of teams is usually focused on creating at least two players vying for each position within an allowed squad of 31 players. Several players have the ability to play multiple positions – so size matters – but player skill and preparation from training, combined with astute coaching decisions, remain the key to success.\nEarly upsets Japan’s shock 34-32 win against rugby heavyweights South Africa in their 2015 Rugby World Cup opener on Saturday night personifies the ever-closing gap between the best and the rest.\nAffectionately known as the Cherry Blossoms, Japan’s win over the heavily favoured Springbok outfit has been lauded by many as arguably the greatest upset not only in rugby union history but in all of sport.\nWhile from the outside Japan’s win may seem like David defeating Goliath, their meteoric rise did not happen overnight. Japan’s continual improvement over past decades has been acknowledged and rewarded via their inaugural inclusion in next year’s Super 18 Rugby competition .\nThe expansion of arguably the world’s strongest club competition will also include an Argentinian team, another definitive example of the globalisation of the game.\nRugby union is now truly an international game played by more than 7.23-million players in 120 countries across six continents . Participation numbers are rising rapidly.\nA growth in players… literally Over the past few decades the weight and size of rugby players have increased , irrespective of their role and playing position.\nBut Japan’s pack weight and height, which was a total of 57kg and 50cm less than their South African competitors, defies the logic that size is everything.\nThe South Africans were significantly bigger in their first Rugby World Cup game against Japan but that didn’t bring them victory.\nSouth African prop Jannie Du Plessis said prior to the game :\n[…] Japan has an efficient and a good scrum that’s going to be a massive challenge for us. So the challenge for us is to go and meet them at their height and still be effective ourselves.\nThe statistics from the game signify this challenge, with Japan winning all its own scrums. But Japan’s initial success in the World Cup took a turn overnight when they were defeated 45-10 by Scotland.\nIt’s more than just size that counts While anthropometric traits may contribute to team success, sporting performance is a multifactorial phenomenon. As such, teams that do not possess the size and shape of their opposition may have to find alternative solutions to succeed.\nAlthough the weight of rugby players has increased at each successive World Cup from 1987 to 2011, the size of the increase has plateaued in recent years.\nGiven rugby union is a game characterised by engaging in or evading physical contact, there must be an upper threshold at which any further increase in size of a rugby player may be detrimental to playing performance.\nWhile tactical and technical adjustments of playing strategy are fundamentally important to team success, there are numerous avenues to enhance sporting performance.\nImproved understanding of player activity profiles during training and matches via advances in wearable micro technology (such as GPS), paired with knowledge of how they recover, may enhance the likelihood of positive physical adaptation and reduce the likelihood of illness and injury via more effective training practices.\nSleep and nutrition practices are incredibly important for player recovery and mitigating fatigue that may influence playing performance.\nFatigue may also be associated with the travel demands of competition. This is of considerable importance given the international expansion of the game. Travel fatigue, which may manifest as jet lag when time zones are crossed, may have detrimental effects on athletic performance .\nUtilising a scientific approach to the preparation of athletes may reduce the gap between the traditional custodians of the game and the emergent nations, despite the size and shape of their populations.\nSport Rugby World Cup Rugby union Rugby Rugby World Cup 2015 You might also like Will rugby union remain one of the big four football codes in Australia?
