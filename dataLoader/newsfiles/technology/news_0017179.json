The right kind of education is liberation. Okay, I must admit that I think the curriculum in schools could definitely use some reshaping. I am a Masters student now and I have learned so much about society, people and life by majoring in Social sciences.\nI have learned to be anaylitical and critical and certainly not to take things at Face value. I do not believe that the subjects offered in school teaches you this.\nI did not necessarily enjoy my journey through (high) school. Primary school was the most fun as learning was based around outings, observing, playing and listening and you would only write exams in Grade 6 and 7 (well, more like mini exams). Once I got to High School I felt like I was in a day prison and I also started to question why we were learning the things we were learning. I found some of the subjects very pointless and not very useful in life. Often students in my class would ask, “why are we learning this?” and teachers gave generic answers that weren’t really answering the question.\nGranted, schooling has given me the necessary tools to cope in society, like being able to read and follow instructions but it did not teach me how to be smart about the decisions I make in life. In a sense, it taught me WHAT to think, in terms of learning work parrot fashion and regurgitating it in a test or exam. It also taught me that authority is always right. I used to get into arguments with some teachers because I would stick up for myself when I felt like I was being misunderstood. This resulted in me being sent to detention or to stand outside of the class so consequently you learn not to trust your own judgement but rather that of an authoritative figure.\nSchool did not teach me HOW to think, they did not teach me how to save money and invest, didn’t teach me how to read contracts or what proper telephone etiquette is, they didn’t teach me how important credit is but also how dangerous it can be, I wasn’t taught how to network and conduct myself with strangers, whether it be on the telephone or in person.Hence why people are so lost when they enter the workplace and have to learn almost as if they back in first grade. Ironically, lots of successful people did not even finish school…\nThat’s just the curriculum though. Which I think is quite oppressive but for somebody living in a poor area, sitting in a class room with no proper equipment or facilities is not only oppressive but marginalizing.\nLet’s be real. The education system under the Apartheid regime systematically privileged whites and disadvantaged people of colour. However, with Apartheid behind us (or not) the South African education system still reflects the inequality of the Apartheid era.\nGranted, our history alone is not to blame for our failing education system. People, like myself, have been able to use my education as I was able to gain access to University and from that opportunities arose. However, this is not the same reality for someone who is living in a low socio economic area. Schools in lower socio economic areas are significantly worse off than schools in more affluent areas.\nThey face challenges such as the lack of basic amenities, infrastructure and learning resources. Beyond that, even just commuting to school for pupils could be dangerous due to violence, which is another form of oppression. So with all that being said, where does it leave children or the younger generation? The curriculum is the same for everybody yet not every child enjoys the same level of education.\nLike Einstein said “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” I don’t believe writing an exam is of any benefit to a person, but that’s just me. Things make more sense when it is put to practical use.\nI guess I am writing this because I think of my (future) children that will go through the public schooling system.\nWithout a doubt, I give applause to teachers who are a great influence in the lives of children. Teachers can have a great influence on children and I have know many who are just that. What would be great is if teachers had more control over the curriculum and every child was tested in a way that was suited to their way of thinking. Not every person thinks the same so how is it possible to test them on one level? (refer back to Einstein Quote: )\nAnyway, these are my thoughts around education in SA. It just needs some redressing. Not to say that the whole system is in shambles or inefficient. However, it’s not equal and if it states so in the bill of rights then why ain’t it being implemented? mmmm???\nEducation is something we should all be advocating for..\nSee my blog at. realtalktalkreal.wordpress.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-07T20:08:28.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
