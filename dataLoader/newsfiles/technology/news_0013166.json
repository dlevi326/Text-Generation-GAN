According to the Australian Fair Work Commission , it definitely could be a factor.\nDeputy president Nicole Wells of the FWC ruled last Wednesday that a Tasmanian woman was bullied by a colleague who had unfriended her on Facebook after a workplace confrontation.\nThe Facebook unfriending was one of 18 allegations of harassment and unreasonable behavior brought forth by Rachael Roberts, a real estate agent, against her co-worker Lisa Bird.\nRoberts accused Bird of purposely delaying administrative work, damaging her reputation with clients and treating her unfavorably in comparison to other colleagues.\n‹ Dunkin' Donuts settles NJ lawsuit for $522K Facebook's new Brand Ad tools take on television Facebook offers businesses new pages, messaging › Wells determined that 8 of the allegations were substantiated and that Bird's continued behavior had caused a risk of health and safety for Roberts, who had sought psychological treatment for work-related stress.\n\"This action by Mrs Bird evinces a lack of emotional maturity and is indicative of unreasonable behavior, the likes of which I have already made findings on,\" Wells said in her decision .\nThe ruling does not mean that unfriending a colleague automatically constitutes bullying, but that the act could prove a pattern of unreasonable and hostile behaviors.\n\"Actions on social media, especially cyberbullying could certainly be used to substantiate a claim for harassment based on a hostile work environment,\" Ted Geiger, a New York attorney specializing in civil litigation, told CNBC.\n\"This decision here is a onetime decision and while the unfriending is the headline, since the decision was based on number of actions over a two year period…I don't think that unfriending will become the sole basis for liability anytime soon.\"\nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "external_links": ["https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/decisionssigned/html/2015FWC6556.htm"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T00:05:56.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
