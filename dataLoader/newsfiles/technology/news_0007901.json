Cloud computing involves the conversion of specific machines to a virtual image on a server within the cloud. Cloud virtualization software acts as an intermediary between cloud-based services and end-user systems. It helps in reducing operational costs and increasing efficiency of the entire network interface. Cloud virtualization solutions are not centralized and remain unaffected by natural calamities or power failures. However, this can lead to problems related to data security and privacy.
