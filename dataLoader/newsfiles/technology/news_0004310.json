Prototype versions of the units are currently undergoing rig and vehicle based testing and evaluation to confirm durability and the anticipated carbon dioxide impact.\nThe ULTRAN research project aims to accelerate cost-effective lightweight drivetrain technologies in order to reduce the powertrain weight of future vehicles, and hence improve vehicle performance and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\nThe project has developed, and is in the process of evaluating and demonstrating, a wide range of lightweight driveline technologies using the latest generation Range Rover as the baseline for the research. Ricardo activities on the ULTRAN project have also included further lightweight design and analysis studies on transmission, driveline and dual mass flywheel systems.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/Ultra-lightweight%20rear%20drive%20unit%20developed%20by%20Ricardo%20as%20part%20of%20ULTRAN%20project.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:13:05.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
