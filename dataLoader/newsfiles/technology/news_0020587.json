One of these devices is the theft of Max’s car, the baleful V8 Interceptor that facilitates his transformation from family man to roving desert avenger in the 1979 original. Reclaiming the vehicle and thus, Max’s feckless nomad lifestyle is a narrative crux in the sequels, with allies and antagonists basically serving as speed bumps.\nAvalanche’s videogame adaptation comes up with a smart variation on the theme, appropriate to the needs of an open-world game that, like fellow Warner Bros release Shadows of Mordor, borrows its spread of initially fogged-up map regions and stronghold infiltration missions from Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed series. Rather than rescuing his car, Max must build another, the Magnum Opus, using parts and scrap metal that are plucked from the wreckage of downed autos, the underbellies of dead towns and the hands of tribal fanatics.\nIn the process you’re called on to reevaluate the car as a symbol, or rather, to decide whether it means anything more profound than the ability to get the hell away from everybody else. This isn’t just my highfalutin’ reading of a B-movie plot. It’s right there in the script in the form of Chumbucket, the mutant greasemonkey who teams up with Max after he takes a fall at the hands of one Scabrous Scrotus, son of Mad Max: Fury Road’s guttural tyrant Immortan Joe.\nFor Chumbucket, the automobile is a goddess – an “Angel of Combustion” that, unlike most deities, also serves as a handy battering ram. In the course of the plot, you and he will pile dozens of upgrades onto your car’s holy frame, adding spiked hubcaps, flame jets and a giant fold-out sniper rifle. When he’s not tinkering with the Magnum Opus, Chumbucket rides around in the back, scuttling across the roof to make repairs. He also operates the delightful harpoon launcher that is the game’s clearest nod to Avalanche’s other open-world series, Just Cause, piercing and tearing loose doors, bodywork and hapless enemy drivers as Max ploughs across the dunes.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In the apocaltypic wasteland, hitchhikers do not take no for an answer Photograph: Warner Bros\nThe game’s on-the-road combat is excellent and brutal, if a shade too chaotic for its own good. Aiming the harpoon or Max’s shotgun triggers slow motion, buying you a respite in which to zero in on highlighted weak spots or swivel the camera to stare in consternation at an approaching hotrod, just before it T-bones you. Its lowest moments come when the Magnum Opus nears destruction – perhaps because the open-world structure has pitched you up against foes that your ride is ill-equipped to handle – obliging Max to leap out and somersault goofily around opposing roadsters while Chumbucket tends to the wounded car.\nIf the vehicular combat is firmly Avalanche’s baby, the on-foot stuff leans on the example of Rocksteady’s Batman games, with an all-powerful counter button that allows you to hold your own in a mob, providing you spot the button prompt before an attacker’s blow connects. The camera can be unwieldy indoors and elite enemies follow a predictable pattern (dodge the charge, then sock ‘em in the rear), but the unscientific thuggishness of the fisticuffs is worth sticking around for. Fists sail home like bricks into sandcastles, and there’s a Fury state that, once triggered by landing a certain number of hits, opens up wrestling throws and jump kicks for a beautifully savage finish.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The melee combat system allows you to hold the punch button, adding satisfying weight - but you open yourself to attack in the process. Photograph: Warner Bros\nAlas, for all its early promise the plot delivers no similarly satisfying conclusion: it’s embarrassing, throwback guff. Fury Road turned the tables on the notion of damsels in distress, with Charlize Theron driving a massive phallic emblem off into the wilderness. Avalanche’s tale puts the damsels front and centre, and somehow makes Max himself even more of a glassy-eyed, apathetic cipher than in any of the films.\nFans of the movies, and of open-world games alike, might retort that sticking to the plot’s beaten path is missing the point. But the vast stretches of dust, trash and oily swampland that surround the story offer their share of disappointments. The views are majestic, with dynamic weather systems rolling across the searing blue of the skybox, and the flames of refineries raging in the distance like multiple Eyes of Sauron. But the side activities – scouting out landmarks through weather balloons, racing, speaking to wastelanders about hidden loot, tracking down landmines – aren’t that novel, and the continual pressure to scoop up scrap for upgrades that move the story forward takes the joy out of scouring the landscape.\nYou could say that this focus on scant resources is in keeping with the theme, but however arid it seems on the surface, Mad Max is a power fantasy rather than a realistic survival sim. Put it this way: the authentic scarcity of materials doesn’t really agree with a game in which you can heal bullet injuries by swigging from your canteen. It says something about the design team’s (guilty) awareness of this that many of the perks you can unlock at friendly outposts merely accelerate the process of finding scrap, to the point of having non-player characters collect it on your behalf.\nMy original worry on hearing that Avalanche would be developing a Mad Max game was that the studio would simply make a post-apocalyptic version of its popular Just Cause series – without the rich buffet of absurd movement options and stacks of demolishable buildings. The game escapes that fate, but an abundance of rough edges, and a weak story, mean that it doesn’t quite go the distance. Avalanche has tuned the engine of the open-world driving genre, but this is certainly no revolution.\nWarner Bros; PC/PS3/PS4/Xbox 360/Xbox One; £40; Pegi Rating: 18", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441177416489/48bedf71-14ae-4bc1-a2e7-13929a499278-2060x1236.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=a21d8e3b85b3dcc086534ca820be506e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441177157401/42b03225-557c-4ebc-9434-d4894ad898e2-1020x612.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=fd60978bf6a55a6197570105f0c1cf14", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441177416489/48bedf71-14ae-4bc1-a2e7-13929a499278-2060x1236.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=ded1fc17f4a1ecc6bd4c12841e06d8e2", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c2mg%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441177416489/48bedf71-14ae-4bc1-a2e7-13929a499278-2060x1236.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=9be49656e10df312f8268298886e4aad", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441177157401/42b03225-557c-4ebc-9434-d4894ad898e2-1020x612.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=023a8b2cfbe3b64d34266617241797d3", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c2mg%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441177416489/48bedf71-14ae-4bc1-a2e7-13929a499278-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=f80db30b84896e9b45a76b514a14efa5", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Mad+Max+review+%E2%80%93+thrilling%2C+incendiary%2C+but+not+revolutionary&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2Fsep%2F02%2Fmad-max-review-thrilling-incendiary-not-revolutionary&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F2%2F1441177416489%2F48bedf71-14ae-4bc1-a2e7-13929a499278-2060x1236.jpeg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Mad+Max+review+%E2%80%93+thrilling%2C+incendiary%2C+but+not+revolutionary&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2Fsep%2F02%2Fmad-max-review-thrilling-incendiary-not-revolutionary&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F2%2F1441177157401%2F42b03225-557c-4ebc-9434-d4894ad898e2-1020x612.jpeg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441177157401/42b03225-557c-4ebc-9434-d4894ad898e2-1020x612.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=d695b69d4d4ff2da14c2c3ff112e676f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441177157401/42b03225-557c-4ebc-9434-d4894ad898e2-1020x612.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=f7b358f7d516552a31a9ffc0a2ae1d29", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Mad+Max+review+%E2%80%93+thrilling%2C+incendiary%2C+but+not+revolutionary&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c2mg%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Mad+Max+review+%E2%80%93+thrilling%2C+incendiary%2C+but+not+revolutionary&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c2mg%2Fstw%23img-2"], "published": "2015-09-02T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:58:45.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
