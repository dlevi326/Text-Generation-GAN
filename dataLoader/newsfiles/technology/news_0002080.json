Ryan Stuart by James Eyers A dozen of Australia's largest venture capital funds have agreed to work together to lobby the Turnbull government for start-up investor tax concessions and improved technology education in schools.\nStephen Thompson, a founding partner of Brandon Capital, a life sciences venture capital investor which closed a $200 million fund earlier this year, said members of a VC industry roundtable in Sydney on Friday agreed to \"pull together as one community to show we can produce globally relevant technologies, and build companies that can go to the globe out of Australia\".\nThe federal government has this year introduced two laws supporting the growth of start-ups. Employee share ownership plan rules have been reformed to remove an upfront tax liability that was hampering the ability of local start-ups to compete for talent, while significant investor visa rules have been introduced that force migrants bringing $5 million into Australia to invest $500,000 in venture capital.\nMr Thompson said additional measures could include tax concessions based on the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) in the UK, which provides a 50 per cent tax deduction on investments made in early-stage start-ups. \"The UK have put a lot of sensible schemes in place and other countries are doing similar things. If we don't follow, we will lose our competitive edge,\" he said.\nRick Baker, a managing director of Blackbird Ventures, which has just closed a $200 million fund to invest in local software and internet companies with global ambitions , said Friday's meeting had resolved that over the longer term it was crucial to boost education efforts in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) because these are the skills that will be most relevant in the digital economy.\nSkills and culture \"One of the things we all agreed on is we need to tackle skills and culture, which is longer-term than changing a tax incentive. We are looking for a long-term project to change the skills people have and the way they think about technology and entrepreneurship â€“ programs that start in primary school and teach the importance of being creative with technology rather than just being consumers of it.\"\nBrandon Capital and Blackbird Ventures were joined at the meeting by other venture capitalist funds AirTree Ventures, BlueChilli, OneVentures, Reinventure Group, Right Click Capital, Tank Stream Ventures and Southern Cross Venture Partners.\n The meeting at EY in Sydney was also attended by lawyers, advisers, not-for-profits and the Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, along with representatives from muru-D, the start-up accelerator backed by Telstra; Stone & Chalk, the fintech hub backed by many of Australia's largest financial institutions; APT Innovations, an incubator backed by four top universities; and Fishburners, a co-working space.\nYasser El-Ansary, the CEO of AVCAL, said the availability of capital for early-stage investing is improving and now the focus needs to be on ensuring capital \"finds a home in potential high-growth businesses and that Australia remains home base for those companies\".\nPointing to policies in Singapore and the UK, including the SEIS scheme, he said Australia does not have to reinvent the wheel on policy already explored and introduced overseas.\n\"We also talked about the opportunity that exists right now with our new Prime Minister, who understands the risk/reward equation for investing in high-growth businesses, and what it takes to incentivise entrepreneurship. This is, perhaps, a once-in-a-generation opportunity the start-up, early-stage ecosystem in Australia has right now, given we have a PM and a strong group of ministers, and others in the government and the opposition, who are passionate about transforming the landscape in this part of the economy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:18:22.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
