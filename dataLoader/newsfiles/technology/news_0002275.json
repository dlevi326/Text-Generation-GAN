We were very impressed with the company’s vision, and are excited to be part of the team,” Gupta said. \nFounded in 2014 by Amar Arsikere (CEO) and Buno Pati (Chairman), Infoworks has developed an automated management solution to discover, organise and manage data on Hadoop. \nA Java-based programming framework, Hadoop supports processing of large data sets in a distributed computing environment. \n“Just as Google crawls the web and organises information for search, the Infoworks dynamic date warehousing (DDW) platform automatically crawls enterprise databases, ingests the data into Hadoop, and organises it into high performance data warehouses and other data models that support all enterprise use cases,” said Arsikere. \nNexus is an India-focused venture capital firm with over $1 billion in assets under management. It has an active portfolio of over 50 companies across technology, internet, media, consumer and business services sectors. It has positions in Snapdeal, Housing.com, Lybrate and other tech firms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T13:50:58.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
