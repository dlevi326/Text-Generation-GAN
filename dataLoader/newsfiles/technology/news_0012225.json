Critics say abusive takedown notices can suppress free speech.\nStephanie Lenz of Gallitzin, Pennsylvania had in February 2007 uploaded to YouTube a blurry 29-second clip of her 13-month-old son Holden happily bobbing up and down to \"Let's Go Crazy,\" a 1984 song by Prince and The Revolution that played in the background.\nLenz said she thought her family and friends would enjoy seeing the toddler, who had just learned to walk, dance as well.\nBut Universal, which enforced Prince's copyrights, persuaded YouTube to remove Lenz's video, citing a good faith belief that the video was unauthorized.\nLenz had the video restored and, with the help of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, sued Universal over the takedown notice, saying the company knew her use was fair.\nIn January 2013, U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel in San Francisco said copyright holders must consider fair use, but denied Lenz's misrepresentation claim.\nUpholding that ruling, Tallman said there can be liability if a copyright holder \"knowingly misrepresented\" in a takedown notice that it had a good faith belief that a video \"did not constitute fair use.\"\nBut he said courts should defer to a copyright holder who has a \"subjective good faith belief\" to the contrary.\nThe 9th Circuit said Lenz failed to overcome this hurdle, and instead may seek nominal damages for the \"unquantifiable harm\" she suffered.\nUniversal and Lenz's lawyers had no immediate comment.\nThe case is Lenz v Universal Music Corp et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 13-16106, 13-16107.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Andrew Chung in New York)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T20:26:51.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
