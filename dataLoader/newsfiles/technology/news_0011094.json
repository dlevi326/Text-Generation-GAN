As there is no scientific factual evidence that early 'hominoids' had a specific skin colour, why do scientists always portray early hominoids as black?\n2. Currently we can modify genetics to suit ourselves, namely GM foods (fact). Also compare the probability of 400 billion years of earth spinning to evolve us (theory of evolution) versus the probability of a timeless multi verse producing far more advanced 'us' which could have 'GM'ed' us (theory of God). With this in mind why do we still say that that only evolution is the only 'fact' on how we came into existence? Are we scientists or just anti Godists? Science should have an open mind to facts and GM is a fact not a theory like evolution.\n3. Closer to politics. I don't support politicians who don't fear God. For one very basic reason. If they don't fear God, I will probably have to fear them as they will think that they are god. Based on Zille's tweet does the DA fear God?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:29:53.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
