That's literally what food start-ups are doing these days. Whether it's ensuring that you don't eat alone or delivering a healthy, nutrient-packed meal to your doorstep, young entrepreneurs are ensuring that they bring more to the plate. Feazt, a Hyderabad-based start-up founded by a team of five in January, believes in the concept of meeting new people over a homemade meal. For, in the age of social media, meeting over meals has become rare. \"Housewives sign up on our site and host feasts for a certain number of people at their home. Guests register for the meal of their choice. And the hosts meet their guests for the first time on the day of the feast,\" says Chaitanya Kishore, head of product and content, Feazt, adding that the host bracket has expanded to include award winning chefs while foreigners sometimes feature on the guest list. A thorough background check of the hosts and guests ensures that the process is safe. For Payal Valera, who hosted two feasts in Hyderabad, this concept - where people pay for the food you prepare - is interesting. \"All those who attended it were not known to me before. It was a nice experience. I always add a surprise dish like cupcakes or muffins to my menu,\" says the Gujarati homemaker, whose lip-smacking dabelis, a salty snack, were a hit. Kishore says hosts come up with innovative themes such as a 'wildness survival ' where guests have a meal in a forest or a traditional Onam feast complete with Kerala attire. Entrepreneur Rahul Reddy, who Firs has been a guest at six feasts, says, \"Long-term relationships are made with people you would otherwise not meet.\" Technology has come to the aid of these entrepreneurs as all of them operate through an online presence or apps. Chennai-based start-up 'More Milagai' encourages housewives to earn by cooking from home. The company, which was founded in June, also offers special homemade sweets and savouries on festivals, which can be ordered through their app, says its founder Vijaylakshmi app, says its founder Vijaylakshmi Ganesh. \"We also deliver just a side dish for a minimum price,\" she says. The 'start-up atmosphere' in Bengaluru grew on health and fit ness enthusiast Pushpesh Dutt, who left his bank job and eventually founded Tandurust with Sudhanshu Sharma this January. Working on a subscription-based system, the company specialises in providing healthy vegetarian dishes keeping in mind the calorie count. These pocket-friendly 'balanced' meals, delivered at your doorstep, seek to ensure that busy professionals don't have to compromise on their health. \"The food is made with healthy substitutes. For instance, we have oats and ragi idli, and red rice poha,\" says Dutt, explaining that they have a set menu every day . Meals can also be tai lored to suit the special di etary requirements of a person, if they have food allergies or high blood pres sure etc, provided prior notice is giv en, he adds. Saswata Shankar De, who worked for a US-based firm, was inspired to start 'The First Meal', which focuses on providing healthy breakfast & and brunch through online orders, when he realised that most people skip breakfast. \"I rarely had breakfast and when I did a survey , realised that 70% people skipped the first meal claiming they had 'no time',\" says De, who launched the company three months ago in Hyderabad. \"Our menu includes Indian and Western dishes, which are natural and prepared fresh every day. They contain no preservatives and are low on oil,\" he says. They also offer 'Regular', 'Diet' and 'Light' options, which are calorie-based. The team is also working with dieticians and nutritionists to address health conditions like dia betes and hypertension. \"Being a working mother, it is hard to grab healthy breakfast but such services make it simple,\" says Dr Urvashi Kaushik, who enjoys the variety offered. If you need to count calories at the breakfast table, the teatime snacks are a must-watch. Seeing a vacuum in the food industry for healthy snack-time munchies, Peeyush Gupta and Ishita Sharma founded The Nibble Box in April. 'Java Chip Latte' granola bars, 'Pumpkin Pie Spice' cookies, 'BBQ Boatclub' trail mix and 'Fig Flap' - a signature snack, are among the 100 products that this Mumbai-based com pany ships to customers in around 20,000 cities. Research for nearly two years resulted in recipes with dry fruits, fruits and imported seasoning like Za'atar and Piri piri, which lend the snacks their unique flavour. \"Our nutritionist helped ensure that our snacks have no preservatives, artificial additives or sugar,\" says Gupta, adding that their 'nutrition through nature' philosophy has netted them a large corporate market.
