The company ranked in the top 1,500 on the Inc. 5000 and in the top 200 on the Gulf Coast 500. Tower Cloud’s inclusion in Inc. Magazine marks the third consecutive year that the company has been awarded a spot in this coveted annual ranking of the fastest growing private companies in America. This is Inc. Magazine’s 34th year awarding companies the honor. Tower Cloud secured #1,349 this year. The Inc. 5000 list represents a comprehensive look at the most important segment of the economy—America’s independent entrepreneurs.\nAdditionally, Tower Cloud secured #195 on Business Observer’s Gulf Coast 500 list, a 12 spot jump from last year’s placement at #207. This ranking marks the second consecutive year the company has been included in this list. The Gulf Coast 500 list represents the 500 largest companies by gross revenue in Gulf Coast area.\n“We are honored to receive high rankings on both of these lists for multiple years in a row,” said Ronald Mudry, founder and CEO of Tower Cloud. “I attribute Tower Cloud’s success to our dedicated and talented team. We are all focused on the same goal – to provide our customers with the highest quality network services and superior execution.\nMethodology – Inc. 500|5000\nThe 2014 Inc. 5000 is ranked according to percentage revenue growth when comparing 2010 to 2013. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2010. They had to be U.S.-based, privately held, for profit, and independent--not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies--as of December 31, 2013. (Since then, a number of companies on the list have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2010 is $100,000; the minimum for 2013 is $2 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons. Companies on the Inc. 500 are featured in Inc.'s September issue. They represent the top tier of the Inc. 5000, which can be found at http://www.inc.com/5000 .\nMethodology – Gulf Coast 500\nThe Gulf Coast 500 is the most comprehensive list on the Gulf Coast by including companies in eight counties. The main list ranks the 500 largest companies by gross revenues for consistency and comparability. The Business Observer contacts businesses to gather their revenues for 2013 and 2014. The reported numbers do not include pass-through revenues for industries such as real estate, advertising agencies or professional employer organizations. In addition to including rankings for 2013 and 2014, the complete list provides other information about each company, including the number of full-time employees, the year founded or incorporated, the top executive, line of business and of course, valuable contact information.\nAbout Inc.\nFounded in 1979 and acquired in 2005 by Mansueto Ventures, Inc. is the only major brand dedicated exclusively to owners and managers of growing private companies, with the aim to deliver real solutions for today's innovative company builders.
