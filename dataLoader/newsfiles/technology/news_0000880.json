Moreover, FDA believes that patients can and should bring their own experiences to bear in helping the agency define meaningful benefits or unreasonable risks for certain new devices,” Nina L. Hunter, PhD, and Robert M. Califf, MD, wrote Friday on the FDAVoice blog .\nAccording to this post, the PEAC will discuss a number of important patient-related topics, such as how to best engage patients during the device development and assessment process and how the FDA and sponsors should communicate information about patient preferences to other patients. The formation of the PEAC supports the FDA’s continuing efforts to integrate patient perspectives into the medical device regulatory process.\nIn an interview published in the September/October issue of BI&T, Jeffrey Shuren, MD, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, talked about the importance of hearing the patient perspective in discussions about medical devices.\n“By recognizing a measure of uncertainty—and by putting our patients first—we have been able to construct a benefit-risk framework for medical device approval decisions and better understand what patients want, the risks they are willing to tolerate, and what they value as benefits,” Shuren said.\nThe FDA stressed that patient preferences will not be used to justify the approval of unsafe or ineffective devices.\n“While it’s important to consider patient perspectives, we understand that patients still expect FDA to do our primary job—namely, ensuring the safety and effectiveness of FDA-regulated medical devices,” Hunter and Califf wrote.\nThe FDA is asking for public feedback on the potential topics to be discussed by the PEAC until Nov. 20. The FDA is also currently accepting nominations for voting and non-voting PEAC members, including industry and consumer representatives.", "external_links": ["https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/09/21/2015-23522/request-for-nominations-of-individuals-and-industry-organizations-for-the-patient-engagement", "https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/09/21/2015-23521/establishment-of-the-patient-engagement-advisory-committee-establishment-of-a-public-docket-request", "https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/09/21/2015-23523/request-for-nominations-of-individuals-and-consumer-organizations-for-the-patient-engagement", "http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2015/09/fda-announces-first-ever-patient-engagement-advisory-committee/"], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T23:44:56.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
