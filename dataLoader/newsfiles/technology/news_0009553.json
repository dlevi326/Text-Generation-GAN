And do you know what that judge did, ladies and gentlemen? He called a press conference and he said to the newsmen, ‘This mugging of me will in no way affect my decision in matters of this kind.’ And an elderly lady got up in the back of the room and said, ‘Then mug him again.’”\nIt was crime more than any other single issue that drove blue-collar voters in the industrial states from the party of Truman and Johnson to the party of Nixon and Reagan. In 1974—a year of energy shock, inflation, recession, Watergate, Vietnam, and other crises—Americans told pollsters they regarded crime as the single-most important issue facing the country. That year, the Department of Justice introduced a new and more accurate method of collecting crime statistics. It found that 37 million American households—one out of four—had suffered a rape, robbery, burglary, assault, larceny, or auto theft in the previous year.", "external_links": ["https://books.google.com/books?id=Ku9DvnGK4Y0C&pg=PA12&dq=david+frum+crime+70s&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIycqK9bPixwIVyzo-Ch0h2Qfz#v=onepage&q=david%20frum%20crime%2070s&f=false"], "published": "2015-09-21T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:34:27.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
