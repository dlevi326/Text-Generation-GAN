(OTCBB:CHGT) as it seeks to expand into new markets and open additional revenue streams. \nForecasts show 3D printing for medical applications will enjoy an impressive 15.4 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the rest of this decade. The market will increase to $965 million by 2019, up from $354 million in 2012. \n“Healthcare and medical are areas that show tremendous future growth possibilities,” said CHGT CEO Marco Valenzuela. “We’ll continue to pursue all opportunities there as they offer solid revenue potential and a means to build shareholder value.” \nMedical researchers have made great advances in using 3D printing technology. A company in the U.K. recently perfected a process to dramatically cut the cost of prosthetics , manufacturing a set of bionic hands for amputees using 3D printing. \nHospital-made prosthetics can cost $100,000 . 3D printing can make prosthetic hands that are also lighter and more comfortable for the wearer for a fraction of that price. Currently, two million people in the U.S. are living without a limb and could benefit from a 3D-printed prosthetic. There are an additional 185,000 amputations in the U.S. each year. \nFor more information on CHGT, please visit www.changingtechno.com . \nFor more information on 6 th Dimension Technologies, please visit http://www.6d3d.com . \nAbout Changing Technologies, Inc. \nChanging Technologies, Inc.
