With SPViewer 3.0, iOS users have the exclusivity to open, view, analyse and print Microsoft project files prepared in any MS Project version, including MS Project 2016.\nIn addition, with SPViewer 3.0 users can create and customize professional graphical reports that will provide critical project status information and ensure team members are up-to-date with the project progress.
