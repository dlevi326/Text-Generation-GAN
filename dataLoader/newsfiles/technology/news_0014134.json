Picture: SOWETAN Related articles Wits school of business wins with case studies New business degree to add prestige lost by MBA Business schools use innovative methods to select new students SA spearheads drive to nurture African management talent In this article People: Blade Nzimande NEW Master of Business Administration (MBA) rules requiring students to possess a previous honours or equivalent degree will not have a long-term effect on the market, say business schools.\nUntil now, the MBA has been a hybrid academic mix of honours and master’s. As a result, an ordinary bachelor’s degree has usually been sufficient for entry.\nFrom 2016, when the MBA becomes a full master’s, entry standards will rise and students will need at least an honours or equivalent. Figures from South African business schools reveal that of all students who began their MBAs this year, 54% would have failed the new entry criteria. To bring students up to the required level, schools are expanding their capacity to offer a postgraduate diploma (PGDips) in business studies. This qualification, effectively the first stage of an MBA, is considered honours level and once students complete it, they will be accepted into a full MBA programme.\nBut there are time and cost implications. The PGDip is a year long and can cost up to R80,000. MBAs already cost from R61,500 to more than R200,000 and last up to three years.\nHelena van Zyl, director of the University of the Free State School of Management, says many employers, particularly parastatals, are already cutting back on higher education spending and this will make things worse.\nThat is why schools are trying to minimise the pain. Some, such as the university schools at Stellenbosch and Nelson Mandela Metropolitan in Port Elizabeth, are reducing the duration of their part-time MBAs from three years to two, so the total time, including PGDip, will remain three years. Others are waiving the PGDip fee if students go straight into an MBA. At Wits Business School they pay only the R210,000 MBA bill, without the additional R80,000 PGDip fee.\nThere are no rules on how to manage the challenge. Each school is tackling it in its own way. As a result of the changes, most schools are reporting a drop in the number of students registering for MBAs next year. All, however, say PGDip applications have increased. As these students make their way through the system and the market becomes accustomed to the new rules, schools say MBA numbers will return to normal within two or three years.\nThe MBA changes are the result of a general overhaul of South African higher education that involves a new academic rating of degrees. According to Stellenbosch school dean Piet Naude, the existing MBA is academically part honours, part master’s. The new degree will be wholly master’s.\nSchools offering MBAs must have their programmes accredited by the government’s Council on Higher Education. Some schools have failed to do so in time and will continue with their current programmes in 2016. That means new students will not need an honours degree to be accepted.\nThe Council on Higher Education says Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande will eventually set a cut-off date for these programmes.\nMBA programmes that started this year or earlier are unaffected by the changes and students will continue their studies as before. The council says old programmes will carry as much weight as new.\nAs with the current system, from next year schools will be allowed to reserve up to 10% of MBA places for students without the requisite academic background, but with suitable business and management experience. This is known as recognition of prior learning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:03:56.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
