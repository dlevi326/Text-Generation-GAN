Martin underwent counseling, Incognito was suspended, and neither played for the Dolphins again. Incognito is now with the Buffalo Bills.\nAn NFL investigation determined Incognito and two other offensive linemen engaged in a pattern of harassment toward Martin.\nIn his post Wednesday, Martin referred to the Dolphins' locker room situation with a profane synonym for \"lousy.\" Trying to fit in, Martin said, he abused alcohol, used marijuana and created a persona.\n\"You see football as the only thing that you are good at, your only avenue to make the shy, depressed, weird kid from high school 'cool,'\" he wrote. \"Your job leads you to attempt to kill yourself on multiple occasions. Your self-perceived social inadequacy dominates your every waking moment & thought. You're petrified of going to work.\"\nMartin played in 2014 for the San Francisco 49ers. He signed this year with the Carolina Panthers but hurt his back during offseason workouts.\nAfter three years in the NFL, he said, he decided the risk of permanent injury wasn't worth it and retired.\n\"You let your demons go, knowing that, perhaps, sharing your story can help some other chubby, goofy, socially-isolated kid getting bullied in America who feels like no one in the world cares about them,\" his post concluded. \"And let them know that they are not alone.\"\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n___\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
