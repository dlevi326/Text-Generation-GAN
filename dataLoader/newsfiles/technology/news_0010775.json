Challenges with their fax service paired with the manual tracking, scanning, and attachment processes in HomeCare HomeBase (HCHB) were hindering their staff’s efficiency. To help sustain their rapid growth the southwest Florida-based hospice agency began searching for solutions that could streamline their processes, outsource their fax infrastructure, and provide a tight, comprehensive integration with HCHB.\nAfter meeting the Forcura team at the annual HCHB User’s Conference in Dallas, Avow gave Forcura the opportunity to learn more about the needs and challenges within their organization. Since the organization handles a high volume of admissions 24/7, the ability to access Forcura from anywhere, at any time was critical in their decision. Within three weeks, Avow Hospice decided to move forward with Forcura and simplify their process for attaching documents to charts in HCHB.\nTodd Neiert, Avow’s Director of Information Technology, spearheaded the Forcura project and is very excited to see the improvements it will garner. Regarding the new partnership Neiert stated, “We look forward to partnering with Forcura to streamline our internal processes. After performing extensive due diligence with multiple vendors, we felt that Forcura’s comprehensive offering set them apart from their competition. The direct integration with our primary EMR, HomeCare HomeBase, coupled with accessibility across all departments was the driving factor in our decision.”\nForcura’s CEO and Founder, Craig Mandeville, is equally enthusiastic about the new partnership saying, “I am proud to welcome Avow Hospice to the Forcura family. Avow is a highly regarded hospice organization providing unmatched quality in patient care. We are looking forward to a long-term, mutually beneficial partnership with Todd and the Avow team.”\nAbout Forcura\nForcura is a leading document workflow technology company headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida with a focus in home health, hospice, and managed care.
