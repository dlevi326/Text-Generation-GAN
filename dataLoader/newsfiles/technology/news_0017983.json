This growth has largely been the result of an expanding number of consumers who use technology to monitor traffic situations in order to take alternate routes when driving.\" One of the leading causes of death around the world is road-related accidents, says Cattya Bella, Director of Product Development for World Patent Marketing. While some road accidents occur due to poor weather conditions, most of these accidents are caused by human error. Our newest automobile invention is a better and improved solution that will create a safer road environment for all, and that solution is called Akpemely. Akpemely is an extremely practical and efficient automobile invention which improves the functions of a traffic light. This invention features an audible alarm system which makes a sound every time the traffic lighting changes. It functions as a constant sound reminder for both drivers and pedestrians to pay attention and move quickly. Ultimately, this automobile invention is an effective means to lessen road accidents, prevent damage to property and save lives. People are often preoccupied with their phones and don't realize that the traffic light has already changed, says inventor Manasse L. Akpemely features a highly audible sound which indicates a change in the traffic light. Even when people are looking at their phones, they will be able to hear the sound, prodding them to move much faster. Georg Foster, a successful entrepreneur and blogger from Lubbock, TX, has this to say about Akpemely: When driving after a long day, people are most likely to fall asleep on the wheel. This traffic light modification has a clear and audible sound which will keep individuals awake until such time they arrive home, thus preventing damages to property and injury to others. Akpemely is a traffic light attachment which improves the efficiency of traffic lights and pedestrian signals. This automobile invention is designed with a volume control which allows for a louder sound depending on the need as well as vehicle and pedestrian volume.
