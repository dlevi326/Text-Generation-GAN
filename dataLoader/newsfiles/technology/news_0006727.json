If we want to stay competitive, we have got to get the STEM dimension up to a level where we are competitive.” \nOkraski, 79, sat down for a chat with Orlando Sentinel technology reporter Marco Santana for a look at the area’s simulation industry. \nOn the defense megaconference I/ITSEC: \nIt had its origin in 1966 when 50 people attended the conference at Orlando’s Air Force base. It has grown today where it had about 15,000 attendees just for the program itself and another 5,000 for the exhibits. (This includes) people from about 60 different countries. The purpose is really to have industry and other organizations to display their technology and have the military organizations. \nOn the origins of simulation in Orlando: \nAt that time, Orlando was a sleepy little town in the orange groves. The only technology component down here was, essentially, Lockheed Martin. They did have minimal simulation going on. They had a helicopter simulator that they used for research. They developed what they called a bullpup trainer at the time. Both were very primitive devices, but other than that there really was no other simulation. \nOn importance of teaching students STEM: \nWe have a very large workforce here in Central Florida. We need to keep the pipeline going in modeling and simulation. In the schools, there are pockets that offer modeling and simulation courses in the public schools and even some of the private schools. They recognize that industry has to feed their base to keep it going.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T04:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T16:28:10.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
