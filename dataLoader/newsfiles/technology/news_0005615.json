He said Uber drivers did not pay the correct taxes and the company did not have the licence needed to operate as a form of public transport. \nUber spokesman Karun Arya, however, told Reuters in a email that none of its drivers had been arrested, but added that the company was in contact with Jakarta Governor Basuki \"Ahok\" Tjahaja Purnama to address any issues related to its licence. \n\"You have been given incorrect information by the Jakarta Police,\" Arya added. \nOn its website, the firm asked customers to sign a petition to help \"save\" it in Jakarta. \nUber launched in Jakarta last year and has some 6,000 drivers. Other car-hailing apps and online services such as GrabTaxi and motorbike app Go-Jek also operate in the city, where traffic congestion is notorious and public transport is lacking. \nThe crackdown on U.S.-based Uber in Jakarta is the latest in a series of troubles facing the company across the world. Taxi drivers have staged protests against the service for hurting their livelihoods while many city governments have banned it for breaching licensing laws.
