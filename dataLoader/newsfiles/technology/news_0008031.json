The second, in 2011, lasted a year.\nContributed Raul Diaz served as a medical officer in Iraq and Afghanistan and had difficulty adjusting to life outside a war zone when he returned home. (Contributed) Both times Diaz, who worked as a member of a combat stress unit, had a tough time readjusting to life outside a war zone.\n“It was a challenge,” he said. “It’s normal to come back with recollections of things you saw and you think about that. You dream about it.”\nNot only that, Diaz’s two kids had grown. His wife had taken on more responsibilities around the house to make up for her husband’s absence. His parents moved in to help out.\nA Mobile Vet Center like this one is coming to Palm Beach State College on Thursday to help student veterans. “It was an adjustment dealing with all of that,” Diaz said. “But you stay connected with those you deployed with, you reconnect with people in the community and you talk things through with others who have been there. But it takes time.”\nAs a licensed psychologist and team leader of The Palm Beach Vet Center, Diaz, 58, is helping other veterans dealing with some of the same challenges he wrestled.\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Readjustment Counseling Service will set up a Mobile Vet Center at Palm Beach State College’s Lake Worth campus to help student veterans and their families. The center will be staffed with four volunteers from the Palm Beach Vet Center and will be on site from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m.\nThe center will offer advice and help on everything from post traumatic stress disorder to how to update your resume.\n“Coming back from a war zone is not an easy thing,” Diaz said. “Sometimes you bring the war zone back with you.”\nHave a Lake Worth issue you’d like to see The Post tackle, or a story idea?
