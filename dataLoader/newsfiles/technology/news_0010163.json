In fact, our research shows that providing staff with connectivity and access to online tools and information while they’re at work is helping the public sector save up to 2 million hours a week. \n“We look forward to working with TfL over the coming years to ensure a smooth-running service which benefits the network’s passengers and staff alike.” \nThe award of the contract comes after TfL was issued with repeated warnings by the Independent Investment Programme Advisory Group (IIPAG), a body set up to advise the Mayor of London’s office about TfL’s projects and investments. \nIIPAG said it believes TfL wastes £300m a year on fragmented and ageing telecoms services that are no longer fit for purpose. \nIt has issued numerous calls for TfL to restructure its telecoms model. In 2014 it recommended the creation of a single team to manage TfL’s system-wide telecoms assets and services, in an attempt to bring down its annual telecoms spending. \nBut one year on, a follow-up review found very little progress had been made . \nTfL is currently undergoing a separate £400m networks tower procurement for a wide area network (WAN) and access network managed service, which will be awarded in June 2016. \nThe contract will cover networks tower ecosystem collaboration, service management, project delivery, design and technical assurance, network transformation, WAN provision, access network provision and support services. \nThe previous TfL networking contract, held by Fujitsu since 2004, was extended after it expired at the end of 2014.
