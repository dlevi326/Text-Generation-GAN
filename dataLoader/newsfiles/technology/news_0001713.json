It took us a couple of hours and we set it up with our beach at Manly.\n“We want to make sure the tourist buses aren’t parking improperly, so they’re not ruining the view or leaving their engine running, things like that.\nMr Rogers said his team receives photos via email, and the machine learning technology means he’s only alerted if there’s an anomaly.\n“Azure Machine Learning has been previously trained on 10,000 ‘normal’ or ‘control’ images from the camera, so each time we upload an image it makes a judgment as to whether it’s normal or whether there’s some sort of anomaly,” he said.\n“If Azure Machine Learning tells us there’s an anomaly, we have a script on our end that will email the right people so they can immediately go and check out what’s happening.”\nHe said the team can now have more of a response model to working, rather than need to patrol for incidents, therefore saving ratepayers a significant amount of money that can be used elsewhere.\nMr Rogers also said he was planning on using the technology to predict surf conditions, given Manly’s title as the birthplace of surfing in Australia.\nThe city attracts around eight million visitors each year.\nDarren Younger, Founder of TechBeach in Manly, said “it is great to see Council working to bring positive change to their community through adopting this type of technology. They are obviously a very innovative organisation and are showing strong leadership in adopting this new technology”.\nMicrosoft said its Azure IoT Suite pricing averages at roughly $1.50 per device/month.\nIt also announced today the launch of its Microsoft Azure Certified for IoT program, an ecosystem of partners including Intel, Raspberry Pi, and Texas Instruments among others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:21:22.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
