What’s more, the company has actually put the watch on sale right now in Western Europe. \nThe Huawei Watch was first teased at MWC earlier this year, but since then the company have remained pretty quiet on the details of the gorgeous looking device. There were however many rumours suggesting that the watch would be either really expensive, with some reports suggesting over £1000, and other reports saying it’ll cost around £300. \nFortunately for fans of the watch, the latter report was the most accurate as the Huawei Watch, which goes on sale in Western Europe today, will cost either €399.00 and €699.00 depending on the model chosen. \nThe first of its kind for the company, the Huawei Watch has a full-round display with a resolution of 400 x 400 pixels resolution in 286 ppi at a 10,000:1 high contrast ratio, “making it the most vibrant Android Wear smart watch to date,” say Huawei in a press release. \nThe Huawei Watch will also be powered by Android Wear meaning it’ll come with all of the great features available to other smartwatch users such as notifications on the wrist, the ability to use voice commands, and change tracks at the touch of a button. Now, thanks to compatibility with iOS, the Huawei Watch will also work for iPhone users too. \nThe watch itself measures at 42mm in diameter, the traditional dimension for wristwatches. It also has a crown located at the two o’clock position, similar to the leaked images of the Moto 360 2 . \nAs for style, the watch will come in various colour options such as rose gold, stainless steel, and black, as well as a choice of different straps from stainless steel mesh, stainless steel links, rose gold, and black-plated stainless steel links, as well as brown and black leather. Have a favourite strap however? Fortunately the Huawei Watch fits any watch strap with 18mm width lug interface. \nIt also comes with a heart rate monitor for those who want to keep track of their fitness in style. \nThe Huawei watch will also be available for pre-order in the US from today. It will go on sale in the UK, Japan and UAE in October and information on further regions will be released later this year.
