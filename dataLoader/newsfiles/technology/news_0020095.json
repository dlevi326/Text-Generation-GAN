WordCaptain allows you to look up any unfamiliar English words and instantly translates them into your native language when you read on any website from the built-in web browser or reading references listed in the app. Once you find a word to look up, the app will ask you to read through the dictionary page and define the word based off of it. WordCaptain is all about helping you retain and memorize new words in their context. For any new word you look up, a flash card is automatically created and stored that provides you with word pronunciation, meaning and use in context for you to study and master.\n\"The idea for WordCaptain started in Ho Chi Minh City when I saw a high demand for students to attend English classes,\" said WordCaptain developer Hai Pham. \"By directly interacting with hundreds of students, many of them expressed to me the struggle they feel of trying to acquire a new vocabulary and how it hinders them in all areas such as reading, writing, listening and speaking. I believe WordCaptain will be a great tool and resource that will help these students and other people who struggle with English to really develop in that area.\"\nFeatured in WordCaptain are also four tests made from your collected flashcards that you can take to challenge your knowledge. It will test your ability to read, listen, write and pronounce them to ensure you will master them. A test performance is also provided so you know your level of proficiency with each word.

Undoubtedly, this app removes the frustration of understanding English and it not being your first language.
