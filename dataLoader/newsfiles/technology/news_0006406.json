Founded less than 3 years ago, Yiwugou.com was amazingly able to participate in this high-level E -commerce summit sponsored by Chinese regional government, to share its experience with global well-known E -commerce platforms like Alibaba.com and JD.com. This fully shows that the unique O2O model of Yiwugou.com was widely accepted. Government officials of China and ASEAN countries, representatives of benchmarking enterprises in E -commerce, principals of important business associations and famous economists were invited to explore the new strategy of \"Internet +\" and new model of \"Cross-border Development, Innovative Interconnection\". Mr. Wang Jianjun , CEO of Yiwugou.com, was invited to participate in  an important task named \"high-end conversation on the new base of China-ASEAN cross- border E-commerce\", sharing the exploring ideas and achievements of Yiwugou.com. Compar ed with well-known international E -commerce platforms, Yiwugou.com is a great example   of \"Internet +\". By definition, based on the physical market, Yiwugou.com's developing experience is of great significance. \nInformatization of Physical Market with Innovative Ideas Combining Online and Offline \nIt is well-known that informatization is a basic and important task. Where there is no informatization of a physical market, there can be no development. Yiwugou.com has devoted particular attention to integrat ing  online services with offline services during the process of informatization. For example, Yiwugou.com set up a credit system combining online integrity level and offline market management, taking advantage of traceable physical market s to enhance its enforceability. Yiwugou.com also   came up with  several creative ideas on technological development, such as a 360Â° panoramic view of purchase s which offers immersive shopping experience online. Yiwugou.com was subsequently awarded \"The Most Innovative Enterprise of China E-commerce\" award on Sept. 8, 2015  at the China E-commerce Industry Conference, owing to its continuous innovation on business model and technology development.\nLeveraging the \"Global Partnership Plan\" to B uild a Huge Spider-web E-commerce Platform with Credit Concept \nThe \"Global Partnership Plan\" was started  in 2014. Currently, Yiwugou.com has signed 57 domestic professional markets and 23 overseas partners. With the development of the \"Global Partnership Plan\" and the growth of transaction volume, Yiwugou.com's credit system escalated quickly. Earlier this year, sellers on Yiwugou.com gained the first batch of official online business licenses and can be better supervised by national laws and regulations than enterprise certification s   from third-party platforms like Alibaba.com. Then, Yiwugou.com launched \"Honest Brands\" to gather competitive first-hand goods together and enhance its brand image - \"Made in Yiwu\". At present, there are over 2,000 online business licenses and nearly 500 \" H onest B rands \" on Yiwugou.com.\nHitting Overseas Market s and Carrying Forward the Cross-Border E-commerce Wholesale Platform \nIf the\"Global Partnership Plan\" helps   sellers on Yiwugou.com improve their cross-border E-commerce business, the upcoming cross-border E-commerce wholesale platform  will be  able to complete online transaction s directly, which is markedly different from the current one. Also, sellers on Yiwugou.com are centralized and goods can be concentrated conveniently. Different kinds of goods purchased from disparate suppliers by one buyer can be provided LCL services and centralized customs services in Yiwu to reduce the purchasing cost.\nIn the first half of this year, Yiwugou.com's online trading volume exceeded 900 million yuan which implied an over three-fold  rise from a year  ago. Lately, Yiwugou.com was selected to the list of 2015 - 2016 annual E-commerce models by the Ministry of Commerce,  solidifying its place as a rising E-commerce star. \nAbout Yiwugou.com \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20141215/164355LOGO \n\nSOURCE Yiwugou\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://en.yiwugou.com/web/aboutus.html", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:09:14.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
