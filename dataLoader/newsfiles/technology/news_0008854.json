Google Maps assured me I was on the right path, but I had to wonder if someone was having a laugh. You know the area is dodgy when it has signs like this. Picture: Justin Hall A common sight walking down Market Street. Pictured Franco Folini The Twitter sign was a sight for sore eyes. This beautiful building made me feel a lot more safe than I did outside. Cool, looks like I am in the right place. I have to agree this would be awesome in the summer sun. Obviously, this wasn’t the day I visited. Twitter occupies level five to nine of the building. Instead of sitting at the desks in the background, staff are encouraged to lounge. Every office should come standard with log cabins. #meatzone and #sando are two of the places staff can get food on this floor. Everyone needs good coffee. Right? Just in case people forgot where they worked. There is no escaping the Twitter bird. I feel like there may be some subtle brainwashing going on here. When someone gifts you something like this, you can’t not hang it. This is probably the best reason to get a job with Twitter. 1 of n \nThe open-air drug markets seemed brazen and this was confirmed minutes later when I passed two police officers interrogating some dubious looking characters. \nThe streets were also filled with homeless people begging for change/hurling abuse when people didn’t acknowledge them.
