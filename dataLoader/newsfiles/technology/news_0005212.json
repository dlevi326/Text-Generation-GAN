North America has the largest market for PUR hot melt adhesives, followed by Europe and Asia-Pacific. China is the largest consumer of PUR hot melt adhesive products owing to greater demand from manufacturing and electronics industry. North America is expected to maintain its dominance in the forecasted period. Europe is expected to show average growth. However, Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness highest growth in the coming future. Increasing number of manufacturing units in the developing region such as India is expected to boost the Asian market.Polyurethane Reactive (PUR) hot melt has a combination of different positive attributes found in various, unique adhesives. PUR hot melt is not found in the normal form of a glue stick or bulk pellet, instead, it is melted from a solid prior to application and commonly dispensed from a 10oz tube similar to caulking adhesive. PUR hot melt solidifies through moisture in the air to form a super strong bond that will not re-melt. There are both high and low temperature PUR adhesives so make sure you are using the correct applicator when working with PUR products.PUR glues are a more recent development for perfect binding and are largely different from the EVA and SBR (styrene butadiene rubber) hot melts. They polymerize when applied so that they form much stronger bonds than traditional hot melts. They also possess superior flexibility and can withstand a larger range of temperatures. They are currently much more expensive than traditional EVA hot melts (2-4X) but application rates are much lower. Transitioning to reactive hot-melt polyurethane (PUR) offers companies a way to stay relevant and competitive.There is low control on the consumption of high VOC adhesives in China and India, due to the absence of related government policies. Market players are keen to expand their product portfolio and offer it to consumers at competitive prices. The major market players are focusing on R&D activities to innovate products under the regulations of EPA and REACH. Other development strategies opted by market players include signing agreements and collaborations to optimize their distribution chain in growing economies.The emerging regions such as Asia, South America, Middle-East and developing regions from Europe have been witnessing sizeable growth prospects for Hot melts adhesives.Companies profiled in the PUR hot melt adhesives market report include 3M Corporation, American Chemical Inc., Ashland Inc., Avery Dennison Corporation, Beardow & Adams (Adhesives) Ltd., Bostik Inc., Dow Corning Corporation, Nordson, Evans Adhesive Corporation Ltd, H.B. Fuller, Henkel AG, Hexcel Corporation, Huntsman Corporation, Jowat AG, Sika AG, among others. Drivers This growth is largely by advancements in technology various increase in application usage has growing demand. Major end user industries are growing, which in turn has spurred the growth of adhesives and sealants. Market users for adhesives and sealants vary from construction to packaging and labeling, automotive industry, footwear, transportation, Assembly, Consumer DIY and woodworking. Growth in the market over the next few years will be driven by growing product penetration in new application markets, product differentiation and innovations. Challenges Volatility in raw material prices provides a major challenge on the global hot melt adhesives market by 2020. Raw materials for adhesives are polymeric materials may be naturally occurring and synthetic where natural polymers like starch, gelatin, asphalt, bitumen natural rubber, and resin and synthetic polymers like vinyl & acrylics have witnessed a volatility in raw material costs during this period especially affected demand for hot melt adhesive during 2013 and 2014. Growing volatility in the prices of raw materials has increased pressure on margins of adhesives and sealants manufacturers.
