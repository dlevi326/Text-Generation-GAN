The robot will also get its own navigation system to allow users to programme its route.\nThe Russian military has already expressed interest in the robot as it can carry a weight of up to 10 grammes and could potentially carry portable cameras into enclosed spaces.\n 29, 2015 6:30 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:07:16.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
