The company is partnering with leading charities around the world to create cause-based 360º video experiences at no cost to the charity, using HoneyVR’s “Hive” network of professional virtual reality filmmakers.\n“Our goal is to use virtual reality to give people a deep, emotional connection to a social cause,” stated Steven Austine, company’s CEO and co-founder. “Typically with social causes, people don’t engage to support the cause unless they feel an emotional connection to the issue. We feel strongly that virtual reality can provide those emotional connections between people and social causes on a scale which is unprecedented in history.”\nAccording to company officials, participating charities will be paired with virtual reality filmmakers from HoneyVR’s “Hive” network in order to create 3 - 10 minute VR films about a social cause, at no cost to the charity. In one project, a whale and her calf are followed on an epic odyssey meant to raise awareness on illegal fishing issues. The projects cover a range of social causes including environmental, cultural, health issues, and more. All completed VR films will be available at no charge to consumers in the HoneyVR app across all VR platforms including Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR, Sony Morpheus, and others in early 2016.\n“We are passionate about virtual reality projects that are both entertaining and culturally significant, such as the ‘Catalyst’ series we’re announcing today as well as the ‘Time Traveler’ series we announced in July, which memorializes historical events using virtual reality,” stated Brandon Mizrahie, a co-founder at HoneyVR. “The company plans to announce other content programs in the future which are both important for society and extremely entertaining.”\nAbout HoneyVR\nBased in Denver and founded in 2015, HoneyVR is a leader in virtual reality content and innovation. The company produces and distributes ultra-immersive VR experiences across all virtual reality platforms including Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR, HTC Vive, Sony Morpheus, and Google Cardboard for Android and iOS. Our Hive community is the world’s first network of professional virtual reality content creators, with hundreds of participating artists and studios.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12946551.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12946551.htm"], "published": "2015-09-08T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:36:23.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
