The track will be an 8km long tunnel, to which the vacuum pumping equipment from Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum is connected. \nUsing optimum vacuum conditions with an expected pressure range between 100mbar and 1mbar, the air resistance against the transport capsule will be reduced and thus the total energy demand of the system is significantly lowered. \n“With our unique simulation software PASCAL we can interpret the entire Hyperloop conditioning in every detail and thus calculate the required vacuum equipment for optimum operation. In addition, we are contacting partners already involved during the run-up phase for all the design issues on vacuum engineering and for the subsequent implementation,” explains Carl Brockmeyer, Head of Business Devel- opment and Leader for this ambitious project at Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum. Just by taking advantage of existing and proven pumps and systems, a variety of vacuum combinations are possible, with dry com- pressing, as well as with conventional oil-sealed vacuum pumps. \nOerlikon Leybold Vacuum sees a high potential in the technology, and since vacuum technology is needed, the company aims to contribute to the success of Hyperloop. “There is a very special motivation in contributing to something fundamentally new which can revolutionized the traditional means of trans- portation,” says Dr. Martin Füllenbach, CEO of Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T19:18:44.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
