Now anyone working at a small nonprofit can use Tableau to better manage programs, tell impact stories through data, or increase the effectiveness of fundraising efforts.\" \nTableau Desktop is a drag-and-drop software application that allows people to analyze data of any size or format. People use the product to visualize data, answer questions, create dashboards and monitor information. Results can be shared with other Tableau Desktop users, through the free Tableau Reader, or posted online with Tableau Public. \nAlongside the free software program, the company also announced the launch of the Tableau Service Corps , a volunteer network of Tableau employees who are eager to help nonprofits see and understand their data. Regardless of organization size, a nonprofit can request help on a data-focused project from one of the many volunteers listed on the Tableau Service Corps website. While separate initiatives, the two programs were launched simultaneously so that any nonprofit could use Tableau software and have access to experts who can help make the most of it. \nTo obtain software through the Tableau for Nonprofits program, visit http://www.tableaufoundation.org/free/ . The program is administered through TechSoup, a nonprofit that offers free resources to nonprofits and libraries and charges an administration fee to facilitate the product donation. This program is currently available for U.S. based 501Â©(3) public charities. \nAbout Tableau Foundation \nThe Tableau Foundation is an initiative led by the employees of Tableau Software (NYSE: DATA ) that encourages the use of facts and analytical reasoning to solve the world's problems.
