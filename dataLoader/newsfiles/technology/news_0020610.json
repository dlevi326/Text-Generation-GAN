Lannett said it expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter.\nLannett's shares, up 15% this year, rose nearly 18% to $58.25 in late trading.\nPhiladelphia-based Lannett, which is borrowing up to $1.29 billion, in part to fund the transaction, estimated a mid- to high-single-digit increase in adjusted profit in fiscal 2016 and 20% to 25% increase in fiscal 2017.\nOn a pro forma basis, Lannett said the deal will leave it with about $225 million left in its credit line.\n\"KU brings considerable manufacturing capacity, a first class research and development team and the potential for advancing our active pharmaceutical ingredients business,\" Lannett Chief Executive Arthur Bedrosian said.\nKremers Urban, based in Princeton, N.J., is a specialty generic-drug maker. Its main drug is a generic form of Johnson & Johnson's Concerta, used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nBelgian pharmaceutical company UCB, which acquired Kremers Urban when it bought Schwarz Pharma in 2006, tried to sell it last year to private-equity firms Advent International and Avista Capital Partners for $1.53 billion. The deal was called off when the Food and Drug Administration changed the ratings for two Concerta generics and requested additional information showing bioequivalency to Concerta.\nThe contingency payments in the Lannett deal are tied to the FDA's restoring the rating. Kremers Urban submitted the final results of new bioequivalence studies in June. Under the current rating, its methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets can be prescribed but may not be automatically substituted for Concerta at pharmacy counters.\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com\nSeptember 02, 2015 18:35 ET (22:35 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:29:43.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
