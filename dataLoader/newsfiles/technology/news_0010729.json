Paring waste streams will enable Ford to be more efficient while helping to improve the environment.\nThe nearly three-year effort to achieve landfill-free status started by identifying various waste streams and categorizing them from smallest to largest. Waste managers and environmental engineers then worked to find creative solutions to avoid using landfills while not incurring additional cost to manage the waste. The move also included recycling training for campus employees.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/Ford_research-engineering-recycle.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T11:43:29.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
