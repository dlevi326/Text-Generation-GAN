COLONY is a co-production between Legendary Television and Universal Cable Productions. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20101014/SF81638LOGO \nLeading up to its Season 1 premiere Netflix has licensed second window streaming rights to COLONY, which now joins the ranks of other popular, highly-rated, and critically acclaimed series that Netflix has recently acquired such as \"How to Get Away with Murder,\" \"Jane the Virgin,\" and \"Zoo,\" all entering their second seasons. Netflix will stream COLONY about a year after its linear broadcast on USA in the U.S., on Bell Media's Bravo in Canada, and after its linear broadcast in other territories worldwide. \nSet in the very near future, COLONY centers on one family's struggle to survive and bring liberty back to the people of an occupied Los Angeles. \nSAG winner Josh Holloway (\"Lost\") stars as former FBI agent Will Bowman and Satellite Award winner Sarah Wayne Callies (\"The Walking Dead\") stars as his wife, Katie, in the series which takes place in a dangerous world of divided ideologies. While some choose to collaborate with the occupation and benefit from the new order, others rebel and suffer the consequences. After being separated from their son during the invasion, Will and Katie are willing to do whatever is necessary to be reunited with him. Thus, when the powerful Proxy Snyder (Peter Jacobson, \"House\") offers Will a chance to get his son back if he will collaborate with the occupational government, Will and Katie find themselves faced with the toughest decision of their lives. They will have to go beyond whatever they thought possible, risking their lives and their relationship to protect their family. Nelson McCormick (\"24\") also executive produces. \n\"We knew from the moment we saw it that COLONY is the kind of smart serialized drama that Netflix members around the world would love watching,\" said Ted Sarandos, Netflix Chief Content Officer. \n\"We here at Legendary Television are thrilled that COLONY has a new global home in Netflix,\" said Bruce Rosenblum, President, Legendary Television & Digital Media. \"Netflix is the perfect service to stream COLONY after its initial broadcast in all countries outside North America, whether allowing fans to catch up with their favorite show before the new season airs or enticing new fans to the series. Netflix's purchase of rights to COLONY, even before Season 1 has aired, is a huge vote of confidence for this exciting new drama.\" \n\"As we ready to premiere COLONY in January, this deal with Netflix will expand the global audience reach of a show we're all so proud of right out of the gate,\" said Jeff Wachtel, Chief Content Officer, NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment and President, Universal Cable Productions. \"In this age of new business models and innovative windowing, this unprecedented access to international viewers is an extraordinarily positive sign in the right direction to grow the series as a long-term asset for our studio.\" \n\"We applaud Netflix for recognizing COLONY's value even before it has begun to air on USA. NBCUniversal is pleased to partner with Netflix on COLONY to make the show available to an even larger audience in the U.S. and Canada,\" said Frances Manfredi, President, NBCUniversal, TV & New Media Distribution, U.S. and Canada. \nNBCUniversal TV & New Media Distribution holds domestic distribution rights for COLONY in the U.S.A. and Canada.
