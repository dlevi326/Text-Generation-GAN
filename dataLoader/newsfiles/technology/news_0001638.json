If changes in the inflation rate should be faster or slower, this has an influence.\"\nThe comments echo remarks made earlier this week by ECB executive board member Sabine Lautenschläger. Speaking in Milan, Ms Lautenschläger said \"it is too early to speak about concrete measures of broadening QE,\" referring to the ECB's broad-based asset purchase program.\nSince March, the ECB has spent €60 billion ($US67.4 billion) each month on mostly government bonds in an effort to revive inflation and growth in the currency bloc. The program is expected to end in September next year, but the ECB has always said that it would last until inflation approaches its medium-term target of just below 2 per cent.\nThe ECB has intensified its willingness to extend purchases beyond the September 2016 end-date, as inflation rates have hovered near zero for months. In September, eurozone consumer prices fell annually for the first time since the ECB launched its program in March, data showed Wednesday.\nBank of Finland Governor Erkki Liikanen said last week that QE can be expanded if needed to ensure that inflation doesn't stay too weak for too long with damaging economic effects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:32:12.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
