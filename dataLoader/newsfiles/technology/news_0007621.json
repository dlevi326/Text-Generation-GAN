There are various technologies that are used depending on the type of application. Retail stores predominantly use resistive touch screen technology for various applications. Resistive technology will continue to be the major technology application in retail outlets. \nAccording to the report, the market is shifting to high-tech in-store mobile applications, which is a major trend in the retail industry, and thus projected capacitive technology, which is the leading technology used in smartphone and tablet displays, is expected to grow. The technology has seven times more endurance than resistive technology and thus can be a cost-effective solution in the long run. Projected capacitive technology can support multi-touch technology, which is another major industry trend. \nFurther, the report states that increasing cost of production is a major challenge for this market. \nKey Topics Covered", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T06:35:45.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
