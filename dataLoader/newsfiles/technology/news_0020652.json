Each affected employee will be given an equivalent of 60 days of pay and benefits. The employees are not represented by a union, and they do not have bumping rights, meaning employees with more seniority whose jobs are eliminated cannot take the jobs of less-senior employees. These cuts are in addition to the 77 jobs cut earlier this year and the 66 announced in November . As with those instances, HP said the latest cuts were due to further corporate restructuring at its 11445 Compaq Center Drive W. location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T01:59:02.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
