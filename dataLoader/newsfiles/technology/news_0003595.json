Stars crowd each other as they whiz through space like cars on a rush-hour freeway. Supernova explosions ... Fast radio bursts might come from nearby stars December 12, 2013 \nFirst discovered in 2007, \"fast radio bursts\" continue to defy explanation. These cosmic chirps last for only a thousandth of a second. The characteristics of the radio pulses suggested that they came from galaxies billions ... DRAGNs in the sky September 9, 2014 \nA radio galaxy is a galaxy that emits large amounts of radio waves. They were first discovered in the 1950s, but it wasn't until the 1960s when a technique known as aperture synthesis was developed that we could resolve the ... VLA reveals 'bashful' black hole in neighboring galaxy June 17, 2015 \nThanks to the extraordinary sensitivity of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), astronomers have detected what they believe is the long-sought radio emission coming from a supermassive black hole at the center of one ... Starry surprise in the bulge: encounter of a halo passerby July 22, 2015 \nA team led by Andrea Kunder from the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP) measured the velocity of a sample of 100 old RR Lyrae stars thought to reside in the Galactic bulge, the central group of stars found in ... Interstellar seeds could create oases of life August 27, 2015 \nWe only have one example of a planet with life: Earth. But within the next generation, it should become possible to detect signs of life on planets orbiting distant stars. If we find alien life, new questions will arise. ... Recommended for you Radio telescopes could spot stars hidden in the galactic center September 22, 2015 \nThe center of our Milky Way galaxy is a mysterious place. Not only is it thousands of light-years away, it's also cloaked in so much dust that most stars within are rendered invisible. Harvard researchers are proposing a ... Comet surface changes before Rosetta's eyes September 22, 2015 \nIn the months leading to the perihelion of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Rosetta scientists have been witnessing dramatic and rapid surface changes on the Imhotep region, as reported in a paper to be published in Astronomy ... Pairs of supermassive black holes in galaxies may be rarer than previously thought September 21, 2015 \nThere may be fewer pairs of supermassive black holes orbiting each other at the cores of giant galaxies than previously thought, according to a new study by astronomers who analyzed data from the National Science Foundation's ... DESI, an ambitious probe of dark energy, achieves its next major milestone September 21, 2015 \nDESI, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, is an exceptional apparatus designed to improve our understanding of the role of dark energy in the expansion history of the universe; it will do this by measuring the redshifts ... New support for converging black holes in Virgo constellation September 16, 2015 \nEarlier this year, astronomers discovered what appeared to be a pair of supermassive black holes circling toward a collision so powerful it would send a burst of gravitational waves surging through the fabric of space-time ... Advanced alien civilizations rare or absent in the local universe September 16, 2015 \nSensitive new telescopes now permit astronomers to detect the waste heat that is expected to be a signature of advanced alien civilizations that can harness enormous energies on the scale of the stellar output of their own ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T19:16:55.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
