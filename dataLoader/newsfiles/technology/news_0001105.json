But if the apprenticeship program is successful, similar programs will be designed and implemented in the future, Goins said. \nThe length of each program will be determined by the type of credentials the apprentices and employers hope to achieve, but will typically range 18-36 months. \nThe program comes amid a bigger, statewide push but the governor to increase IT educational opportunities. Computer systems design and related services is one of the top 10 industries in Arkansas, according to the ADWS. \nThe AAC, which has 75 apprenticeship locations and works with more than 2,000 employers across the state, will serve 30 software architect apprentices over the two-year period of the grant. The program is targeted toward people interested in pursuing careers in IT, but eligibility preference will be given to dislocated workers. \nAAC is accepting applications for the Little Rock area. People interested in enrolling in the IT apprenticeship program or other apprenticeship programs should contact Breashears at (870) 246-0320 or Karen@NATF.US .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T20:44:50.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
