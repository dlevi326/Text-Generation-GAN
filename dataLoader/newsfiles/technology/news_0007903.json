If colour has to be brought into sport do it across the board. Swimming, gymnastics, chess, badminton.\nOur country is going to \"%#$ and people focus on things that are not improving any of the daily matters, violence,corruption and so on.

I don’t know apartheid and I’m sure the kids at varsity has even been less affected by it.\nThey have an opportunity to study but instead complain about it, Give me that opportunity to go to varsity man....Come right South Africa!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T19:02:39.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
