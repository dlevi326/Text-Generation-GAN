Plan ways to proactively address tech burnout. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) 10 CONNECT 8 TWEET 3   \nIn my last column, I brought up the \"nerd-life balance\" challenges facing employees in the tech world. \nStress, time pressure and complex tasks are common in most every field. But in the IT world, there are some unique factors that can literally drive techies crazy. \nAsk any experienced software developer to share their programming \"war stories\" and be prepared for a long conversation. \nMost coders love to code. But the coding part of developing software is often only a small portion of the tasks involved in a complex software development project. \nWhen building a website, mobile app, or full-blown software application, programmers are working within an \"iron triangle\" (that they have little control over) juggling the trade-offs between resources, deadlines and requirements. If requirements change but resources and deadlines do not, coders simply must dig in and code faster. \nTechies often consider it a badge of honor to work late nights solving complex problems under immense pressure. But at some point, burnout can creep in. \nAs a workaholic techie as well as a manager of other techies, I have learned projects have a better chance of success if every player on the team can keep their enthusiasm intact. Whether your business depends on external tech resources or an internal IT department, if burnout, resentment or outright mental illness takes hold of a computer professional, the end product will suffer. \nKeeping techies mentally healthy is something that few of us think about in the heat of a project battle. But, with the shortage of techies available, proactively addressing tech burnout is good for business. \nSo how do you keep techies happy, healthy and productive? \nRecognize that each team member is different. Each person has unique needs and circumstances that shape how much they can work, what they are good at and what they struggle with. Recognizing each team member's unique characteristics and embracing them rather than forcing the same expectations on everyone can create a well-oiled machine of productive techies. \nCreate a noncompetitive culture. Much like a sports team, group chemistry is just as important to a software development team as raw talent. If I am the backup point guard on my basketball team and I secretly hope the starting guard will miss a shot so I can get more playing time, our teamwork suffers. \nThe same thing applies to techies. Establishing a culture where techies know it's OK not to be a genius at everything comes from the top down. It's an essential part of building a good tech team to let techies know its OK to say \"I don't know\" or to fail without fear for their jobs or reputation. \nAvoid the \"forced overpromise.\" \"You can finish this by Friday, right? Techie: \"I'm not sure.\" \"You have to finish by Friday â€” can you get it done?\" Techie: \"I think so ... yes.\" \nTech tasks are notoriously hard to estimate. If a techie is truly not sure if they can make a deadline, it's better to allow them to just say so, rather than forcing them to overpromise. The forced overpromise needlessly leads to an unhealthy culture of stress and resentment. \nHave their backs. No one means to miss a deadline or make a mistake. Bugs and glitches happen to everyone. Managers that take the pressure off by focusing on problem-solving rather than punishing will keep their techies both sane and productive. \nAs the world's dependence on technology continues to grow, great IT professionals are becoming a scarce resource and should be valued and safe-guarded as such. \nJJ Rosen is the founder of Atiba, a Nashville IT consulting , programming, networking, web design, and web development firm.
