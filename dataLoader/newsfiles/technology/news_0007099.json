The PV panels were installed by Maui Pacific Solar and took about six weeks to complete. \n“The PV panels [on Maunakea] are the second highest in the world by about 200 feet [~61 meters]. The highest are in Tibet.” says Maui Pacific Solar Founder and President Mike Carroll. “However, it is the highest rooftop mounted PV system in the world that is connected to the utility.” \nThe solar panels will (conservatively) generate about 10% of the power required to operate the Maunakea facility, and will be roughly 70% more energy productive than the panels planned for installation on the roof of the observatory’s base facility in Hilo. \nThe table below shows a side-by-side comparison of PV panel installation at the Hilo Base Facility versus the Gemini North telescope on Maunakea. The reason for this productivity boost on Maunakea is a combination of clear skies, lower temperatures, and less absorption in the atmosphere.
