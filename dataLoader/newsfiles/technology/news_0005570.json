The income from 2014 was due to the revaluation of our derivative liability. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2015 the Company has reduced its derivative liability from approximately $3.3 million at June 30, 2014 to approximately $1.0 million at June 30, 2015 through warrant exercises and exchanges.\nThe Company ended the 2015 fiscal year with approximately $1.75 million of cash and cash equivalents. Subsequent to the 2015 fiscal year end, the company announced the closing of a registered direct placement with $2.6 million in gross proceeds received from the offering.\nBased on management's current projections, the Company has enough capital to fund its operations into the third quarter of 2016.\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nThe following represents selected financial information as of June 30, 2015 .

In more than 40 Phase I and II clinical studies sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, VAL-083 demonstrated safety and efficacy in treating a number of cancers including lung, brain, cervical, ovarian tumors and leukemia. VAL-083 is approved in China for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and lung cancer and has received orphan drug designation in Europe and the U.S. for the treatment of gliomas.\nDelMar is currently studying VAL-083 in a multi-center Phase I/II clinical trial for patients with refractory GBM in accordance with the protocol that has been filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at five clinical centers in the United States: Mayo Clinic ( Rochester, MN ); UCSF ( San Francisco, CA ) and three centers associated with the Sarah Cannon Cancer Research Institute ( Nashville, TN , Sarasota, FL and Denver, CO ). As a potential treatment for glioblastoma, VAL-083's mechanism of action appears to be unaffected by the expression of MGMT, a DNA repair enzyme that is implicated in chemotherapy resistance and poor outcomes following front-line treatment with Temodar ® (temozolomide).\nAbout DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nDelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was founded to develop and commercialize proven cancer therapies in new orphan drug indications where patients are failing or have become intolerable to modern targeted or biologic treatments. The Company's lead drug in development, VAL-083, is currently undergoing clinical trials in the U.S. as a potential treatment for refractory glioblastoma multiforme. VAL-083 has been extensively studied by U.S. National Cancer Institute, and is currently approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and lung cancer in China . Published pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that VAL-083 may be active against a range of tumor types via a novel mechanism of action that could provide improved treatment options for patients.\nFor further information, please visit http://delmarpharma.com/ ; or contact DelMar Pharmaceuticals Investor Relations: ir@delmarpharma.com / (604) 629-5989.
