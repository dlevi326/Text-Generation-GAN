Today, Lockheed Martin launches Prepar3D® v3, allowing users to build or experience advanced simulation environments and tools that simplify development and augment the training experience. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150929/271906 \nPrepar3D v3 enhancements simplify training scenario creation by employing a SimDirector drag-and-drop technique. The user interface is also improved, with expanded gauge and panel training through Autodesk® Scaleform® support. A new avatar mode enables users to experience the simulated environment in the third or first person for increased realism and situational awareness. \nPrepar3D continues to partner with hundreds of third party developers and partners in an active community that continuously enhances the software. Prepar3D v3 features memory and performance improvements to provide greater fidelity and increased realism. Users can now utilize next generation hardware to achieve a heightened experience that was never before possible. \nFrom novice learners to military service members, Prepar3D provides a realistic training environment for critical mission readiness. First launched in 2010, Prepar3D is a full earth simulation platform through which users can create training scenarios anywhere in the virtual world - from underwater to suborbital space. It offers immersive, experiential learning for private pilots, commercial organizations, militaries, and academia. \nPrepar3D exists at the core of many of Lockheed Martin's complex flight simulators. In any industry where simulation is relevant, customers will realize benefits from this realistic training environment. \nFor additional information, visit our website: www.prepar3d.com . \nAbout Lockheed Martin Headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 112,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.
