YOU STILL A CRYBABY?” That got your attention, didn’t it? It’s also the kind of heckling that gets the attention of hitters and throws off their focus. In 2013, Baseball Factory CEO Steve Sclafani and stress training expert Dr. James E. Driskell teamed up and devised an innovative new method to help players overcome such distractions. Called “The Game Time Pressure Training & Simulation Program,” it created a simulated in-game environment so players could practice while learning to deal with everyday commotion they may face on the field. Now, Baseball Factory is bringing this revolutionary training method into the digital realm with its free Game Time Pressure Training app. The app will provide players with the ability to train and develop their skills both on and off the field.\nDesigned for players ages 11-18, the app digitally recreates “stressors” based on the studies conducted by Sclafani and Driskell. These studies isolated the five main elements that hamstrung players on the baseball field: Performance pressure, competitive demands, time pressure, task load, and noise.\n“We’re giving hitters a chance to rapidly improve their game day performance by learning how to block out distractions,” says Sclafani. “It’s never going to be quiet in a real game, so why do baseball players practice this way? The more a player learns to deal with stressors, the more confident they’ll be when it counts the most.”\nWith the app, players set up a “virtual baseball card” profile and jump right into the action. They can attempt to focus on pitches while hearing random heckling (like the Quote: above) and crowd noise – and even add their own parents, coaches and teammates. They can also simulate training exercises and test their vision and balance with custom-designed wheel displays and phone gyroscope games.\n“If hitters really want to improve, training should not be a comfortable situation,” Sclafani continues. “The Baseball Factory’s two decades as the leaders in player development tell us that being successful as a hitter in a game is so much more than just having good mechanics.”\nPlayers can also get pointers by accessing Baseball Factory video tutorials. These tutorials cover techniques ranging from teeing up to working on balance and pitching. When players are finished, the app gives them a way to calculate how well they’ve performed. Then they can try again to improve their ranking.\nThe app is already off to a running start: In its first 48 hours, it was downloaded over 1,000 times by young baseball players from around the country.\n###\nAbout Baseball Factory, Inc.\nBaseball Factory provides baseball players nationwide with the very best instruction, tournament competition, and college planning and guidance.
