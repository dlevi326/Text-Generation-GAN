The malware uploads stolen data to its command and control (C2) server, which itself contains vulnerabilities that expose user information.”\nHe said Palo Alto Networks notified Apple about KeyRaider on August 26 and provided it with the stolen account information.\nIt is suspected that user ‘mischa07’ is the culprit — Mr Xiao said some of the tweaks mischa07 uploaded have been downloaded tens of thousands of times.\nThe malicious apps and tweaks provide functionalities such as game cheating, system tuning and app advertisement stripping.\nWeipTech only recovered about half of the stolen accounts “before the attacker fixed the vulnerability,” Xiao wrote.\nOne victim reported their phone was held for ransom, while the malware has also been used to steal Apple accounts to buy apps.\nPalo Alto Networks also said stolen accounts can be used for app promotion, spam and device unlocking, as well as fraud.\n“Our primary suggestion for those who want to prevent KeyRaider and similar malware is to never jailbreak your iPhone or iPad if you can avoid it,” Mr Xiao said.\n“At this point in time, there aren’t any Cydia repositories that perform strict security checks on apps or tweaks uploaded to them. Use all Cydia repositories at your own risk.”\nApple has been contacted for comment.\nThis article was first published in The Australian Business Review.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/keyraider-hijacks-more-than-225000-apple-accounts/story-e6frgakx-1227506583517"], "published": "2015-09-01T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:26:00.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
