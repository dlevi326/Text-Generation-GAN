New England saw the sharpest declines, with double-digit falls in New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Outside of the Northeast, the numbers varied greatly: Illinois saw an 8.3 percent decline, for example, while Florida saw reports of violent crime increase by almost 17 percent.\nThe UCR is the most well-known measure of crime in the United States, but it’s not flawless. FBI Director James Comey, who told reporters in April that it was “ridiculous that I can’t tell you how many people were shot by the police last week, last month, last year,” announced a new initiative Monday to collect more data on police shootings in the wake of high-profile incidents over the past year. But activists warned that police departments would still submit data on a voluntary basis instead of through a desired mandatory system.", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/28/fbi-police-killings-voluntary-reporting-system"], "published": "2015-09-29T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T19:50:15.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
