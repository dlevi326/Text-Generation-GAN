With this information clinicians are able to make a more informed decision on the child’s ADHD care.\n“Regardless of the type of treatment involved, whether medication, behavioral therapy, or dietary treatment, it is essential the clinician know how well core ADHD symptoms are being managed and how the child is performing in important domains so adjustments can be made to optimize the child’s ADHD care,” stated David Rabiner, Ph.D., Clinical Psychologist, research professor, and associate dean at Duke University. “But unfortunately, recent research suggests that this may not always be the case. A study by Epstein et al. shows that rating scale data from parents and teachers, which help determine a child's treatment response, is rarely a part of follow-up medical visits. As a result, it is likely that many children are deriving less benefit from treatment than they would if treatment monitoring were occurring.” For this reason, ADHD treatment guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry highlight the necessity of sustained, systematic treatment monitoring.\nIn July, CHADD and Attention Point formed a strategic partnership to increase awareness of the importance of treatment monitoring and to increase access to educational and ADHD management resources. “We’re glad to be working with such a wonderful organization and I applaud CHADD for recognizing the need for better communication,” stated Sam English, PhD, founder & CEO of Attention Point. “I believe DefiniPoint will benefit CHADD parents and families and ultimately result in better care for children with ADHD.”\nAbout Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\nADHD is one of the most common childhood neurobehavioral disorders. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, parents report that approximately 11 percent or 6.4 million children ages 4 to 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD in the US and 82.5% of diagnosed children are receiving medication and/or treatment by a mental health professional. It is estimated that the annual direct cost of the diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing management of ADHD in the US is approximately $30 billion.
