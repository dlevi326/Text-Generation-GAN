The goal, though, wasn’t to show off the cherry red, $50,000-plus convertible but instead the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto systems.\nRather than having to learn a new system to access a GPS, or having to plug in an iPod, the driver simply accesses Google maps or Spotify as if they were using their smartphone.\n“It’s all about convenience,” said Patrick Hernandez, Regional Communications Manager at General Motors. “It’s a platform that gives customers convenience and ease by using the same platform that they are already comfortable with. It’s much more user-friendly.”\nLet’s apply a similar user-friendly consumer approach to highway information.\nIn transportation lingo, I am a commuter. In reality, I am a transportation consumer. You are as well.\nWe pack the highways each day — truckers, landscapers, AC repair crews, you name it — to a standstill, literally. And lost time in traffic costs all of us money, time and productivity.\nA pet peeve on my daily, 64-mile commute deals with messaging on the lighted blackboards parsed out along the interstates. The other is non-synchronized traffic lights — but that’s for another column.\nSpecifically, too often the highway signs disseminate general information — “Southern Blvd, 20 miles, 20-22 minutes.”\nThe estimates tend to be accurate, but what we transportation consumers really need to know is exactly where the snarls are so we can decide whether to ride out the congestion or find an alternate route. That’s what other states like California do.\nAlso, the signs need to be consistent in telling us if the accident is before a specific exit, not at . That way we know which exit to get back on if we choose to detour.\nOn occasion, there’s imprecise information — “No reported delays to Daytona Beach” when in fact there is an accident right after the sign.\nI spoke with Daniel Smith, ITS Operation Manager for the Florida Department of Transportation. He said the discrepancy is in the definition of an incident, meaning an accident. FDOT defines an incident as one that blocks at least one lane.\nOnce the wrecked autos have moved to the side of the road, it’s no longer reported.\nI disagree. Even after damaged cars and debris are on the shoulder, costly delays continue. People slow down to gawk. And Florida law requires you to reduce your speed in the lane next to an emergency vehicle. That causes delays in the other lanes, too.\nSmith suggests using the Florida 511 app for real time data and email and text alerts from smartsunguide.com. Both of those are very helpful, and FDOT ought to promote their availability on the highway message signs. But the signs themselves also need to be more helpful.\nIn business, the cliche goes, time is money. We transportation consumers need precise information to make smart, time-saving traffic choices — whether via an app, a text alert or a highway message sign.\n</span", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T12:41:39.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
