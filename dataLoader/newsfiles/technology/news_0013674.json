Whether or not he wanted the police to arrest him, they shouldn’t have done so https://t.co/LtOFAAmVxK\n— Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) September 20, 2015 Dawkins also tweeted this YouTube video called “Ahmed Mohamed Clock is a FRAUD”, in which the creator suggests Ahmed brought the clock into his school, Macarthur High School, to create an “alarmed reaction”.\n“This man seems to know what he’s talking about,” Dawkins added.\nThe British-born writer stuck to his guns as other Twitter users objected to his comments, adding: “Assembling clock from bought components is fine. Taking clock out of its case to make it look as if he built it is not fine. Which is true?\n“Yes, there are other reasons why a boy might take a clock out of its casing & pretend he’d made it. Trying to impress teachers, for instance.”\n@I_Love_Atheism Because he disassembled & reassembled a clock (which is fine) & then claimed it was his \"invention\" (which is fraud).\n— Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) September 20, 2015 @HarryStopes I don&apos;t know. Possibly wanted to be arrested? Police played into his hands? Anyway, now invited to White House, crowdfunded etc\n— Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) September 20, 2015 When asked why he was so annoyed, Dawkins replied: “Because he disassembled & reassembled a clock (which is fine) & then claimed it was his “invention” (which is fraud).”\nBut Dawkins eventually backed down, saying he was sorry if he went “a bit over the top in my passion for truth”.\nAcclaimed author Richard Dawkins. He then retweeted a tweet by US President Barack Obama, in which Obama compliments Ahmed on his “cool clock” and invites him to visit the White House.\nAhmed’s arrest last week roused the attention of a host of big names, including presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, NASA engineers and Ahmed’s “dream school”, the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nAhmed Mohamed, 14, poses for a photo at his home in Irving, Texas with his home-built device. Picture: Vernon Bryant / The Dallas Morning News via AP But former Alaska governor Sarah Palin took aim at the ninth-grader on Facebook yesterday, saying school authorities were justified in thinking Ahmed’s clock could have been a bomb.\n“Right,” she said. “That’s a clock, and I’m the Queen of England.”\nAhmed, an aspiring engineer who spends his spare time tinkering with inventions in his bedroom, said he invented the clock and brought it into school to show off to his teacher.\nHe was arrested and interviewed by police at length, and suspended from school despite charges against him being dropped.\n“It made me feel like I wasn’t a human. It made me feel like I was a criminal,” Ahmed said after his release.\n Richard Dawkins slams teenage ‘fraud’", "external_links": ["https://t.co/LtOFAAmVxK", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEmSwJTqpgY", "https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/645534680033423360", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f24aea371c54f655bd11e7c05d2331e3", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/716df18eaed25d9c705c55a211ecac73", "https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/645555802636464129", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a8bbe1ab90a69576463acacabd23ce87?width=650", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/sarah-palin-says-arrest-of-clock-making-whiz-kid-ahmed-mohamed-was-justified/story-fnjwucti-1227535771535", "https://twitter.com/HarryStopes", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/richard-dawkins-questions-whether-ahmed-mohamed-really-did-invent-controversial-clock/story-fnjwucti-1227537770720?sv=e031e5c36b68c6ef7cdf19788b68022", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f5aae49e3ec10a8f11ec8dfeaa614ded", "https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/645519286082138112", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dd95b197f8c89552c1feb15bee8fcaec", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/366686b539b559f61996661fc233ac6f?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0596a1b3c0cbb697b2397b7485e1f947", "https://twitter.com/I_Love_Atheism", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e68981e1b37731ad88d2c133cb43bfd1"], "published": "2015-09-22T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T00:15:12.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
