An overgrowth of yeast in the gut causes it to ferment carbs into booze, sending their blood alcohol levels soaring.\nBreathalyser tests on people with the condition reveal blood alcohol levels that could kill an ordinary person. And the hangovers are horrendous.\n“There was an initial buzz, a slight feeling of being tipsy, but mainly the symptoms were the hangover,” Matthew Hogg told news.com.au\n“If I had a meal that included starchy foods, I’d wake up with a hangover you’d expect from a couple of bottles of wine or ten pints of beer. I’d have a banging headache, I’d be sick and I’d have cold sweats and the shakes. It was like the worst hangover imaginable.”\nIt took 20 years for 36-year-old Matthew, from Yorkshire, to work out what was wrong with him.\n“All through my childhood, I had chronic infections — nose and throat, stomach pains, colic. I was fatigued and drained. The doctors were a bit clueless. I was diagnosed with ME because they couldn’t really find answers.”\nThe 36-year-old’s gut ferments yeast into alcohol. Source: Supplied\nIn his teens, Matthew tried to ignore his problems, playing sport, socialising and drinking with friends. But he couldn’t keep it up.\n“I got worse and worse hangovers. I managed one semester at uni and then I was bedridden for the next few years. I went home to live with my parents, I stopped going out. I also started suffering from depression.\n“I wasn’t drinking any alcohol, but I was still feeling intoxicated.”\nMatthew made the most of his time laid up in bed. He ordered medical books online and eventually came across research from the 1980s on something called ‘yeast syndrome’.\n“That was the Eureka moment,” he said. He went to see private specialists doing pioneering work on the field, spending thousands of dollars on tests, and discovered that his abnormal blood alcohol levels were indeed caused by excess yeast fermenting in his gut.\nManaging the condition remains a challenge.\nMatthew follows a no-carb, Atkins-style diet, eating only meat, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds and vegetables, but he hasn’t found a cure. He also takes anti-fungal medication and probiotics.\n“I haven’t been able to live a normal life,” he said. “I can’t work because I’m so tired all the time, my concentration and focus isn't good.”\nInstead, he studied for a degree in nutritional medicine and started a website called the Environmental Illness Resource to help others with unusual conditions. He’s been cited in research and regularly hears from people all over the world, some of whom credit him with saving their lives. “There’s no point wallowing,” he said. “You have to make the most of what you’ve got.”\nPeople with auto brewery syndrome have to avoid alcohol completely, since even a tiny amount can trigger an episode, as well as eliminating yeast and mould from their environment. The condition is still not fully understood, and experts suspect there could be a genetic component.\nBarbara Cordell, Dean of Nursing and Health Sciences at Panola College in Texas, became interested in the issue after watching it affect her 61-year-old friend, Joe.\n“He would be intoxicated but swore he hadn’t touched a drink,” she told news.com.au\n“His wife and I thought he must be hiding it, keeping it in his truck.”\nAt first, Joe had two or three episodes a year, but that steadily increased until he was having two or three a week. He thought he must have low blood sugar and would often eat during attacks, probably the worst thing he could have done. Eventually, he was taken to the emergency room for acute intoxication, disorientated and with a dangerously high blood alcohol level of 0.37.\nBarbara began researching the subject and learnt what was really going on. She was able to get treatment for Joe and became an expert on the subject, consulting with sufferers in Canada, Spain, Japan and France. She’s heard from about 30 people, but suspects far more have the condition without understanding it.\nOne recovering alcoholic who hadn’t had a drop in 25 years said he had suddenly developed auto-brewery syndrome three years ago. It can be very distressing.\nMatt has struggled with auto-brewery syndrome since he was 11. Source: Supplied\n“I’ve been contacted by people who had gone reclusive because they don’t know what’s going on with them,” said Barbara. “There are probably a lot of people who become depressed and stay at home.”\nNick Hess, 34 , came across her research online, after years of suffering. His wife had at one point searched the house from top to bottom for hidden alcohol.\n“I thought everyone was just giving me a rough time, until my wife filmed me and then I saw it — I looked drunk,” he told the BBC.\n“It was weird, I’d eat some carbs and all of a sudden I was goofy, vulgar. Every day for a year, I’d wake up and vomit.”\nDoctors found he had 400 per cent more yeast in his gut than he should. Even now, he still has a couple of episodes a month, and is fighting a drink-driving charge.\nThere often isn’t an easy solution for sufferers. Barbara is working with three doctors and a research scientist looking at the intestinal microbiome, but her research is still in the early stages, and she says some respond better to anti-fungal medication than others.\n“It’s very painful for family members to watch a loved one go through, especially when they don’t respond to the drugs,’ said Barbara.\n“One man relapsed several times. People have lost jobs and got DWIs. It’s very frightening because you never know when you’ll become drunk. It’s terrible that you can’t trust yourself to drive.”\nIncredibly, sufferers can become far drunker than normal people and continue to function.\n“We always hear that after a certain level, you just pass out, but a lot of people don’t, they function at extraordinary levels,” said Barbara.\nPlus plenty of people still don’t believe them.\n“The notion that a motorist’s state of intoxication was caused by endogenously produced ethanol lacks merit,” concluded a US study in 2000 .\nGetting drunk without drinking isn’t a blessing, it’s a curse.\nOriginally published as ‘I have a brewery in my stomach’", "external_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10976182", "http://www.ei-resource.org/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DC6iOYOriSc", "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150305-the-man-who-gets-drunk-on-chips", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/05/1227514/110723-7209ba8a-52b0-11e5-9feb-d976cea92fcd.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/05/1227514/111060-71854282-52b0-11e5-9feb-d976cea92fcd.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/i-have-a-brewery-in-my-stomach-what-its-like-to-have-auto-brewery-syndrome/story-fneuzlbd-1227514111088"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T03:37:41.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
