This 360-degree artistic view of different locales mirrors what the all-new Lincoln MKX offers. \n“I believe that some of the best work comes from allowing things to just happen, from taking risks and from finding a new approach in a comfortable routine,” said photographer Grant Legan. “Like the 360-degree camera, we allowed for multiple perspectives to come together in a harmonious, intriguing way.” \nIn addition to the 360-degree bird’s-eye view, the camera system offers a 180-degree split view, which can be helpful in cross-traffic situations. The Lincoln Star badge between the split-wing grille moves out and tilts up to reveal the available front camera. The combination of front-camera deployment and how the lens is cleaned is an industry first. \n“The design, engineering and execution of the available 360-degree camera system provides seamless assistance for the customer,” said Jennifer Shaw, driver assistance electronics supervisor. “The cameras offer another set of eyes and perspective to help the driver.” \nAbout The Lincoln Motor Company \nThe Lincoln Motor Company is the luxury automotive brand of Ford Motor Company, committed to creating compelling vehicles with an exceptional ownership experience to match.
