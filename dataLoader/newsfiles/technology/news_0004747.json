Revenue growth was strongest within the group of original design manufacturers that sell directly to hyperscale datacenters. This portion of the market was up 25.8% year over year to $1 billion. Sales of server-based storage were up 10% during the quarter and accounted for $2.1 billion in revenue. External storage systems remained the largest market segment, but the $5.7 billion in sales represented a -3.9% year-over-year decline. Total capacity shipments were up 37% year over year to 30.3 exabytes during the quarter. \n\"Companies are increasingly using new project initiatives and infrastructure refresh as an opportunity to deploy new storage technologies that are able to drive cost and complexity out of their existing storage resources,\" said Eric Sheppard , Research Director, IDC Storage. \"This is pushing critical investment dollars towards technologies like cloud-based storage, integrated systems, software-defined storage, and flash-optimized storage systems at the expense of traditional external arrays.\" \n2Q15 Total Disk Storage Systems Market Results \nEMC finished in the top position within the total worldwide enterprise storage systems market, accounting for 19.2% of all revenues in 2Q15. HP held the number 2 position with 16.2% of spending during the quarter. Dell accounted for 10.1% of global spending. As a collective group, storage systems sales by original design manufacturers (ODMs) selling directly to hyperscale datacenter customers accounted for 11.5% of global spending during the quarter. \nTop 5 Vendors, Worldwide Total Disk Storage Systems Market, Second Quarter of 2015 (Revenues are in Millions) 2.1% \nSource ( News - Alert ) : IDC Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker, September 3, 2015 \nâ€  Note : IBM's 2Q15 revenue excludes x86 servers due to the sale of that business to Lenovo ( News - Alert ). \nIn addition to the table above, an interactive graphic showing the worldwide market share of the top 5 total disk storage systems vendors plus the ODM Direct segment over the previous five quarters is available here .

IBM, NetApp, and HP finished the quarter in a statistical tie* for the second largest ranking with revenue shares of 11.1%, 10.9% and 10.5%, respectively. Dell and Hitachi ( News - Alert ) were also a statistical tie with the two companies earning 6.6% and 6.5% of worldwide external storage revenues during the quarter. \nTop 5 Vendors, Worldwide External Disk Storage Systems Market, Second Quarter of 2015 (Revenues are in Millions) -3.9% \nSource : IDC Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker, September 3, 2015 \n* Note : IDC declares a statistical tie in the worldwide disk storage systems market when there is less than one percent difference in the revenue share of two or more vendors. \nOpen Networked Disk Storage Systems Highlights \nThe total open networked disk storage market (NAS Combined with non-mainframe SAN) generated $5 billion in revenue during the quarter. EMC maintained its leadership in the total open networked storage market with 32.4% revenue share. NetApp generated 12.3% of revenue within this market segment. \nTaxonomy Notes: \nIDC defines a Disk Storage System as a set of storage elements, including controllers, cables, and (in some instances) host bus adapters, associated with three or more disks. A system may be located outside of or within a server cabinet and the average cost of the disk storage systems does not include infrastructure storage hardware (i.e. switches) and non-bundled storage software. \nThe information in this quantitative study is based on a branded view of the disk storage systems sale. Revenue associated with the products to the end user is attributed to the seller (brand) of the product, not the manufacturer. Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) sales are not included in this study. In this study, Hitachi Data Systems (HDS) sales do not reflect their OEM sales to Sun Microsystems ( News - Alert ) and Hewlett-Packard. \nIDC's Worldwide Disk Storage Systems Quarterly Tracker is a quantitative tool for analyzing the global disk storage market on a quarterly basis. The Tracker includes quarterly shipments and revenues (both customer and factory), Terabytes, $/Gigabyte, Gigabyte/Unit, and Average Selling Value. Each criteria can be segmented by location, installation base, operating system, vendor, family, model, and region. \nFor more information about IDC's Worldwide Disk Storage Systems Quarterly Tracker, please contact Lidice Fernandez at 305-351-3057 or lfernandez@idc.com . \nAbout IDC \nInternational Data Corporation (IDC) is the premier global provider of market intelligence, advisory services, and events for the information technology, telecommunications, and consumer technology markets.
