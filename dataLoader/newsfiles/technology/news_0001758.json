Ouyang has licensed intellectual property from the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization to found the startup PURSPEC Technologies to develop and market the device. (Credit: Purdue Research Foundation) \"Traditional mass spectrometry analysis requires sending samples to a centralized location to conduct the analysis. This process can take weeks,\" said Ouyang, who also is a professor in Purdue's Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering , School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Department of Chemistry . \"PURSPEC is trying to make a device that can be used by physicians, pharmacists and possibly the general public to do the process in minutes.\"\nOuyang said the device could have an impact on developing personalized medicine plans for prescription drugs.\n\"Using a miniature mass spectrometer could provide a very easy way to adjust the dosage of prescription pharmaceuticals. Currently a physician writes a prescription for a standard dosage, which may not be effective for the patient,\" he said. \"With a miniature mass spectrometry system, a doctor can prescribe a drug, and then the patient can take a test dosage at the pharmacy. Within half an hour, the pharmacist can measure the concentration of the drug in the patient's blood and adjust the dosage to more appropriate levels. And if the dosage is appropriate, it could impact a patient's compliance.\"\nOuyang and R. Graham Cooks, the Henry B. Hass Distinguished Professor of Analytical Chemistry in Purdue's Department of Chemistry, have developed several technologies to create miniature mass spectrometers. The technologies have been licensed to PURSPEC Technologies through the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization . More than 20 startups based on Purdue intellectual property were launched in the 2015 fiscal year.\nOuyang said PURPSEC Technologies will establish two locations: one in West Lafayette, Indiana, and the other in Beijing.\n\"As our device is developed in West Lafayette, it will be manufactured at PURSPEC China and sent to PURSPEC U.S.,\" he said. \"We have created this business model because there are other potential markets in China, including food safety and quality control. Also, we have developed a strong relationship with Tsinghua University in Beijing, which will help us identify financial resources and develop the prototype for all applications.\"", "external_links": ["https://sites.google.com/site/purspectechnologies/home", "http://otc-prf.org/", "https://www.chem.purdue.edu/", "https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME", "https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/wmLSkqmpZUg"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T02:23:47.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
