By Seattle Times staff The Seattle Times \nWhat: Prizmiq , a Seattle-based company that creates interactive 3-D representations of products, mostly shoes, for retailers to display online. \nWho: Darrick Morrison, founder and CEO, a 32-year-old University of Washington graduate and former Amazon employee. \n3-D library: Prizmiq originally charged a company a large fee to scan its inventory, limiting customers to brands that could afford the service. Now Morrison wants to build the world’s largest 3-D library, starting with shoes and then moving to other product lines. The new business model will allow a retailer to subscribe to the library, and the 3-D versions of items the company carries will automatically populate its website. The retailer incurs a charge each time a 3-D model loads on the retailer’s page. \nBanking on shoes: At its founding in January 2014, Prizmiq scanned and created 3-D representations of everything from wakeboards to couches. Learning quickly that focus is key, Prizmiq now just works with shoes. Morrison said shoes are predictable in size and shape, allowing the company to build a 3-D system specifically for shoes and pump out scans at a higher volume.
