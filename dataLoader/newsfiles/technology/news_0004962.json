More Skype grounded for non-business users \nInstagram’s user base added 100m monthly users in the past nine months, thanks to adoption outside the US. International users make up three-quarters of the user base, with Brazil, Japan and Indonesia among countries adding the most users. \nThe news comes as Instagram prepares to broaden its advertising push at the end of this month by rolling out ad services worldwide. It unveiled a range of new ad products this month, including 30-second video ads and event-targeted “marquee” ads that are similar to Twitter campaigns. \nThe new figures highlight how much faster Instagram’s user base is growing compared to Twitter’s, which reported 304m monthly active users in its most recent quarter , up 12 per cent year on year. Twitter is searching for a new chief executive after the departure of Dick Costolo. Its share price has fallen 25 per cent since the beginning of the year. \nInstagram, which was acquired by Facebook in 2012, started testing ad products two years ago but has been cautious about ramping up its ad load. \nFacebook does not disclose Instagram’s revenues. However, before Tuesday’s announcement, analysts at eMarketer estimated revenues might be $600m this year. \nMichael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson research said he expected Instagram ad sales could reach $1.8bn in the next two to three years. “With Instagram advertising finally going live globally, we can now begin to truly assess [its] revenue potential,” he wrote in a note before the announcement. \nInstagram has been a hit with advertisers because of its visual format, its popularity among celebrity users and its high adoption among teenagers . However, it also faces increasing competition for teenagers’ attention from chat apps including Snapchat, which has 100m daily users. Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
