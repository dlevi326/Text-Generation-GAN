However, these things can be useful on daily basis. You may wonder how? Given below, are some DIY hacks and builds on how you can make the best use of office stationary.\nSticky notes:\nEven though you try your level best to keep your laptop clean, it’s almost impossible to reach the minute corners of the keypad. While you might find it difficult to remove the dirt between the keys of your laptop, a sticky note can work wonders in this matter!\nAll you need to do is use the adhesive side of a sticky note to get the hard-to-reach dirt out of your keyboard.\nEmpty plastic glasses\nYou want to watch a quick video on your phone, but the low audio output of smartphones these days could be a pain. Try this! Just join two plastic cups and a cardboard toilet paper roll together and place your handset in the middle. Placing your phone inside an empty tumbler can also help you increase the audio volume.\nBinder clips:\nFeel good about yourself and want to capture a selfie on a pleasant day? Not everyone can afford a tripod or selfie stick for a perfect selfie. No worries! You can make a smarter and cheaper tripod with just two Binder clips.\nCassette cases:\nDon’t wish to spend much on a smartphone stand, but want to keep it hands-free while you are working? Gone are those days when audio cassettes were in demand. Just grab one of the old cassette cases, open it and turn it into a simple phone stand.\nPaper pins:\nPaper pins seem small in size, but works in big ways! You can twist the paper pins and turn it into a cradle handset stand.\nBread ties\nHow often do you find handling too many wires at the same time? Thanks to all those similarly coloured cables, you could end up unplugging the wrong cord. Why not use the bread ties as the cord labels to make your life easier in such situations?\nAdhesive wall hooks\nWall hooks can not only be used for hanging clothes or handbags, but can actually turn your tablet into an interesting smart gadget on the wall. You just need three strong adhesive wall hooks and you're done.\nToilet paper rolls\nYou may wonder how can we reuse empty toilet paper rolls? They may seem useless, but can help you manage and organise numerous wires/ USB cords. Simpley stack a few of them into an old cardboard box and you can have your own cord organiser in a minute. You can also use them to stack your office stationary, or to organise your tools in your workshop.\nSource and pictures: Huffington Post, Pixabay\n latest Mobiles and tabs Also Read Redmi Note 4G: A functional 4G phone Keep your beer cold with this bluetooth speaker The Pirate Bay has a second cousin in operation How to get water out of your drenched iPhone 5S", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/paper-roll.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/new-ties.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/paper-clip.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/wall-hooks-one.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/iPhone-speakers.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/sticky-one.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/plastic-cups.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/new-handset-stand.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/cassette-case.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/wall-hooks-two.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150923/technology-gadgets/article/small-size-big-work", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Stationary%20hacks.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/bread-ties.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Stationary%20hacks.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Big-clips.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/new-tripod.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/sticky-two.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-26T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T07:57:36.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
