Robert Shakespeare \"We have to work out how to encourage investment... how to set the right investment mechanisms so that investors start thinking about this as a risk they're willing to take.\"\nPicking winners Three startups across the categories will be awarded $100,000 each as part of the Johnson & Johnson Innovation Quick Fire Challenge, on the condition that they do at least part of the research and development for the product within Queensland.\nJohnson & Johnson Innovation Asia Pacific and other company executives will be on the selection committee and will work with the startups on their pitches prior to the main event, and serve as mentors to the selected businesses.\nJanssen Australia and New Zealand managing director Chris Hourigan said the Australia was well known for its medical research, but struggled with commercialising ideas. Supplied Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said global startups could also apply if they were willing to do their research in Queensland.\n\"This is a global prize so we are looking for great ideas from across the world,\" she said.\n\"It is part of the $180 million Advance Queensland initiative to create jobs now and for the future, drive productivity improvements, harness innovation and translate some of our great ideas into real economic outcomes for Queenslanders.\"\nTaking on Melbourne Melbourne is renowned as being the medical tech hub of Australia, home to more than 40 per cent of ASX-listed life sciences companies, but this push could attract more businesses to Queensland.\nBut managing director of pharmaceutical drug company IDT Australia, Paul MacLeman told The Australian Financial Review last month that Brisbane had already tried and failed to create a similar community .\n\"Melbourne's network and critical mass of medical institutions in the centre of the city was something that Brisbane couldn't match,\" he said.\nJohnson & Johnson has a number of projects with Queensland universities. Through a partnership with James Cook University it is looking into whether or not proteins in hookworms can treat inflammatory bowel diseases like crohn's and ulcerative colitis.\nIt is also collaborating with the University of Queensland to developed more targeted pain relief using spider venom.\nMr Hourigan said Australia needed to go beyond being \"one big mine\".\n\"We have to be a knowledge-based economy,\" he said.\n\"The science is good, but we're not harnessing its full potential yet. We could be a centre of excellence around the world.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-09-24T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:18:16.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
