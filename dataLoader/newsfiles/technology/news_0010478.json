It is organized by Cykob Solutions, and popular among young technology enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, and students. \nThis is the fifth year of the event. The one-day summit is fixed for October 24, 2015 at the British Council in Accra. \nSeveral big names have been lined up to lead the various workshops, lectures, demonstrations, and one-on-one interactions. \nVodafone’s Head of Networks, Tony Assan, will guide participants on how to use technology to drive efficiency, productivity, and national development. Huawei’s Head of Network Technology, Kweku Essuman Quansah, will expose some entrepreneurial opportunities to be found in emerging technologies like Big Data, the internet of things, and LTE. \nEmmanuel Essel, a respected businessman with varied interests including Helisel Aviation and Motorway Supermarket will show participants how to become a world class entrepreneur. There will also be a session on IT careers by lead IBUS organizer, and author of IT Career Pathway, Joseph DeGraft-Duncan. \nAccording to Joseph, the idea for the summit came several years ago when he observed that many people wanted to get into technology careers, but had no guidance. For lack of guidance, some of them ended up making wrong career moves. To solve that problem, he and his team started this programme. \nThis year’s programme is packed, “we will have more interaction, and several hands-on workshops with dedicated facilitators. You can expect to boost your knowledge in IT, business, and entrepreneurship. Also expect to meet more people and expand your networks” said Joseph, in an interview with Newaccra.com. \nIBUS 2015 comes off at 12noon, on Saturday October 24 at the British Council, Accra. It is sponsored by Motorway Breakfast, Helisel Aviation, Motorway Supermarkets, Crisel Consult, Privilegio events, and Baafo Plus. Media partners are ReachMarketing Ghana and Newaccra.com \nTickets are available from the organizers on 0244 955 925 / 020 253 6572 / 0271 528 524. \nABOUT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T12:33:21.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
