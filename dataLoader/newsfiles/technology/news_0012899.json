Where are the programmer codes of conduct that might have led to whistles being blown a lot sooner about VW?\nWhile accountability has to be held at the corporate level, one hopes that the programmers will not hide behind a position that they were just following orders. A simple line of code can impact the environment, a company’s reputation and its bottom line.\nHeather Creech, Victoria\nVW is facing a marketing nightmare. May I suggest a new model name: the VW Schadenfreude?\nBryce Heron, Okotoks, Alta.\nFor good reason, Das Auto has been given Das Boot.\nKen DeLuca, Arnprior, Ont.\nReady, aim, politics\nYour editorial The Morass of Arms Shopping (Sept. 22) suggests “failed procurement” of a fighter replacement and new naval ships, and ends with the observation: “One wonders whether there is any other kind.” There is.\nThe program to replace older antisubmarine aircraft with the Lockheed Aurora was done in the 1980s on schedule, on budget, and on specification. More recently, the acquisitions of C-17s and new Hercules were quick and effective, despite the bogus bogeyman of being “sole sourced.”\nThe worst problems with military procurement seem to arise when they are subjugated to politics (maritime helicopters, F-35), or to other national goals (upgrading Canada’s ship-building capability). Both add to the burden on the defence budget to replace necessary equipment.\nPerhaps the question should be: How can we get politics out of defence procurement, and should the extra costs of “buying Canadian” be assigned to a budget more appropriate than that of the Department of National Defence?\nAllan McLellan, Halifax\nJean Chrétien cancelled helicopters, putting us decades behind. If Justin Trudeau were to cancel the fighter jets, it would seem to be a consistent Liberal policy.\nPhilip A. Russel, Toronto\nThe time and cost overruns on the overengineered, deeply flawed F-35s are well documented. Canada does not need the Ferrari of fighter aircraft and Justin Trudeau understands this. Why don’t the other leaders get it?\nMark Robinson, Port Colborne, Ont.\nIt takes a toll\nI just returned from a driving holiday through New York and Massachusetts, making extensive use of the U.S interstate highway toll system (Let Them Pay Some Paltry Tolls – editorial, Sept. 21).\nIf keeping toll charges to a minimum is a target to encourage popular use, our politicians should take heed of the U.S. system. I recently drove 700 kilometres on their thruways in New York and Massachusetts, and the toll worked out to about 4 cents per kilometre. Compare that to the about 35 cents per kilometre I was charged in Canada on Highway 407, driving to Buffalo.\nWhile the 407 toll rate is almost nine times higher than the E-Z pass system in New York, my primary concern is what to expect from the Ontario government after it sells off Hydro One’s assets. We already know those rates are too high.\nLeo A. Barros, Markham, Ont.\nBishop of roam\nRe Why Does Everybody Have A Popecrush? (Sept. 22): Not everyone does. Orthodox Catholic hardliners certainly don’t; after the severe dressing-down he gave them last Easter, I doubt very much that members of the curia are enamoured with him. (Of course, the curia tends to consist of orthodox hardliners.) Certain members of the Republican Party have also removed him from their Christmas card lists.\nBut I’m probably quibbling. This Pope is very popular, and for good reason: He’s done a great deal to move the 2,000-year-old church’s feet of clay. Anyone who really believes the Pope ought to have turned church doctrine through a full 180 degrees on abortion, euthanasia or other issues is deeply deluded. Accomplishing such a feat, if he had done so, would be the sort of miracle that would make the mere turning of water into wine look like child’s play.\nIt would have been refreshing if he had challenged antiquated beliefs regarding the place of women in the church. So he’s not perfect, but he has challenged the church to take a more positive view of women who choose to have abortions, and he’s called on us all to be more open to gays and lesbians.\nAs to getting off “the moral hook” if we simply become “Pope groupies,” that’s like claiming folks who put “Support our Troops” stickers on bumpers have in some way done something useful to support our troops.\nSteve Soloman, Toronto\nAbout that beard\nRe Dear Tom: Lose The Beard (Sept.21): I can easily sympathize with Melissa Carroll’s political prejudices. I could never vote for a politician who wears a lapel pin or uses the term “folks.”\nNarrows the field, doesn’t it?\nDeborah Percy, Toronto\nCatting about\nMy cat is restricted to the house, so I don’t expose her to the wrath of neighbours who object to wandering cats, and to traffic (Curb Your Feline, Preserve The Birds – Sept. 18). But back in Halifax, I did have a cat which was occasionally allowed to roam in my large yard. It couldn’t catch a bird if it tried, but it was an incredible predator of mice, rats, voles and especially squirrels, which it would lie under a bird feeder to catch, ignoring the birds. And it ate its catch.\nThe worst predator of small birds and hatchlings I’ve seen recently are the many aggressive crows in the red cedars and Douglas firs surrounding my townhouse. The crows decimate the small bird population I treasure around my small garden, even using my birdbath to “dip” edible portions of the bodies in the water, leaving remnants behind so I constantly have to refresh it.\nWatch out for crows, ravens, hawks and owls; as for feral cats, well they’ve gotta eat.\nJanet Doyle, Victoria\nIt wasn’t the butler\nRe At Your Service (Life &Arts, Sept. 22): Anyone who has watched Downton Abbey knows that the person shown wearing white gloves is a footman, not a butler. This inflation of language is everywhere; there are no pupils in our schools, only “students,” shop assistants or clerks are now “associates,” etc.\nAs Gilbert and Sullivan put it, “When everyone is somebody, then no one’s anybody.”\nRobert A.
