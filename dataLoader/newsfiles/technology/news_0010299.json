And aside from their superior performance on the pitch, the All Blacks—as the country’s national team is known—are perhaps most famous for a special pre-game ritual.\nBefore each match, the All Blacks, who are set to play Namibia on September 24 in the 2015 Rugby World Cup , perform “the haka”—a traditional, full-body dance and accompanying chant derived from Māori culture. (The M ā ori are New Zealand’s indigenous people.)\nHistorically , the haka is a ceremonial act intended to welcome visitors to a M ā ori community. Contemporarily, however, it is performed at all manner of special occasions, including birthdays, weddings, and funerals. In a video that went viral earlier this summer, thousands of students bid farewell to a recently deceased (and much beloved) teacher in the town of Palmerston, by way of the haka:\n“Ka Mate,” arguably the most popular haka, was composed in the 1820s by the Māori chieftain Te Rauparaha . It has since been adopted by the All Blacks, who first began performing it before matches in 1905.\nAs the World Cup unfolds in England, the haka remains an incredible sight to behold. And one that, regardless of one’s national affiliations, is bound to hit you with a rush of adrenaline. The Washington Post ’s Ishaan Tharoor describes it as a “perfect act of nationalism.”", "external_links": ["http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/70613108/Farewell-haka-at-Palmerston-North-teachers-funeral-popular-online", "http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/", "http://www.britannica.com/art/haka", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/09/21/new-zealands-haka-is-the-worlds-most-perfect-act-of-nationalism/", "http://www.britannica.com/topic/Ka-Mate", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/yiKFYTFJ_kw", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/alIRaSxL59I"], "published": "2015-09-23T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T19:55:59.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
