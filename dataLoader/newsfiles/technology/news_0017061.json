Gizmo from the US claims to extend the battery life of the average 1.5 volt AA battery by \"up to 800 per cent\"; we asked an Aussie expert if that was just too good to be true.\nPT1M55S 620 349 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings How could we forget those baloney billboards from the Advanced Medical Institute which preyed upon men's sexual insecurities with the promise of longer-lasting sex.\nAfter years of drawn-out proceedings, Federal Court Judge Anthony North found there was \" no proper scientific evidence \" behind AMI's erectile dysfunction remedies, saying the company had engaged in unconscionable, and misleading or deceptive, conduct for its less-than-honest sales tactics.\nIt's an episode in Australian corporate history that little-known San Jose tech start-up Batteroo might want to study up on.\nBatteroo's chief executive Bob Roohparvar. Photo: David M Allen\nIts product, the Batteriser , is a simple sleeve that's small enough to fit over a regular AA battery and inside a device's battery compartment which claims to tap into 80 per cent of unused capacity in disposable batteries, extending their lifetime by up to eight times.\nAdvertisement Battery voltage boosters are not new: Batteriser is essentially a tiny \" joule thief \", made possible now that small enough parts are available, and wrapped up in some nice product marketing.\nBut before it has even hit the shelves (it's currently raising funds via crowd-funding website Indiegogo ), electrical experts have slammed the company's claims of longer-lasting power as misleading.\nSeveral Australian electrical experts were universally doubtful of Bateteroo's claims. Photo: Batteroo\nIt all started with popular Australian YouTube channel Electronics Engineering Video Blog ( EEVblog ). Without having the product physically on hand, presenter Dave Jones published a detailed 40-minute \"takedown\" of Batteroo's claims .\nCentral to the takedown was Batteriser's claim that electronic gadgets stop working when their battery's power falls below 1.4v or 1.35v. Jones tested various devices from calculators to controllers, and discovered they kept running down to 1.1v battery power or lower.\n\"There probably are products out there … that dropped out at the 1.35 or 1.4v … I don't doubt it, but it's not nearly as prevalent as they [Batteroo] imply it is,\" Jones said.\nRemember these? The ACCC prosecuted Advanced Medical Institute for misleading advertising. Photo: Danielle Smith\n\"It's [Batteriser] going to have a very niche application because they don't mention the vast majority of cases … where their assumptions are not true.\"\nIn some cases using Batteriser could even shorten a battery's life, Jones said, because the product is effectively drawing power to boost voltage all the time, even when a device is idle.\nWith 280,000 subscribers to the EEVblog YouTube channel, Batteroo is none too pleased at the negative attention, and told Fairfax Media its legal team was \"looking at\" potential action against Jones.\nThe Batteriser is a simple sleeve that fits over a standard battery to boost voltage. Photo: Batteroo\nBatteroo's chief executive, Bob Roohparvar, became notably upset when Jones' arguments were put to him, saying \"every single one of those points\" was wrong.\n\"This fear campaign and character assassination is completely unacceptable from someone who has not seen our product and hasn't tested it,\" he said.\n\"We've been called scam artists and thiefs, and I've been named to be the head of the international mafia [by EEVblog's viewers].\"\nRoohparvar went on to paraphrase Gandhi – \"First they will ignore you; then they will laugh at you; then they will fight you; then you will win\" – and his first punch in that perceived fight was to discredit Jones for having no formal electrical engineering qualifications, only a degree in performing arts from Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Arts .\nIn contrast to Jones' lack of expertise, Roohparvar is quick to highlight his position as a professor at California State University and his more than 30 years' experience in the power industry. (In fact he is Associate Professor, a marginally lesser role.)\nRoohparvar also suggested Jones was being paid by battery maker Duracell, which he says stands a lot to lose from Batteriser's \"disruptive\" potential.\nJones rejected the allegation as \"ludicrous\", \"slanderous\" and \"complete nonsense\".\n\"No battery company or affiliate has ever even contacted me in any way shape or form,\" he told Fairfax Media.\nDuracell also confirmed it had not worked with Jones or EEVblog.\n\"Their views are independent,\" a spokesperson said of EEVblog.\nAs for evidence, Roohparvar said Batteroo had tested Batteriser on some models of remote control toy cars and successfully extended the battery life by eight times.\nBut Batteroo has not yet published any data demonstrating this apart from a video demonstrating five times' battery life with a Garmin GPS.\nSeveral Australian electrical experts contacted for comment were universally doubtful of Batteroo's claims.\nThomas Braunl, director of the Renewable Energy Vehicle Project at the University of Western Australia, which researches battery-powered electric cars, said it was \"just ludicrous\" to suggest a product could extract eight times the energy from a standard battery.\n\"I am sure there is room for improvement for a smaller percentage, maybe 20 per cent, but nothing like the stated amount,\" Professor Braunl said.\nTony Vassallo, an expert on battery storage at the University of Sydney, said Batteroo was correct in claiming there was under-utilised capacity in standard batteries but that realistically its product would not be able to extract much more out of them.\n\"I think if you used it on 1000 batteries you might get one or two that gave you that [eight times battery life result], but they [the batteries] were probably badly stored and used in the first place,\" he said.\nGeoff Walker, Queensland University of Technology Associate Professor in Power Engineering, backed up Jones' explanation in his YouTube video that very few products would cut out at 1.4v or 1.35v battery power, and called Batteriser's claims \"misleading\".\n\"This product will solve a problem and will extend the lifetime of alkaline cells or batteries generally for some specific products which stop working while there's still a relatively high voltage … but for other products it's probably not justified,\" Dr Walker said.\nFurther, using Batteriser in products such as remote controls which sat idle most of the time would have a detrimental effect on battery life due to the constant voltage output, he said.\nBoth Dr Walker and Dr Vassallo instead suggested replacing a flat battery, or using good quality rechargeable batteries, as the best options.\nA fourth qualified expert declined to speak on record, saying the issue was more of a marketing debate than a scientific one.", "external_links": ["http://revproject.com/", "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/batteriser-extend-battery-life-by-up-to-8x", "http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ADEAAAM8eDQBy7NzgQYkNI0udJy46UAxCM-D-Rk&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=BNxN&locale=en_US&srchid=1134235031442275350335&srchindex=5&srchtotal=12802&trk=vsrp_people_res_name&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A1134235031442275350335%2CVSRPtargetId%3A54294580%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_thief", "http://batteriser.com/", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2DjFE7Xf11URZqWBigcVOQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iEshd6izgk", "https://vimeo.com/135935197"], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T17:20:07.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
