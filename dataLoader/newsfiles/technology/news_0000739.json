SIMmersion’s complex logic engine and stimulus-response model have driven dynamic conversations with virtual humans in a long list of simulations created for healthcare, law enforcement, government and military use. Last year, SIMmersion put together an intelligent tutor as a proof of concept to show an alternative use of the PeopleSim engine. Now SIMmersion is taking their technology to the next level by developing the capability to simulate an adaptive opponent in an even more game-like environment than simulations they’ve created in the past. “We’ve come up with ways to use our technology to develop scenarios that adapt and present new challenges in the middle of the simulation,” says Tom Beato, Senior VP of Business Development for SIMmersion. “That opens up some exciting possibilities.”\nSIMmersion is experimenting with scenarios ranging from businesses competing in a virtual marketplace to air traffic control simulations and military mission rehearsals. They’re also developing a concept that integrates simulated conversations with human actors into a three-dimensional computer-generated environment populated by avatars and simulated equipment.\nDr. Dale Olsen, CEO of SIMmersion, says, “We’ve found our model of the give-and-take that happens during a conversation also works to simulate the reactions you might get from a business competitor or opposition force. The features of an unpredictable competitor that has memory and thinks in different ways provides unique training opportunities.”\nEven though SIMmersion has its eyes on the future, the company will continue to provide the same quality PeopleSim® applications facilitating virtual conversations with specific learning objectives. SIMmersion has a lot of experience teaching people how to do things like influence others without provoking resistance and to perform well in a job interview, but these simulations can do much more than teach people how to be effective during difficult conversations.\nFor example, SIMmersion is working on a system that would teach people how an organization functions through interactions with simulated employees of the organization. By working through a few mock assignments, a new member of the organization will learn more and retain the knowledge better than if it had been received via a lengthy PowerPoint presentation. Another example is a simulation of people passing through a checkpoint in an overseas area of operations, where the user should recognize signs of deception and imminent trouble when they are presented, then take appropriate action.\nFor thirteen years, SIMmersion has built a reputation for delivering world-class simulations to prepare trainees for success from the boardroom to the battlefield and beyond. With the innovative new capabilities on the horizon for the PeopleSim technology, SIMmersion is poised to bring more value than ever to its military and business customers.\nAbout SIMmersion\nSIMmersion’s mission is to train skills faster and more effectively by combining the world's most realistic simulated experiences with highly interactive training content and extensive user feedback.
