The positioning, the spacing, the logos need to reflect what is customary in the given market• Understand local regulations, legal and tax requirements and incorporate those into the pages and the T&Cs• Look at domestic competition and other retailers to understand customer expectations of your site FOCUS ON : Understanding that localisation is a process not just a translation tool Tip 9 Optimise mobile checkout • Part of the multichannel offering but getting more and more important• Ensure that the pages are designed for mobile: less is more, ease of scrolling or bars/headings• Not all payments will fit (e.g. DD/ACH), consider wallets and tokenising cards FOCUS ON : Size and usability over representing everything that you can offer on a small screen Tip 10 Prioritise payment methods • More is definitely not better in travel and many other sectors (exception being gaming)• Understand what is necessary to keep customers coming and provide it• But also prioritise options based on your ease of processing, costs, lower chargebacks - don't be worried about putting your needs first FOCUS ON : Your priorities and needs but ensure that the customer can get any option that is relevant for the market and the transaction Masha Cilliers is founder and Principal Consultant at Payment Options, and Associate at Consult Hyperion, London.
