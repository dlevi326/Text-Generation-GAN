Now, by employing a high-performance, mobile responsive web platform, MaxView Enterprise significantly enhances these capabilities, so customers can securely manage their networks from virtually any web-enabled device. \nMaxView Enterprise is designed to make complex and remote network management easier. The software can serve in a variety of functions, overlaying and consolidating monitoring inputs from multiple other software tools, devices, and sensors in both IP and proprietary protocols. By providing a single view and control of a customer's entire network, an IT department or network operations center (NOC) can improve operational efficiency and incident response time. Over time, as the licenses of other underlying legacy software tools expire, customers can switch to the appropriate native capabilities in MaxView Enterprise, significantly lowering software licensing costs and simplifying employee training. \nIn addition, MaxView Enterprise offers substantial upgrades to the software's analytics capabilities with enhanced reporting and customizable dashboards for a comprehensive view of your network. The new interactive reporting feature allows operators to fine-tune their results in real-time to achieve a greater understanding of key performance indicators. \nOther significant enhancements include a cutting edge user-interface, advanced scheduling capabilities, automation of complex service tasks, and an expanded library of device drivers to support remote sensors and additional appliances. MaxView Enterprise includes built-in continuous learning, through integrated multi-media training, to ensure that your network can take full advantage of the latest tools and reporting features. The user-interface based support capabilities are customized to your network and provide varying levels of help ranging from detailed workflow procedures to interactive tutorials. \n\"MaxView has been a trusted remote monitoring and control software solution for nearly two decades by government agencies, leading broadcast organizations and satellite operators throughout the world,\" said David Myers, President and CEO of DataPath. \"Our investment in the next generation of this industry leading software, now called MaxView Enterprise, highlights our commitment to quality and innovation--not only in satellite communications terminals and hardware--but also in the advanced software tools that every mission critical network needs to be successful.\" \nDataPath will have MaxView Enterprise on display at IBC2015 in Hall 1, Stand F56.
