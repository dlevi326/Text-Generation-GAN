He’s just been awarded the most notorious international prize in science — the Ig Nobel Award — for finding a way to unboil an egg.\nFlinders University chemistry professor Colin Raston and his team have built a machine which can unravel proteins. To demonstrate its potential, they fed it a boiled egg.\nThey got an ‘uncooked’ one back.\nOther Stories Last drinks for ousted PM at late night Kirribilli party Nsw 0 comments The masterstrokes and treachery of Malcolm Turnbull News 0 comments Teacher exposed as porn star Parenting Turnbull draws a crowd in Sydney Nsw 0 comments Bulldogs fans in ugly clash with police Nsw 0 comments Couple buys 19 homes in a year News “Wow, did I really do that?” was Professor Raston’s Eureka moment.\nThen the Ig Nobel Prize committee came along.\nThe Igs are intended to reward scientific advances that make people laugh — and think. So, each year, they track down the most unusual and imaginative research.\nDespite the seemingly silly act of ‘unboiling’ an egg — though who hasn’t over-boiled one on occasion — it was actually a serious demonstration of a groundbreaking new technology.\nIt’s a new way of doing chemistry that has implications for cancer treatments, pharmaceutical manufacturing and the processing of biofuels and foods.\n“It’s not what we set out to do, to unboil an egg,” Professor Raston says, “but it’s the way of explaining the science involved and helping the wider world realise the momentousness of it.”\nIt’s also potentially significant in terms of economics: remember, it was an Australian astrophysicist tinkering with radio waves who invented the now ubiquitous technology behind wi-fi.\nHow to unboil an egg “The sheer scale of this is mind boggling,” Professor Raston says.\n“The global pharmaceutical industry alone is worth $160 billion annually and the processing of proteins is central to it. The VFD is completely changing it — and is set to do the same for the fuel and food industries. It’s impossible to place a price on the value of this device.”\nThe science behind unboiling an egg is just as mind-boggling.\nIt’s called Vortex Fluidic Technology . Essentially, it’s a way of using mechanical energy (spinning) to undo the work of thermal energy (cooking).\nHeat breaks up the bonds of proteins, which settle back into a more tightly bound mass. Professor Raston’s idea is to spin those bound proteins so fast that they fly apart again — but this time, without heat, they snap back to their original shapes.\nFlinders University Vice-Chancellor Colin Stirling says Professor Raston’s research is already improving people’s lives.\n“His VFD (is) boosting the potency of a common cancer drug fourfold — meaning better treatment with fewer side effects. And that’s just the start,” Professor Stirling Says.\nSo can you expect a new kitchen gadget any time soon?\nNo: It won’t work with a whole egg and its shell. Nor does it work if you add any extra ingredients — yet.\nAnd the whole egg-thing was just a demonstration, anyway.\n“Winning an Ig recognises the science and is both humbling and amazing” he says.\n“It’s living the dream. All scientists want to do something that is significant, but this has the wow factor.”\n Aussie researcher wins Ig Nobel Prize", "external_links": ["http://www.rastonlab.com/", "http://www.improbable.com/ig/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/97b697f8f509ba686162a725f7c1ec4c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/37bdba20203810c1a5dc315e11f9c313", "http://www.vortexfluidictechnologies.com/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/aac9dd66c9b7ae2e70ac4617a84b97b8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6fb85d062ddea53fbbe4fce53904a85d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a26c02d2af5f58a22387758f30d2d7ee", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/flinders-university-chemistry-professor-colin-raston-awarded-ig-nobel-prize-for-research-that-showed-how-to-unboil-an-egg/story-fn5fsgyc-1227532657393?sv=403021ffef95b8c5e310414a25c9f793", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6e4bbdb278a268040c85b8ddb8e66e6a", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-18T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T16:00:55.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
