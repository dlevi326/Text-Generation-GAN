Diesel engines emit about the same levels of carbon dioxide, the gas that causes global warming, as gasoline-fueled engines. The problem with diesel comes down to public health: its engines emit several times more nitrogen oxides than do gasoline engines. In France, that's because of decades-old tax breaks and regulations that stretch from the factory floor to the gas pump, and that the government is reluctant to lift despite growing evidence of health risks. Governments left and right have legislated in favor of diesel since the 1960s, and industry officials fear ending the tax breaks and subsidies would drive consumers away from French cars at a time when the country is struggling to stay globally competitive. The European Automobile Manufacturers Association is pushing such technology, arguing that modern diesel cars are as clean, or cleaner, than gasoline counterparts. French Environment Minister Segolene Royal, trying to be \"exemplary\" ahead of the U.N. climate change talks in Paris, ordered random checks on 100 French cars to ensure they're not deceiving emissions monitors.
