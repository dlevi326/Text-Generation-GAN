Kemeys (1843-1907). The iconic guardian lions have flanked the Art Institute's Michigan Avenue entrance for more than 100 years and have become a symbol of the museum and city. \n\"At FABTECH, we explore new and innovative technology; 3D printing is just one example that is driving major change for manufacturers of all types.
