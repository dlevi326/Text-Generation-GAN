Among all female deer, only her domesticated cousin, the reindeer, grows antlers like she does. And what antlers! Tall and branching, they are lined with a thin velvety layer, like the neck of a mallard. On cave walls, i n the heart of Europe, it is possible to find vivid portraits of caribou. Some are more than 15,000 years old.\nLike the woolly mammoths, the caribou were among the Pleistocene's most prolific large mammals. But unlike the woolly mammoths, the caribou survived the megafauna extinction that coincided with the Pleistocene’s melt, and the emergence of modern humans. The spear-weilding primates came for the caribou, too. Did they ever. But somehow, the caribou were spared.\nNo one is quite sure why, though acclimation to extreme cold is surely part of the story. The caribou makes its home on the Arctic’s tundras, in Scandinavia, Siberia, Alaska, Northern Canada, and Greenland. It makes its home in frigid places, where few mammals can live.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:35:44.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
