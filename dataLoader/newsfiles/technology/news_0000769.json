Ms Brook was named the UK’s most dangerous cyber-celebrity of 2015 in Intel Security’s annual study , overtaking Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, who dropped 18 places from the top spot last year. This is Ms Brook’s first time in Intel Security’s list of the most dangerous celebrities and, by topping the poll, she beats the likes of Katie Price, X Factor judges Nick Grimshaw and Rita Ora, and Victoria Beckham. The terms “Kelly Brook”, “Kelly Brook HD downloads”, “Kelly Brook free MP4”, and “Kelly Brook torrent” were used to search for Kelly Brook, and similar terms were used for each celebrity on the list. The study was conducted using McAfee SiteAdvisor site ratings, which determines the number of risky sites generated by each search term and calculates an overall risk percentage for that celebrity. Intel Security said that cybercriminals are always looking for ways to take advantage of consumer interest around popular culture events including talent shows, movies premieres, album releases and celebrity breakups. Three out of this year's four X Factor judges made the top 20 most dangerous celebrities to search for online They capitalise on this interest by enticing unsuspecting consumers to sites that download harmful malware onto devices and steal their private data. The desire for consumers to have access to the latest celebrity gossip can often make them vulnerable to cybercrime,” said Nick Viney, VP consumer, mobile and small business, Intel Security. “Most consumers are unaware of the potential risks they are exposing themselves to by clicking on sites that provide them with the latest news and entertainment. But cybercriminals are quick to exploit this desire for breaking celebrity news.” Intel Security added celebrity names combined with the terms \"free MP4\", ‘\"HD downloads\", or \"torrent\" are some of the most searched terms on the Internet. The company warned that people looking to download free music and films that are not made available through legitimate channels may be especially at risk from cybercriminals.
