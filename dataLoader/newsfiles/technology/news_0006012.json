Katz Graduate School of Business are pleased to announce that Katz MBA students will be using the BoardBookIt board management platform to gain real-world, hands-on learning in business and management with a tool used by actual boards of directors. According to Clinical Assistant Professor of Business Administration Ron Magnuson, “Katz offers an MBA course called the Management Simulation Capstone in which students get the chance to apply everything they have learned in the core subjects of finance, marketing, supply chain management, operations, human resources, information systems and strategy. What makes the course so innovative is its realistic element. Students make real business decisions and report directly to a real board of directors made up of Pittsburgh managers and executives. The software and tools provided by BoardBookIt help make this a realistic and seamless experience for our students, and we couldn’t be happier with their outstanding product.”\nBoardBookIt is a robust board portal that helps organizations streamline all of the functions associated with managing a board of directors including the distribution of board materials. Directors and executives have quick access to all meeting information and board materials through a web browser, iPad app or, beginning in the 4th quarter of this year, an Android app.\n“We are very excited that the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business will be using BoardBookIt for their management simulation course,” said Chief Executive Officer Marion Lewis. “These MBA students will have a world-class tool to make their learning experience even more meaningful, and BoardBookIt will be exposed to a roster of future business leaders and the seasoned executives who serve on their boards. We are honored to be affiliated with such a highly regarded and nationally recognized institution.”\nAbout BoardBookit\nBoardBookit is the board portal solution that perfectly blends security, functionality, optimal user experience and affordability.
