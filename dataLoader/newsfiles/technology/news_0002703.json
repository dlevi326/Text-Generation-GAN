Email address 1: In less than a year, blockchain has emerged from the shadow of bitcoin to become one of the most talked-about technology topics in finance. iStock \nWall Street’s sudden burst of interest in the distributed ledger technology that underlies the virtual currency might perplex some observers, considering that only a year ago mainstream financial institutions seemed to want nothing to do with it. At least publicly. \nOn top of that, while the technology is still being developed, it is not exactly new. The first transaction in bitcoin took place nearly seven years ago and the first use of cryptographic protocols to create secure digital cash dates back more than three decades. \nSo why has it suddenly become such a hot topic in finance? \nSome say that, ironically, it was bitcoin’s spectacular booms and busts that led to Wall Street’s current infatuation with blockchain. While banks were wary of a virtual currency not issued by governments and used to buy anything from pizza to drugs anonymously online, the surge in its use forced them to take a look. \nWhat they discovered was that, while bitcoin was probably not worth the headache, blockchain – the technology that makes the currency work – could help them slash costs and streamline their processes. Related Meet the blockchain start-ups \nDave Birch, a director of innovation at Consult Hyperion, said: “In a way, bitcoin ended up being a very effective marketing campaign for the blockchain.” \nRobert Sams, the chief executive of blockchain start-up Clearmatics and a former interest rate derivatives trader, said: “The success of bitcoin was a proof of concept that demonstrated that this stuff actually works. It’s ironic that banks will probably not use its key innovation, the hash-based proof of work.” \nWhile bitcoin forced banks to pay attention, they did not reveal their interest in blockchain publicly until several far-sighted regulators gave the lead. \nIn September 2014, the Bank of England became one of the first watchdogs to recognise blockchain’s potential, describing it as a “significant innovation” that could have “far-reaching implications”. \nA month later, UBS ’s chief information officer Oliver Bussmann told Financial News he believed blockchain was the biggest disruptive force in finance, with the potential to trigger “massive” simplification in banking. \nThen came news that Blythe Masters , formerly of JP Morgan , one of Wall Street’s most influential women, had become the chief executive of a blockchain start-up. This was followed by Nasdaq ’s announcement that it was looking to implement the technology in its markets for private shares. \nSuddenly it was no longer just the talk of venture capitalists and libertarian crypto enthusiasts. \nPublic support from important institutions and notable figures in finance was “the starting gun that got everyone running on it”, Sams at Clearmatics said, although in reality everyone had been looking at it for some time. \nThe seemingly sudden explosion of activity and announcements about blockchain by banks was also a reflection of their growing understanding of the topic, according to specialists. \nOn top of that, over the past few years, banks have been building up their innovation capabilities, and blockchain fitted well with one of the main purposes of those efforts, said Yann Ranchere, a director at fintech investment and advisory firm Anthemis Group. \nRanchere said: “Banks have a full-on innovation agenda now, and obviously their focus is on improving their core infrastructure . And blockchain is an interesting possibility.” \nBut most of all blockchain appeared to be the right solution at the right time. \nSince the financial crisis, banks have been under pressure to reduce their technology costs, and have attempted to do so by shedding staff and reducing the complexity of their systems. At the same time, however, the need to implement myriad new regulations, especially in post-trade operations, has forced them to boost their systems and build new platforms. And the technology bills have piled up. \nBlockchain could cure many of these ills. \nAlex Batlin, director, innovation and Crypto 2.0 at UBS, said operational efficiency was one the biggest attractions of blockchain: “We have to spend less on technology to achieve the same.” He said one of the triggers that led UBS to take its first look at blockchain was the growing amount of venture capital money being poured into start-ups. \nFrederik Voss, vice-president and head of blockchain strategy at Nasdaq, said: “We started exploring the possibilities with blockchain over two years ago. We were excited by the potential it holds for purposes such as immediacy, security, efficiency and auditability.” \nAlthough many financial institutions have become convinced of blockchain’s possibilities, most are quick to note that projects are still in the experimentation stages, while others express interest, but seem to be keeping their cards close to their chests. \nMariano Belinky, managing director at Santander InnoVentures, believes that “there has been a lot of ‘me too’ on blockchain recently”, and that it is now time for the industry to focus on concrete efforts. \nConsultancy Aite Group noted in a report in September that some banks were being vague about their initiatives in blockchain, not because they “deem this a trade secret; the simple and harsh reality is that the banks themselves are not clear on how this technology will evolve and ultimately be adopted”. Aite estimates banks and other firms operating in the capital markets will spend $400 million a year on developing the blockchain by 2019. \nBlockchain technology is, however, still in its infancy, and several improvements are needed to make it a serious tool for use in capital markets. \nOne of the most notable issues is whether blockchain platforms could handle hundreds of millions of transactions a day at sufficient speed. Bitcoin’s blockchain, which remains the most widely used blockchain, can currently process seven transactions per second. By contrast, Visa’s payments processing network alone can handle more than 24,000 transactions per second. \nBatlin said: “Transaction volumes and transaction latency is still a big issue – we still need to do a lot more proving that it can work at volume and at scale.” \nThis is why it is likely that the first blockchain applications in finance will emerge in slow-moving and less liquid markets, such as that for syndicated loans, Aite noted in its report. \nBlockchain’s security will also need to be proved before financial institutions can entrust it with their data. \nSo far, bitcoin’s blockchain has resisted hacking and tampering, but Rabobank’s chief information officer René Steenvoorden noted: “From a technologist’s perspective, it’s hard to believe that any system is un-hackable.” The bank is looking at how it can apply smart contracts to its new mobile payments app. \nAnd while banks’ IT infrastructure is often criticised for being old, clunky and expensive to maintain, so far it has been able to carry out its Herculean tasks. Blockchain systems have not seen enough service to know if they will be as resilient. \nBatlin said: “A lot of these systems are very nascent. They haven’t been stress-tested nearly as much as other existing systems have been tested. It takes time to get assurance.” \nIan Pollari, global co-head of fintech at KPMG , said: “The system of financial services and exchange comes down to trust, and clearly trust comes to ensure any of these use cases can work at scale.” \nFurthermore, while regulators have expressed interest in the potential of blockchain technology, it is still unmapped territory, and experts believe regulation will shape how it evolves. \nOn top of these technical and regulatory challenges, banks and other institutions will have to agree to shared objectives and industry-wide projects, which could involve some market participants cannibalising existing parts of their business, experts say. \nVoss at Nasdaq believes one of the harder aspects of driving greater implementation will be to “gain acceptance from stakeholders, users, regulators for the services based on the technology”. \nIf blockchain gains acceptance, financial firms will have to instal it and start moving their operations on to it, which experts say will be no mean feat. It could be several years before banks can achieve any of the operational benefits they hope blockchain can bring. \nSo could blockchain just be the flavour of the month? \nBelinky is confident. “Definitely not. This is here to stay.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T10:54:29.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
