No matter what the classification is, the size of each of them range in between 1 and 100 nano metres. Nano rods come under one kind of morphology. These are manufactured using synthesis procedures from the metals as well as from semi conducting materials. Usually, they have a normal ratio of 3:5, where 3 is the length and 5 is the width. One regular method using which these rods are produced is called chemical synthesis. The shape of the rods is managed by some ligands, they combine and form facets with various levels of strength and come up with the required size of the nano rods. This is the process by which different kinds of rods can be made, and the size can be maintained as per the need. The various sizes of rods makes it usable in different fields and the most common use of the rods can be found in the display science. In addition to this, another common use is in MEM or micro electro mechanical system. Interesting uses of nano rods They are used in a number of applications, however here we shall have a look at only some interesting uses of nano rods. Electric field The rods are primarily used in electronics field due to its property of alteration. When used in displays, the quality of the picture automatically gets enhanced. Each and every pixel looks sharp and crystal clear. When used in TV, the quality of the picture looks brighter than it used to be and each and every colour looks simply great. The thin rods that are flexible in nature are used in the computers as well, and they have taken the retail industry to a different level. Detect humidity When the nano rods have been used with the Zinc Oxide nano rods, it was found that they can be used in vapour transport process to test the humidity sensitivity. The rods have the ability to show humidity sensitivity, response time, and the stability feature as well. However, it is advised that the rods should be used in bulk quantities and the calculation should be made for every batch. Furthermore, these rods are also used in the biomedical purposes. Some other applications are in cancer therapies, as theragnostic agents, and also to treat the tumour. About the Author I am Nidan Narkhade guys. I work in a huge industry where there is a common use of nano technology. However, when it comes to purchasing of nano rods , I recommend only MKNano.com.
