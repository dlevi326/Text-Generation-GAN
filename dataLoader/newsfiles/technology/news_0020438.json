He added that for an ergonomic design, anthropometric measures were considered for the Latin American population, contemplating the sector as a potential market. \nThe robot bed supports 350 kilos of weight and its innovative mattress is fragmented into cubes made of a material that repels body fluids that could damage the mesh of the smart electric system that detects the position of the patient and sends information to the command center. \nCamabot also has a graphical interface with buttons for operation, and a battery that provides 10 hours of power. In this regard, Dr. Vazquez Santacruz especially emphasized that a robot bed in unfeasible in a commercial context if communication for the user is not considered; hence, the importance of the interface design. \n\"We conducted a reliability analysis and feasibility studies to assess whether we have the resources and conditions necessary for the viability of the project, and the result is a Mexican product that competes internationally. \n\"We have competitive advantages over similar products on the international market, with the use of technology, tools and Mexican supplies the price is much more accessible, $ 22,000 US dollars\" the Cinvestav consultant ended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:00:20.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
