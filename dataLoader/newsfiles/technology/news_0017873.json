Paul's workgroup will cover steps to seize today's opportunities in technology, while Gilbert's will focus on preparing for tomorrow's opportunities. \nChannel Directions Live is a new event designed for partners to address the changing business dynamics of the IT channel head on. Leaders from across the channel will come together to tackle the tough business challenges of today and map out the future direction of the industry. \nAppRiver had a banner year in 2014, with a 30-percent increase in channel revenue, marking its largest year-over-year increase. Growth stemmed in part from a renewed focus on relationship management within the company's global partner program and a growing relationship with Microsoft . As a result, the company now boasts that more than half of its overall revenue is driven by the channel, and it expects to see 40 percent more growth in 2015. \n\"Evolving technology trends such as cloud computing, BYOD and sophisticated advanced persistent threats directed toward businesses are driving the adoption and demand of new security solutions,\" said Gilbert. \"Not only have we designed our technology to keep businesses productive and information secure, but we're helping resellers become trusted advisors to their clients.\" \nIndustry recognition will be presented on Wednesday, September 30. AppRiver ranked no. 32 among the world's Top 100 Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), according to Penton's fifth-annual Talkin' Cloud 100 report. The report recognizes top CSPs based on such metrics as annual cloud services revenue growth (both in actual dollars and in percentage growth rates), and input from Penton Technology's Channel editors. AppRiver also made Penton Technology's eighth-annual MSPmentor 501 Global Edition , a distinguished list that identifies the world's top 501 managed service providers (MSPs), coming in at no. 9. Rankings are based on Penton Technology's unique criteria for MSPs such as annual recurring revenues, total revenues and more. \n\"We are honored to be recognized on both award lists,\" adds Gilbert. \"It's a true testament that we are delivering on our mission to help our partners grow their business and ultimately protect their customers.\" \nAbout AppRiver AppRiver is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider offering award-winning email and Web security solutions to businesses of all sizes.
