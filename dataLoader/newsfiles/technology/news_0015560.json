We continue our mission to help simplify and digitize healthcare globally and make Practo your health app,\" Practo founder and CEO Shashank ND said. \n\nOver the coming months, Practo will continue its aggressive expansion and build the world's leading healthcare technology platform, he added. \n\nPracto bought Fitho (digital fitness solution) in April, followed by Genii in July and Insta Health earlier this month. \n\nThe key proprietary technologies and algorithms of Qikwell help synchronize patients, doctors and front office staff at hospital to reduce the average wait time by over three times, resulting in a much better consumer experience as well as better optimization of hospital operations. \n\nPracto will use this technology to improve the booking experience across its entire platform. \n\nLaunched in 2011 by Krishna Prasad Chitrapura and Raghavendra Prasad TS, Qikwell today has over 100 employees and offers hospital appointment scheduling for 250 hospitals in 19 cities. \n\nQikwell will continue to be led by the founders. \n\nIts clients include marquee hospitals like Manipal, Fortis, Cloudnine, Narayana Hrudalaya, among others. It also has over 6,000 doctors including pediatricians, gynaecologists and neurologists on its platform. \n\nWith presence in India, the Philippines and Singapore, Bengaluru-based Practo has a team of 1,500 employees. \n\nLast month, Practo had raised $90 million (around Rs 574 crore) from a group of investors, including Tencent, Google Capital and Sequoia India. So far, it has raised $125 million, one of the largest funding in the digital healthcare space.
