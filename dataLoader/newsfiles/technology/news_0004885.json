Featuring automated processes from job submission to help order fulfillment, PRISMAdirect solution offers users an order management dashboard and an optional web shop module, to enable higher productivity for in-plant print centers, print shops and commercial printers alike. \n“As a service business, your company is challenged every day. First and foremost, it is increasingly important to create a better bridge for communicating with your customers. Additionally, you should be automating your processes as a way to help reduce costs and cycle time. With PRISMAdirect, Canon has developed a solution that helps you deliver on those expectations,” said David Zwang of Zwang & Company. \nSaving Time \nAutomating time-consuming steps enables users to produce work more efficiently and effectively. For businesses that receive recurring orders, the PRISMAdirect solution offers prepared settings, helping to eliminate repetitive procedures and assists them in delivering more orders. \nFacilitating Customer Communication \nTo help ensure the continuous flow of communication between print service provider and client, the solution allows businesses to update customers regarding the status of their orders via personalized or automatic emails. \nInsight \nExtensive reporting and accounting capabilities of PRISMAdirect can help you gain more insight into your operation. \nStreamlined Order Acquisition \nAble to acquire orders from a variety of sources, PRISMAdirect simplifies the production workflow by combining job submission and order fulfillment in one centralized solution. Whether customers submit orders in the form of an email, USB drive, hard copy, via network folder, FTP folder, uniFLOW or a supported web shop, PRISMAdirect delivers a reliable, unified channel to help process incoming print and non-print orders. \nThe solution comes standard with a powerful order processing and management dashboard. Additionally, the optional web shop provides a convenient, online purchasing experience for buyers, allowing them to submit purchase orders for both print and non-print items 24/7. PRISMAdirect users may create an unlimited number of virtual storefronts, and modify each one to reflect the print provider’s or print buyer’s individual corporate identity. \nSimplified Order Management \nThe order processing and management dashboard offers two powerful views, the order view and job view. The order view provides detailed progress status information, allowing users to manage the workflow of orders from creation to finalization. The job view provides a clear overview of all jobs and connected printers, allowing operators to preview, edit production settings, and process jobs assigned to them. \nExpanded Integration Capabilities \nThe make-ready process can be one of the most time-consuming aspects of production work, but PRISMAdirect offers standard imposition templates. For more elaborate page programming, the solution is designed to integrate smoothly with Océ PRISMAprepare solution, an all-in-one make-ready solution that helps accelerate preparation from composition through production and reduce costly and non-chargeable print preparation time. PRISMAdirect can even allow for page-level editing in third-party PDF-based applications such as Adobe Creative Suite without leaving the PRISMA application and can be easily integrated into existing workflow systems utilizing standardized JDF/JMF interfaces. \nPRISMAdirect protects customers’ previous investments by driving not only Canon systems but other third-party printers that accept PDF files for example in mixed brand fleets. \nAvailability \nThe PRISMAdirect solution is scheduled to be available in October 2015 through Canon authorized dealers and Canon Solutions America. \nAbout Canon U.S.A., Inc. \nCanon U.S.A., Inc., is a leading provider of consumer, business-to-business, and industrial digital imaging solutions to the United States and to Latin America and the Caribbean (excluding Mexico) markets.
