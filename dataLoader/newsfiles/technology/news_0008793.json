It will serve as a template for Fiat Chrysler’s Detroit counterparts, General Motors and Ford, both of which are operating on contract extensions. \nBut UAW President Dennis Williams made it clear that he would treat the other two differently because they are more prosperous. \nUnion officials still must be briefed on the four-year package, then the full membership will vote on it. \nAt a hastily called news conference after the deal was announced early Tuesday evening, Williams said the agreement meets the union’s goals but still keeps Fiat Chrysler competitive with other automakers. He told reporters he had three goals for the contract: giving entry-level workers a path to higher pay, rewarding members for sacrifices they made while Fiat Chrysler struggled financially, and dealing with escalating health care costs. \n“We believe that we have met those goals, but ultimately our membership will make the final decision,” Williams said. \nThe union was seeking hourly pay raises for longtime workers who haven’t had one in a decade. It also wanted to narrow or close the wage gap for new hires, who start at about half the $29 per hour that longtime workers are paid. \nThe UAW agreed to the two tiers of pay when then-Chrysler was near bankruptcy in 2007. But Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne agreed with the UAW that tiered wages were unfair to workers. Marchionne said negotiators came up with a carefully crafted agreement “whereby that issue will go away.” But he wouldn’t give further details. \nThe UAW began bargaining in July with Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler. Contracts with all three companies – which cover around 140,000 U.S. hourly workers – expired Monday night but were extended while talks continued. \nFiat Chrysler, or FCA, was picked as the lead company in the talks this year, making it the focus of bargaining and a potential strike target if talks hit a snag. \nThe deal with FCA came after two days of talks that included an all-night session from Monday to Tuesday. Both sides had agreed to extend the contract on an hour-by-hour basis while talks continued, even as some members called for an end to talks and a strike at FCA plants. \nSome union officials at the GM plant in Lordstown where the best-selling Chevrolet Cruze is made, continue to monitor the unfolding events. Although there’s no set timetable, UAW’s tentative agreement with Fiat is “the start of what will be an agreement for us,” said Robert Morales, president of UAW Local 1714 representing fabrication workers at the GM plant. “It’s in the right direction.” \nHe said progress is also being made on the Lordstown plant’s local contract with General Motors with some positives as well as some issues that need to be resolved. “We’re anxious to see how that transpires,” he said. \nGlenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112, representing the assembly plant workers at the General Motors Lordstown plant, was unavailable for comment Tuesday night. \nWilliams said some parts of the deal will transfer to Ford and GM, but some financial provisions will be different. \n“It’s about whether or not the company has a greater ability to pay,” he said. “I don’t want people to think for one minute that I’m not looking at the other companies and the amount of money that they have made,” Williams said. \nThe main issue in the FCA talks was pay raises. The current wage gap between entry-level workers and veteran employees benefits FCA the most, since 45 percent of its hourly workers make entry-level wages. Only around 20 percent of workers at Ford and GM make the lower wage. Fiat Chrysler had no cap on the number of entry-level workers it could hire, but that was to be negotiated in the contract talks. \nMarchionne has been outspoken about wanting to eliminate the wage gap. But he has indicated the top wages should come down in favor of fatter profit-sharing checks. Over the past four years, FCA workers have gotten annual profit-sharing checks totaling $9,000 per worker. \nThe union is also seeking guarantees from all three automakers that new vehicles will be built in U.S. factories and not in Mexico, where companies have been moving some of their production. \nWhile the agreement will serve as a pattern for pacts with Ford and GM, there are significant differences in the companies. Ford and GM are larger and make more money. Also, FCA is the only one of the Detroit Three whose U.S. labor costs are lower than foreign competitors like Toyota; Ford and GM think that’s an unfair advantage and want to be on par with FCA. \nTo fund some of the union demands, Williams has proposed a giant health care pool to save money for the union and the three companies. Currently a union-run trust pays most health insurance costs for about 600,000 retirees and their spouses, and the companies fund health care for about 551,000 hourly and salaried workers and their families. \nNeither would say if they agreed to set up a giant health care pool, but Marchionne said there are inefficiencies in the way they now run health care.
