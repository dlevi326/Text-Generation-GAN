If students answer yes, Pell Abacus makes a series of assumptions that can be paired with other personal information to skip additional questions about finances while providing similar results to those available by visiting specific college Web sites. \nThe tool is also designed to be mobile friendly, as many students from low-income families primarily access the Internet through phones. \n\"By making this process simple to navigate without tax forms and accessible on mobile phones, we're removing some of the key barriers preventing low-income students from exploring their full range of college options,\" said Abigail Seldin, co-founder of College Abacus and vice president of Innovation & Product Management at ECMC Group, in a prepared statement. \"Our goal with Pell Abacus is to not only streamline the college search process for underserved students, but to empower them by providing meaningful context around the most important financial factors impacting college choice, from personalized net prices to school-specific loan repayment information.\" About the Author \nJoshua Bolkan is the multimedia editor for Campus Technology and THE Journal.
