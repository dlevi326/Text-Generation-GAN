It is no good that the author plays god over the editor. The editor has been contracted to polish the story and his/her experience in such matters is often way and above the knowledge of the writer, but the writer, in many instances doesn't see it that way.\nEditing a novel is a time consuming, effort binding practice and much thought goes into the recommendations that an editor sends to the writer. And in many instances, the writer fails to carry out that recommendation because of some or the other reason related to the writer's ego. Yes, ego. A typical writer response to an editor's recommendation is: \"This is my work, I will write it the way I want!\" And that leaves the editor gasping for air. This writer has lost the plot and forgotten that the reader is the most important part of marketing books, not the writer. The reader will let others know that the book is not worth the money spent, and that kind of information spreads like wildfire through the reading community. Then the writer blames the editor, not realising that the editor made his/her recommendation, but the writer chose to control the editor's input. At the end of the day it is the writer's responsibility to publish a well edited book, not the editor's responsibility at all.\nAn editor looks for grammatical errors. Spelling. Flow and continuation from the first word to the last. They look for repeated words, verb, noun, adjective and pronoun usage and sentence structure to name just a few things in layman's terms. They look at research notes for non-fiction, they tie up the research to the work and find anomalies, but this is not good enough for the diva writer. The diva writer has one goal, and that is to make his/her editor think that he is inept. But, all the editor wants is to help make the manuscript shine. In so doing, it may seem that the editor is attacking the the writer, but that is not the case - the editor's job is to attack the work.\nIt's all about teamwork. The writer does not realise that once the editor has the manuscript, the story does not belong to the writer alone, it now belongs to a team.\nHere is another typical response from a diva writer: \"You have hijacked my work...\"\nReally? Since when does the good intention of an editor mean that the work has been hijacked? Is this because the editor suggested changing those badly written chapters? Is it because the editor didn't say, \"Please change this...\"? Is it the editor's job to say please for every suggestion? I think not. Please do this, please do that. No. It doesn't work like that. A politeness is required, yes, but not \"please\" with every suggestion. Personally, all I say is: \"Consider this change...\" and that is polite enough.\nIs a writer jealous of the editor? I wouldn't call it jealousy. I'd call it a feeling of superiority. This superiority is god like and dangerous. But that is the editor's fault. The editor should be in a position to meet the author over coffee or via the internet and gauge whether or not the writer is worth the time.\nA diva writer thinks that they are responsible to write dialogue the way they hear it. They have no idea that speech is filled with hesitators and qualifiers and quantifiers on a daily basis and does not translate well to good fiction. The writer has been told through workshops and courses that they must write dialogue the way they hear it. I say no. The writer needs to give the illusion of everyday speech, and that takes practice. Elmore Leonard's works alludes to this principle of dialogue.\nOther diva writers feel the need to write stream of consciousness before going on to add punctuation and dialogue. This is all very well, but they don't realise that SOC can result in wordy verbage that actually means nothing.\nOther diva writers forget one of the most important things about writing; action and sequel. They write action chapters one after the other without rest and without giving the reader a break with a reaction chapter. They don't understand that writing novels is made up of action and reaction chapters.\nSome writers use backstory to populate the entire novel.\nSome writers take fifty pages to start closest to the action.\nSome writers just don't want to be told they are wrong.\nThey say there is no right and wrong in writing fiction. I say tell that to a professor of literature. Tell that to the men and women who have spent years studying the English language and they will tell you there ARE rules that must be followed.\nAt the end of the day the reader wants a story that is well written with a beginning, a middle and an end. They want value for money. The reader is the final judge, not the writer, not the editor.\nThe day the diva writer realises that the work does not belong to him/her, but belongs to the reader, is the day that the editor and the writer will get along.\nI am a harsh editor. I tell it as it is. Many editors will declare that they have a warm relationship with their writers. I do too. I love my writers, but I also work with American and European writers who are difficult to say the least.\nIf you find my attitude biased, please understand, I needed to vent. We all do at times. Your thoughts about this are welcome. Your thoughts may differ to mine, of course. I am not saying that what I have written here is the norm, all I'm saying is that the diva/god writer does exist and would love to find a way to treat them.\nYou can contact me at our webpage for any advice or work related matters regarding fiction only, http://cooldudespublishing.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T16:17:20.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
