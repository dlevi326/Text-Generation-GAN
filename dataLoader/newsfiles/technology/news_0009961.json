LONDON--U.K. trader Navinder Sarao, who faces a U.S. extradition hearing later this month, allegedly worked with a customized version of software known as the “matrix” in a deliberate attempt to “spoof” markets, according to a U.S. court filing.\nThe 28-page indictment made public by a Chicago court Thursday reveals new details of the U.S. Justice Department’s allegations against Sarao ahead of his extradition hearing scheduled in London on Sept. 25.\nSarao’s lawyers, who are fighting extradition to the U.S., didn’t immediately return a request for comment on the allegations contained in the filing. At a hearing in May, Sarao denied any wrongdoing.\nWhen Sarao was arrested in April, U.S. authorities alleged that Sarao earned about $40 million in profits by using illegal trading strategies over several years and contributed to a “flash crash” on May 6, 2010, when stocks dropped swiftly before bouncing back. Sarao is facing criminal charges from the Justice Department and a civil case from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nAn expanded version of this story is available at WSJ.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-prosecutors-outline-spoofing-software-allegedly-used-by-u-k-trader-1441376204"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T22:40:20.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
