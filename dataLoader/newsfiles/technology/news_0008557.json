BioSonics first introduced fixed-location hydroacoustic fish monitoring in 1980. BioSonics introduced the mobile scientific echosounder in the mid-80's and since evolved the technology to the current DT-X Digital and MX Habitat series. Systems can be configured for mobile, automated fixed-position, and submersible autonomous deployments. BioSonics echosounders are used in all aquatic environments where accurate assessment of marine life abundance, distribution or behavior is required.\nVersatile, rugged designs allow for use in every environment imaginable. Technical staff includes a team of experts in software and electrical engineering, fisheries science, oceanography, and hydroacoustics. BioSonics' rich combination of products and technical services provides unique monitoring solutions for researchers, regulatory agencies, and private industry. ITs clients include hundreds of federal, state, and provincial agencies, research institutions, and private sector entities worldwide. BioSonics technology centers around focused, split beam and single beam hydroacoustics. Core products are the DT-X and MX series mobile echosounders for fisheries and aquatic habitat assessment. Digital transducers with superior signal to noise ratio, extremely low side-lobes, and multi-frequency, multi-channel systems are some of the unique technology advantages offered.\nRecent innovations include :\nFixed-station monitoring system for debris monitoring at cooling water intakes. Several systems now in use at nuclear power facilities used for early warning and reducing risk of clogged intake screens.\nAutomated software that processes split beam data in real-time to create track lists containing information that includes the size, location, direction and speed of travel for each target detected.\nROV mounted echosounders for aquatic habitat and fisheries surveys conducted by remote control using wireless Ethernet communication. This technology allows for data collection in environmentally sensitive and/or hazardous areas inaccessible by manned vessels.\nPioneering of fully autonomous submersible echosounders used for seafloor observatories, AUV deployments, and deep-towed surveys using uplooking transducers for assessing surface oriented targets.\nDevelopment of the Wave Glider DT-X SUB.\nThe MTR100 is Marine Technology Reporter's Annual report on 100 leading companies in the subsea industry, published in the July/August 2015 edition of MTR - http://www.marinetechnologynews.com/Magazine", "external_links": ["http://www.marinetechnologynews.com/Magazine"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T22:07:47.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
