It was originally an Android product, but was released for Chrome a couple months later. Only now is Google finally bringing the service to iOS. \n“Forget fumbling with sticky notes or trying to recall that last item on your to-do list,” says Google software engineer Genevieve Cuevas. “When you’re trying to capture a moment or remember a task, Google Keep can help. And starting today, the things you love about Keep on the web and Android are now available on iOS.” \n“Find what you need, quickly by searching and filtering your notes by color and type like images, audio and text. You can also add labels to help you organize your thoughts,” adds Cuevas. “Set time or location-based reminders so you won’t forget to swing by the dry cleaners or miss an item on your shopping list. Do more, together by sharing your notes so you can divvy up the packing list and watch as the items get checked off in real time.” \nYou can grab Google Keep in the App Store starting now. \nImages via Google", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T07:10:02.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
