The European Union, home of the biggest carbon market, doesn’t plan to use CERs after 2020 unless global emissions targets are tightened.\n“This is new demand for the CER market,” Rossetto said by phone. Companies are keen to show their customers and potential customers they support sustainable development and climate protection, he said.\nCERs for December settled unchanged at 50 euro cents ($0.56) a metric ton on ICE Wednesday. The benchmark contract has fallen from as high as 23.38 euros a ton in July 2008.\nUnder the UN’s online program, companies wishing to offset their own emissions can buy a corresponding number of credits generated by greenhouse-gas reducing projects such as wind farms and hydroelectric plants in developing countries. The UN then cancels the credits, which reduces the market glut and encourages investment in new projects.\nThe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bonn began setting up its CER-cancellation system last year, backed by Brazil.\nCarbon-offset projects can transform communities and spur sustainable\ndevelopment, Rob Bernard, chief environmental strategist at Microsoft, said\nin a statement on Tuesday.\nSome buyers may be disappointed as the UN will allow existing projects to sell credits such as those that encourage the use of cleaner fossil fuels, Eva Filzmoser, director of Carbon Market Watch, said Tuesday in an e-mailed statement.\nInvestors in previous emission-reduction projects must receive fair treatment, or “there is no chance” private companies will rush to participate in future carbon markets planned by governments, Rossetto said.\nThere will be 38 countries and regions with carbon-pricing systems governing about 12 percent of the world’s emissions by 2017, up from 5 percent in 2011, the World Bank said Sunday.", "external_links": ["https://store.climateneutralnow.org/\\"], "published": "2015-09-24T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T18:32:42.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
