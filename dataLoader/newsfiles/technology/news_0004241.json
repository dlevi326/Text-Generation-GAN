(PRWEB) September 14, 2015\nCubic Global Defense , a business unit of Cubic Corporation ( NYSE: CUB ), today announced that Amanda Bond, lead human performance engineer, will discuss the benefits of game-based training and interactive virtual environments in cabin crew training for commercial aviation at the Asia Pacific Airline Training Symposium (APATS) 2015 held in Bangkok, Thailand from September 15 – 16. Bond will also present a tutorial to introduce how this type of technology can enhance current aviation training methods.\nWith the theme, “Promoting Flight Crew Safety and Efficiency Through Training and Assessment,” APATS 2015 will focus on identifying practical solutions to challenges facing the aviation training community. APATS 2015, one of the largest and longest established events for aviation training in the Asia Pacific region, brings together participants from all over the world to learn, educate and exchange views on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of flight training operations and procedures.\n“The commercial aviation industry has changed dramatically over the past 20 years, but few changes have been made to the cabin crew training beyond computer-based slide presentations,” said Bill Toti, president of Cubic Global Defense. “As airlines begin to look for alternative methods to train their cabin crew in consideration of operational efficiency, immersive game-based training is a safe and cost effective way to train dangerous, high-criticality and rarely encountered tasks in the aviation industry.”\nDuring the event, Bond will highlight specific applications and advantages of interactive virtual environments and game-based training, such as the ability to scale deployment to numerous platforms from high-definition environments in dedicated rooms to handheld personal devices. In addition, she will demonstrate how the training can be customized to the domain, the task and the individual learner to optimize the experience.\nBond will highlight the following topics at the symposium:\nBeyond CBT: Game-Based Training Efficacy, Efficiency and Applications for Training Tuesday, September 15, 2:00 p.m. – 3:30 p.m. ICT (local time) at the Centara Grand Convention Centre, Bangkok, Thailand\nPresentation to discuss concrete ways in which game-based training is advantageous to the cabin crew training program, in both efficiency and efficacy for safety and service.\nCabin Crew Training Workshop: Designing Effective Game-Based and Immersive Virtual Aircraft Environments for Training\nWednesday, September 16, 9:00 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. ICT (local time) at the Centara Grand Convention Centre, Bangkok, Thailand\nTutorial to discuss considerations and guidelines for designing and incorporating game-based training into an overall curriculum, as well as platforms that are advantageous to the delivery of training and the constraints within it.\nFollow Cubic Global Defense at @CubicDefense or #APATS2015 to join the conversation.\n# # #\nAbout Cubic Corporation\nCubic Corporation designs, integrates and operates systems, products and services focused in the transportation, defense training and secure communications markets.
