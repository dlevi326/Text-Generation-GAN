There was the car elevator . There was Cookiegate . Four years earlier, John McCain—hardly anyone’s idea of a typical plutocrat—got hammered for not being able to remember how many houses he owned . It was an issue for Steve Forbes before him and for George H. W. Bush before him . Republicans are already trying to use the many millions accumulated during Bill Clinton’s post-presidency as a cudgel against Hillary. Although it’s true that great wealth confers considerable advantages in politics, in terms of optics, it can also prove a meaningful handicap.\nExcept when it doesn’t. Donald Trump is richer than any of the aforementioned candidates, and his wealth, far from being a handicap, is a central rationale for his campaign. It’s what proves (in theory) that he knows what he’s doing. It’s what proves that he’s not a “loser,” like—well, pretty much anyone Trump is inclined to put down.
