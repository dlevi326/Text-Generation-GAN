A majority of the Dutch reject any suggestion that the tradition is racist, but opponents say it is offensive.\nStarting this year, schools in The Hague will begin phasing out the use of blackface, curly hair wigs and red painted lips, with the changes to be completed within three years. They will be replaced with visually neutral Santa servants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T21:29:24.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
