No one monetizes mobile like the way it happens in Japan. We identified some unique opportunities that can be beneficial to the Indian market, with a bit of a desi touch, and there exists a gap in the market right now on content consumption. So we tried to address that in our new business,\" Singh told ET. \n\n\"Right now we have bootstrapped this, but we are talking to a number of funds for Series A capital,\" he said. \n\nSingh and Gupta will roll out their first product, a content-based app, by the end of this month. The duo took about three months to shape their idea for the product. \n\nSingh did not divulge more details about the product, but said since it was a content-based app, they would not want \"the consumer experience to be broken because connectivity is missing or slow.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:36:39.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
