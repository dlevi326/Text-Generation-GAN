They lured him and then assaulted him.\nThe following week we heard about teenagers being necklaced in Etwatwa, possibly because they belonged to a gang. There have been numerous previous accounts of crowds meting out “justice” and we are shocked at the brutality of these people.\nWe know we will not do what they do. We are shocked at their behaviour. How can they?\nWe come from apartheid where the police would appoint themselves as judge and executioner. We saw brutal scenes of the police shooting unarmed children. We promised ourselves it would not happen again. Then came Marikana and Macia and numerous other stories of police brutality.\nI think we see similar forces playing out in the bullying on the playground through to the police massacre. In all instances, the perpetrators (yes, perpetrators) have taken in the position that they are right and have to right some perceived wrong. The possible snitch has to be taught a lesson; the possible gang members have to be shown that their behaviour is wrong; policemen died before the Marikana massacre and they have to learn this is wrong. In all these cases there is no rule of law or due process. The crowd has decided and has turned on the now victims who have lost all their rights and protection.\nWe cannot identify with these people. We would not do what they do.\nThis weekend I watched a phenomenon which has played out before, but was ferocious in its intensity this time. A social media campaign plays out and lives are damaged. I have no idea of whether the people who are targeted are guilty of whatever charges are laid against them. I do know that the process of what is done to them is wrong.\nWhether it is #WhereWasNzimande or #sarsspies the pack turns on the person, grabs the hashtag and bravely draws blood. Watching the #DearYusuf campaign this past weekend reminded me of a pack of hyenas that have decided that an injured animal must now die. No one stood back and called the devouring pack to order. They had smelt blood and were going to kill. As time passed, the blood lust only appeared to increase.\nWhat is different in this ghastly destruction of human beings on Twitter to what we saw at Marikana, in the pack of attacking children, to vigilante justice? It appears to be driven by the same need to teach someone a lesson, to draw blood, to destroy someone in the attempt to force them to confess.\nI eventually have to accept that we are all capable allowing ourselves to be swayed by the moment of apparent righteousness and in it to commit evil.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:20:17.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
