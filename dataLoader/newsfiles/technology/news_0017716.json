The tax has led to more transparency, giving investors better understanding of the income of online gaming firms, thereby prompting possible M&A activity.\nRegulations have also tightened elsewhere in Europe, constraining growth and focusing companies' attention on how to lower costs.\nIreland's Paddy Power PLC and smaller U.K. rival Betfair Group agreed last week to a near $8 billion merger.\nBetting and gaming services firm Ladbrokes PLC in July also said it would merge with rival Gala Coral Group Ltd. in a stock deal.\nThe sector has also seen smaller deals in the works in recent months. Pools and tote betting firm Sportech PLC has confirmed receiving a proposal from a Toronto-listed gaming and software supplier Contagious Gaming Inc. regarding a possible recommended offer for the company. Likewise, newly AIM-listed Stride Gaming PLC acquired InfiApps Ltd., an internationally-focused mobile social gaming firm, for up to $39.2 million, to help push the company's entry into the social gaming segment of online gaming, it said.\nTalking about the deal in a conference call, Bwin.party Chairman Philip Yea said after considering the offers from 888 and GVC, Bwin believed GVC's offer terms provided a better headline value, synergies and cost savings. Mr. Yea added that, although the 888 offer was attractive, GVC's offer was more attractive in equity and cash and provided an opportunity for Bwin shareholders to gain from the enlarged group.\nBwin.party intends to recommend that bwin.party shareholders vote in favor of the deal, he added. As a result of the bwin.party board's change in recommendation, the previously agreed proposal with 888 Holdings has been terminated.\nThe news sent Bwin.party shares up 2%, 888 Holdings lost 5.9% and GVC also lost 2.3% in early trade.\nWrite to Razak Musah Baba at Razak.Baba@wsj.com\n 04, 2015 05:05 ET (09:05 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T03:06:45.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
