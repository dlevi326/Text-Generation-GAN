SmartPay, which provides lease options for smartphones, tablets and other wireless devices, was acquired from its parent company, Better Finance, Inc. \n\"Consumers are looking for ways to spread out payments for these products, which have become essential to everyday life,\" said Orlando Zayas, TEMPOE president. \"This is a logical move for us and expands TEMPOE's offerings into this rapidly growing market.\" \nSmartPay Leasing currently allows wireless carriers and retailers to spread customer payments over time for smartphones and other consumer electronics items. The service is available across the U.S. \nThe SmartPay name will be integrated into TEMPOE's portfolio of offerings, and the combined company will provide more benefits for retailers and their customers. The SmartPay team, led by General Manager Ken Pedotto, will remain in place in San Francisco. \n\"This is about combining two technology-based companies to provide even better lease solutions. Now retailers can more easily help all of their customers to get the devices they want, which will help increase sales in each store,\" said Pedotto. \"In addition, our employees will now be part of a larger company where they can leverage additional resources.\" \nFor retailers, offering SmartPay can grow sales by expanding what customers can afford. SmartPay uses existing sales infrastructure and provides retailers with marketing tools to make it easy for customers to apply, be approved and make a purchase in store. \nTEMPOE will continue to grow through strategic acquisitions, new market penetration and product expansion. \n\"We are interested in taking our model to additional channels while continuing to expand our reach in the markets we're already in,\" said Zayas. \"This acquisition is just the start of a solid business strategy.\" \nFor more information about TEMPOE and the several payment options it provides retailers, visit http://www.TEMPOE.com . \nAbout TEMPOE TEMPOE, built upon the roots of WhyNotLeaseIt, is a leading provider of no credit required shopping.
