Now it might be testing a new direct pickup service for Prime Now customers that allows them to pick up packages directly from the Prime Now center, according to GeekWire . \nWhile Amazon has not formally announced the program, signs inside the Amazon Prime Now facility in Kirkland, Washington indicate that the pilot is being readied. GeekWire reported that one Amazon Flex sign inside the facility reads “Please take a ticket located behind you. Please look for your number on the top corner of the wall on your left. Proceed to pick up your package once your number is displayed.” \nIn addition to the Flex program, Amazon began one-hour delivery service in the Seattle area . The new service reduces wait time for perishable and other last minute items. Amazon said Tuesday in its announcement of the new service that it plans to add other zip codes to Prime Now service \"rapidly.” \nAnd GeekWire also reported that the three Seattle-area locations may well be the first to offer timely delivery of alcoholic beverages. Prime Now began delivering wine and spirits in the U.K. earlier this year. \nPrime Now service, which was first launched in New York in December 2014, is available only to Amazon Prime members, and charges $7.00 for one-hour delivery, or nothing for two-hour delivery. The service also delivers hot food from restaurants, and offers a wide variety of food and household items for delivery. \nOf course, as GeekWire points out, Flex could also be Amazon’s crowd-sourced delivery service. Back in June, it was rumored that the retailer was working on a mobile app that would use driver similar to those hired by Uber to deliver packages to customers while out and about.
