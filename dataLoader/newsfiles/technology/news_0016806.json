Pearbuds are not only the smallest wireless earbuds on the market- they also boast a best-in-market six-hour battery life and a crisp, rich and cordless listening experience. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150903/263576 \nPearbuds have been specially engineered to hug a user's ears and stay securely fit all day long. The wireless, in-ear headphones last 6 hours on a single charge and can be fully charged again with the portable charging case in just 45 minutes. \n\"Our early-market testing indicated that size and battery life were the two main pain points of current wireless earphones,\" Eric Tsoi, Pear Designs co-founder, said. \"So those were the first two issues we focused on with Pearbuds. However, as audiophiles ourselves, we also took extra measures to make sure that the small size did not compromise sound quality. The result is crystal clear audio in the most convenient, Bluetooth earbud on the market.\" \nPearbuds use balanced armature audio transducers that offer very low noise distortion and are optimally tuned to specific frequency ranges. Additionally, an AptX codec uses a special bit-rate reduction technique to offer Bluetooth sound that is indistinguishable from corded headphones. A proprietary-design module creates ultra-low latency between both earbuds, so a listener hears exactly the same thing in both ears, with no difference whatsoever. Pearbuds also include ambient noise cancellation to block out everything but the crisp, rich audio. \nBy connecting via Bluetooth to a user's phone, Pearbuds are compatible with virtually any app: maps, workout trainers, audio books, games, videos, podcasts and more. They are also sweat-resistant and extremely light, making them ideal to connect with any fitness tracking devices and optimize a workout without getting tangled in cords. \nPearbuds connect with any device that has Bluetooth, including iPhones, Android phones and most mp3 players. They work the same way any Bluetooth-enabled audio device does, so they are simple and ready to go out of the box. Pearbuds are available via the Kickstarter campaign for another 13 days. They can be pre-ordered starting at $119, which is $80 off the eventual retail price of $199.
