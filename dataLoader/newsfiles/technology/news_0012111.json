Policy makers are motivated to allocate more funding to encourage institutions and faculty to adopt this new technological trend, which will be widespread and essential in the future. Axiomtek’s OPS module with abundant useful features will be the best choice for companies that are embarking upon this growing market trend.”\nThis smart open pluggable module can connect to OPS-compliant displays via a standardized JAE TX-25 plug connector, which supports HDMI, DisplayPort, UART, audio, USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 signals.
