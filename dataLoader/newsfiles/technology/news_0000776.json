Knowledge Vault enables organizations to embrace cloud-based collaboration technologies while still retaining control. \nThis partnership and technical integration provides significant benefits to Knowledge Vault customers including: -- Extending the power of Active Directory's Kerberos and LDAP capabilities to enable organizations leverage existing Active Directory-based authentication for Knowledge Vault administrators and data consumers. -- Providing enterprise-grade SSO functionality that enables users to be more productive and secure by allowing them to log-in as themselves, rather than sharing privileged accounts. \nChristian Ehrenthal, CEO and co-founder, Knowledge Vault, explained: \" The lack of visibility and control over cloud content and processes is a problem for CIOs, CTOs, and those charged with managing IT security, risk and compliance. There is a growing demand for organizations to audit, document and analyze activities, enforce processes and oversee risk across cloud-based collaboration and content-sharing technologies. The integration between Knowledge Vault and Centrify creates a simplified identity infrastructure for IT while optimizing the end user experience.\" \nShreyas Sadalgi, SVP Business Development, Centrify, commented: \"In order for a solution to gain adoption, it must be easy to access and secure.
