Credit COURTESY ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES When the Steelers and the Patriots kick off the National Football League’s 2015 season, on Thursday night, Jill Stelfox will know precisely where on the field each player is at all times. Stelfox is the vice-president for location solutions at Zebra Technologies, and it is her company’s radio-frequency identification tags that will be embedded in the players’ shoulder pads.\nUntil three years ago, Stelfox’s clients were more likely to be industrial robots or dairy cows than tight ends. “Every major car manufacturer in the world, with the exception of two, uses our technology in the creation of a car,” she told me. Although basic R.F.I.D. technology was first developed during the Second World War, it did not become popular until the nineteen-nineties, when researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology linked the serial number on each chip to the Internet, creating a networked tracking system. Stelfox touted the tags’ ability to streamline manufacturing, enabling just-in-time inventory control throughout the supply chain and even guiding the torque wrenches at the ends of mechanical arms as they tighten bolts. Meanwhile, on an R.F.I.D.-equipped farm, she said, “we end up knowing everything about the cows.” By combining location and motion data, Zebra’s systems can infer when the animals eat, when they sleep, when they give birth, and a whole host of other data that, in aggregate, predict each heifer’s milk production and thus her potential to generate revenue.\nN.F.L. players are not automatons (although they are perhaps cash cows), but the league had already been seeking a way to track them when, in 2013, Zebra called. (“We were looking for other verticals to play in,” Stelfox said.) The N.F.L. tested the company’s chips against those of a handful of competitors, then approved a limited rollout, in 2014. Full implementation begins this fall. The upper deck of each of the league’s stadiums is now encircled with a constellation of small receivers (“They look like Wi-Fi routers,” according to Stelfox), which record the pings emitted by each of a player’s shoulders, twelve for every second that they are on the field. The quarter-sized R.F.I.D. tags contain a battery-powered chip and an antenna that broadcasts a unique identifying code to the receivers, which, in turn, are connected to a server. There, Zebra’s software triangulates the distance between a chip’s bleep and the individual receivers all but instantaneously, thereby discerning a player’s whereabouts on the field.\nThe resulting data looks like “a lot of ones and zeros,” Cris Collinsworth, an NBC football analyst and a former wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals, told me—but, translated, it maps game play in an entirely new way. The ability to pinpoint a player’s position in real time can be used to calculate exactly how far he has run and how fast, of course, but it also sheds light on a different game, one filled with missed openings, unexplored routes, and unforeseen mismatches.\nAt the moment, the N.F.L. is being tightfisted with the data. Commentators will have access during games, as will the betting and analytics firm Sportradar. Users of the league’s Xbox One app, which provides an interactive way of browsing video clips, fantasy-football statistics, and other metrics, will be able to explore a feature called Next Gen Replay, which allows them to track each player’s speed and trajectory, combining moving lines on a virtual field with live footage from the real one. But, for now, coaches are shut out; once a player exits the locker room on game day, the dynamic point cloud that is generated by his movement through space is a corporately owned data set, as outlined in the league’s 2011 collective-bargaining agreement.\nSome teams already use R.F.I.D. or an equivalent technology in training, and they find it frustrating, Stelfox told me, not to be able to have similar insight into what happens on game day. “It’s almost like doing all the work in college and then, after you take the test, the teacher says, ‘O.K., but I’m not going to tell you the result,’ ” she said. When that data does become available—and the N.F.L. Competition Committee is currently in discussions to approve data dissemination to teams—it is hard not to anticipate a “Moneyball”-style shift in how veteran players and college draftees are evaluated, from old-fashioned subjectivity to R.F.I.D.-enabled statistical detachment.\n“I don’t think this chip technology is going to overnight revolutionize the game,” Collinsworth said. “But I do think that the coach that’s going to be the most influential in the N.F.L. in the future is going to be sitting in front of a computer for the better part of the day.” Just as the Bengals’ move, in the nineteen-eighties, to a hurry-up, no-huddle offense transformed the tempo of N.F.L. games, R.F.I.D. chips will offer innovative coaches the opportunity to reinvent the game’s spatial possibilities—to design new formations that take advantage of players’ matching acceleration rates, to substitute fatigued players at the moment they start to slow, and to choreograph new routes down the field.\nBut Collinsworth is perhaps most excited for R.F.I.D. technology’s potential, in tandem with virtual-reality devices, to address the N.F.L.’s biggest problem of all: the concussion crisis. In ten years, he speculated, “There will be almost no contact during the week. Pre-season will be eliminated.” Instead, he imagines, players will practice virtually, building up muscle memory of, say, “two linebackers rushing from the right side and the left defensive end dropping off in coverage,” without the risk of getting hurt. If Stelfox’s chips can enable that, they will go a long way toward saving the game that they are poised to transform.\nWatch: A guide to how the best soccer players cheat on the field.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:26:32.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
