Used in conjunction with Xitron’s Sierra workflow, Navigator RIP, and Raster Blaster TIFF catcher to drive Dainippon Screen platesetters, the popular interface continues to provide prepress independence to printing companies around the world.\n“The Screen kit has easily been our most successful commercial printing interface,” said Karen Crews, president of Xitron. “The fact that we passed the 3,000 mark less than two years ago is truly remarkable, speaking volumes about the popularity of this low-cost alternative to proprietary RIP & workflow systems.”\nAs with Xitron interfaces for Agfa, Fuji, Heidelberg, ECRM, and Linotype, the Screen interface is designed to communicate over a PC’s universal serial bus (USB), where other solutions still rely on older PCI card technology, limiting a user’s choice in computer platforms. “Based on industry acceptance, moving our interface development to USB a few years ago was clearly the smart move,” said Crews.\nThe Screen interface kit is capable of driving all of the thermal Screen platesetters, including the 4000, 6000, and 8000 series imagers as well as the Ultima 16000, 24000, 32000, 36000, and 40000 systems. Coupled with Xitron’s Navigator RIP, the Screen interface becomes an economical replacement/upgrade option for existing PT-R owners.
