DealerSocket, a leading technology provider for automotive dealerships nationwide, has been selected as a preferred provider for Kia Motors.

Prior to the Kia and Jaguar Land Rover partnerships, DealerFire was already a preferred website and digital marketing provider for Toyota, Scion, and Volkswagen. \n\"Kia is a brand that continues to garner respect in the industry and we're very pleased to welcome more of the company's franchise dealers onto the DealerSocket platform,\" says Matt Redden, DealerSocket CMSO. \"DealerSocket's vision aligns perfectly with that of Kia Motors. We are excited about the benefits we can provide for Kia dealers and we can't wait to get started.\" \nWhile the partnership allows Kia dealerships throughout the country to experience the benefits of the DealerSocket website and digital marketing solutions, the overall portfolio of products that DealerSocket offers will likely be a big part of the appeal as well.
