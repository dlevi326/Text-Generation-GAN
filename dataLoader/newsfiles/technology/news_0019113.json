The \"all-in-one,\" drone-enabled package combines Agribotix's FarmLens(TM) cloud-based data platform with the purpose-built SOLO AGCO edition quadcopter to provide customers with an efficient, reliable way to collect and analyze field data for precision agriculture applications. \nThe new package enables users to scout and record aerial field data across up to 60 acres in a single flight. Agricultural imaging cameras capture RGB and near-infrared images. The data collected is uploaded to the FarmLens platform, where it is then processed to produce high-resolution Field Health Reports (NDVI) essential for identifying potential yield-limiting problems early on. These actionable reports can then be used to optimize inputs and to address issues, leading to improved crop yields and increased profits for growers. \nAgribotix provides the platform, service and support for the integrated solution. The SOLO AGCO edition drone is built on the 3D Robotics Solo platform. The UAV is future-ready, designed for easy integration with technological upgrades and enhancements. \n\"Our partnership with AGCO gives our customers a best-in-class ag intelligence solution, enabled by a robust, purpose-built drone,\" said Agribotix CEO, Lou Faust. \"Both companies are 100% focused on agriculture, so we understand the kind of reliable information farmers need to better manage their farms and increase their bottom lines.
