Analysts at Liberum said a deal would give Trinity scale in local advertising and better negotiating power with media buyers, as well as providing more profit to help tackle its pension deficit. They forecast a potential 30 per cent earnings boost. \nBlur shares bounced 44.8 per cent over the week, after the business services exchange strengthened its board in the wake of a string of profit warnings, appointing angel investor Rob Wirszycz as a non-executive director. \nShares in oil explorer Soco International rallied 10.5 per cent, helped by a upgrade to “market perform” from analysts at BMO. Soco’s “low cost operations, strong balance sheet and ability to scale activity up or down quickly” was likely to appeal to investors looking to avoid too much volatility, they told clients. \nMeanwhile, shares in Teathers Financial , a button merchant turned crowdfunding platform developer, jumped 72 per cent after the group signed up Shard Capital to provide a broker licence for a mobile app giving private investors access to fundraisings. \nGateley grows fast despite shrinkage in legal fees \nThe first UK law firm to list has started life as a public company while growing fast. Gateley ’s turnover was up 11.5 per cent in the year to April 30, 2015, the period before it floated on Aim in June, writes Andrew Bounds. \nRevenue at the Birmingham-based company rose from £54.6m to £60.9m. Adjusted pro-forma pre-tax profit was up by almost a third from £7.4m to £9.8m. \nEarnings per share, based on a plc structure, were 7.4p and the dividend yield was 5.4 per cent. \nMichael Ward, chief executive, said Gateley had experienced fast growth in its banking and financial services, corporate finance and commercial property practices. He said markets were improving but remained “difficult”. Legal fees have been driven down since the recession and even with the return to robust growth some companies were not prepared to pay more. \nThe shares remain just above the 95p listing price. Gateley has six UK offices but is looking to use its listing to acquire other companies by issuing shares or borrowing money. \nHaiKe Chemical dives after warning over China’s economy \nHaiKe Chemical lost more than a third of its market value this week after the Chinese company said the country’s slowing economy meant it was at risk of not recording a profit this year, writes Conor Sullivan . \nUpdating investors on trading for the first half of this year, the speciality chemicals business said cuts to the prices of its main products were the principal cause of a 16 per cent fall in revenue to Rmb390m (£40m), compared with the first half of 2014. It reported a profit for the period of Rmb95,000. \nThe pressure on revenues and margins worsened in the second half and the company recorded a loss for July and August, it said. \nIn May the group had said it expected its earnings to “stabilise” and that Beijing would ease monetary policy, thus boosting commodity prices. \nHaiKe listed in London at 145p in 2007. It makes DMC, widely used in pesticides, and propylene glycol, used in flavourings and perfume. \nQuadrise powers ahead on Maersk fuel deal \nQuadrise Fuels International has for a decade or more been developing a low-cost and environmentally friendly alternative to “heavy fuel”. Known as multiphase superfine atomised residue, or MSAR for short, it is for use in shipping, refining and power generation, writes Kate Burgess . \nThis week, Quadrise signed a deal with container shipping group Maersk and Cepsa — part of the Abu Dhabi government’s International Petroleum Investment Company — to set up a unit near Gibraltar to make the fuel. Maersk has been testing MSAR on its vessels but this latest contract will enable the next phase of trials to take place, and pave the way to commercial production. Quadrise also said that a Saudi Arabian refinery had been designated an MSAR production site, with its output to be used at a nearby thermal power station. \nOriginally, Quadrise had floated on Aim in 2006 to develop a product out of solid waste generated at refineries. But it was hit by delays and a falling oil price. From a float price of 20p, the shares peaked above 40p in late 2013 but have dropped steadily since. They rose 21 per cent on this week’s news, to close at 14p. Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
