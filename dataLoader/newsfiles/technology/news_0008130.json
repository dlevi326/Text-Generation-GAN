These components are key building blocks for constructing precisely functioning and programmable bio-computers. Devices designed to identify pathogens in food May 27, 2015 \nResearchers at the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) in Mexico have developed a technology capable of identifying pathogens in food and beverages. This technique could work in the restaurant industry as a biosensor to ... Research team produces powerful new tool for medical diagnostic applications June 10, 2015 \nProfessor Georg Duesberg, Investigator in AMBER, the Science Foundation Ireland funded materials science centre based at Trinity College Dublin, and Trinity's School of Chemistry and his team, in collaboration with the group ... Nanoparticles target and kill cancer stem cells that drive tumor growth June 10, 2015 \nMany cancer patients survive treatment only to have a recurrence within a few years. Recurrences and tumor spreading are likely due to cancer stem cells that can be tough to kill with conventional cancer drugs. But now researchers ... The light of fireflies for medical diagnostics July 22, 2015 \nIn biology and medicine, we often need to detect biological molecules. For example, in cancer diagnostics, doctors need quick and reliable ways of knowing if tumor cells are present in the patient's body. Although such detection ... Recommended for you Modular platform for biosensor assembly September 22, 2015 \nTumor markers are biological substances, usually proteins, that provide early indication of cancerous or benign tumors in the body. Researchers create fatigue-free, stretchable conductor September 21, 2015 \nResearchers have discovered a new stretchable, transparent conductor that can be folded or stretched and released, resulting in a large curvature or a significant strain, at least 10,000 times without showing signs of fatigue. Physicists determine the three-dimensional positions of individual atoms for the first time September 21, 2015 \nAtoms are the building blocks of all matter on Earth, and the patterns in which they are arranged dictate how strong, conductive or flexible a material will be. Now, scientists at UCLA have used a powerful microscope to image ... Working electronic circuits produced through artificial evolution September 21, 2015 \nResearchers of the MESA+ Institute for Nanotechnology and the CTIT Institute for ICT Research at the University of Twente in The Netherlands have produced working electronic circuits that have been developed in a radically ... DNA sequencing improved by slowing down September 21, 2015 \nEPFL scientists have developed a method that improves the accuracy of DNA sequencing up to a thousand times. The method, which uses nanopores to read individual nucleotides, paves the way for better - and cheaper - DNA sequencing. From trees to power: McMaster engineers build better energy storage device September 19, 2015 \nMcMaster Engineering researchers Emily Cranston and Igor Zhitomirsky are turning trees into energy storage devices capable of powering everything from a smart watch to a hybrid car.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:07:27.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
