A new, clean update of the WeChat app had been uploaded to the app store, it said.\nIt is unusual for malware to spread through Apple's App Store, which typically subjects apps to stringent reviews. In a blog post Thursday, Palo Alto Networks said the attack was the first of its type directed at Apple's iOS mobile operating system. Chinese anticensorship activist group Greatfire.org called it \"the most widespread and significant spread of malware\" in the app store's history.\nAsked if it was possible the Chinese government was involved, Palo Alto Networks said it didn't yet have enough information to determine who was behind the attack.\nOther apps found infected with the malware include those belonging to state-run mobile carrier China Unicom, and 12306, the country's official train-booking website, researchers said. China Unicom and China's railway bureau didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday.\nIt wasn't clear Sunday how the infected apps made it past Apple's screening process, or whether the breach had resulted in any user information being stolen, though researchers said millions of devices could have been exposed based on the popularity of the apps in question.\nWeChat has more than 500 million active users, according to Tencent. It isn't clear how many use devices from Apple, which accounts for about 15% of China's smartphone market, according to researcher IDC.\nThe hack exploited Chinese developers' impatience, according to Palo Alto Networks. To write apps for Apple devices, developers have to use a tool kit called Xcode, but downloading the official version from Apple's website can take a long time in China.\nThe hackers posted their infected version on a Chinese server, advertising faster downloads, the researchers said. Any app created or altered using the bogus Xcode would then become infected with the malware, they said.\nThe infected Xcode was hosted on Baidu Pan, a cloud service offered by Chinese search company Baidu Inc., said multiple security researchers.\nBaidu removed the file shortly after being notified of its existence, Baidu spokesman Kaiser Kuo said Sunday.\nThe malware has been dubbed XcodeGhost by Alibaba Mobile Security researchers, who were the first to document it extensively in a series of social-media posts starting Thursday.\nEven if the hackers didn't use the malware to steal anything, Palo Alto Networks warned it still represented a threat to the popular operating system. Security researcher Claud Xiao wrote on the firm's website Friday that criminals and spies could use the malware to gain access to iOS devices.\n\"We believe XcodeGhost is a very harmful and dangerous malware that has bypassed Apple's code review and made unprecedented attacks on the iOS ecosystem,\" he wrote.\nYang Jie and Danny Yadron contributed to this article.\nWrite to Josh Chin at josh.chin@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"Apple, Inc.\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n 20, 2015 20:30 ET (00:30 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif"], "published": "2015-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T13:44:39.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
