It also has a USB Type-C port for fast charging. \nMeanwhile, the plastic-clad 5X, made by LG (KSE: 003550.KS - news ) , is an update to the \"much loved\" and \"iconic\" Nexus 5 released in 2013, said Google's Dave Burke. \nIt has a 5.2-inch HD screen and also a USB Type-C port as well as a fingerprint sensor on the rear. \nIt also has a 12.3 megapixel camera on the back but a less powerful 5-megapixel front-facing camera, compared to the 6P. \nThere is also a new DOZE state which automatically shuts down more processes to extend the battery life. \nThe 5X will start at £339 while the 6P will start at £449, with pre-orders beginning on Tuesday, Google confirmed. \nGoogle also unveiled the first tablet it has built itself called the Pixel C, which comes with a full-sized keyboard. \nThe US technology giant also confirmed a new version of its Chromecast streaming device, as well as a new version that plugs into home stereo systems called Chromecast Audio. \nThis will enable users to stream music from a mobile device through their home speakers (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T23:29:11.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
