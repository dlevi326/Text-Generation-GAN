It continues until Thursday. \nIsland leaders have described the UN-brokered COP21 talks in Paris in December as the last chance for the world to reach a binding agreement that can secure their future. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:42:24.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
