Brown to Protect Digital Privacy 82% of CA voters agree: Cops should get a warrant for digital surveillance Issues : \nCalifornia's digital privacy laws haven't been updated since cell phones were as big as bricks and computers ran on floppy disks. \nFast-forward to 2015. It's time for an upgrade. \nThanks to supporters across the state, CalECPA (SB 178) was passed with bipartisan majorities in both the House and the Assembly. We need to make sure that Gov. Brown hears from you, immediately. (use the form below) \n82% of California voters want cops to get a warrant for digital surveillance. If you agree, make sure that Gov. Brown signs CalECPA and makes this happen. We're almost there, thanks to the support of the ACLU of Northern California Community. Now we have one more big step to take, right now. Use this form to email Gov. Brown: Re: SB 178 - Sign! \nThe files in your desk are protected from warrantless searches. Your email, text messages, and other digital information should be properly protected too. But California's digital privacy laws are stuck in the last century. It's time to catch up by enacting the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (CalECPA). \nCalECPA would make sure that law enforcement agencies go to a judge and get a warrant before getting private digital information about who we are, where we go, who we know and what we do. CalECPA also includes appropriate exceptions to ensure that the police can continue to effectively and efficiently protect public safety, which is why all major statewide law enforcement groups have thanked the authors and removed any opposition. \nWith your help, CalECPA was passed by the California legislature with broad bipartisan support. Now Governor Brown needs to know that itâ€™s his turn to safeguard our digital information. Use this form to urge our governor to sign CalECPA (SB 178). Your message Subject line * Editable text * Our digital privacy laws need to be upgraded to the 21st century. That's why I support SB 178 (CalECPA). Californians deserve the right to know that their digital information is protected. Signing CalECPA now will make sure that law enforcement must obtain a warrant before accessing sensitive information, a protection that I and 82% of California voters support. And CalECPA makes sure that law enforcement still has the tools they need to protect public safety while respecting my individual rights.
