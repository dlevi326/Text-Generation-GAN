Pick an accent color for the background or let Windows pick a color automatically. Show that color on Start, taskbar and Action Center, and make those transparent. Configure high contrast settings. Configure a picture for the lockscreen, and add apps to it. Open the theme settings, sound, desktop icons and mouse pointers. Define Start related settings such as showing or hiding most used apps or recently added apps. \nPersonalization Panel for Windows 10 is a free standalone program that brings back the classic Windows personalization window. \nYou can run the program from any location on your system as it does not have to be installed. \nProbably the biggest advantage of the program is that it lists all personalization options on a single page. This is in contrast to the new Windows 10 Settings app which divides them on five pages currently that you need to click through. \nYou may use the app to switch themes quickly or load one of the available personalization menus, e.g. desktop backgrounds or color options. \nThe program won't load the Settings application but uses the personalization options provided by the Windows Control Panel (which Microsoft wants to get rid of). \nIf you click on desktop background for instance, the corresponding control panel applet opens which improves the wallpaper selection process significantly as it remembers picture locations. \nThe main advantage of the program is that it links to all personalization options on a single screen making it that much easier to change settings without having to flip through different pages to do so. In addition to that, it links to configuration options that Microsoft has yet to integrate into the settings application (or decided against it and won't add them). \nThis can be particularly useful if you change settings regularly. If you only do that once and stick with them, it may not be worth it though considering that you perform the modifications once only.
