Monkeys, on the other hand, did not show evidence of the illusion.\nIn the second experiment, monkeys and humans played a computer game in which they were required to classify a central dot as small or large.\nThe researchers found evidence of the Delboeuf illusion in all three species. Capuchin monkeys and rhesus monkeys, like humans, classified dots presented inside large rings as small more often than the same-sized dots presented inside small rings.\nThis showed that the context created by the ring, which was supposed to be ignored, generated a visual illusion. Monkeys and humans alike misperceived dot size depending on outer ring size.\nResearcher Audrey Parrish said that the results showed that humans and monkeys share similarities in their perceptual systems, adding that they perceived and misperceive some types of physical stimuli in similar ways.\nParrish concluded that monkeys were an appropriate model for studying human perception and that contextual cues affect perception in ways that are shared across species.\nThe study is published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition.\n 29, 2015 8:33 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:40:00.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
