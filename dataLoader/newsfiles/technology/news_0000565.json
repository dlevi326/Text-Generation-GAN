(NASDAQ:GAI) today announced its net sales and earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 (the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2016). \nNet sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 ended June 30, 2015 were $15.3 million, compared to net sales of $24.6 million for the corresponding quarter in fiscal 2015. Net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $1.0 million, or $0.34 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.3 million, or $0.10 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. \nJohn C.K. Sham, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, said: “As anticipated, net sales decreased significantly when compared to the prior corresponding period, due almost entirely to declining sales in commodity CCMs, a lower price-point category where increases in labor and overhead costs have eliminated any advantage previously held over competitors.” \nMr. Sham continued, “Despite a decrease in overall sales, average unit pricing improved as a result of a more favorable product mix and our efforts to control production costs, leading to increases in profit margins.” \nMr. Sham concluded, “The outlook on our overall business is tempered by growing sentiment of a slowing Chinese economy together with the potential impacts of the recent devaluation of the Chinese currency, as much of our business is U.S. dollar related. We do not expect our business to improve in the near future as our customers are likely to take a conservative position to reduce excess inventory and are prepared to make further cost reductions if necessary in an effort to protect our continued viability.” \nRecent Developments \nAnnounced Receipt of “Going Private” Offer On August 3, 2015, the Company announced that its board of directors (the “Board”) has received an unsolicited preliminary non-binding proposal letter (the “Proposal Letter”), dated August 1, 2015, from Mr. John C.K. Sham, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and certain of his controlled or affiliated entities (collectively, the “Acquirer”), proposing a potential offer to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of the Company (the “Offer”) not already beneficially owned or controlled by the Acquirer for $8.75 in cash per share (“Shares”). According to the Proposal Letter, the Acquirer plans to form an acquisition company for the purpose of implementing the Offer, and the Offer is intended to be financed with a combination of cash and debt. On August 10, 2015, the Company announced that in response to the Proposal Letter received by the Board from the Acquirer, the Board has formed a special committee of independent directors who are not affiliated with the Acquirer (the “Special Committee”) to consider potential transactions involving the Company, including the previously announced Proposal Letter. The Special Committee consists of Mr. Barry J. Buttifant and Mr. Patrick Po-On Hui, with Mr. Buttifant acting as the chairman of the Special Committee. On August 24, 2015, the Company announced that the Special Committee plans to retain Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP as its United States legal counsel, Maples & Calder as its British Virgin Islands legal counsel and Houlihan Lokey (China) Limited as its independent financial advisor to assist in the evaluation of potential transactions involving the Company, including the Proposal Letter received by the Board from the Acquirer. \nThe Special Committee cautions the Company’s shareholders and others considering trading its securities that the Special Committee is continuing its evaluation of the Offer or other alternatives and that, at this time, no decisions have been made by the Special Committee with respect to the Company’s response to the Offer. There can be no assurance that any definitive offer will be made, that any definitive agreement will be executed or that the Offer or any other transaction will be approved or consummated. \nGlobal-Tech Advanced Innovations Inc. is a holding company, owning subsidiaries that manufacture and market electronic components and other related products, such as complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera modules (CCMs).
