Autodesk plans to support and expand this community by continuing to develop, sell and support netfabb software as well as integrate netfabb technology into Autodesk’s solutions for product design and additive manufacturing, including Autodesk Fusion 360 the Spark 3D printing platform. \nCarl Fruth, CEO, FIT AG, parent company of the FIT Technology Group, commented: “Autodesk shares FIT’s goal of delivering high quality industrial additive manufacturing. We’re looking forward to cooperating with Autodesk – our newest investor– and we are confident that netfabb will continue to thrive and grow as part of Autodesk.\" \nAutodesk plans to use foreign capital for the transaction, which is expected to close in Autodesk’s Q4 FY2016. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. \nHear from Autodesk and netfabb at the TCT Show + Personalize Conference on 30th September at the NEC, Birmingham. Register for free .
