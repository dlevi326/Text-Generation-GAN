The conclusion is that the Classical Arthur did not exist. This is why there is no mention of King Arthur for nearly 600 years, until the early 12(th) century. It was only when Templar Crusaders returned to Normandy from Syria and Judaea, that the Arthurian genre was born. \nWhy? \nBecause in reality, King Arthur was the alter ego for the biblical King Jesus of Judaea. The Templar Crusaders had discovered a manuscript in Syria detailing the true monarchal and martial life of King Jesus and his family. But this revised history was decidedly heretical and positively dangerous. Being unable to record and preserve this history directly, the Norman Templars crafted an alternate pseudo-history about a 'British' monarch called King Arthur. \nA revolutionary 650-page book available on: Apple, Kindle, Kobo, Nook. \nPaperback pre-orders from Adventures Unlimited of Illinois. \n*** See the Edfu Books Website for details *** \nThe Grail Cypher - the sequel to the Gospel of King Jesus Trilogy : \nCleopatra to Christ The biblical family was descended from a daughter of Queen Cleopatra, who became the queen of Parthia but was exiled to Syria. PoD paperback: Cleopatra to Christ. \nKing Jesus St. Paul (Saul) was Josephus Flavius the historian. But this means that the biblical Jesus MUST be Jesus of Gamala, the leader of the Jewish Revolt. This rebel prince was subsequently exiled to Dewa, a prison fortress in Britain. PoD paperback: King Jesus . \nJesus, King of Edessa The history of Jesus of Gamala is further refined, and he has now been identified as King Izas-Jesus of Edessa. King Izas led the Jewish Revolt, but was captured and crucified while wearing the traditional Edessan royal Crown of Thorns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T11:24:23.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
