Streaming viewers in Australia were hooked by the fourth episode.Source: Supplied\nAustralians are slower to become hooked on TV series than other viewers globally, according to new research from global streaming TV giant Netflix.\nIn the week that American networks premiere, and make swift judgments about, their new TV series for the 2015-16 season, the Netflix analysis also shows viewers don’t become hooked on new TV series during the pilot ­episode.\nIndeed, the analysis of 20 different series across 16 markets showed viewers tend to become “hooked” — meaning the episode from which point 70 per cent of viewers would then go on to complete the first season — only after the fourth or fifth episode of a ­series.\nBut the figure varied across different series, with the legal drama Suits and the thriller The Killing the earliest to grab viewers in Australia, at the third episode, one episode earlier than the hyped Netflix drama Orange is the New Black. Ricky Gervais’s comedy series Derek also hooked streaming viewers here by the fourth episode, while House of Cards, Breaking Bad and Bloodline took five episodes compared with 10 episodes for the action drama Arrow and 11 for the sitcom How I Met Your Mother. Breaking Bad’s global average was three episodes.\nThe data is difficult to translate to traditional free-to-air television because the data is for pure content available without commercial breaks and for viewing at any time.\nNevertheless, it corroborates anecdotal evidence in which some TV series have enjoyed far more successful lives as DVD or pay-TV “binge” shows rather than on FTA television, or even gone on to long lives after slow starts.\nOne of those shows was Friends. Its co-creator Marta Kaufman said in a Netflix statement her new show Grace and Frankie, starring Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, had a crucial turning point in its fourth episode and “it is nice to know viewers were there right along with us”.\nNetflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos noted the “precious nature of primetime slots on traditional TV” and the importance of the pilot, or first, episode.\n“However, in our research of more than 20 shows across 16 markets, we found that no one was ever hooked on the pilot,” he said.\nThe research showed on almost every show, Australian viewers took at least one more episode to become hooked on a show than the global average (and two more episodes for House of Cards).\nThe data showed not one streaming series hooked viewers from the first episode. Yet on linear TV, the first episodes remain crucial.\nThe new US season began on Monday with Australian Sullivan Stapleton’s new NBC drama, Blindspot, launching successfully with 10.6 million viewers, while in Australia the Seven network can claim another drama hit after 800 Words, starring Erik Thomson, averaged 1.2 million metro viewers, and 2 million nationally, for its important second episode, suggesting Australians are “hooked”.", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/23/1227541/105766-7479ae2c-61d0-11e5-8a5b-5d1516c8bd1c.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-24T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T04:23:31.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
