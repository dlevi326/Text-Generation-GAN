The institution, which is the second largest in the country, signed an agreement with Greenwood Hall to deliver a 24-hour student \"concierge\" service to answer questions about registration, financial aid, campus services and related topics. \n\"We are pleased to partner with Greenwood Hall to expand access to student services and assistance during periods of peak demand,\" said Alicia Keaton, the university's director of student financial assistance, in a press release. \nThe company, which is based in Los Angeles, runs support centers in Phoenix, AZ and College Station, TX. Among its other clients are Jacksonville State University in Alabama, where it runs a student re-engagement campaign, and Spartanburg Community College in South Carolina, where it provides admissions and enrollment assistance to students and their families.
