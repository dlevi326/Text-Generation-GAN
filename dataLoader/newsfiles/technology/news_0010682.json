We give it a workout\nWe are always wary of model upgrades when it comes to gadgets. With minor tweaks in the design element and a basic software upgrade, companies try and hawk their 'best offering ever'.\n\n \nThe new Kindle Paperwhite 7th generation takes this concept to a whole new level, though not necessarily for the better. When we received the gadget, we had to recheck whether it was the right piece, as it looked and felt the same. And we were right, as the dimensions are exactly the same, and it is about 2 gm heavier (the free 3G version).\nThe screen gets an upgrade, which is now 300 ppi compared to 212 ppi from the 6th generation. It offers 4GB internal storage in addition to the Amazon cloud storage. The screen improvement makes very little difference; we still faced the problem of seeing the shadows of the words of the previous page, post flipping.\nAlso, the touch response is wonky; it can impress at times, and can fail completely too. Overall, it is as slow as the previous version, especially while typing.\n\nThe biggest downer was the 3G coverage. Unlike our previous review, which was last year, the network has gone to the dogs. We had no connection in most parts of the city. We had to restart the device every time we came out of a zero network zone. The device needed to be restarted even after charging, as the low battery sign refused to go after a full charge too.\nSo, would you buy it? Those who don't have a Kindle might be interested, as last checked, the previous version wasn't available on Amazon. It costs the same too. For those who already own one, stay away, unless you want two of the same devices.\n\nSpecifications \nDisplay: 6 inch, 300 ppi\nMemory: 4GB\nWeight: 205 gm (Wi-Fi), 217 gm (Wi-Fi+3G)\nPrice: Rs 10,999 (Wi-Fi), R13,999 (3G + Wi-Fi)\nAvailable on Amazon.in", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T09:26:23.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
