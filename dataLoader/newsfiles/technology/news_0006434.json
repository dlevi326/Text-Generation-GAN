The price war between Sprint and T-Mobile continues to rage on. \nSprint slashed the cost of its iPhone Forever plan to $1 a month for a 16 GB iPhone 6S on Thursday, and $5 a month for a 16 GB iPhone 6S Plus. The catch is you have to trade-in an iPhone 6. \nThe iPhone Forever plan lets customers lease iPhones from Sprint, and upgrade to a new device whenever Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) releases a new smartphone. Regular price for a 22-month commitment with a trade-in is $22 a month, and $27 a month. \nSprint's ( S ) latest deal comes just a few days after T-Mobile announced a huge deal of its own upgrade-anytime \"Jump On Demand\" plan. \nT-Mobile ( TMUS ) cut its monthly Jump On Demand price from more than $25 a month to $5 a month for an iPhone 6S on Tuesday. The company also cut the price for the iPhone 6S Plus from about $31 a month to $9 a month. \nLike Sprint, T-Mobile will only give you the promotional price with the trade-in of an iPhone 6. But, T-Mobile lets you upgrade up to three times per year -- whether you want a new iPhone or any other smartphone. \nThe price wars have heated up as carriers have given up on two-year contracts. Cell phones no longer universally cost $200, and switching between wireless companies is easier. That means the deals have come pouring in. \nThough Verizon ( VZ , Tech30 ) and AT&T ( T , Tech30 ) aren't racing to the bottom on price, both are offering up to $300 ($400 on Verizon) for switching to their service and trading in an old smartphone. That gets you within striking distance of Sprint and T-Mobile's monthly costs when spread out over the course of two years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T19:58:18.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
