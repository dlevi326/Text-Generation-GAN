Apple, of course, made a huge splash when it released its Apple Watch in March and now Samsung is back for its sixth smart watch since 2013 -- the Gear S2. \nI'm in Berlin at the giant IFA tech trade show where I had a chance to try on the new watch at a briefing ahead of the official announcement on Thursday. This Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2015, photo shows Samsung s Gear S2 smartwatch during a presentation in New York. Samsung says it expects about 1,000 apps to be available when the S2 launches.

Samsung didn't announce pricing but the classic will likely sell for a premium price. Both have a 1.2 inch circular display and are built with stainless steel and gorilla glass 3. Gorilla glass, used on many smart phones, is pretty tough, though not indestructible. The standard watch is .45 inches thick and weighs about 1.65 ounces.

There will also be a cellular version of the standard edition that will enable you to use it without a phone. In fact it will be a standalone wristwatch phone, reminiscent of the 2-way wrist radio that was introduced into Dick Tracy comic books in 1946.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) ( Mary Altaffer ) \nI tried on the standard edition and found its plastic band comfortable enough. I liked that it has a standard buckle instead of the snaps used on some smart watches that have a tendency to fall off your wrist. I've already lost one such watch because of the lack of a secure band. \nThe first thing I noticed about the watch is its rotating bezel which is used to scroll through messages and select apps. It's Samsung's answer to the digital crown on the Apple watch. In both cases, these hardware enhancements make it easier to select apps on a very small touch screen. Still, there are times when you do have to press icons on the screen which might be a challenge for those with wide fingers. \nUnlike Samsung's earlier watches, the new Gear S2 is designed to work with most Android phones rather than just some Samsung phones, as long as the phone uses standard Android APIs (application programming interface). If you want to use the watch to make payments using Samsung's payment service, you will need a compatible Samsung phone. \nThe new watches let you chose from several analog and digital watch faces but, alas, no Mickey Mouse watch as is an option from Apple. The company will also support third party watch faces as well as third party apps. \nFor me, fitness apps are the most important features of any smart watch so I was glad to see that the Gear S2 has continuous heart rate monitoring as well as Samsung's S Health app which, among other things, can determine what activity you're engaged in. You don't have to tell it if you're running, walking or cycling -- it figures it out on its own and measures your progress accordingly. My Basis Peak exercise watch does that as well, which I appreciate because I would otherwise forget to tell it what activity I'm engaged in. It will also remind you if you've been inactive for too long, encouraging you to get up and move around. \nBattery life is a big deal for any device and while the Samsung doesn't have the longest life out there, it does run for two to three days, according to the company. \nApple rates its watch at one day though some users report getting a bit more life out of them. Personally, I find battery life to be the Achilles heel of most smart watches. \nEven the Pebble, which lasts for about five days, can be annoying if you don't remember to charge it or don't feel like taking the charger with you when you travel. \nI wish it were possible to use smart watches for months or years on a single battery as is the case with many not-so-smart watches, but that's a tall order considering how much energy these devices use, especially the ones with continuous heart monitoring. I have a LifeTrak exercise watch whose coin size battery lasts nearly a year but it's nowhere near as sophisticated as what Apple and Samsung are offering. \nIt's too early to know whether Samsung will turn the tide and get mass adoption for its new watches. It depends, in part, on price and whether people appreciate its features. Even Apple, which is reportedly doing better than most other smart watch makers, apparently hasn't set the world on fire in terms of watch sales even though CEO Tim Cook did say that early sales exceeded Apple's expectations. Like any new technology category, it will take awhile before we learn what consumers are willing to buy. \nContact Larry Magid at larry@larrymagid.com .
