The company - which originated as a telecoms start-up in Lithuania - is aiming to expand its domestic and international presence from its state-of-the-art base in the north-west of England.\nTelcoQ Ltd. will operate from The Landing on Salford Quays. The development offers a home to ambitious, creative start-ups such as TelcoQ Ltd., as well as larger technology and media firms which are more firmly established in the market. As well as laboratory and studio services, fully supported by next-generation connectivity, The Landing offers a variety of high-quality managed workspaces.\nWith super-fast WiFi, 3G and 4G mobile broadband at its disposal, TelcoQ Ltd. sees The Landing as being the ideal base for its growing business. From its new Manchester home, the company will look to increase the profile of its rottenwifi.com, wifirank.com and telcoq.com testing and ranking websites. The city's business-grade connectivity, excellent communication links and enterprise-focused local economy are seen as being major assets to TelcoQ and its brands going forwards.\nArturas Jonkus, Co-founder of TelcoQ Ltd., commented: \"We are happy to incorporate in MediaCityUK, which is a very lively and growing technology hub.
