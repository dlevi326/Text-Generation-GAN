With this partnership, AppliedMicro's HeliX®2 quad-core integrated 64-bit ARM processor will power Vapor IO's Vapor Edge Controller™ (VEC), an Edge Zone Controller superseding traditional \"top-of-rack\" controllers by managing a dense physical and logical compute zone within the data center. \n\"We chose AppliedMicro's HeliX 2 because it delivers the unique capabilities required by modern data centers,\" said Cole Crawford, founder and CEO of Vapor IO. The high performance combined with low power consumption, small form factor, support for ARM 64-bit instruction set architecture and an integrated 64-bit memory controller are key features that we have leveraged to enable users to monitor and manage data center components like never before. We look forward to the impact this new technology will have on the data center market.\" \n\"With IT organizations continuously seeking to enhance data center management capabilities and lower costs, the Vapor Edge Controller represents a major step forward,\" said John Williams, vice president of marketing for AppliedMicro. \"Vapor IO has taken advantage of the performance of the HeliX 2 processor to replace a large number of BMC devices within a rack with a disaggregated solution, reducing cost and complexity while increasing overall reliability and telemetry.\" \nThe Vapor Edge Controller manages data centers with rack-level granularity, replacing proprietary baseboard management controllers on each server, while also reducing costs, regardless of rack or server type. The Vapor Edge Controller ties all components together and provides simple management tools at a lower price point. Powering the VEC is the quad-core HeliX 2 which runs up to 2 GHz, integrating multiple high speed interfaces and hardware accelerators, including six lanes of PCIe 3.0, one lane of SATA 3.0, three USB 3.0 ports and a memory controller. \nAbout Vapor IO Vapor IO provides the industry's first intelligent, hyper modular data center solution. Significantly lowering capex and opex costs when building and running data driven data centers, Vapor IO provides an integrated solution to integration problems. Eliminating complex structures and parking lot data centers, Vapor IO offers a true intelligence platform for any data center workload.
