The bolivar currency was also rapidly depreciating, hurting their bottom line.\nCosts, meanwhile, have sky-rocketed amid near-weekly price increases in some sectors, though the central bank has not published data for inflation this year. Economists say the annual figure is likely in triple digits.\n\"The substantial increases (over 500 percent) in costs in 2015 drastically impact the finances of companies in the sector, which is why we hope for an urgent adjustment of prices in all services,\" Casetel said.\nDemand is strong, with data consumption growing too quickly to keep up with network infrastructure, which will lead to a saturation of networks, the group said.\n\"It's very hard to predict precisely (what will happen) but it's clear that all these impacts will deepen,\" Casetel said.\n(Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Grant McCool )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:22:54.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
