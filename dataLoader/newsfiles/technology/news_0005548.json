However, ordinary bread-and-butter South Africans will hardly benefit from any formalised discourse between some distant big-wig Talking Heads. Definitely not! The only way a National Discourse can have any value is if it is among ordinary South Africans - as it is currently happening via comments to News24 articles. The people on the ground need to talk to one another – inelegant, crude and downright nasty as such talking may be at times. But least they are talking - and there is much to learn.\nFor our entire history, members of the various races and cultures of our land have not been speaking to one another. We lived cheek-by-jowl with one another, the first- and third-world literally rubbing shoulders as we walked past one another, with not even the slightest inkling of what made our fellow South Africans tick. Somehow Apartheid’s formalized creed of Separate Development and separate Group Areas did more than merely segregate our living spaces. It mostly segregated our psyche; the psyche of all South Africans of all races and cultures. It officially set each group in its own psychological fenced-off camp where discourse and meaningful discussion happened only within the confines of that particular group who “belonged” within that particular camp. In due course everyone knew full well the value system of those within their own culture and race, how their own society operated and how to fit into that society – into their own camp.\nBut for many generations we’ve not had a cooking clue of the codes of behaviour and thought processes and hopes and desires and fears and angers of our fellow compatriots!\nDuring the mid-1970’s when I was well into my twenties, I started working in the same office with a Muslim girl of around the same age as me. I shall never forget Faldielah. She was my first friendship across the “colour bar” and in the most wonderful way she opened up my mind to those incredibly interesting people in one of the other camps. With time I started feeling personally cheated about what I had been missing out on through my ignorance of what went on in her camp. We never, ever spoke one word of politics; we were too busy plumbing one another’s cultures and customs and religion as well as wonderment that we’re getting to know all these interesting things about one another only now, despite having been virtually neighbours for our entire lives! For the tragedy of it all was that neither Faldielah nor I were “newly arrived” from somewhere else: both of us were born and bred Capetonians and our “camps” were located within a 15 minutes drive from one another; geographically within spitting distance, psychologically light-years distant.\nAlthough the tides of life caused both of us to eventually move onto different paths and lose touch, many years later Faldielah was still the single most significant reason I voted “YES” in that referendum. I sincerely wanted to break down the fences of the camps and live in communion with my fellows; to see what the Sipho's and the Xoliswa's could also tell me.\nNow, in my old age, the News24 comments section has, in some strange way, become my \"Faldielah\".\nI read the reactions of all my compatriots to the daily news events and sometimes I also add my ten-cents’ worth. Many comments are obnoxious, veering towards extremely hostile But that is how that person has been conditioned to react to a given news event. Some people, like Anth*** from Wherever, is best not to engage at all, as are some others whose minds are clearly closed off to any debate. Often comments indicate refreshing consensus across all races and cultures to certain events and occasionally someone adds a humourous observation which makes people laugh. And to my shame I must admit that more than once I too have sarcastically lashed out in anger at some of my compatriots – but I plead for tolerance because being an Afrikaner some part of me still needs to say a sharp word or three about that Boere-oorlog. And then I’ve not nearly done with Dingaan and his downright unfriendly treatment of Piet Retief either!\nHowever what is of great importance to me is that via the News24 comments section, for the first time in my life I hear the opinions of ordinary South Africans, with an opportunity for me to rebut. Thus these \"comments\" are more than merely a few lines of personal observation; it gives a sharp and precise impression of that person's stance as well as a good insight into the motivations and reasons for their particular viewpoint - however much I may sometimes disagree with them. Added to which, calling one another \"racist\" has by now become quite worn-out and pulling the race card too has lost most of its power. So possibly soon we'll finally get tired of name-calling and really start hearing one another?\nAnd it is good and it is proper that this is where our vital National Discourse is happening – amongst the people on the ground – uncomfortable and ugly as that discourse may sometimes be. As I said before, at least we are talking and we have much to learn.\n Please News24, don’t take that away from us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T14:08:06.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
