In an effort to support college students across the country, ParkWhiz has launched a Parking Scholarship promotion. ParkWhiz will grant up to $6,600 toward free parking to five deserving students. \n\"Besides keeping up with school work, college students have a laundry list of expenses each semester to think about,\" says Aashish Dalal, co-founder and CEO of ParkWhiz, a Chicago-based on-demand parking app. \"We just want to make it a little easier by offering free parking for students who need it most.\" \nTo enter, college students should visit https://www.parkwhiz.com/o/parking-scholarship/ and upload a picture of themselves, their car, or their school along with a 100-word response that explains what a free year of parking would mean to them. Entrants are invited to share the promotion with friends to ask for votes. \nThe five submissions with the most votes will be judged by a panel from ParkWhiz. The grand prize winner will receive a year of free parking (up to $5,000 value) and four runners-up will receive a month of free parking (up to $400 value). Entrants must be currently enrolled in a higher education institution and pursuing an associates, bachelors, masters or doctorate degree. \nVoting closes on September 25, 2015. The ParkWhiz judges will select winners and contact them on September 28, 2015. See official rules for details. \nAbout ParkWhiz: \nHeadquartered in Chicago, ParkWhiz is the e-parking industry leader.
