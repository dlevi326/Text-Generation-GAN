The research firm cited Appcelerator's \"vibrant history within the mobile development community,\" which allowed it to \"identify common front-end needs for backend services.\" \n\"The mobile explosion is changing enterprise infrastructures and altering how businesses and users deliver and consume services across a range of devices. Organizations face a myriad of challenges, from securely exposing mobile-optimized API endpoints to backend data, to measuring app and service usage -- all of this alongside faster, more frequent release cycles,\" said Jeff Haynie, CEO of Appcelerator. \"Forrester's wide-lens approach on mobile infrastructure services underscores, in our view, the fact that mobility is much more than client-side app development. In fact, a complement of services are required to deliver great mobile experiences. We believe Appcelerator being named a Strong Performer in the Wave validates our ability to give enterprises the comprehensive capabilities to solve the challenges of a multi-device world.\" \nForrester's 112-criteria evaluation of mobile infrastructure service vendors identified 10 significant software and service providers in the category and researched, analyzed, and scored them. Among all vendors evaluated, Appcelerator tied for the highest market presence score, which the report noted was \"the biggest differentiator in the group.\" \nTo score market presence, Forrester evaluated: 1) client base and growth specific to mobile infrastructure services; 2) the number of mobile apps deployed and the highest-scale deployments; 3) overall revenues and dedicated revenue from the vendors' mobile infrastructure services offerings. \n\"Many are aware of [Appcelerator's] Titanium development studio and multiplatform development tool,\" wrote Michael Facemire and Jeffrey Hammond, co-authors of the report. \"Our analysis shows that each of these ['Strong Performers'] vendors would be well suited to act as the centerpiece of nearly all enterprise mobility solutions.\" \nDownload a complimentary copy of the The Forrester Wave: Mobile Infrastructure Services, Q3 2015 Report . \nAbout Appcelerator Mobile apps are fast replacing web applications as the way we buy, share, search, learn and collaborate.
