Located in the Silicon Valley, Porter Consulting provides technology companies with sales, corporate marketing and product marketing services including staffing resources, marketing development and management, and demand generation programs. The growing accessibility of data is driving new opportunities for companies in the health and fitness industry. Technology is also rapidly changing the way individuals are able to monitor and improve their health and fitness and the way service providers and retailers are able to engage customers.\nA recent report by research firm IDC described the enormous growth in the wearables industry, one of the drivers of new opportunities in health and fitness tech. IDC estimated that global wearable device shipments would reach 76.1 million units in 2015, up 163.6 percent from 2014. By 2019, they estimate that worldwide shipments will reach 173.4 million units, a growth rate of nearly 23 percent over the next five years.\nWearables are just one example of how the Internet-of-Things will reshape health and fitness sector, from mom and pop retailers to mid-size fitness center chains, and from small medical clinics to large healthcare institutions. Porter Consulting can provide unique insights that can assist both manufacturers and service providers to more effectively market and sell into this fast-changing environment.\nFitness technology expert, Karl Etzel, will lead the Porter Consulting team as they deliver sales and marketing expertise to companies across the health and fitness industry. “Wearable technology is one of several drivers disrupting the health and fitness industry today.
