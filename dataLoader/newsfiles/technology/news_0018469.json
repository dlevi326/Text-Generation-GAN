While both have long been critical parts of IT operations, there importance is magnified as organizations adopt new cloud and mobile components. \n\"New threats have emerged as a result of cloud and mobility, so understanding these threats is a top priority for the IT team even as traditional threats continue to be effective,\" Robinson said. \"It's no simple task.\" \nThe top change driven by cloud computing within the IT function is the management of storage. Systems and data are spread across multiple environments; and there are many cloud solutions, such as databases and analytics services, that allow companies to build robust plans beyond the simple storage of data. \nThough many companies have found cloud to be cost-neutral, the expectation of lower costs still lingers. Among IT professionals surveyed by CompTIA, 61 percent said that controlling costs is the top challenge in the overall management of backend architecture. \nOther challenges with backend systems revolve around the complexity in managing multiple models, starting with selecting the correct model (cited by 47 percent of IT professionals). Complexity remains as the process moves on and models are integrated (43 percent), secured (43 percent) and monitored (42 percent). \nAbout half of the companies surveyed that have experienced difficulties with frontend systems cited cost control as an issue, as they need to support a growing number of devices. Companies also struggle with creating and managing new applications needed for mobile devices and ensuring that users are properly equipped to put their new devices to good use. \n\"Many companies discover that the traditional desktop development experience does not perfectly translate to mobile app development; or they're adding new development efforts were there were none in the past,\" Robinson said. \nCompTIA's Building Digital Organizations is available for free with a simple registration.
