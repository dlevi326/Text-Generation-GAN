The company aims to commercialize the scanner in 2018. \nCurrently, Pioneer is making a prototype to verify the theory that the scanner is based on. And the company has just started to test the scanner with a vehicle. The company aims to drastically reduce size and price, compared with existing products. \nWithin 2016, Pioneer will develop a vehicle equipped with the scanner in cooperation with Increment P Corp, Pioneer's subsidiary that develops maps, in the aim of making a high-accuracy map. Then, Pioneer will have the scanner employed for other vehicles. \nWhat is interesting in Pioneer's project is its plan after the employment of the scanner for vehicles. The company aims to automate the updating of a map, which is the most complicated part of map development, in the near future by using data collected by driving the vehicle equipped with the 3D laser scanner on public roads. \nThe company plans to develop a \"system that effectively organizes and uses advanced map data (data ecosystem),\" which calculates the difference between the original map data and the \"real-time\" map data collected by driving the vehicle and updates the map data. \nIn January 2015, Konica Minolta Inc announced that it would start to develop a laser scanner. Currently, only Velodyne Inc and Valeo SA are developing automotive 3D laser scanners. Therefore, their prices are high. As more companies will develop 3D laser scanners, the prices are expected to lower.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T07:54:31.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
