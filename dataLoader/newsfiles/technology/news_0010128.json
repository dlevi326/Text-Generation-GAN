Gupta brings to Docker an extensive background in corporate finance, treasury, investment and operations in addition to a long history of scaling high-growth companies. Gupta’s more than 20 years of financial leadership at industry-leading companies such as Twitter, Zynga and Yahoo will serve Docker as it ascends into the next phase of its rapid development. Docker has appointed former CFO Eric Bardin to the newly-created role of senior vice president (SVP) of finance and business operations, where he will focus on financial planning and analysis (FP&A), expanding Docker’s corporate infrastructure, both domestically and overseas, and mergers and acquisitions. \n“We’re very fortunate to have Mike join Docker, bringing with him a deep knowledge of what is needed to transform the explosive demand for Docker’s platform into a financially strong business,” said Ben Golub, CEO of Docker. “Mike’s previous success leading financial teams in high growth, industry-leading companies will be invaluable as we evolve our commercial business and continue to expand the Docker project. Mike is an excellent addition to the executive team, adding the strategic financial oversight and strong operational support needed to support our long-term business objectives.” \nBefore joining Docker, Gupta was SVP of strategic investments at Twitter, where he ran Twitter Ventures. Before taking on this role, he served as Twitter’s CFO, during which he led the company through its very successful IPO. Prior to joining Twitter, Gupta was SVP, finance and treasurer at Zynga, Inc. where he ran several finance functions including investor relations, FP&A, treasury and corporate finance. Prior to that, Gupta spent eight years at Yahoo! Inc. in a variety of financial roles, most recently as SVP of corporate development, finance and treasury. \n“It is an honor to join a company that is disrupting the software industry and changing the way organizations bring applications to market,” Gupta said. “I look forward to working with the Docker team to ensure we are financially well positioned and yet nimble so that we can continue to innovate.” \n“We would also like to thank Eric Bardin for his unrelenting focus on building a strong financial foundation for the company and instilling a fiscal discipline that leaves us well-positioned for the future,” continued Golub. “He provided incredible leadership as we transitioned our business model from dotCloud to Docker, completed all financing rounds from seed to series D, executed all of our acquisitions to date, and enabled us to expand our staff from 5 to over 180 employees. Thanks to Eric’s leadership, Docker is well-positioned to make the strategic investments necessary to progress our business.” \nLearn More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T19:24:44.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
