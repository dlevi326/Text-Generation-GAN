Scientists are examining one that already did NASA Space Odyssey: It's a physical and mental challenge\nHe will exercise more than 700 hours during his year-long mission as he strives to keep his bones, muscles and heart strong. That's two hours a day on average.\nFor hydration he will drink 730 litres of recycled urine and sweat whilst keeping fit by running 648 miles on a specialised treadmill.\nThe astronaut will also produce about 180 pounds of faeces which will burn up in the atmosphere looking like shooting stars.\nDay 173.
