Priced at Rs 4,999, this smartphone is for people who want to shell less and yet have all the necessary features to their dispense. Phicomm Energy 653 will be available only on Amazon.in. \nThe phone has a glossy back cover and is among the few devices which provide 4G support in both SIM card slots at this price range. While the budget smartphones like Xiaomi Redmi 2, Moto E, Lenovo A6000 Plus and others are already available in the market, Phicommâ€™s E 653 has got every feature right at its price. \nWhile, Phicomm has given everything to its E 653 smartphone at Rs 1,000 less than its competitors, it does not impress much. \nThe display quality is decent but not good. Both the front and rear cameras do not deliver satisfying results and disappoint you the most. Both the 8 MP rear camera and the front 2 MP snapper provide grainy pictures. For the same price, InFocus M2 offers dual 8 MP high resolution cameras. The Energy E653 doesn't offer front flash or in-app selfie beautification options too, unlike InFocus. \nHowever, the good thing is that the Expect 5.0 UI keeps it simple and is similar to stock Android Lollipop. The battery does a decent job but for heavy users, it is expected to be a big disappointment. \nThe smartphone though is one of the lightest in its category at 127g. \nIt comes with a low internal storage, but with the dedicated slot for memory card you can extend it to 64 GB. The device has a 1.1 Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 processor and 1 GB RAM but still hangs a lot and hence, puts off the user. \nLastly, I can only suggest that if you do not keep much expectation from your smartphone and need it just for the basic utilities, Phicomm could be a choice. \nSPEC BOX \nDisplay: 5-inch 720p HD IPS display \nProcessor: 1.1 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 CPU \nOS: Expect 5.0 UI based on Android Lollipop \nRAM: 1GB RAM \nMemory: 8GB ROM (4GB available, up to 64GB expandable) \nCamera: 8MP rear and 2MP front camera \nNo of SIM slots: Dual SIM (4G/3G + 2G) with 4G support \nBattery: 2,300 mAh battery \nPrice: Rs. 4,999/-", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:52:55.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
