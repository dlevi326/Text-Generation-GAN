It is long overdue and I hope the desired result is achieved.\nBut News24 needs to come to the party too.\nI have two points I would like to make on the subject:\nFirstly, the editors and management of News24 are being disingenuous if they believe the responsibility lies solely at the feet, or the fingertips, of those who make comments inflammatory or otherwise. The responsibility should be shared by the editors and moderators of the site for allowing the platform to be used, or misused, like it has.\nI’m sure that ‘hits’ and ‘clicks’ took precedence over accuracy, integrity and honest, effective debate.\nSecondly, and related to the first point, is the quality of the News24 moderators. It is a hard truth the editorial management must accept that they must have a moderation policy that is as equally clear and fair as their comments policy. Moderators should be above the fray and moderate according to guidelines laid down and understood by both moderators and readers and comment makers.\nToo often in the past, the moderation of comments has been woefully substandard and inconsistent. It seemed that comments were published or deleted dependent solely on the opinion and mood of the particular moderator on duty based on their own view point of the particular subject of the article or debate. The moderators cannot be adjudicators and participants at the same time. They must leave their personal feelings and viewpoints aside and moderate according to prescribed policy that everyone understands and becomes familiar with. Too often some very antagonistic and inflammatory comments are left in place while others, which may or may not be as inflammatory, seem to disappear from the comments thread, with no apparent logic between what was acceptable and what was not.\nI have sometimes tried to make a point sans any inflammatory angles, simply trying to present a counter point of view or to point out inconsistencies in other view points, only to have them deleted for no apparent reason, other than they went against the moderators personal perspective. Then the very same comment is accepted a few hours later or the next day, when a different moderator is on duty. Surely the moderators should be a certain standard, consistency and maturity to be able to allow all perspectives on a subject to be discussed no matter which moderators are on duty?\nModerators should also be able to accept and allow comments critical of themselves and News24.\nSo I challenge News24 editors to accept their part in the free-for-all that News24 comments became and to up their game, and that of their moderators, so that readers and comment writers in particular know where in the sand the lines are drawn, over which they may not type.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T12:04:46.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
