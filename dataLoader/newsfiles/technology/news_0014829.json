ProAir ® RespiClick is the only multi-dose, breath-activated short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) inhaler available to patients in the U.S. It differs from other currently available rescue inhalers as it utilizes breath-activated technology that enables patients to breathe in to receive a measured dose of the medicine, eliminating the need for hand-breath coordination during inhalation. \n\"The acceptance of the pediatric filing for ProAir ® RespiClick by the FDA represents an important step forward for Teva in our mission to better serve patients living with respiratory conditions, such as asthma and EIB,\" said Tushar Shah, MD, Senior Vice President, Teva Global Respiratory Research and Development. \"With millions of children living with asthma in the United States, it is important to provide this age group with a new option in rescue inhalers that does not require hand-breath coordination during inhalation.\" \nThe sNDA for ProAir ® RespiClick includes data from Teva's pediatric clinical trial program that evaluated the safety and efficacy of the treatment in children 4 - 11 years of age. The sNDA for ProAir ® RespiClick has been accepted by the FDA for standard review, with FDA Regulatory Action expected in April 2016. \nApproved Uses \nProAir ® RespiClick (albuterol sulfate) Inhalation Powder is indicated in patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm with reversible obstructive airway disease and for the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm. \nImportant Safety Information \nDo not use ProAir ® RespiClick (albuterol sulfate) Inhalation Powder if you are allergic to albuterol sulfate, lactose, or milk proteins. Call your doctor right away if you develop red, itchy bumps on your skin, swelling beneath your skin or in your throat, rash or worsening trouble breathing \nIf your symptoms become significantly worse when you use ProAir ® RespiClick, seek medical attention immediately. This may indicate either a worsening of your asthma or a reaction to the medication. Either of these could be life-threatening \nDo not increase your dose or take extra doses of ProAir ® RespiClick without first talking to your healthcare professional \nBefore using ProAir ® RespiClick, be sure to tell your healthcare professional if you have a heart, blood, thyroid or seizure disorder, high blood pressure, diabetes, are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed \nProAir ® RespiClick can cause significant heart-related side effects, such as an increase in pulse, blood pressure and/or related symptoms. If you have a heart condition, your healthcare professional will determine if ProAir ® RespiClick is right for you \nMake sure your healthcare proessional knows all the medicines you are taking - especially other inhaled medicines, other asthma medicines, heart and blood pressure medicines and drugs that treat depression - because some medicines may interfere with how well your asthma medicines work \nCommon side effects in patients taking ProAir ® RespiClick include back pain, body aches and pains, upset stomach, sinus headache, and urinary tract infection \nPlease click here for Full Prescribing Information \nAbout Asthma \nAsthma is a chronic (long-term) disease of inflammation of both the large and small airways of the lungs, characterized by symptoms of wheezing and coughing.
