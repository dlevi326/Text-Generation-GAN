Yet, near-term adoption of IIoT remains limited to achieving operational efficiency as most companies are unable to leverage IIoT for predictive capabilities that create new business opportunity. This article sheds light on the probable future of IIoT adoption and the imperative for businesses to form IIoT investment strategies.During Digital India Week in July, Prime Minister Modi announced the creation of a Centre of Excellence for Internet of Things. This is a timely intervention, as the Internet of Things, or IoT, will is set to transform technological and economic landscape over the next decade.The IoT will directly alter the Indian economy's industrial sectors, including manufacturing, energy, agriculture and transportation Together, these sectors account for close to half of India's GDP. It will also affect India's consumers, as their everyday devices connect to the Internet through tiny embedded sensors and computing power.The total potential payoff is enormous. The most conservative independent estimates place spending on the IoT worldwide at $500 billion by 2020. More optimistic forecasts peg the market as high as $15 trillion of global GDP by 2030. The Government of India estimates India's share to be between five and six percent of the worldwide IoT market through 2020.While consumer adoption of connected technology will be gradual in the short term, it will increase rapidly over the next decade. However, many industrial companies are already embracing what has been dubbed the Industrial Internet of Things, or IIoT. For example, the number of sensors shipped globally has increased more than five-fold from 4.2 billion units in 2012 to 23.6 billion units in 2014.Operational efficiency is one of the key attractions of the IIoT. Companies are seeking productivity gains that could reach 30 percent. For example, a big area for operational gains is in predictive maintenance of assets. This use of the IIoT could help reduce breakdowns by 70 percent, overall maintenance costs by 30 per cent, and repair costs by 12 per cent, according to estimates.However, there is more to the story. The IIoT can also be an important driver of breakthrough innovation and new growth opportunities. The key is to combine use of big data analytics with IIoT capabilities and technologies. For example, a major automobile manufacturer is pursuing a unique approach to increase value for customers: a flexible, convenient pay-per-use model for city dwellers needing cars. Customers can use an app to find the car that is parked nearest to them. They open the door with a membership card, drive to their destination, and simply park the car on the street and lock it up. This service competes with conventional taxis and hourly car rental services. Customers can choose to pay by the mile, the hour or the day. The rates are lower than for taxis, and there is no need to reserve, return or order a car; the cars can be parked and found anywhere use location sensors. Chart: Business benefits for driving near-term adoption of IIoT Source : Industrial Internet of Things: Unleashing the Potential of Connected Products and Services, WEF, January 2015 But are most companies up for the challenge? Survey results indicate that only 40 per cent can predict outcomes based on existing data, and fewer still (36 percent) can optimize operations from that data.Understandably, initial investments are focused on improving the ability to react and repair and move toward zero unplanned downtime. However, when asked about future plans, respondents stated their priorities in more ambitious plans for IIoT: increasing profitability (60 per cent), gaining a competitive advantage (57 per cent) and improving environmental safety and emissions (55 per cent) represent more pervasive, cross-functional and sophisticated uses of it.At Accenture, we believe that the transition from efficiency to value-enhanced growth is likely to follow four distinct phases. (See Figure) Phases one and two will represent immediate opportunities that drive the near-term adoption, starting with operational efficiency. Phases three and four will include long-term structural changes that are roughly three years away from mainstream adoption. These last two phases will lead to disruptive changes in businesses and industries. They will manifest themselves in the form of the outcome economy and an integrated human-machine workforce. Figure: The adoption and impact path of IIoT Source : Industrial Internet of Things: Unleashing the Potential of Connected Products and Services, WEF, January 2015The outcome economy will be built on the automated quantification capabilities of the Industrial Internet. The large-scale shift from selling products or services to selling measurable outcomes is a significant change that will redefine the base of competition and industry structures. As the Industrial Internet becomes more ingrained in every industry, it will ultimately lead to a pull-based economy characterized by real-time demand sensing and highly automated, flexible production and fulfilment networks. This development will call for a pervasive use of automation and intelligent machines to complement human labour (machine augmentation). As a result, the face of the future workforce will change dramatically, along with the skill sets required to succeed in a much more automated economy.Yet, it is still early. Numerous technology challenges and important hurdles remain to be overcome. Not all products can or need to be connected. But amid the new, an old truth remains: business customers need products and services that create more value for them than those on offer today. The time to push is now.
