The announcement was a huge blow to Shell, which was counting on offshore drilling in Alaska to help it drive future revenue. Environmentalists had tried repeatedly to block the project and welcomed the news. Shell has spent upward of $7 billion on Arctic offshore exploration including $2.1 billion in 2008 for leases in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska's northwest coast where an exploratory well about 80 miles off shore drilled to 6,800 feet but yielded disappointing results.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:43:33.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
