MIT researchers found a way to use them to extract man-made pollutants from water and soil; Theresa Dankovich is using silver nanoparticles to purify drinking water in Africa; and Johns Hopkins biomedical engineers are using them to combat cystic fibrosis. \nGetting Dizzy Could Signal Bigger Problems A new study took a look at orthostatic hypotension, which is defined as a drop in blood pressure within three minutes of sitting and standing. Of the 165 participants, 48 were diagnosed with delayed orthostatic hypotension (a less serious form), 42 had the full condition and 75 did not have either. Over the 10-year span, the rate of death was 64 percent for people with orthostatic hypotension, compared to 9 percent for those without the condition. \nAlzheimer’s Disease Consists of Three Distinct Subtypes, Study Says UCLA neurologists say Alzheimer’s disease actually consists of three subtypes, which could each require a different type of treatment. The three subtypes are inflammatory, non-inflammatory and cortical. Cortical affects relatively young people and seems to be more widely distributed across the brain than other types. \nBeet Juice Boosts Muscle Power in Heart Patients Researchers have found that drinking concentrated beet juice increases muscle power in patients with heart failure because the juice is high in nitrates. Two hours after the treatment, patients showed a 13 percent increase in power for quick, power-based actions. There was no improvement in tests that measure muscle fatigue. \nFDA Accepts NDA for First-Ever Digital Medication Rounding out the top five stories this week is Ryan Bushey’s article on the Food and Drug Administration’s acceptance of a new drug application from Otsuka Pharmaceuticals and Proteus Digital Health for the first sensor-embedded version of Abilify. The medication works with another sensor that is embedded into a wearable adhesive patch to help monitor patients physiological responses and medication-taking patterns.
