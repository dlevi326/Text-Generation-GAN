A multi-center clinical study has launched in 8 centers equipped with EOS systems (in the United States, Canada, France, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong) to measure the technology’s ability to predict the risk of young patients with mild scoliosis later developing a severe deformity. \nMarie Meynadier, CE0 says: “ This promising technology confirms the value of the 3D data naturally associated with EOS images in developing applications and services dedicated to orthopedic care pathways. Acquiring these exclusive rights is an integral part of our global strategy to offer doctors not only cutting-edge imaging technology, but also a full suite of software and services to help them in their therapeutic strategies and execution, to the greatest benefit to patients. ” \nThis software’s algorithm, developed by Montreal-based surgeons and engineers, uses several clinical parameters available in patient reports from the sterEOS workstation. It establishes a predictive score, which could measure the risk of a patient at an early, mild stage of scoliosis developing a severe form of the pathology. Preliminary data on this predictive score will be presented at the forthcoming 50 th Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) Meeting to be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from September 30 th to October 3 rd . \nTreating scoliosis, whether via surgery or using a brace, is invasive. The ability to predict the risk of scoliosis progressing can facilitate both the choice of therapy – surgery or a brace – and its acceptance by young patients. Although its efficacy has been proven, wearing a brace can be difficult to accept for adolescent patients. In this area, EOS imaging is also involved in programs targeting the improvement of brace design using 3D information of the spine, ribcage and patient body contours. \nThe EOS platform provides 2D and 3D full-body, stereo-radiographic images of patients in functional positions. EOS exams require a radiation dose 50% to 85% less than Digital Radiology and 95% less than basic CT scans. The new EOS Micro Dose system, recently cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, marks another important step towards the ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Available). This latest technology has made the dose for a pediatric spine follow-up exam equivalent to a week of natural background radiation on Earth. \nFor more information, please visit www.eos-imaging.com . \nEOS imaging has been chosen to be included in the new EnterNext© PEA-PME 150 index, composed of 150 French companies and listed on Euronext and Alternext markets in Paris. \nEOS imaging is listed on Compartment C of Euronext Paris ISIN: FR0011191766 – Ticker: EOSI \nNext press release: revenue for the 3rd quarter of 2015, on October 21, 2015 (after market). \nAbout EOS imaging \nEOS imaging designs, develops, and markets EOS, an innovative medical imaging system dedicated to osteoarticular pathologies and orthopaedics, as well as associated solutions. The Company is authorized to market in 48 countries, including the United States (FDA), Japan and the European Union (EC).
