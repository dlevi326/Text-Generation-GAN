The technology is also safe, long-lasting, friendly to the environment and produces no greenhouse gas emissions. \nIn contrast to conventional solar photovoltaic cells that produce electricity directly from sunlight, solar thermal generation of energy is developed as a large power plant in which acres of mirrors precisely reflect sunlight onto a solar receiver. At the solar receiver a fluid such as supercritical carbon dioxide is heated to a high temperature, which in turn is used as a heat source for an electricity generating facility. \nExisting plants so far have been built in areas with the most consistent solar resource, such as the American Southwest. But if costs are lowered and efficiency improved, usage in general should expand, and other sunny areas in temperate or tropical zones around the world could develop such systems. \n“Our advances could open the door to a significant, 15 percent higher efficiency for solar thermal technology,” said Kevin Drost, an associate professor of mechanical engineering, now retired, at Oregon State University, which is leading the research consortium working to develop these systems. \n“We’re confident that this work will meet the goals being set by the Department of Energy,” Drost said. “With their support we’ll now move it beyond the laboratory toward a technology that could be commercialized.” \nA key to the advances is microchannel technology that has been developed at OSU in recent years, and is already finding applications in systems such as blood dialysis or advanced heat exchangers. \nThese microchannel systems use extremely small channels and a branching distribution system that speed the transfer process and improve efficiency. A microchannel lamination technology developed at OSU helps control cost, and short channels help control pressure. \n“Solar thermal technology has to work at very high temperatures and very high pressures, which present special challenges,” Drost said. “We are demonstrating that microchannel systems, as well as the use of supercritical carbon dioxide as a heat transfer fluid, should meet those challenges.” \nThe use of supercritical carbon dioxide, the researchers said, is an important component of their system, in contrast to the molten salts now used for heat transfer. It can operate at 650-720 degrees centigrade, compared to 500 degrees for molten salt. The use of supercritical carbon dioxide will improve efficiency, use a much smaller turbine, and will help to eliminate the need for water cooling towers, a special concern in some of the sunny, dry locations where such energy plants are likely to be located. \nThe microchannel receiving panels using the supercritical carbon dioxide are also about four times smaller than existing technology, which reduces cost, loss of thermal energy and weight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T13:44:30.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
