A high-speed photography technique known as schlieren was used to capture the incredible images.\nSupersonic shockwaves are invisible to the naked eye, but photographs using a calcium-K optical filter can capture the change in refractive index caused by the change in air density.\nThe shots had to be carefully timed\nA carefully timed shot was taken by NASA scientists from the ground as aircraft passed the edge of the sun or moon at supersonic speeds.\nThe images were then cleaned up to produce the incredible results, which were published on its website on Thursday.\nThe images were captured with consumer grade astronomy equipment which can be picked up for around Â£2,000, meaning anyone should be able to take similar shots if they are willing to make the investment.\nThe images were cleaned up by NASA after they were taken\nThe team behind the photos says it hopes the images can help aerodynamics researchers better understand supersonic flight.\nIt could also lead to a way to design quieter aircraft.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T12:18:41.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
