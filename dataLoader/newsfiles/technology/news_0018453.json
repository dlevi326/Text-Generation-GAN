Detection sensors in key metropolitan areas are part of a growing nationwide network to send information in real-time to a fusion center for analysis, she said. \nStarting in late 2013, a team of more than 50 scientists from across federal research laboratories and industry started working on the Mighty Saber exercise to demonstrate and evaluate post-detonation technical nuclear forensics capabilities that might be used following a simulated detonation of a nuclear device in an urban environment. DTRA said Mighty Saber included several hundred participants representing 15 agencies, laboratories, and industry partners. \nDTRA also stressed that Might Saber was based on high-fidelity modeling and simulation tools and signals associated with a nuclear detonation, not on an actual weapon detonation. \nThe data was generated by computer modeling to simulate a nuclear detonation, then sent to Discreet Oculus sensors and used to characterize the weapon’s performance and determine its potential design features. Labs working on the project also used surrogate data to simulate debris and material in the fake explosion.
