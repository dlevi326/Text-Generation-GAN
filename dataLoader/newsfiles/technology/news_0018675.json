There are too many organizations that simply are not meeting their timelines when it comes to deliverables,” stated Daniel Nemzer, CEO of Better Calculated Decisions.\nBCD can be adopted for any team environment which is tasked with achieving milestones and deliverables for clients and stakeholders.\nBCD analyzes the behavioral patterns of individuals and teams who work in a desktop environment. It then recommends and generates a customized task list for every team member. This process results in large productivity gains. BCD is easy to learn and will make workers feel good about accomplishing the various activities and tasks they do on a daily basis.\nAs part of its soft launch of its product, BCD has redesigned its website as well as its associated social media properties and will be hosting events with industry specialists.\nMore information: http://www.getbcd.com\nPress Contact: goffe@getbcd.com\nAbout BCD - Never ask your team when a task will be done again. BCD observes behavior patterns of individuals and teams, then suggests custom schedules to markedly increase efficiencies. This gives managers and principals a highly accurate system to plan budget and time allotments for deliverables.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:07:13.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
