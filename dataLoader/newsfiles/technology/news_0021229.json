A large G featuring all four colours, which replaces its little blue \"g\" icon. Four perpetually re-arranging coloured dots that indicate when Google is working. \n\"We've taken the Google logo and branding, which were originally built for a single desktop browser page, and updated them for a world of seamless computing across an endless number of devices and different kinds of inputs (such as tap, type and talk),\" wrote Tamar Yehoshua, vice-president of product management and Bobby Nath , director of user experience. \n\"It doesn't simply tell you that you're using Google, but also shows you how Google is working for you.\" \nThe new version of the full logo uses a custom sans-serif typeface that \"maintains the multi-colored playfulness and rotated 'e' of our previous mark — a reminder that we'll always be unconventional,\" explained Alex Cook, Jonathan Jarvis and Jonathan Lee of Google's material design team on the Google Design blog . \nThey added that the font is intended to combine the \"mathematical purity of geometric forms with the childlike simplicity of schoolbook letter printing.\" A visitor passes the old Google logo at the company's offices in Berlin, Germany in 2012. While it features similar colours, it uses a completely different font from the new logo.

Google says early this year, designers from all across the company convened in New York for an intense, week-long design sprint to come up with a new logo.
