European regulators are still examining whether Google manipulated other types of search results to keep traffic away from sites that could diminish its advertising sales.\nGoogle has denied the allegations in Europe. If it loses the case in Europe, Google could be fined more the $6 billion.\nAntitrust regulators in the U.S. wrapped up a probe into Google's practices in 2013 without requiring that the company make any major changes to how it ranks websites.\n technology latest google Also Read Mark Zuckerberg introduces ‘A Year of Books’ on Facebook Now, send money by email: Gmail Apple sells more than 10 million iPhone 6 handsets in the first 3 days Motorola begins after-sale service at doorstep, just at Rs 200 per service", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150901/technology-latest/article/india-suspects-google-abusing-its-dominance-internet-search", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://d2yhexj5rb8c94.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Google%20Internet_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_2_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.JPG", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://d2yhexj5rb8c94.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Google%20Internet_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_2_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-01T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:40:59.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
