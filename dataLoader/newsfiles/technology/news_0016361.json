Appearing on Triple M’s Merrick and Australia , the Channel Nine personality revealed how Bob Hawke tried to convince him to give up his historic TV interview with Sir Donald Bradman.\nA cricket tragic himself, Martin had always been desperate to interview Australia’s most famous sportsman and he was able to plant the seed for a future chat when he sat on the same table as Bradman and his wife during a dinner in Sydney.\nOther Stories Partner explains why Thurston broke down Nrl 0 comments ‘I got three or four words in’ Us Sports Wayne trait that other coaches can’t stomach Nrl 0 comments Suburbs most at risk of mortgage default News 0 comments Watmough baby ‘beats the odds’ Sydney Confidential 0 comments Lana and Sarah live it up in Bali Sydney Confidential 0 comments “Across the table, he (Bradman) said he and Jessie (Bradman’s wife) used to watch Midday . And I said, ‘Next time we’re in Adelaide, why don’t you come on the show?’”\nBut Bradman didn’t bite.\n“He said, ‘Good try son ... I don’t have anything to do with television or the media anymore.’ And then he said, ‘But if I ever do a television interview I’ll do it with you’.”\nIt seemed like an offhand comment to Martin, but Bradman meant what he had said and was true to his word.\n“Four years later I got a call from Bob Hawke after he’d left being Prime Minister and he said he needed to talk to me about something,” said Martin.\nNews_Image_File: Bob Hawke wasn’t able to convince Ray Martin to let him interview Sir Donald Bradman.\n“I met him (Bob Hawke) and he said, ‘I’ve been in Adelaide with Don Bradman and ... he’s agreed to an interview but I can’t do it unless you release him from the agreement.’”\nMost of us probably wouldn’t have the guts to stand up to a former Prime Minister, but Martin knew that if he let Hawke interview Bradman, he would never get the chance to do it himself.\nHe somehow summoned the courage to say to our 23rd Prime Minister, “If he’s (Bradman) now available, I’m back in the game”.\nNothing happened for the next few years until another of Australia’s most influential men stepped in.\n“Kerry Packer had agreed to bankroll a million dollars for the Bradman Museum in Bowral and we’d have a telethon,” said Martin.\n“So Kerry Packer arranged for me to go and meet him (Donald Bradman) and as a result of that I got the interview.”\nDon Bradman — 87 Not Out aired on Channel Nine on May 29, 1996 and out of the more than 10,000 interviews that he’s done, Martin still rates his chat with the cricket legend as one of his favourites, along side Fred Hollows and David Attenborough.\n“He’d never opened up personally before, as he did,” said Martin.\n“Jessie (Bradman’s wife) was dying of cancer and maybe that’s why he sort of felt a need to talk about it, but it was a great love story.”\nLady Bradman died in 1997, aged 88, and Donald George Bradman followed four years later in 2001, aged 92.\nMerrick and Australia airs weekdays on Triple M.\nOriginally published as How a PM tried to steal Ray’s biggest interview", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0a24d062921134ff16b643ea3037b225", "http://www.triplem.com.au/sydney/shows/merrick-and-australia/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/07c4e322b16d72e12116bc386a936907", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0141987f84dd2aed4c86736a7e4e87bd", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/120a899984c32c29f2c5947e0598a147", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/how-bob-hawke-tried-to-steal-the-biggest-interview-of-ray-martins-career/story-fnndfy6b-1227549534104?sv=fcabb76093ab9609f26df9b5952fb429", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e0accf1e79dd076186c35ecbcfae011c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d7b4dc82ab06294ba8ea6f1346c7600f", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-29T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T12:30:13.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
