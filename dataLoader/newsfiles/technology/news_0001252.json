Management Commentary \"This quarter, seasonality and delays in large contracts impacted our revenue,\" said Donovan Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer . \"That said, our partnerships with key OEM vendors continued to progress during the quarter. Together, we are focusing on a number of large opportunities, particularly in the financial, health and government sectors where our secure solutions are highly valued. Some of these deals have taken longer than we anticipated but they remain prominent in our sales funnel. We continue developing our relationships with leading VADs and VARs targeting small and medium sized businesses. We have also accelerated our transition towards a recurring revenue model by preparing to convert our retail business to a subscription based model for greater revenue predictability. Recently, we shored up our balance sheet with a private placement to pursue these initiatives in the multi-billion dollar unified communications market,\" continued Jones.
