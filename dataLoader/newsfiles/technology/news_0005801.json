But they missed this repeatedly over dozens of different applications. A huge mistake on their part.\" \n\nAn Apple spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the app approval process and why developers in China were using unofficial Xcode, but a senior executive said on Tuesday the company would make it easier for Chinese developers to download its tools. \n\nMarketing chief Phil Schiller told Chinese news site Sina.com it would offer domestic downloads within China of its developer software. \n\nSome Chinese firms had said they were pushed to download Apple's developer toolkit from unofficial sources in China because of the slow internet speeds when connecting to international services. \n\nThe country's censorship architecture, dubbed the Great Firewall, does not block app developers from downloading the official version of Xcode, but the controls, along with low investment in infrastructure for international connections, make using services based outside China a painful process. \n\nThe world's second-largest economy has average internet speeds more than three times slower than those in the United States, according to online content delivery firm Akamai's latest State of the internet report. \n\nSlow internet connections, along with government censorship, have long been a top concern among foreign businesses in China. \n\nThe issue has been exacerbated in recent months by crackdowns on tools used to circumvent the Great Firewall, such as Virtual Private Networks. \n\nLocal support \nChina is a huge market for Apple, which earned around $13 billion in Greater China in the last financial quarter and in January 2014 said Chinese developers had launched 130,000 apps for its mobile devices and personal computers. \n\nThe size of that contribution to the tech giant's bottom line has fueled resentment among some of the Chinese firms who are making those apps, who complain of lack of support. \n\nIf Apple had provided a local, quick source for the official Xcode software sooner it could have avoided the problem, said software developer Feng Dahui. \n\n\"Apple doesn't care enough about Chinese developers, nor does it value Chinese users,\" said Feng. \n\nBut regardless of the challenges facing them in China, many app developers and security experts said the tech firms themselves bear the most responsibility for the attack, which has affected mostly Chinese companies and users so far. \n\nEswar Priyadarshan, CEO of Tasteful, which creates food and dietary apps, noted that he does not know any U.S. developers who use third-party Xcode. \n\n\"It's like buying a Toyota and getting a third-party engine installed - it's going to break,\" he said.
