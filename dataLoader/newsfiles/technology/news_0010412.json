In the video, the speaker provides details on the equipment needed to see the benefits of this new container terminal design, including massive, agile fully-automated RMGs, truck load-unload stations, large conveyors, and shuttle cars.\nDutch consulting firm Dynamar recently argued the case for automation in a review of its recent breaking report \nThe shuttle cars play a key part in the function of the terminal as they provide long-move translation between berths so that containers can be moved easily and rapidly between line haul and feeders while there are containerships at the berth.\nSome of the benefits of this process are said to include aspects such as increased equipment availability, increased reliability of equipment, and increased stack density.\n\n(Source: Automated Terminal Systems)\nFor all the latest on automation, click here \nSimulation training and next generation automation", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:39:36.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
