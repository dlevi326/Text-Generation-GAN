PFC can induce adverse health effects, nerve problems and other health problems to humans and animals as well as long-term effects to the environment.

(Image: Fjordforsk AS) Recent reports show that PFC have been detected in groundwater in Sweden, Norway and many other countries in Europe. In Norway, The Environment Agency has published a plan to eliminate PFOS from the environment by 2020. In other countries such as China and the United States, the levels are far higher, and several studies show accumulation of PFOS in fish and animals, however no concrete measures have been taken. The Norwegian company, Fjordforsk AS, which specializes in nanosciences and environmental methods, has developed a method to remove PFOS from soil by binding them to natural minerals. This method can be used to extract PFOS from contaminated soil and prevent leakage of PFOS to the groundwater.

PFC coating on nanoparticles is visible as a light and transparent layer on the surface. The particles are in the range of 100-200nm and are magnified 57.000 times with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). (Image: Fjordforsk AS) Electron microscopy images show that the minerals have the ability to bind PFOS on the surface of the natural nanoparticles. The proprietary method uses saltwater and does not contaminated the treated grounds with chemicals or other parts from remediation process.
