And in January, UBS AG said it would pay more than $14.4 million to settle charges it gave some customers preferential treatment in its dark pool.\nStein said the SEC should \"adopt dramatic reforms to bring transparency to dark venues,\" including making the rules that govern the various platforms public, and to make more execution and order data available.\nStein also called on the SEC to take more responsibility in the creation of a system that would enable it to track every order and trade made in the market, across venues and systems, which has been in the works for six years.\n\"While transparency cannot do it all, it can go a long way towards restoring confidence and faith in the integrity of our marketplace,\" she said.
