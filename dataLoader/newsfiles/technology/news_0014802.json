(OTC: DRGV), a holding company of emerging high-tech companies in China , announced today its strong financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 for 2015 fiscal year.\nFinancial Highlights\nFor the first six months of 2015 fiscal year, total revenues were $10.5 million compared to revenues of $9.3 million recorded in the same period in 2014 fiscal year. Gross margins improved to 7.1% in the second quarter of 2015 compared to gross margins of 4.2% in 2014. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2015 was $628,654 compared to income from continuing operations of $132,159 recorded in the second quarter of 2014. The increase in income was mainly attributable to an increase of general sales revenue as a result of our increasing sales effort and stable cost of sales. Net income attributable to Dragon Capital Group in the second quarter of 2015 was $926,299 compared to net loss attributable to Dragon Capital Group of $232,039 inclusive of a loss of $114,548 from discontinued operations in the same period in 2013.\nBalance Sheet\nOn June 30, 2015 , total assets were $11.7 million and shareholder equity was $9.3 million with 2,018 million common shares outstanding.

This effort has resulted in a small but steady increase in our gross margins in the quarter as we maintain our cost of sales which we intend to build upon in future periods.
