The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is yet to give clearance to allow chicken sites in Iowa to bring in bird replacements. \nSome farms are expected to bring in new egg-laying chickens later this year, but farms that lost birds on a large scale are likely to remain empty until the end of the year due to the lengthy cleanup process. \nFarms will receive case-by-case clearance by the USDA, after the organisation carries out testing to ensure that the virus has been completely eradicated. The rebuilding process may take even longer if the virus recurs later this year, when seasonal ducks that carry this disease migrate. \"Minnesota and Iowa were home to the earliest chicken farms to have been affected by the disease.\" \nMinnesota and Iowa were home to the earliest chicken farms to have been affected by the disease. These farms have therefore had a faster cleanup process and have begun restocking. \nIn a monthly supply and demand report by the USDA on August 12, the estimate for wholesale frozen turkey prices for the fourth quarter was raised from $1.28 to $1.36 per pound, up from an average of $1.14 a year earlier. \nPoultry breeders and hatcheries such as Hy-Line International are already inundated with orders for replacement birds from farmers, who are waiting to resume production, reports Reuters. \nThe effect of the shortage in eggs supplies is telling on food chains such as Dunkin' Donuts, who serves sandwiches and eggs for breakfast. The chain had to withdraw a major promotion for the third quarter. \nEgg products distributor Michael Foods has also suspended production of certain items, laid off workers, and increased prices several times since the onset of the bird flu epidemic. \nImage: Egg and turkey prices continue to rise in US.
