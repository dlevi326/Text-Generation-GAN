Roland DG is also offering five runner-ups the opportunity to win either a weekend trip to a popular European destination or an iPad Air 2s. \n“This contest provides a fun and creative platform for our customers to tell the world what they’ve been able to achieve with Roland DG technology,” said Gillian Montanaro, Head of Marketing, EMEA at Roland DG. “We’re excited about giving away some incredible prizes and learning more about the vital role Roland DG equipment has played in helping users maximise their business success.” \nCustomers can simply record their story using any device and then upload the video file or submit a link to their video on YouTube, Instagram or Vine. Roland DG is not looking for video experts and the contest will be judged on enthusiasm, creativity and the imaginative story it tells. \nAny Roland DG user is eligible to enter the #WithRoland contest up to five times between the 14 September and 26 October, 2015. Contest terms and conditions can be found www.withroland.eu where users can also submit an online entry form that includes a link to your video.
