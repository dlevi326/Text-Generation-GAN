One of the bank's favored gauges of inflation expectations, the five-year, five-year euro zone breakeven forward, has fallen below 1.7 percent from 1.85 percent in July.\nThe International Monetary Fund argued on Thursday that the ECB should consider extending QE, citing a rise in downside risks to the global economy due to a combination of threats, including China's slowdown and rising market volatility.\nA majority of analysts polled by Reuters expect the bank to eventually extend or increase its asset purchases. Three quarters said that the bank has simply run out of tools and that adjusting QE, scheduled to run until next September, is its only viable option.\n\"The economic benefits of the ECB’s QE program are fading, inflation expectations are low and global growth is under threat from a rapidly slowing Chinese economy,\" RBS said in a note to clients.\nPeter Praet, the bank's chief economist, has said markets should not doubt the ECB's \"willingness and ability\" to act. But comments from other rate setters like Benoit Coeure and Vice President Vitor Constancio suggest the bank will want to take time before taking action and prefers steady policy for now.\nThe ECB will also argue that the drop in oil prices will impact inflation only temporarily and that while near-term forecasts are cut more, the impact on 2017 inflation, earlier seen at 1.8 percent, will be more limited.\n\"Given the increasing uncertainty surrounding China, the ECB’s wait-and-see mode will likely be characterized by heightened alertness to external events,\" UniCredit said.\n\"We expect ECB President Mario Draghi to respond to this more challenging environment with a strong commitment to further easing if price stability were to appear threatened.\"\nEU Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici played down the risks, predicting in an interview with Italian newspaper La Stampa that growth would become more robust.\n\"We have seen how monetary authorities, above all in China, have reacted well and have the tools to continue to do so,\" he said in the interview, published on Thursday.\n\"In such a context we can benefit from low energy prices, growth-friendly interest rates, while reform efforts by European governments are bearing fruit and create better conditions for growth.\"\nThe ECB will also be keen to highlight some of the positive impacts of QE, even as inflation has stayed below 2 percent since early 2013.\nLending to euro zone firms in July grew at the fastest pace since early 2012, unemployment fell and the composite purchasing manager's index unexpectedly rose, offering a glimmer of hope that growth may be picking up after a lackluster second quarter.\nThe bank may also argue that the impact of China's market volatility on the euro zone is limited and that the modest rise in yields on the euro zone's periphery amid a wider rout shows the bloc is in better economic health than at any time in years.\n(Additional reporting by Silvia Aloisi in Milan; Writing by Balazs Koranyi ; Editing by Catherine Evans )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:25:15.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
