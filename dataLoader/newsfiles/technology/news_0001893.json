According to the research firm Parks Associates: Roku leads the US market with a 37 percent market share, to 19 percent for Google Chromecast and 17 percent for Apple TV. Amazon's Fire TV devices have 14 percent. \nApple shares rebounded a day after a lukewarm market reaction to the US tech giant's launch of upgraded iPhones and other devices. \nShares rallied 2.2 percent to end at $112.57. \nAnalysts say Apple is seeking to diversify its product line amid a competitive global smartphone market, and that its new iPad Pro, Apple TV streaming device and Apple Watch may help. \n\"The new offerings are welcomed additions to the portfolio that will strengthen not only the competitiveness of each product category, but also the wider ecosystem and the increasing developer effort behind this platform,\" said analyst Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse in a note to clients. \nJan Dawson of Jackdaw Research said that while the iPhone accounts for most Apple revenue, the upgraded Apple TV device \"one of the biggest and most important things announced\" and \"should drive significant new revenue for Apple and for developers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:27:37.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
