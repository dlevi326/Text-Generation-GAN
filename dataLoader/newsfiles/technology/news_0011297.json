By using the camera, the settings pull down menu and prompting the password entry screen the long text string could be pasted into the password box causing it to crash.\nThe Guardian could not replicate the bug on a Google Nexus 6 or a Motorola Moto G – and entering that much text proved difficult and time consuming.\nAbout 20% of the billion or so Android devices across the world run Google’s latest version called Lollipop, including new devices from Samsung, LG and Sony.\nThese devices will require a software update to fix the bug, but users will have to rely on the manufacturer of the smartphone and their mobile phone operator to roll out the update, rather than Google directly.\nThe attack requires physical access to the smartphone, and cannot be performed remotely. Users worried by the attack can change their lockscreen preferences to a pattern unlock or Pin code, which can be up to 16 characters long, instead of a password.\nAfter the Stagefright security vulnerability , Google, Samsung, LG and other Android smartphone manufacturers recently pledged to release monthly security updates for their latest devices, in an attempt to help prevent this kind of attack being used.\n• Samsung keyboard bug leaves 600m Android devices exposed to hackers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T17:57:40.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
