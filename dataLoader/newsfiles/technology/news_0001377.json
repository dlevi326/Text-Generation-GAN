Essentially, all technology developments in BuilderMT are being voted for, designed and directed by our own users.” \nCurrently, BuilderMT has Client Advisory Groups in the following areas: \n• Estimating and Database Management \n• Sales Pricing and Sales Center Integration \n• Scheduling and Multi-Unit Scheduling \n• Portal Technologies and BMT Cloud \n• Accounting Integrations \n• Warranty Integrations \n“Recent BuilderMT functionality that has resulted from Client Advisory Groups includes BuilderMT’s most-popular modules, such as Multi-Family Scheduling, the Variance Purchase Order Process in the Builder Portal, and BuilderMT’s enhanced Tablet and iPad experience,” commented Tom Gebes, BuilderMT’s President. “We know of no other company that involves its user base so closely in technology development decisions.” \nAbout BuilderMT \nFor the home building industry at large, BuilderMT (a MiTek company) provides highly-customizable workflow and building-process-management software that works in tandem with leading accounting systems and other wireless and jobsite productivity tools, such as CRM and warranty management.
