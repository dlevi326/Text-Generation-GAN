(Michael Mercier/UAH). (Michael Mercier) Comments If you are connected to the internet, you are vulnerable to breach. \nBecause of the high concentration of national defense research conducted in Huntsville, the FBI said it has fortified its resources for a region that's a prime target for foreign cyberattacks. \nThe bureau has \"doubled its footprint\" in Huntsville, according to Roger Stanton, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's office in Birmingham. \nStanton briefly addressed the Huntsville research industry last week that attended a cybersecurity summit at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. \nStanton, who was named head of the Birmingham office in January, gave no specifics on when the FBI bolstered its investigative efforts in Huntsville. \n\"Because of the amount of research that's going into national security programs, there is ongoing activity and vulnerabilities associated with that national security research,\" Stanton said in an interview with AL.com at the cybersecurity summit. \"So we have a lot more counter-intelligence activity going on here. \n\"There are more targets for foreign intelligence services to try to look and steal our intellectual property. (For example), we have a cleared defense contractor who is doing aerospace technology research for space communications research or any of the things going on actively here. It is drawing in more foreign adversaries who are interested in stealing that material.\" \nThe enhanced FBI presence is further confirmation of the critical nature of the defense and space industry in the Rocket City while underscoring the fact that Huntsville, according to Stanton, is among the nation's foremost targets for adversaries looking to swipe that intelligence. \nStanton said there are more than 400 cleared defense contractors in Huntsville, the largest concentration in the U.S. outside Washington D.C. \n\"The threat is there,\" Stanton said. \"And because of that, internally, we have had to make more changes to put more agents and employees here.\" \n\"Specifically, there is national security research and development that's going on (in Huntsville) to support space initiatives, primary defense initiatives and those are precious to our national security. So the FBI is responsible to make sure we do what we can to identify and prevent and disrupt and dismantle any foreign intelligence service activities that may go on where they are trying to steal intellectual property, particularly when it affects the nation's defense.\" \nStanton declined to give specific numbers behind the FBI's increased presence in Huntsville. \n\"I have created an additional hybrid squad,\" he said, \"which is a new thing that is happening across the FBI and we are trying to lead the way on that by having counter-intelligence and cyber-skilled agents sit next to each other and work together on protecting our nation's intellectual property that's been hard-earned through research and development by America and we don't want foreign adversaries to steal it.\" \nProtecting that intellectual property was an emphasis of the cybersecurity summit. John Carlin, assistant U.S. Attorney General for National Security, delivered the keynote address. \nThe hacking into Sony in 2014 by North Korea is an illustration that it could happen to any company, he said. \n\"The fact is, you're all vulnerable,\" Carlin said. \"So if you don't know by face and by name when you're in that type of situation who you'll talk to in the government, then you do not yet have an incident response plan.\" \nJoyce White Vance, U.S. Attorney in Alabama's Northern District, quoted FBI Director James Comey in describing the prevalence of cyberattacks. \n\"Director Comey said there are only two kinds of companies: Those who have been hacked and those who have been hacked and don't yet know it,\" Vance said. \nAnd while larger companies might seemingly yield the greatest return in a cyberattack, Vance said, \"Increasingly, they will go after smaller companies that support critical pieces of U.S. infrastructure and our economic security.\" \nThat makes relationships with law enforcement all the more critical, Stanton said. \n\"If you are connected to the internet, you are vulnerable to breach,\" he said. \"Through conferences like this, the FBI just wants to make sure that we are leveraging and we are enhancing our relationships so we can know each other beforehand. \n\"We can break down any barriers that would that would affect our response to someone having the data stolen.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:41:00.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
