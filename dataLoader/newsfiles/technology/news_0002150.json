Picture: Kelly BarnesSource: News Corp Australia\nAdelaide-based Snap Network Surveillance’s computer-assisted tracking solution is turning heads at home and overseas, with the start-up’s technology being tested in the ­US.\nAccording to Snap Network Surveillance, the live pilots in the US are the first steps in its goal to build a global presence.\nThe company’s patented technology automatically finds the relationships between all the cameras in a network, allowing a single operator to follow someone in real-time.\n“We have done our first few live pilots in the US with one site in Florida and another in Utah, and that includes healthcare facilities and hospitals,” Snap Network Surveillance chief executive officer Simon Langsford told The Australian.\nSnap Network Surveillance has about a dozen pilot and full commercial sites. Its largest site in Australia is at Melbourne’s Swinburne University of Technology and it also recently rolled out its technology in one of Melbourne’s largest retail centres.\nThe company generated its initial revenues during financial year 2014-15 and anticipates first international export revenues within this calendar year.\n“At least one of the pilot sites we have done we expect to convert over the coming months and we have a number of opportuni­ties in the US in particular,” Mr Langsford said.\n“We also have a couple of pilot sites in the Middle East and France. We have done trials in some of those locations and we have qualified opportunities in those areas.”\nThe company’s software addresses the problem of sophisticated video surveillance systems being monitored irregularly by personnel with multiple responsibilities or staff who rotate from site to site, resulting in operators who lack experience with systems and familiarity with site and camera layouts.\n“Snap solves this by automatically learning how cameras relate to each other and using this to help guide the operator follow a subject through a network via computer-assisted tracking,” Mr Langsford said.\nHe said the software was designed to mitigate the impact of the human factor in effective ­security monitoring, which often could defeat the purpose of organisations spending significant sums of money on sophisticated surveillance systems.\nThe worldwide digital video surveillance market was esti­mated to be worth $3.6 billion in 2011 and is predicted to rise to $10.7bn by next year.\nSnap Network Surveillance, which was spun out of the University of Adelaide, has been supported by grant funding from Commercialisation Australia of more than $400,000 in 2012-14. This has led to installations in a museum and the first of several correctional facilities.\nIn 2012, Snap Network Surveillance announced a partnership deal with Pacific Comm­unications, a national distributor of closed-circuit TVs and integrated internet systems. The company’s main investor is AustralianSuper along with businesses from South Australia, NSW and Britain. The start-up has received a total investment of “multiple millions” of dollars.\n“One of my goals is to attract new investment or to seek out potential acquisition opportunities for the technology,” Mr Langsford said. “Where we are reaching out at the moment is more international businesses that are potentially able to take our technology forward on a broader front and with more resources.”\nSnap Network Surveillance will also undertake city street trials and sales of its product in the coming month in Adelaide and western Sydney.\n“We are going to probably be doing a trial with a US airport within the next month and we have done a trial with Sydney Airport in the past, which was successful, and we are still having conversations with them.\n“We are well-positioned now with growing interest and awareness of the product both locally and overseas,” Mr Langsford said.", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/21/1227537/596240-57d8ffca-6036-11e5-998f-5d4478d7f37a.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-22T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:53:11.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
