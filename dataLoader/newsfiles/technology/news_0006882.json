Michael Bennet. “Particularly, the kids of these brave men and women face unique challenges when their parents’ service ends and they transition back to civilian life. With the help of United Health Foundation, Boys & Girls Clubs of America will help these kids reintegrate and thrive in their new schools and communities.” \n“Our nation’s service members and their families know the true meaning of sacrifice,” said Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05). “The children of our fighting heroes have the strength to endure the challenges associated with this sacrifice, but they need more help from all of us. This program supported by United Health Foundation in partnership with Boys & Girls Clubs of America will help them succeed in their new schools and communities as they transition from military to civilian life. I greatly appreciate the deep commitment that UnitedHealth Group and the United Health Foundation has demonstrated toward the health and well-being of our military community and their families.” \nAnnounced today during an event at Peterson Air Force Base, the platform will engage military kids through mobile applications, digital community bulletin boards, distance learning opportunities, targeted digital communications and interactive games. The pilot will launch this fall at five Boys & Girls Clubs Affiliated Youth Centers on military installations across the country before distribution to more than 4,100 Boys & Girls Clubs. \n“The children of military families are some of our nation’s most resilient yet vulnerable youth, who have had to make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of our country,” said Jim Clark, president and CEO of BGCA. “Thanks to a generous contribution from United Health Foundation, we’ll be able to reach more families and provide the resources and community support they need as they transition between military and civilian life.” \n“We are grateful for the opportunity to support Boys & Girls Clubs of America to make a difference in military families’ health and well-being,” said John Williams, Sr., M.D., senior medical director, UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans. “This online platform will give children of military families access to health and community resources that will enhance their quality of life.” \nAbout Boys & Girls Clubs of America For more than 100 years, Boys & Girls Clubs of America ( GreatFutures.org ) has enabled young people most in need to achieve great futures as productive, caring, responsible citizens.
