Whether it's iPads, MacBooks, Chromebooks, 3D imaging or touchscreen TVs, technology is profoundly changing the way teachers teach. “The technology taps into a bigger educational question,” said Damian Bebell, a professor at Boston College on the forefront of the issue. “For me, it ultimately boils down to this: What’s the purpose of school and what role are we playing as educators in the 21st century?” For districts in the region, there’s no clear answer, and no universally accepted approach. While districts like Natick and Franklin have wholeheartedly embraced one-to-one learning – that is, some sort of laptop or tablet in the hands of every student and teacher – others are sifting through the options, constrained either by budgets or a cautionary approach. Reservations, when it comes to new technology, aren’t necessarily a bad thing either, Bebell said. “You've seen whole societies transform in the last generation or two around digital technology,” he said. “In education, we try to be more cautious. Schools are pretty traditional bastions in our communities.” Unlike other states such as Maine, where one-to-one technology in the classroom has been a clear policy directive at the state level for more than a decade, technology integration in Massachusetts falls on individual districts. In Natick, one-to-one is in full force, and technology has been a top priority in the district for six years. The high school has had one-to-one teaching for four years; the district put MacBook Air computers in the hands of every student from the eighth to twelfth grade. In kindergarten through fourth grade, the district stocked each classroom with five iPads, and from fifth to seventh, a blend of laptops and tablets. “You're just addressing a generation of students who have been raised in a culture of using technology,” said Superintendent Peter Sanchioni. “There’s no doubt technology is a difference maker, it's advancing kids.” Newer to the method, Franklin Public Schools established one-to-one in the high school last year, in conjunction with their new high school opening. Administrators say they are already seeing successes. Superintendent Maureen Sabolinski said the Chromebooks used in the pilot program, typically about $300 each, worked well for students and teachers, but cautioned they’re not an end in and of themselves. “It's not meant to supplant actual books, creative problem solving and thinking. They’re a tool to support our learning expectations,” she said.

The “disruptive” power of technology and the Internet in the way people absorb information, as Bebell put it, sometimes takes teachers back to the drawing board. One of the clearest examples of this is what educators call “flipping lessons.” Teachers effectively outsource the lecturing, either recording videos themselves or curating videos pulled from the web, for students to watch at home. Then, in class, students do hands-on work or group work, what might traditionally be seen as homework. Many districts incorporate innovations like lesson flips into their lesson plans, and use Google accounts systems to connect the district. But many districts are still feeling out what they want to do in terms of the devices they give students. While one-to-one remains the ultimate long-term goal, districts including Milford, Medway, Bellingham and Westborough are still in the piloting phase. This year, Westborough is testing a “bring your own device” program for upper classmen and women. Next year, the Westborough schools plan to roll out one-to-one teaching graded four through nine, and have students in grades 10 through 12 go out and purchase their own. Milford, Medway and Bellingham are feeling out a “blended learning” approach. Recognizing that individual devices aren’t the solution to every problem, these districts are rolling out programs that incorporate tablets, laptops and desktop computers in the classroom. What’s good for an English class may not work for an engineering class, said Kevin McIntyre, assistant superintendent for curriculum in Milford. And certainly, he said, it would be a shame to invest the thousands of dollars required for one-to-one, then have them not be used properly. “I’ve gone to classrooms (in other districts) and seen one-to-one being used in amazing, creative ways,” said McIntyre. “And others, I’ve seen them used as $300 notebooks.” Still, no public school in the area has outright rejected technology, like some private schools have. There’s a general sense in the education world that because computers are used so ubiquitously in everyday life, it would be a disservice to the students to not integrate them in the classroom. “As students move into a society where technology moves so quickly, it just matters that our students have the ability to pick up those tools and use them in a way that supports learning,” said Medway Superintendent Armand Pires.
