A staff member at the Laboratory of the Consumer Physics Society tests cheese using the SCiO pocket device in Hod Hasharon \n\"The bigger our community gets, the more data SCiO will have about different materials and this goes right back to our community of users,\" its website says. \nThe product was launched with the help of crowd funding site Kickstarter, with 13,000 customers so far placing orders for the gadget at $250 dollars (220 euros) apiece, for delivery from December 2015. \nSharon says his technology has an appeal that reaches beyond the consumer market. \n\"There is interest from small developers that want to develop something cool for themselves or for their kids, or even teenagers that want to develop this, up to multinationals and large companies,\" he says, adding that he is eyeing the industrial sector for the next phase. The SCiO spectrometre tests medicine tablets the Laboratory of the Consumer Physics Society in Hod Hasharon \n\"There are people that work in industry that on a daily basis look at stuff and say, 'Is it really the quality that I ordered?'\" \nAnd one day your smartphone could come with a SCiO built in. \nThe prototype already exists but is kept under careful guard at the premises of Consumer Physics. \nIts makers believe that within years the giants of the industry will come to see the gadget as indispensable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:51:45.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
