Surface Pro tablets ran Intel processors.\nStarting with the Surface 3, both the Surface and the Surface Pro use Intel processors and can run a full version of Windows 10, although the Surface 3 LTE model I used ships with Windows 8.1.\nA question of hardware The difference between the Surface 3 LTE ($499 with a data contract) and the Surface Pro 3 (starting at $799) is in the hardware.\nThe Surface 3 LTE ships with an Intel Atom X7 quad-core processor running at 1.6 GHz with 2 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage. It has a 10.8-inch display.\nTo give you some reference, the lowest-priced Surface Pro 3 has a 12-inch display with an Intel Core i3 CPU running at 1.5 GHz with 4 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage.\nYou can also go crazy and spend up to $1,799 on a Surface Pro 3 if you max it out.\nThe Surface 3 LTE’s display has a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels with 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 plus 4G LTE.\nTo supplement the onboard storage, the Surface 3 LTE has a microSD card slot to accommodate up to 128 more gigabytes of storage. The physical dimensions are 10.5 inches by 7.36 inches by 0.34 inches, and it weighs 22.4 ounces.\nBesides Windows 8.1, the tablet comes with a one-year subscription to Office 365 with full versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and more.\nThe Surface 3 LTE has a full-size USB 3.0 port and a Mini DisplayPort, so you can attach any USB accessory and output to a larger monitor.\nThe built-in kickstand now can adjust to three viewing angles, which is great when you use the Type Cover, a $129 option. The Type Cover has a built-in trackpad to control the Surface’s pointer.\nEasy setup Even though I use a Mac, I had no problem setting up the Surface 3 LTE to do all my work tasks. The Type Cover’s trackpad is easy to use, but it’s not very big, so I did prefer to use a mouse with the Surface 3 LTE.\nI connected hard drives and thumb drives, and easily connected my external monitor.\nI do wish the Surface 3 LTE had more RAM. Windows can get a bit bogged down with just 2 gigabytes of RAM. Given the speed of this tablet running Windows 8.1, I’m not sure I could recommend upgrading to Windows 10.\nTo be fair, Microsoft lists 2 gigabytes of RAM as the minimum requirement for Windows 10, but I wish there were more RAM available, even if it cost more money.\nOverall, the Surface 3 LTE is a great starter computer and a really nice tablet. You will need to get set up with a data plan, but it’s pretty inexpensive to add to an existing AT&T family plan.\nPros: Runs Windows, nice accessories, bright and clear touch display.\nCons: Needs more RAM, Type Cover is expensive.\nBottom line: Great size and features make this a good choice for those who aren’t power users.\nOn Twitter:\n @jimrossman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jimrossman", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIwFHVnGcc0"], "published": "2015-09-13T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:45:52.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
