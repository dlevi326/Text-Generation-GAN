From LG and Samsung featuring a curved back and arched displays to Samsung making displays with an edge and Yotafone boasting of a dual display panel, smartphones have come a long way. Now, LG wants to differentiate its smartphones, yet again. Reports state that the tech giant wants to place a tiny display panel on top of the main screen. This display will be incorporated by moving the front camera to the left side.\nThe new tiny display will feature tickers—notifications, news updates and a lot more will be seen scrolling on that panel. This will enable the user to see his updates and notifications without turning on the main display panel, thus saving power and time. This display will be the auxiliary ticker display, and the smartphone will be called the LG V10, reports Evan Blass, the famous leakster, via Tenna.\nAt present, there is no official confirmation from the smartphone company, but Evan further mentioned that the V10 would sport features such as a 5.7-inch QHD display, an SD808 chipset, a fingerprint sensor, 3GB RAM and 64GB storage with expandable memory. The new smartphone is scheduled to be unveiled in October.\n latest Mobiles and tabs LG Also Read India can be a tough market for Google's Android One: IDC Lenovo starts smartphone manufacturing in India New technology prevents iPhone damage from accidental drops Google’s Project Ara has a competitor", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/LG_1.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/COASu-CWsAAdXAi.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150909/technology-mobiles-and-tabs/article/lg-planning-new-smartphone-second-display", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/LG_1.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-10T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:51:52.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
