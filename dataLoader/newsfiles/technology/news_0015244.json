This will hopefully help to differentiate start-ups in the minds of policymakers and the general public from small business at large,” he said.\nThe report also says that while Australia has a relatively high start-up activity, it’s in decline and the employment generated per start-up is low compared with other OECD countries. “The fact that Australia seems to be falling behind in the creation of new start-ups is worrying,” Mr Mabbott said.\n“Early this year we saw Sydney drop from 12th to 16th on the Startup Compass Global Ecosystem Ranking, with Melbourne falling out of the top 20. It isn’t a question of Australia going backwards — our ecosystem has stalled — and other countries are moving ahead quicker with a more deliberate direction and strategy in place. We need to grasp the opportunity if we want to remain competitive.”\nSPECIAL REPORT: Cracking the Code - how Australia is embracing the digital economy\nVIDEO: GE’s Beth Comstock - “Australia can be world leader in energy, agriculture\nGRAPHIC: How does Australia compare with the rest of the world?\nQUIZ: How much do you really know about startups?\nAccording to Mr Mabbott, the low employment generated per start-up could be a function of the type of businesses being formed, where the majority of SMEs classified as a “start-up” are small businesses like cafes, trades or other lifestyle businesses that may not be looking to grow into global markets.\n“What the data shows is that there are a few start-ups that account for the lion’s share of job growth — understanding and helping to create more of these companies is the key to unlocking future jobs,” he said.\nThe report emphasises the need to invest in innovation, an area that Malcolm Turnbull has made a top priority for his government.\nLate last week, Labor revealed their innovation policy with start-up visas designed to attract up to 2000 foreign university graduates and 2000 entrepreneurs wanting to start their own business in Australia.\nLabor has also announced a $5.5 million policy to support Australian university students looking to set up start-ups after they graduate by offering a HECS-style loan scheme of $10,000 in addition to a two-year program to help support start-ups compete for government tenders.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten said Australia could be in the top 10 per cent of countries globally when it came to start-ups, if the right policies were implemented. Both Labor MP Ed Husic and the newly appointed assistant minister for innovation Wyatt Roy have expressed their desire for bipartisanship on policies around innovation.\n“I think it’s a good thing that both parties are focused on innovation and that there should be competitive tension around policy delivery. But if we work as collaborative policymakers than I think we can have a better outcome for our country,” Mr Roy told The Australian.\n“I don’t think it’s necessarily a matter of implementing their policies — it’s the matter of what are the right polices, what are the best policies and how do we support both.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:59:48.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
