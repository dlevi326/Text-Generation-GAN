The survey of 3000 US parents by Stop Procrastinating , the productivity website, comes during the start of the school year and highlights concerns that use of digital devices at night are making children more fatigued and less able to concentrate during the school day.\nThe study found that 51% parents said their suspicions were aroused because their children were more tired and irritable in the mornings and were unusually tired after school.\nOf parents concerned about their children browsing the Internet at night:\n74% of parents said that it affected their quality of sleep\n62% made them more irritable and less able to concentrate\n69% said that they were worried it would lead to fatigue in the classroom with their children less able to concentrate on schoolwork.\n37% are concerned that the lack of sleep could causes anxiety and depression.\n51% said they had noticed that it had affected their children’s ability to finish homework.\n36% of parents said they had raised the issue with teachers with many saying they also noticed that children were more tried in the classroom.\n56% of parents have also observed their children working on school work while also using social media. They worried that this multi-tasking was undermining their children’s concentration and performance as well.\n42% of parents felt a high level of guilt and blamed themselves for the detrimental impact of social media and the Internet on their children’s education, believing they were unable to ban the use of social media as its presence is so pervasive.\nTim Rollins, Research Director at Stop Procrastinating, said: \"Children used to be caught having a midnight snack or reading under the bed covers, now they are staying up late into the night browsing the internet or using social media, sending messages to friends.\nWhile not every child read or ate under the covers, it seems that a majority are now using social media instead of sleeping. Evidence shows it is affecting their concentrate and causing fatigue and could do real damage to their educational attainment.”\nNotes to editors:\nThe survey was undertaken with 3000 parents, weighted for age and region, between 14st August and 18th September 2015 using standard national opinion polling methodologies.\nAbout Stop Procrastinating:\nStop Procrastinating is an evidence-based productivity website and blog providing advice on how to improve productivity.\nUndertaking its own independent research as well as collating the latest scientific data, it aims to provide only the very best, informed and practical advice available today.\nWhen there's so much information to choose from, you want to be able to rely on reliable and actionable information.\nStop Procrastinating is also a leading internet and website blocker allowing using to disconnect from the web in order to get things done with distraction.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdG9wcHJvY3Jhc3RpbmF0aW5nYXBwLmNvbQ=="], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T17:09:09.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
