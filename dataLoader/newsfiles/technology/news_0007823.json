Nic Walker by The Australian Financial Review A successful sharemarket listing in the United States by pin-up software company Atlassian would be a vote of confidence in the potential of Australia's technology sector. To become the agile, tech-smart disruptor that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull envisages, Australia needs to encourage the sort of culture that breeds more companies like this.\nEntrepreneurs themselves are the irreplaceable ingredient, but Australia makes it much harder – culturally and financially – to fail and start again than in the US. Atlassian, which took its first steps towards a $3 billion US listing last week, began with $10,000 on the credit card of uni mates Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes. And along with their sort of energy, we need the right STEM-based education to fire up bright ideas in the first place.\nMany fret when Australian tech companies head overseas. Fellow digital pioneer, Freelancer founder Matt Barrie lamented Atlassian's decision to float in the US rather than here. Mr Turnbull's new assistant minister for innovation Wyatt Roy says he wants to get many of the 20,000 Australians said to be working in Silicon Valley to come home. These are reasonable sentiments, but it is also good for the world's biggest capital market to recognise Australia as a potential source of bankable ideas, just as it is for Australians to circulate through Silicon Valley's network of people, ideas and money.\nIn the case of Atlassian, the engineers and product managers, the technical brains of the company, remain in Australia. But Mr Cannon-Brookes and Mr Farquhar are forced to heavily rely on foreign workers here because Australia's educational culture does not value STEM subjects enough given their importance in the iPhone economy. This feeds into a higher education sector that needs to focus more on innovation and commercialisation – essential ingredients of wealth creation. And, while the Abbott government may have fixed the heavy-handed tax treatment of employee share schemes for tech start-ups, Labor continues to scaremonger over imported labour and any encroachment into a nine-to-five workplace regulation that suits a world which no longer exists.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:21:42.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
