In the 12 months after the September 2013 launch of its inaugural smartwatch, Samsung cranked out no fewer than six different smartwatch models as it sought to carve out an early lead in the fledgling market for wearable devices. But in the one year since then, Samsung has remained silent on smartwatches.\nThat extended break coincided with Apple's unveiling of the Apple Watch last September.\nBy some measures, the Apple Watch appears to be faring well with consumers. After going on sale in late April, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company shipped 3.6 million Apple Watch units in the second quarter of the year, according to research firm IDC, suggesting that the device is off to a better start than Apple's iPad or iPhone. Apple hasn't provided its own figures.\nThe same IDC report said Samsung shipped a total of about 600,000 units of its wearable devices in the three months ended June 30, a small decline from the year-earlier period. Market research firm Juniper Research said in a report last year that the smart-wearables market could generate $53 billion in revenue by 2019 compared with $4.5 billion in 2014.\nAfter its hiatus, Samsung appears to be basing its counterattack on slicker design, and features that Apple hasn't yet offered.\nUnlike the Apple Watch, which relies on a rotating \"digital crown\" on the side of the watch to access features, Samsung's new smartwatches will allow users to rotate the outside ring of the device.\nLike most of its other wearable devices, the new Samsung smartwatch will eschew Google Inc.'s Android operating system in favor of Samsung's homegrown Tizen operating system. The company didn't release specific details on pricing or the timing of the release.\nWrite to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"Apple, Inc.\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005\n 31, 2015 17:14 ET (21:14 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif"], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T07:46:34.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
