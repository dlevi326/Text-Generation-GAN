And Carly's team came back shrugging their shoulders.\" \nHayden suggested that the NSA and other federal agencies were mainly trying to target foreign entities, and that data collection included Americans incidentally. \"I have yet to meet a civil libertarian who gave a damn about NSA intercepting the high frequency communications from Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces Headquarters in Moscow going out to [missile] fields,\" Hayden said. \"We were on those networks trying to pick up keywords of interest, words like 'launch.'\" \nToday, Hayden said, the federal government must focus on cellular communication metadata on a widespread basis in order to monitor similar information. \nCommunications, Hayden said, \"co-exist on a single, global, integrated, telecommunications grid with your Gmail. There is no way around that. If you wanted the NSA to do for you what it did in the last century in this century, it had to be on paths in which your protected communications were co-mingled with the communications of legitimate, foreign intelligence targets.\" \nHayden, who retired as director of the CIA in 2009, oversaw many of the American surveillance programs exposed by Edward Snowden in 2013. One of the most controversial was the surveillance of telephone metadata authorized by the Patriot Act, also known as Section 215 authority. That program was reauthorized by the USA Freedom Act in June, but is set to expire permanently in November.
