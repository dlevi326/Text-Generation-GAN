With more people using the Internet and smart phones to access banks and other secure information, identity theft has been on the rise. It is important to take precautions to protect yourself from becoming a victim of identity theft. \nBelow are some ways you can begin to protect your information online: \n1. Change your passwords: Having the same password for everything can put you more at risk for identity theft. If a thief figures out your password they will have access to all of your personal information, including your finances. It is also important to change your passwords up every few months, and make sure they are longer than 10 characters, including multiple symbols and upper and lower case letters. \n2. Use websites that you are familiar with and that have good reputations when making purchases : It is important that any time you put your credit and other personal information onto a website, you make sure that it is being protected (and that it is not a scam.) If you are unfamiliar with the company you are purchasing something from, you should research them more before you complete your order. Look for https in the URL at the top of the payment page, if you see this then the website should be secure. \n3. Be Alert : Make sure that you are aware of abnormalities on your credit report. You should monitor your credit report often and notice if there is any false information on them. You should also be aware of when your bills are coming. If they are coming later or are missing, this could be a sign of identity theft. If you are sent a credit card you did not apply for, if your credit approval is denied for no reason or if you receive calls about missing payments about items you did not buy, you should take action; these are common signs that your identity may have been taken. All of these could be signs that your identity has been stolen and the faster that you notice and respond, the faster you can fix the situation. \nBeau Dietl & Associates is a premier private investigation company based in New York City with offices in New Jersey, Florida and California.
