Photo: Jessica Shapiro/AFR\nThe digital innovation frenzy that gripped the banks is now playing out in the superannuation sector as funds compete to manage Australians' super assets — $2 trillion today and tipped to reach $9 trillion by 2040.\nTraditionally a digital laggard, the superannuation sector was kicked into the 21st century by the Government's SuperStream reforms which forced most firms to overhaul their back office by the end of June this year.\nOrganisations which had shuffled and faxed paper forms were forced to replace largely manual processes with computer systems in a process that has already cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars. But that's just the start of the digital disruption of the sector.\nThe Financial System Inquiry recommended that all employees be allowed a choice of superannuation fund in the future. Many players are gearing up now. With the back end overhauled, super funds are now looking to fancy front ends and apps to lure millennials, if and when full competition is introduced.\nAdvertisement ANZ Bank's Grow app for example allows customers to see their banking and super funds from a single login, and also consolidate their lost super by clicking through a series of prompts. Fees are just 0.6 per cent. Online bank ING meanwhile has leveraged technology to offer fee-free entry level superannuation and online access to accounts via the web or a mobile app.\nNSW State Government owned Pillar Administration is the latest organisation to spend up big on technology. CEO Peter Brook acknowledged that the funds it administers still rely to some degree on paper and faxes but Pillar is now streamlining its IT, spending \"tens of millions of dollars\" replacing nine separate back-office systems with Financial Synergy's Acurity system (the same platform used by ING). First State Super is Pillar's largest customer and will be the first fund to go live on the new platform in March next year.\nOnce equipped with the superannuation sector's equivalent of updated core banking platforms, the industry will be better placed to use technology to create a competitive edge to lure consumers — particularly millennials.\nBrooke said that already technology had cut the time taken to effect superannuation rollovers from four to six weeks to three days. But he said that in the future \"The power is moving to the member,\" and that socially engaged consumers would want to use technology to switch super funds the way they can switch bank accounts in order to benefit from better fee structures, or reward a fund's approach to investing in Transfield or its ethical investment strategy.\nBut there's a catch for the industry funds. Unlike banks which can afford to invest in technology from their profits, the only way industry funds can pay for new technology is through member fees.\nFees are already a sore spot; a recent report suggests that fees associated with super accounts have already reached $21 billion.\nBut all funds will have to bite the bullet and invest in technology or they will struggle to compete in the future.\nAccording to Blake Briggs, senior policy manager for superannuation at the Financial Services Council; \"The Government is looking at ways to drive competition in the superannuation industry to reduce fees. If all consumers are afforded the right to choose their superannuation fund the FSC expects funds will be forced to deliver high quality services through modern technology at a low cost. Until now that competitive pressure has been lacking from the industry.\n\"Large, efficient superannuation funds that invest in their technology platforms now will be more competitive in the future. Small, subscale funds that cannot afford to invest in new technologies will struggle to compete.\"\nBriggs added; \"The back office SuperStream project has been the focus of much IT spend for superannuation funds over the last three years. The FSC expects trustees to increasingly focus on how consumers can better interact with their fund and how servicing standards can be improved through investment in technology.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T07:32:10.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
