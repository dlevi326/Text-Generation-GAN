DattoCon brings Managed Service Providers (MSPs), Value-Added Resellers (VARS), and IT business owners together for three days of sessions, technical training, best practices and networking opportunities designed to help Datto partners dramatically grow their businesses. Datto is dedicated to innovation and with that spirit in mind, the company tapped one of the world’s leading thinkers, Steve Wozniak, for a session entitled “iWoz: A Conversation with Steve Wozniak” during DattoCon. As an Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak is best known as the developer of the Apple I, one of the first personal computers and a catalyst for the launch of Apple.\n“DattoCon gets better every year, and in 2016 we will not only provide content that helps IT professionals get ahead in their careers, but also inspires,” said Austin McChord, CEO of Datto. “Steve Wozniak is an inspirational leader in the technology industry and attendees will undoubtedly benefit from Steve’s wisdom.”\nWith more than 700 attendees expected in 2016, DattoCon will offer a range of sessions focused on two tracks: a sales and marketing track as well as a technical track, to address challenges such as how to best provide total data protection.\n“While there are many benefits to attending DattoCon, increasing your company’s bottom line is one of the most important advantages,” said Rob Rae, Vice President, of Business Development at Datto. “Datto partners have the opportunity to collaborate with fellow partners and learn specifically what works and what doesn’t. We found that 2014 DattoCon attendees grew their Datto sales 151 percent on average within one year’s time.”\nIn addition to receiving tremendous educational resources at DattoCon, attendees will get a first look at new Datto products before they are generally available.\nTo register for DattoCon 2016, visit http://www.dattocon.com .
