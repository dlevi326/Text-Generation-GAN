Source: Supplied\nFive stars for ingenuity, zero stars for the film — well, actually, to be fair, make that two stars.\nGuardian UK writer Benjamins Lee’s review of the forthcoming Krays biopic Legend (in which Tom Hardy plays both brothers) was as unremarkable as the film itself.\n“It’s two thugs for the price of one actor and while flashes of brilliance emerge from his performance(s), Hardy is let down by disappointingly pedestrian surroundings” — Two Stars out of Five.\nThe resourceful marketers behind the film didn’t let a little thing like a middling review get in the way, though, craftily placing the Guardian verdict between the two Hardys, suggesting a five-star masterpiece.\nBut Lee wasn’t the only Guardian journo to make the news this week. Football Weekly podcaster and writer Jacob Steinberg sniffed out a story when the plane he was on in Las Vegas burst into flames . For once, what went on in Vegas didn’t stay in Vegas.\nWHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD?\nCross Road is a new take on the old ZX Spectrum favourite Frogger Source: Supplied\nThere is nothing an Aussie loves more than a battler, the underdog, David v Goliath, the Malcolm Gladwell anti-hero. Step forward Andy Sum, the Melbourne developer who enjoyed a moment of glory at this week’s humungous Apple launch in San Francisco to talk about Crossy Road , which will soon be available on Apple TV.\nWe’re told it’s a big hit with the kids, and no wonder — it is a wonderful app and a new take on a favourite from our childhood: Frogger. They do make them like they used to.\n‘AT 12 HE WAS SHOT IN THE BACK’\nDeng’s extraordinary story has now become the backbone of an advertising campaign by Western Sydney University. Source: Supplied\nSometimes a story drifts into your inbox that is so incredible, you can barely believe it to be true. Case in point: Rick Morton’s report on Western Sydney University’s superb Unlimited marketing campaign.\nDeng Thiak Adut was taken from his mother at the age of six, forced to become a child soldier, shot in the back, smuggled out by the UN ….\nWell, we won’t spoil it for you if you are not one of the 370,000 people to have already seen the clip. A truly remarkable, uplifting story. Watch it HERE .\nWHAT THE CLUCK?\nAs a big Scotland football fan, I’m used to seeing players run around like headless chickens. Turns out I’ve been doing a bit of a disservice to headless chickens.\nBBC Magazine this week paid tribute to Mike, the chicken who was beheaded 70 years ago but refused to die for 18 months. The explanation is pretty simple, there is very little brain at the front of the head of the chicken.\nMike Headless Chicken made @BBC mag! Officially, world famous, if he wasn't already. #gjco #miketheheadlesschicken http://t.co/hmpAntrByy\n— The Daily Sentinel (@DailySentinelGJ) September 10, 2015 Mike was fed with a dropper and had his throat cleared with a syringe but eventually suffocated to death.\nBut the good folks of Fruita in the US haven’t forgot the last chicken standing with a statue in the town and a festival held every year.\nCAT’S ENTERTAINMENT\nJapan is a weird, wonderful and sometimes slightly wrong place; beer from vending machines, curry bears and maid cafes (don’t ever visit one - they’re not kitsch, just a bit grubby).\nAnd they love cats. Cat cafes are already well established in Japan and making their way over here. (Not Google) Street Views for Cats is the new thing and the most addictive site on the internet since something we loved last week but can’t quite recall now.\nVox led the way, and not just with the awfully pun-tastic headline ‘Truly nothing is im-paw-sible’.\nHiroshima’s tourist board came up with the idea to give everyone the chance to see the world from a slightly different, whiskered perspective. Take a walk on the wild side.\n@marcdodd/twitter", "external_links": ["http://www.vox.com/maps/2015/9/2/9251241/cat-map-japan-hiroshima", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/gjco?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/marcdodd", "http://hiroshima-welcome.jp/kanpai/catstreetview/", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/11/1227522/621266-2d77bec4-5820-11e5-a7dc-18321c6979b2.jpg", "https://twitter.com/DailySentinelGJ/status/642000412321677312", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/11/1227522/633728-5a7932f0-5829-11e5-a7dc-18321c6979b2.jpg", "http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34198390", "https://twitter.com/BBC", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/miketheheadlesschicken?src=hash", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/11/1227522/627612-013e0442-582c-11e5-a7dc-18321c6979b2.jpg", "https://twitter.com/SquigglyRick?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "http://t.co/hmpAntrByy"], "published": "2015-09-11T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T02:55:29.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
