As \"Force Friday\" passes, she fondly retells the story of how stumbling upon a discarded action figure changed her life forever. Enlarge Image My crooked little smile appeared every time I thought of my favorite \"Star Wars\" toy. Bonnie Burton/CNET \nIn 1977, I was a 4-year-old who lived on a farm, kind of like our hero Luke Skywalker. I longed to spend time with toys that ignited my imagination, but all I had were hand-me-down dolls, Lincoln Logs, pick-up sticks, View-Masters and a few creepy puppets. \nThen I spotted a dirty action figure carelessly discarded outside my preschool that looked like a cross between Big Foot and a skinny bear. And I realized I might have found a new plastic soulmate. \nKeep in mind, I was just a kid. I can't remember most details from my childhood, but there was something about that odd-looking toy that stole my heart. I put the figure in my pocket and never let him out of my sight. I called him Harry until I knew better, and I made up adventures for him, usually consisting of foiling evil plans by Saturday morning cartoon monsters.

I have a feeling someone sold my mom on the idea of \"Star Wars\" as a cross between a Muppet movie and \"The Wizard of Oz.\" \nWhen you talk to us elder geeks who were lucky enough to see the original \"Star Wars\" movies in the theater, we get a far-off look in our eyes. It's a special kind of glimmer that makes us smile at the excitement we had witnessing the Star Destroyer slowly move across the screen, shaking in fear at the sight of Darth Vader and leaving the movie waving our arms around wielding invisible lightsabers as we all made that signature \"whoosh\" sound. \nBut the thing that made me squeal with delight was seeing my old friend Harry up on the big screen, growling, howling and laughing it up with his buddy Han Solo. Of course, they called my furry buddy Chewbacca, but he was still Harry to me, and I loved him. Enlarge Image These days Chewbacca likes to hang out in my houseplants. Bonnie Burton/CNET \nBefore I discovered Harry had another life as a famous Wookiee who helps to save the galaxy, to me he was just a beat-up toy, forgotten in the dirt by his old master. \nBut as soon as I discovered Harry, aka Chewbacca, in his natural habitat that was \"Star Wars,\" I spent all my time trying to perfect a Wookiee howl, which probably made me sound like a whiny dog to my confused parents. \nFrom then on I learned quickly that the best way to size up other kids wasn't by their appearance or personality, but by their \"Star Wars\" knowledge. I wore my hair in Princess Leia buns for school yearbook photo day. \nI practiced my own style of \"Star Wars\" battle choreography by leaping off of jungle gyms while waving around makeshift lightsabers constructed with gift-wrapping cardboard rolls and duct tape. \nI kept Harry the Wookiee with me even when all my other toys fell by the wayside to make room for Merlin and Simon electronic games, Lite Brite, Spirograph and this new thing called a Pong video game. \nEven when I grew up from a nerdy kid into a surly teen, Harry was always hanging out inside my desk drawer or on a bookshelf. I even took the little Wookiee to college with me as a good-luck charm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T19:44:06.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
