Coury, Mylan executive chairman, in Tuesday’s announcement.\nMylan also released the text of a letter sent to Perrigo CEO Joseph C. Papa, which argues that “this is a highly compelling offer in terms of the price, multiple being paid, accretion and long-term potential for value creation.”\nMylan wants to complete the transaction by Nov. 13.\nAnalysts have said that significant swings in Mylan’s share price since it is no longer an acquisition target itself have made the offer to Perrigo shareholders less attractive.\nBut Mylan’s letter to Papa makes the case that Perrigo’s stock has been protected from stock-market swings by Mylan’s interest, and that Perrigo shareholders can expect their shares to drop in value if the deal doesn’t go through.\nThe offer to Perrigo shareholders was cleared in late August. At a meeting in Amsterdam, Mylan shareholders authorized the company to offer Perrigo stockholders 338.5 million Mylan shares and $11 billion in cash in exchange for their shares.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T07:56:10.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
