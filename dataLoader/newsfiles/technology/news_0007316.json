The good thing is, you don’t have to spend a lot of money to get yourself a pretty decent smartphone these days. - Advertisement - \nThe issue of poor battery life has always been a challenge in the smartphone industry, and that’s where Lenovo is all set to help users overcome it by presenting a huge 5000 mAh battery. This could easily mean at least 2-3 days of battery life which is an amazing feat. \nAs for the R5s, it is pretty much an upgrade on the original R5 and carries on the mantle of being one of the thinnest smartphones around. It does have its own upgrade here and there, and, in fact, it comes with a cheaper price tag as well. Is there more to it than meets the eye? \nFor starters, the Vibe P1 which will only be available in October 2015 comes with a body of 152.9 x 75.6 x 9.9 mm (6.02 x 2.98 x 0.39 in) and weighs 189 g (6.67 oz). You can say that it is slim but might not necessarily be lightweight. Then there’s a fingerprint sensor on the home button which supports black screen unlock and brings about even greater convenience and security to keep the device and user privacy safer than ever before. It will also be sporting a premium metal-and-glass design with a curved rear metallic cover for improved ergonomics. The screen is made of Gorilla Glass 3, a thinner and lighter iteration of Corning’s scratch- and crack-resistant protective glass that is a protection that you will surely need. \nMeanwhile on the R5s, it actually has the same look and feel as its predecessor. In fact, the body and weight remains the same at 148.9 x 74.5 x 4.9 mm (5.86 x 2.93 x 0.19 in) and 155 g (5.47 oz). Each device features a reinforced industrial grade stainless steel micro-arc frame that undergoes a personal touch of handcraftsmanship. Plus it is made of phase-shifting material that is made of metal, resin, and other composite materials. When heat is generated, the material begins to change accordingly. This material will not only absorb heat but it also radically improves on thermal efficiency. How many of us complained of their smartphone running hot? Not anymore with this smartphone. \nWith a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS capacitive touchscreen, the Vibe P1 has a screen resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~401 ppi pixel density. Then we have the R5s that still uses the same 5.2-inch Full HD AMOLED capacitive touchscreen displaying 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~423 ppi pixel density. \nTo be frank both are equally good on their own terms, but the larger screen on the Vibe P1 appeals to me a bit more. I mean, after you are so used to large screen devices, you will not go back or settle for anything smaller. \nPerformance-wise, the Vibe P1 will be powered by the Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 405 graphics and 2GB RAM. \nMeanwhile on the R5s, there will also be the Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising of Quad-core 1.7 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 405 graphics and 3GB RAM. \nBoth are in the medium-high range but the slightly faster processor and an additional 1GB RAM makes the R5s perform slightly better. There shouldn’t be any issues running all of the apps and games that are out there. - Advertisement - \nIn terms camera, both the Vibe P1 and the R5s has the same 13MP-5MP camera setup. That should be more than enough for all of your camera adventure and casual upload to your favorite social media. This makes for a very decent point-and-shoot camera. Only a camera shootout would determine the actual winner in this case. \nAs for storage, the both the Vibe P1 and R5s has 32GB of internal storage is there to install all of your favorite apps and games plus to keep all of your precious documents and photos. But then herein lies the deal-breaker for some people. On the Vibe P1, should you need more space; just put in a microSD card up and you can expand up to a maximum of 128GB. But do take note that it will take up the 2 nd sim slot. As compared to the R5s, which has no expansion slot, which means that you have to do your housekeeping now and then. Which is good by the way, a spring cleaning every few months is good for your smartphone. \nSoftware-wise, the Vipe P1 is equipped with the latest Android Lollipop 5.1 right out of the box which further complements its strong hardware. This should optimize and improve performance a lot more. \nAnother downside for the R5s is that it is still running on Color OS 2.0 which is based on Android KitKat 4.4.4. We would have expected it to be at least running on KitKat 5.0, and with no confirmation on whether it will get an upgrade, this is something that you have to bear in mind as well. \nFinally we have reached the end and this is what the Vibe P1 is all about - its humongous non-removable Li-Po 5000 mAh battery. The huge battery does help to power up the device for a few days, but a 5-minute charge equals to 3-hours of talk time. The massive battery has the potential to last you for around 81 hours or 30 days of battery life, with 44-45 hours of talk time. Massive isn’t it? In addition to a physical power saver switch , which instantly extends battery life and OTG (On-The-Go) Charging feature, it also stands out with the 24W quick charge function that can rapidly charge the phone battery. \nIt is an unfair comparison altogether when we take into account what the R5s has to offer. It only has a rather smallish non-removable Li-Po 2000 mAh battery that is supplying the juice to it. It might even struggle to last you for a day if you are a heavy user. At least the good thing is that a five-minute charge gives you two hours of phone call while 30 minutes charge and that will restore 75% of the R5s’s battery. - Advertisement - \nWith the Lenovo Vibe P1, the primary target would be users who want the absolute best in battery life. Not many smartphones can brag about it or even comes close to it. The metal body gives its premium look about it. The performance is somewhere in the mid-upper range which is a boost. In fact, there isn’t a flaw that you can say about this smartphone. \nBeing one of the world’s thinnest smartphone feels great but it does have its own shortcomings. The performance is top-notch, but there won’t be an expansion slot, they're the dated OS issue and the fact that it has a very small battery are the things that you should look out for. But it does come with a very attractive price. \nThe Lenovo Vibe P1 is expected to be available in October for approximately $279 USD and will be available in black, white, violet, blue and pink. \nThe Oppo R5s is currently available for just $220 USD but is only available in Gray.
