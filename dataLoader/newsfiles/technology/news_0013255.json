In the lawsuit filed Monday by Wilford Raney and others in federal court in San Francisco, claims that the company systematically intercepts, reads, and alters the private messages without users’ knowledge or consent. Twitter maintains that direct messages are private between two users. The suit claims Twitter is violating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and California’s privacy law. “Should a user write a Direct Message and include a hyperlink … Twitter’s algorithms will read through the Direct Message, identify the hyperlink, and replace it with its own custom link, thereby sending the person clicking on the link to Twitter’s analytics servers before passing them on the original linked-to website.” According to the suit, Twitter benefits immensely from replacing users’ hyperlinks with their its own shortened version.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T09:23:00.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
