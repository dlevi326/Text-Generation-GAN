Photo: AP/Eric Risberg \nOnce, there was simply a pencil and paper. \nNow the ‘paper’ is a super-sized tablet – and the ‘pencil’ is a R1,400 stylus that allows users to write on it. \nHoping to reinvent the way we communicate, Apple unveiled the gadgets yesterday in what it called the biggest innovation since the iPad was launched in 2010. \nThe supersize iPad Pro, which has a 12.9-inch (32.8cm) screen, has already been dubbed the ‘Monster iPad’– and boasts four speakers. \nThe ‘Apple Pencil’ has pressure sensors to convert its movements into different thickness lines for drawing or writing. Users can also change the colour of the strokes. At an event in San Francisco yesterday, Apple showed how it could be used by a doctor to talk a patient through a diagnosis and surgery using 3D images. \nUK prices have not yet been announced, but the pencil will cost the equivalent of £65 in the US. \nThe iPad Pro will have a starting price of £520 when it goes on sale in November. \nUsers will also be able to buy a ‘smart keyboard’ and cover, which will cost another £110. \nApple chief executive Tim Cook said the device is more powerful than previous iPads and offers ‘desktop-class performance.’‘iPad is the clearest expression of our vision of the future of personal computing,’ he said. ‘We asked ourselves how we can take it further – and we have the biggest news for the iPad since the iPad.’ \nApple’s late founder Steve Jobs, when introducing the iPhone in 2007, famously said: ‘Nobody wants a stylus. If you see a stylus, they blew it.’ \nAnd tech expert Ernest Doku, of uSwitch.com, said: ‘For the average consumer, the iPad Pro isn’t more than a big screen and stereo sound, with a colossal price tag. And all those accessories, like Apple Pencil, are sold separately and don’t come cheap either.’ \nApple also used the event to reveal new versions of the iPhone, the biggest selling smartphones in the world. \nMr Cook said the new iPhone 6S and larger iPhone 6S plus are ‘the most advanced ever’ with a new chip to speed performance. \nThe handsets include a version with a rose-gold aluminium case and others using hi-tech materials originally developed for the aerospace industry. New technology called 3D Touch recognises the force used on the screen – speeding up navigation between screens and applications. The camera has been upgraded to 12 megapixels, which is a 50 per cent improvement in detail. \nVideo can also be recorded in super-sharp 4K, which is some four times more detailed than the images on existing high definition TVs. \nStill images can also be transformed into what Apple calls a ‘Live Photo’ by capturing a short video clip when a photo is taken. Touching an image of a lake, for example, will produce ripples on the water – echoing the moving portraits that featured in the Harry Potter books. \niPhone 6S will be available in the UK for a suggested retail price of £539 for the 16GB model –£619 for the equivalent iPhone 6S Plus model. \nAlso unveiled by the company were new versions of the Apple Watch and updates to enhance its position as both a fashion accessory and a lifestyle tool. \nSoftware has been developed to allow a doctor to monitor a pregnant woman’s heartbeat while she is sitting at home. Astonishingly, the watch can also be connected to sensors on the mum-to-be’s belly to separately monitor the baby’s heart. \nApple also plans to take on traditional broadcasters and the likes of Netflix with a new TV service. Apple TV works via a new smartbox that attaches to the television and the home’s broadband wi-fi system. \nUsers get a remote that allows them to search for films and programmes by touch. – Daily Mail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T11:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T05:57:01.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
