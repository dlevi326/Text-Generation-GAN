The Elections Department will this year conduct a sample count , where 100 random ballot papers are counted in each polling station once voting ends.\nThe poll gives Singaporeans a chance to assess how Lee’s administration has fared in tackling issues that hurt the PAP in 2011, including living costs, public transport disruptions and immigration. The PAP moved after that vote to further boost spending on lower-income families and the elderly, and has sought to capitalize on the groundswell of patriotism that followed massive celebrations last month to mark the nation’s modern founding.\n“They’re evolving with the electorate,” said Wai Ho Leong, a Singapore-based economist at Barclays Plc, referring to the PAP. “The burning issues that were with Singapore in 2011 have since receded because the government has systematically worked to address some of these election concerns that were very pressing in 2011.”\nChallenges remain for a country facing an aging workforce and doubts over traditional pillars of growth like manufacturing and electronics. The export-driven economy has been damped by China’s slowdown, uneven recoveries in the U.S. and Europe and a commodities slump. The Singapore dollar is set for its biggest annual loss since 1997 and its stock index is the second-worst performing Asian benchmark index in local currency terms this year.\nThe outlook among small and medium enterprises for the next six months fell to an almost three year low in the third quarter, according to an index by the Singapore Business Federation and DP Information Group.\nOpposition Parties Nine opposition parties are contesting the 89 parliamentary seats up for grabs, alongside a handful of independents. Among them, only the Workers’ Party won seats in 2011. It had seven, compared with 79 for the PAP, before parliament was dissolved for the poll.\nThe Workers’ Party has drawn tens of thousands to its rallies, with Singaporeans packing open fields in the suburbs to listen to chairman Sylvia Lim speak. The Singapore Democratic Party has seen the return of its chief Chee Soon Juan after he was cleared of bankruptcy in 2012. He was declared bankrupt after failing to pay S$500,000 ($351,000) for defaming PAP leaders during the 2001 election.\nYet, the ruling party is likely to keep its majority as it retains support from citizens who see it as the force that turned a small trading port into Southeast Asia’s richest country. The death of party founder and first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew in March led to an outpouring of grief as hundreds of thousands stood in line for hours to pay their respects to him.\nA record 2.46 million Singaporeans will get to vote, and casting a ballot is compulsory for all citizens who are 21 and over. Politicians compete in single-seat wards or multiple-seat districts. The party that gets the most number of votes in a constituency sends all its members to parliament.\nSocial Media The ruling party has built up its online presence since 2011, when an undercurrent of discontent emerged on social media over transport woes, immigration and the cost of living. Lee has actively taken to Twitter since April last year and has more than 210,000 followers. In January he held his first online chat on his personal Facebook page where discussions ranged from his preference of pink shirts to perceptions of the government.\nIn a country where the operator of the biggest television and radio stations is indirectly owned by the government, some have turned to news portals, blogs and social media for alternative views. Topics like train breakdowns, housing prices, stresses of the local education system and anti-foreigner sentiment regularly crop up in such forums.\n“Social media is something that can’t be ignored,” said Eugene Tan, an associate professor at the Singapore Management University and a former nominated member of parliament. “It’s an addition to what candidates need to do, and not just have boots on the ground.”\nLicensing Rules While Lee’s administration has sought to embrace the new media, it has also grappled with the virtual world.\nA socio-political site was suspended earlier this year for publishing prohibited material including inciting anti-foreigner sentiments and two of its editors were charged with sedition. Singapore in 2013 added more licensing rules for websites that regularly publish news on the city.\nA 16-year-old blogger was sentenced in May to four weeks jail for offensive Internet posts including an obscene image of Lee Kuan Yew, and anti-Christian remarks. Roy Ngerng, a blogger who was found to have defamed Lee Hsien Loong and is being sued by him for damages, is standing against Lee in his ward in the poll.", "external_links": ["http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pap-has-knee-jerk/2093894.html\\", "http://www.sbf.org.sg/\\", "http://www.eld.gov.sg/mediarelease/ELD_SampleCount_1Sep.pdf#zoom=100\\"], "published": "2015-09-11T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:21:54.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
