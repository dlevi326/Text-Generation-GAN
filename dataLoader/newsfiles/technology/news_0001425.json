But Ryder believes a South African team would be competitive in Brazil.\n\"We’ve got an incredible bunch of guys. Daryl would be the lead guy because of his experience and time on the World Tour.\n\"You’d have Reinardt Janse van Rensburg, you’ve got Louis Meintjes (both Qhubeka) … you’ve got guys who have done so well this year in the biggest races in the world against the best riders in the world.\n\"If you put a full team together, I really believe you’d have a solid opportunity to go top 10 and (then) … the podium’s not that far away.\"\nSA not good enough for the Olympics? But here they are with a sniff of making the World Tour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:08:42.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
