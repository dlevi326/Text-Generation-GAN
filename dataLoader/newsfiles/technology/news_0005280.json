If you’re one of the billion people who use Facebook to connect with family and friends, share entertaining memes, and pass the work day, you’ve probably noticed that the website loads nothing but a big fat error message. \nFacebook Error Message Received By Users On Thursday [Screen grab] According to the Independent , Facebook is unavailable on desktop and mobile versions, and on both Android and iOS versions. People trying to access the site are having a hard time getting it to load, and while some users have been successful over the past 30 minutes or so, others are still having difficulties. \nThose who have been trying to access the site without success have taken to other social networking sites (like Twitter) to vent. While there are certainly some people in an absolute panic, most are taking the opportunity to have a little fun with the down time.
