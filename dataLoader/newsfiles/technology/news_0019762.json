Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 14.\nThe Gozi virus was discovered in 2007. It stole personal bank account information of computer users while remaining virtually undetectable.\nBy the time U.S. authorities announced charges in 2013, more than a million computers worldwide had been infected, including at least 40,000 in the United States, over 160 of which belonged to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\nThe indictment against Calovskis was unsealed in January 2013 as prosecutors announced charges against Nikita Kuzmin, the virus' Russian creator, and Mihai Ionut Paunescu, a Romanian accused of running a service that enabled its distribution.\nProsecutors said Kuzmin was the mastermind of the operation, conceiving of the virus in 2005 and running a business that rented out the virus to other cyber criminals intent on stealing money from banks.\nProsecutors said Calovskis, who resided in Riga, Latvia, and went online as \"Miami,\" helped develop code that increased the virus' effectiveness by altering the appearance of banks' websites, tricking victims into divulging their information.\nKuzmin, who was originally arrested in 2010, secretly pleaded guilty in May 2011 as part of a cooperation agreement with prosecutors.\nPauneschu was arrested in Romania in December 2012. His extradition remains pending, a spokesman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said.\nThe case is U.S. v. Calovskis, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-cr-00487.
