Processes inside the chamber are protected with ULPA-filtered intake air, and the cleanroom or lab are also shielded from internal contaminants with the use of a second, optional ULPA filter. Air is not recirculated within the negative-pressure chamber. \nTerraâ€™s open-loop glove box features a brushless, electrically-commutated motor that does not release particles into the controlled environment. Glove boxes are available in a choice of cleanroom-compatible plastics, and come with either two (one-person) or four (two-people) glove ports. The back is removable for placement of equipment. \nTerra Universal Inc. , www.terrauniversal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:09:58.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
