This is because of the augmented reality technology that makes it possible to view the videos right on a coffee cup or a bottle of wine or any other thing. This makes an original gift idea where messages can be applied directly upon presents that are being sent. The gift recipient will be able to view the video clip using an application on a compatible mobile device.\nJust imagine having the possibility to put one’s self in a \"Happy Birthday\" or “I Love You” message for a special person and place this video on a T-shirt.\nSee How It Works in 3 Simple Steps:\n1. Download the Minute of Life application for Android or for iOS\n2. Scan the QR Code using the Minute of Life app\n3. Look at the Marker (picture on a T-shirt)\n(You can find the QR Code and the Marker at the picture attached to this article).\nCreating an Augmented Gift requires uploading or recording a video message at minuteoflife.com and then select a marker - this is a simple image that the recipient will scan using the Minute of Life app on a mobile device's camera to view the content of the message. Minute of Life offers its users a wide range of markers, which can be applied to T-shirts (both male and female).\nOnce the message has been crafted and the marker chosen, the user can enter the recipient’s data and send the present with the integrated Augmented Reality message on it. The recipient will get it in a cute box with instructions how to watch the video.\nRuslan Fedorenko, CEO of Brainberry Global believes that Minute of Life is revolutionary, but at the same time a very simple way to present and congratulate friends, family, colleagues and loved ones in two clicks.\n“First, choose a gift and then add your personal video message that will be viewable on the gift. So, the gift will \"speak for itself\" in the literal sense of the expression. Augmented reality gives a greater possibility to create valuable messages for different occasions in your life,” explains Ruslan Fedorenko.\nVisit minuteoflife.com to get more information and to create your own Augmented Reality Message.\nAdditional Information:\nMinute of Life beta version was launched in October 2014 and at first it functioned as a service of future video messaging. This idea finds its audience in the countries of Latin America, South Africa and Turkey. In less than 5 months the users of this service created over 141, 000 minutes of content: birthday and anniversary greetings, love confessions and even apologises.\nThe project belongs to Brainberry Global , a Ukrainian IT Company that has its offices in Canada and Cyprus and is focused on start-ups in the digital field.\nContacts:\nRuslan Fedorenko - founder, r(at)m2f(dot)ca\nHakan M.Sonmez - cofounder, h.sonmez(at)brainberryglobal(dot)com\nAlina Rodina - PR manager, a.rodina(at)brainberryglobal(dot)com\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12938814.htm\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bb.minuteoflife", "http://minuteoflife.com/ru", "http://brainberryglobal.com/", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/minute-of-life/id1024947450?ls=1&mt=8", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12938814.htm"], "published": "2015-09-03T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T09:39:04.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
