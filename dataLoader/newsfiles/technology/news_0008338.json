Does anything in this definition explain anything regarding the Economic Freedom Fighters?\n1. Court cases of EFF vs. Parliament and/or ANC\n Courts don’t just give a ruling, they interpret the law clearly before giving judgements and they do so also by reading reasons to all parties involved. Just in parliament only, the EFF never lost a case or won almost all the court cases it went through with the ANC parliament. There were about 4 or 5 court cases which the EFF won in a neutral court of law and the ANC never appealed most of them, why? Does this mean our courts are a circus too? If you think the 5 th parliament is a circus then the high court must be a circus too. With this first point, I see no entertainment here.\n2. The EFF wearing overalls and Gumboots in Parliament\nDuring SONA we used to see parliament that supposed to represent even the poor going for fashion show with expensive suits and people going as far as seeing designers to listen to same things. SONA was also shifted to 7H00 pm so that all of us can see this in the face of the poor. When the EFF arrived, this was relegated to a useless issue.\nThe DA in 2014 SONA even shocked us by wearing the same colour in a way of protest. The EFF did that to represent the workers and the poor. When one wears and expensive clothing and the other one decides to wear something that even a poor person can get at a very cheap price, how is that theatrics or circus?\n3. Nkandla debacle and Marikana massacre\nSome people even think EFF is about Nkandla and Marikana and this is simply because they are ignorant. No wonder they are excited because ignorance is bliss. I can ask them about a debate on mineral resources between Julius Malema and Mandla Mandela, even Stephen Friedman does not have any idea what that argument was about because it was in the committee.\nThis is largely because people only follow parliamentary proceedings when they want to see Malema speaking on Nkandla and Marikana. Stop following parliamentary proceedings selectively. Those are the two issues that I was promised if I vote EFF, they will be fought tooth and nail.\nHow does the prevention of a corrupt president who has no respect for law from addressing parliament be regarded as circus? Is parliament not a place to handle such matters? What do you take our parliament for? There was a good reason why Gwede Mantashe and some of the ANC members were excited to tell EFF and Julius Malema that parliamentary rules will not allow them to do as they like such as pushing corrupt individuals in the ANC to a corner.\nJulius Malema responded very well by reminding Gwede that he doesn’t know him well enough. They thought parliament will still be the same and today they were forced to change rules. How is that a circus?\n4. The manner in which debates are conducted\nPeople must learn to follow debates and listen to EFF carefully. When the likes of Floyd Shivambu, EFF deputy President, Hlengiwe Maxon, Sipho Mbatha, Reneilwe Mashabela, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and all EFF MPs are on the podium you will realize that even Jacob Zuma is not close to a match. I find it difficult for me to get comedy from issues the entire EFF MPs raise. I see no circus unless one provides me with some examples.\nDon’t let your hatred towards Malema or EFF give you some lazy analysis and conclusions of a circus. Please be very careful the circus might be your hallucinations. Better go for a check-up, circus might be in your own mind only.\nIf I was to say parliament is a circus then there must be the following or something similar to: a group of traveling entertainers, including clowns, acrobats, and sometimes animal trainers and their animals.\nThis is not even close to a metaphor, just pure laziness and hatred because if it was another party like DA doing what the EFF does, your circus results were going to be different.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:07:54.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
