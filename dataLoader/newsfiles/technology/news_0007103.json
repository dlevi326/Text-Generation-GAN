We are confident that high 4G network quality and wide coverage will secure customers loyalty as well as contribute to revenue growth from data services”. \nDuring 2014, Tele2 finalized its network modernization in the Baltic region and invested EUR 50 million in attaining the objective of the project – to create the most up-to-date mobile network in the Baltic countries. The modernization has enabled Tele2 to reach its goal to cover 90 percent of the Baltic population already now, which originally was set for end-2015. \nIn the Baltic States, Tele2 will further concentrate its efforts to expand its 4G network coverage along with increasing network capacity as both data consumption and the number of mobile internet users are expected to grow significantly. \nTELE2 IS ONE OF EUROPE'S FASTEST GROWING TELECOM OPERATORS, ALWAYS PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH WHAT THEY NEED FOR LESS.
