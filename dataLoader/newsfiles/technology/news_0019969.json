The picnic lasted for most of the day – incorporating food, drinks and live lectures. \nWT | Wearable Technologies hosted the German WT | Picnic. Orginally it was planned for the Munich English Garden; however due to rain we relocated to Hofbräuhaus (the largest beer garden in Munich). A small gathering of people sat around drinking beer and sipping soup.
