Reassure yourself Self-confidence and self-assurance, key characteristics of mentally strong people, helps people work through stress. \"They tell themselves: `I can deal with stress, and I'll be OK no matter what happens,'\" Morin says. 3. Focus on what you can control People with mental strength know when something is their responsibility. \"They spring into action and engage in active problem-solving when they can prevent and address problems, and they don't waste energy on the things they can't control,\" Morin says. 4. Know the source of stress A stressor is \"a situation that causes us to need to act and that can trigger our body's stress response,\" writes Elizabeth Scott in her book \"8 Keys to Stress Management.\" Identifying these stressors is the first step.

They take responsibility for their actions and don't blame others for crossing boundaries. 6. They spend time with positive people \"Social support is an important part of combatting stress, and mentally strong people seek out positive people,\" Morin says. 7. Prioritise tasks Time is valuable. Strong people are quick to scrap activities that bring them down and prioritise tasks to finish the most important ones. 8. Have fun \"One of the best ways to combat stress is to engage in leisure activities,\" Morin says. It can be anything -hanging with family, engaging in a hobby, watching TV. 9. Use health coping skills When dealing with stress, using alcohol, caffeine, or food would fall in the \"wrong way\" category, Morin says. Winners \"use healthy coping skills, such as meditation, walking, or journaling to deal with their stress,\" she says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T14:36:20.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
