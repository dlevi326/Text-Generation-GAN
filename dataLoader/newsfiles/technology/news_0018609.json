Apple said in August that the service had attracted more than 11 million members during its free trial period, a response that music industry experts called respectable but not overwhelming.\nIn Rogers, Apple is losing a leader with a strong track record of innovation, said Ted Cohen, a former music executive who is now managing partner of TAG Strategic, a digital entertainment consultancy.\n\"He is the smartest and most compassionate digital music guy I've met in my career,\" he said. \"I think it's Apple's loss.\"\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\nRogers takes up his new job at LVMH in October.\nWhile luxury goods sales globally have slowed down in recent years to around 5 percent annually, luxury online sales have been rising by more than 20-30 percent, albeit from a very low base.\n(Reporting by Astrid Wendlandt and Julia Love, Editing by William Hardy and Ken Wills )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T04:23:06.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
