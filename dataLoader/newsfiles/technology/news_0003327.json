The firm's investigation seeks to determine, among other things, whether the Company's Board of Directors failed to satisfy their duties to shareholders, including whether the Board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the Board obtained the best price possible for the Company's shares of common stock. \nIf you currently own common stock of Pericom and believe that the proposed buyout price is too low, or you would like to learn more about the investigation being conducted by Brower Piven, please visit our website at http://www.browerpiven.com/currentinvestigations.html .
