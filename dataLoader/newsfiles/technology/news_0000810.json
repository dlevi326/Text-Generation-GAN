First, if Iran abides by the agreement -- and this is a big if -- Iran will never obtain a nuclear weapon. Second, this agreement is not a bilateral pact between the U.S. and Iran. The other four permanent members of the UN Security Council -- Britain, China, France and Russia, plus Germany and the European Union -- are co-signatories, and the UN Security Council voted 15-0 in favor the JCPOA. Hence, the U.S. is in no position unilaterally to alter that agreement. It is also interesting to ask why support in these other countries is overwhelmingly in favor of the agreement unlike here and why, last Friday, the leaders of Britain, France and Germany all co-signed a powerful op-ed in the Washington Post reaffirming that support. Last, like the U.S. and 187 other states, Iran is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which guarantees the right of each signatory to pursue nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Treaties are part of the law of the land. Hence, anyone calling for Iran to forgo its nuclear capacity is either naive or uninformed. Iran will mothball all but 6,500 largely obsolete centrifuges, eliminate 98% of its enriched Uranium, and fill the core of its Arak Plutonium reactor with concrete. These actions block every avenue, called 'super highways' by General Colin Powell, to produce nuclear weapons material. This agreement can be likened to an arranged marriage between two distrusting parties. What is needed is a long-term regional strategy for implementing this agreement that includes a Plan B should the JCPOA fail. And a commission of distinguished Americans of both parties should be established now to oversee the agreement providing its assessment to Congress and the public on a recurring basis.\" Based in Washington, D.C., Ullman is a former naval officer with combat commands in the Vietnam War and later in the Persian Gulf. He chairs The Killowen Group that advises leaders of government and business at the highest levels, including presidential candidates here and abroad, through a brains-based approach to strategic thinking. Since the 1980s, he has developed a reputation as a strategic thought leader and thinker in the public and private sectors. He is known for the doctrine of shock and awe and sits on advisory boards for the Supreme Allied Commander Europe and Commander US Forces Europe. Currently a senior advisor to the Atlantic Council and Business Executives for National Security, he was a Distinguished Senior Fellow at the National Defense University and professor of military strategy at the National War College. A student and practitioner of global economies, he writes often on the financial crises in UPI and other media, and sits on the boards of both private and public companies in the high tech and financial services sectors. His latest book is \"A Handful of Bullets--How the Murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand Still Menaces the Peace.\" Contact: Ryan McCormick, ryan@goldmanmccormick.com \nPope Francis' Decision to Canonize Father Junipero Serra Jeffrey Burns Director, Frances G. Harpst Center for Catholic Thought and Culture University of San Diego \"What we celebrate is a man burning with missionary zeal who loved and engaged the native peoples of California. We celebrate the contemporary native Californian Catholic community, who bear witness to this complex history and are, perhaps, Serra's greatest legacy.\" Burns is a past director of the Academy of American Franciscan History, a research institute that studies the history of Franciscans in North and South America. He can provide a balanced and thoughtful look at Pope Francis' decision to canonize Father Junipero Serra.

Despite increasing graduation rates, not enough graduates are prepared for college or a career. We need innovative and forward-thinking solutions in education. Bringing together students, teachers and parents through hands-on, in-classroom programs and advanced technology applications, we can strength the education community and elevate our education system. I strongly believe in the power of parent and community involvement for a child's education. Involved communities contribute to higher academic and social outcomes, stronger values, and more successful lives.\" Bhatia's degree in psychology and education from Emory University, along with her training as a Montessori teacher and experiences as a Montessori child, power her passion for wide-scale education improvement. In the early years of her career, Bhatia spent time working in both the classroom and as a school administrator in several Atlanta-area schools. She was also part of the founding team of the Atlanta-area chapter of Child Rights and You, a nonprofit organization committed to addressing the root causes of illiteracy, poverty, discrimination and exploitation. As both an educator and a member of a nonprofit organization, Bhatia recognized that it is not always easy for parents to stay constantly engaged in their child's education, nor is it easy for nonprofit volunteers to be as involved with their causes as they would like to be. And so, in 2011, Alefiya founded Crescerance, which is dedicated to improving communication, increasing edtech engagement and growing communities through mobile application solutions and education. Through their programs MAD-learn and Embr, Crescerance is able to harness the mobile technology movement with education to offer applied classroom programs and custom mobile applications. MAD-learn is hands-on, in-classroom program that brings mobile application development into classrooms for students to learn programming at a very young age. Embr creates communication solutions for schools and districts through mobile applications to keep everyone connect and up-to-date.
