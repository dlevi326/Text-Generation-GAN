He is also the public safety and transport MEC. In terms of the plan, he will act as premier until the next national and provincial election.\nThe provincial cabinet will then be reshuffled to introduce Zikalala to government as an MEC so that he will be a “more appropriate” premier candidate for the ANC in the province come 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T17:28:05.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
