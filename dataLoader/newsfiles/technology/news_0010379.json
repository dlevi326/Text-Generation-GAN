Low capacitance diodes are integrated with an additional zener diode to protect each I/O pin against ESD and high surge events. These robust devices offer a benchmark-setting surge protection/capacitance ratio; safely absorbing up to 24A of lightning-induced surges while presenting only 1.5pF per I/O-to-Ground connection. This helps to assure minimal signal degradation. The array can also handle a minimum of ±30kV ESD, so electronics manufacturers can realize greater protection and enhance product reliability in the field. The low loading capacitance also makes the SP4044 and SP4045 Series ideal for protecting high speed signal pins. “Straight-through” routing allows these components to sit on top of the lines they protect, eliminating stub parasitic capacitance and inductance and ensuring higher signal integrity. \nTypical applications for the SP4044 and SP4045 Series TVS Diode Arrays include protecting HDBaseT, 2.5 and 5 Gigabit Ethernet, and 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports, as well as secondary protection for T1/E1 , T3/E3, and high-end audio-visual equipment lines. \n“These low capacitance, low clamping protection devices will make the design engineer’s life just a little bit easier,” said Tim Micun, product manager for the TVS Diode Array (SPA® Diodes) line. “By allowing straight-through routing, they eliminate complicated trace capacitance calculations and data reflections, and support high signal integrity on the ultra-fast HDBaseT, 2.5 and 5 Gigabit Ethernet ports.” \nSP4044 and SP4045 Series TVS Diode Arrays offer these key benefits: Peak pulse power (500W for SP4044, 600W for SP4045) allows far more headroom against electrical threats as defined by regulatory standards. High ESD and lightning surge immunity allow manufacturers to achieve ESD protection above the maximum level stated in the IEC Standard and protect against a multitude of other threats to ensure product reliability in the field. Low capacitance (1.5 pF typical) preserves signal integrity and minimizes data loss while offering a more robust device against electrical threats. Very low dynamic resistance (0.22Ω for SP4044, 0.3Ω for SP4045) produces low clamping voltages, allowing these devices to protect modern/small geometry chipsets against industry-defined ESD transients. \nAvailability The SP4044 and SP4045 Series TVS Diode Arrays are available in a 10-lead Mini Small Outline Package (MSOP-10) in tape and reel packaging, with a minimum order quantity of 4,000. Sample requests can be placed through authorized Littelfuse distributors worldwide.
