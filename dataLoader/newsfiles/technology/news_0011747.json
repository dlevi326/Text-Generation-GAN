(ATPR), a provider of technology based solutions for the real estate and settlement services industry, has introduced SmartFlow, a workflow solution focusing on the title agents and settlement services firms. \nAccording to Shannon Cobb, EVP for ATPR, \"SmartFlow is the first independently produced end to end workflow solution for back-office title operations. Leveraging SmartFlow, ATPR can take over all the tasks involved in a title back-office, right from order entry to printing the final commitment report. With its integration to the title agent's production platform, the final report would appear exactly as if it were prepared in the title agent's facilities. SmartFlow covers both insured and uninsured title products.\" \nCobb notes that \"SmartFlow allows title companies flexibility in their cost structures. Agents typically incur fixed costs, managing these tasks internally using a combination of systems and processes. SmartFlow offers them a 100% variable cost option through its customizable workflow and integration to the agent's systems.\" \nAlok Datta, President of ATPR adds, \"SmartFlow is underwriter agnostic and customizable, thus able to meet each agent's and underwriter's unique guidelines. Its ability to integrate with most title platforms provides even greater flexibility to the agents and settlement firms.\" \nAbout American Tax & Property Reporting, Inc.
