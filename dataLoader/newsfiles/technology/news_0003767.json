My favorite is at speedtest.net.\nI suggest that you run the speed test on a computer that is connected to your home network with an Ethernet cable so you get a true test of the speed. It’s OK to run the speed test over Wi-Fi, of course, but I think you’ll get a truer result from Ethernet.\nYou should know the speed you’re paying for, and it should be close to what you see from the speed test.\nIf the numbers are way off, your first step should be to contact your Internet service provider and ask them why you’re seeing a difference.\nIf you’re paying for 24-megabit-per-second service and only seeing 2 mbps on the speed test, it’s probably a problem with your provider.\nIf you’re seeing decent speeds from the test but still experiencing slowness, especially over wireless, your Wi-Fi router might be to blame. Try accessing the Internet with different devices (computer, tablet, phone) to see whether surfing is slow for them all or just one device.\nPower-cycling the modem or router is a good place to start your troubleshooting.\nMy Internet modem is also a wireless router, and I find I need to reboot it occasionally to speed things up when the going gets slow.\nThe easiest way to reboot is to unplug the box from its power supply, wait 30 seconds and plug it back in.\nIf there’s still a problem, look for causes of interference. Try moving the router to a higher place in the room or even a different room if you are able.\nI used to keep my router inside my TV cabinet but found I get much better coverage if I set it on top of the cabinet behind my TV.\nOf course, it’s better to set the router away from other electronics if you can. Also, microwave ovens and cordless phones can use the same radio spectrum (2.4 GHz) as your router, which might explain some intermittent slowness.\nAt my house, I purchased a separate Wi-Fi router to supplement the built-in router from my modem. My new router uses the 5 GHz radio band, which is faster and much less crowded.\nI connected it to one of my modem’s Ethernet ports.\nMy house now has two Wi-Fi networks to use. One of them is usually working well.\nThe bottom line is that you need to do some testing on each part of the connection, both inside and out of your house. You should be able to zero in on the problem.\nOn Twitter:\n @jimrossman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jimrossman", "http://www.speedtest.net/"], "published": "2015-09-13T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:47:18.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
