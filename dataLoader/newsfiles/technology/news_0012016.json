The event will be hosted by honorary chairs Nancy Dubuc, president and CEO, A+E Networks , and Neil Smit, president and CEO, Comcast Cable Communications . \nThe elements of Mission Media will cover all aspects of veteran recruitment and retention including: developing best practices for industry companies centering on the most effective ways to identify and recruit and retain veteran talent; training sessions for human resources managers in cable who are unfamiliar with recruiting and retaining veterans; virtual job fairs; an industry-wide mentoring program and a “fellows” program, both of which will serve to develop and retain talent; and partnerships with veteran-related nonprofits and government agencies. Mission Media will also serve as an umbrella brand for unifying the industry’s veterans hiring activities. \n“Veterans, reservists and National Guard members are imbued with the attributes of leadership, teamwork, learning agility and integrity. Attracting these talented individuals and retaining them in our talent pool will enrich our industry,” said Pamela Williams, CAE, executive director of CTHRA . “As witnessed by strong corporate participation in our Advisory Council, there is burgeoning support in our industry for the Mission Media initiative, and we know many companies will join in supporting the effort as we move ahead.” \nWith more than one million service members leaving the military over the next five years, and unemployment rates among post-9/11 veterans exceeding those of the population at large, there is an on-going public movement to rally support for putting those who have served into civilian careers. As a growing, dynamic industry, cable – with its nationwide footprint, diversity of companies, wide range of needed skills and positions at all levels – offers outstanding opportunities for veterans as they leave military service. Mission Media is positioned to be at the forefront of cable’s effort to address veteran hiring at an industry level. \nFor more information about Mission Media, please contact Pamela Williams , CAE, CTHRA, at 630.416.1166. \nAbout CTHRA \nThe Cable and Telecommunications Human Resources Association (CTHRA) is the premier human capital resource for the industry and a growing nonprofit organization with more than 3,000 members spanning 50 companies.
