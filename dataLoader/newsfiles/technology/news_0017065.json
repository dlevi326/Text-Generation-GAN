(Photo: Google)\n1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN — Google has responded to those who for years have itched to block really irritating people on Gmail with a new \"block\" button.\n\"Sometimes you get mail from someone who's really disruptive. Hopefully it doesn't happen often — but when it does, you should be able to say, 'Never see messages from this person again,'\" product manager Sri Harsha Somanchi wrote in a blog post .\nThe block button automatically sends emails from blocked addresses to the spam folder. It's coming Tuesday to the Web and over the next week to Android.\nIf you change your mind, you can \"unblock\" someone in settings.\nGmail's also rolling out the \"unsubscribe\" button to its Android app.\nThat button ditches email subscriptions sent to your Gmail account.\n //usat.ly/1Fdkjlr TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635785253688075301-block.PNG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Fdkjlr&text=Gmail%20finally%20rolls%20out%20%27block%27%20button&via=usatoday", "http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2015/09/stay-in-control-with-block-and.html", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Fdkjlr&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/58b367d0521c8a720f5a2c604ed8dd53f70ffa57/r=344x400/local/-/media/2015/09/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635785253688075301-block.PNG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/19964f243d99a1ccede743f1db987db3f7fe96ec/c=25-0-369-459&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/09/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635785253688075301-block.PNG", "http://usat.ly/1Fdkjlr"], "published": "2015-09-22T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:53:42.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
