Individuals were eligible if they had experienced a breakup in the past year and if both partners were on Facebook.\n\nThe researchers evaluated associations between factors such as attachment (anxious versus avoidant attachment), investment in the relationship, level of commitment, responsibility for termination of the relationship, emotional distress after the breakup, and seeking relationship alternatives.\n\nResearchers found that it is not uncommon for ex-partners to remain 'friends' on Facebook. This lingering connection -- as well as access to the ex-partner's post-breakup experiences via Facebook posts and pictures -- may encourage more surveillance of the partner, particularly in the wake of a stressful breakup.\n\nResearchers concluded that distress is positively associated with online surveillance of the former romantic partner immediately following the breakup, especially if the individual did not initiate the breakup.\n\n\"Since stress may trigger problematic internet use, psychologists may wish to assess for increased usage by their patients during periods of stress, such as a relationship's dissolution,\" said editor-in-chief Brenda K Wiederhold, Interactive Media Institute, San Diego, California and Virtual Reality Medical Institute, Brussels, Belgium. 6 things you didn't know you could do on Facebo... of 7 Did you know you can add a pronunciation guide to your name on Facebook? Overlay colorful text on the photos you post? How about mark the end of a relationship without your 500 closest friends getting notified?\n\nMany of these tips and tricks aren't well known, even to veterans of the 1.5 billion-strong people-connector and time-waster. Facebook is constantly updating its service, adding new features or tweaking old ones. A lot can slip through the cracks even if you are scrolling through your friends' updates several times a day.\n\nHere are a few such tips and tricks. More than 83% of Facebook's users are outside of the US and Canada, and they use over 80 languages to communicate with friends and family. That's a lot of people, and a lot of different ways to say your name.\n\nTo add a pronunciation guide, go to the 'about' section of your profile and click on 'details about you', (called 'more about you' on mobile) then 'name pronunciation'.\n\nHere, Facebook will offer suggestions for your first and last name that you can listen to before selecting. If none work, you can also type in your own phonetic pronouncer. Logging in from a public computer? If you don't feel comfortable typing in your password on a shared machine that might have malicious software, Facebook lets you request a temporary one by texting 'OTP' to 32665.\n\nYou'll get an eight-character passcode that works for the next 20 minutes and cannot be reused. Anyone who's commented on a popular Facebook post, or belongs to a particularly chatty group, knows that those notifications telling you that \"Jane Doe and 4 others also commented on a post\" can get a bit annoying.\n\nYou can turn off notifications for individual posts by clicking on the globe icon on the top right corner of your web browser, then on the 'X' next to the individual notification.\n\nYou can also change your notification settings here to get fewer or more of them for each group that you belong to.\n\nTo do this on mobile, click to view the original post, then click the down arrow in the top right corner of the post. You'll see an option to \"turn off notifications.\" Announcing engagements and marriages on Facebook is fun. Post and watch the likes and congrats roll in. Bask in the love and glory. Fast-forward a few years for some couples, and the glory fades, not to mention the love and marriage.\n\nIn this case, you might not want to announce the irreversible breakdown to 450 of your closest friends.\n\nThankfully, you can still mark the end of a relationship without notifying everyone. Go to your profile and click on the 'about' section, then 'family and relationships on the left'. Under relationship, you'll see a gray icon that probably says 'friends', or maybe 'public'. Change it to 'only me'.\n\nThen change your relationship status. After a while, you can change it back if you wish. Your hundreds of acquaintances will be none the wiser, unless they are stalking your profile to see if you are single.
