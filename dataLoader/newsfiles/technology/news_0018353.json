Active Listening also recently won the American Business Award’s People’s Choice prize , as well as a Stevie in the annual International Business Awards . \nInMoment competed in the New Product or Service of the Year – Software – Relationship Management Solution category against Dell, Inc., ServiceSource and Totango. \nInMoment’s Active Listening Suite applies text analytics in a unique, patent-pending way to get richer data and make the feedback process a more engaging, positive experience for customers. The tool analyzes comments as customers type them into an online form, and poses follow-up questions, encouraging customers to provide more details. Active Listening helps companies find the most valuable, actionable data, and build meaningful relationships with customers in the process. Last week, InMoment announced that Active Listening is now available in 90 languages. \n“We’re honored that the national and international business communities recognize the compelling value Active Listening brings to the market,” said John Sperry, Founder and CEO of InMoment . “For us, Active Listening is both a technology, and a philosophy of turning our emphasis toward empowering brands to truly listen. As companies rush to better understand their customers, many make the mistake of interrogating them with long, taxing surveys that focus primarily on what the brand wants to know, and not what customers want to share. Active Listening is about engaging with customers in a more personal and authentic way, and allowing them to share their stories on their own terms. The results have been stunning. Customers provide much richer insights to companies about how to improve their business, and feel more connected and satisfied. This is the type of relationship all brands should strive to create with their customers.” \nThe American Business Awards are the nation’s premier business awards program. The People’s Choice Stevie Awards for Favorite New Products are a feature of The American Business Awards in which the general public can vote for their favorite new products and services of the year. More than 16,000 votes were cast in 40 people’s choice categories this year. All new products and services to be honored in the ABA’s new product categories were included in people’s choice voting. \nMore than 3,300 nominations were submitted to this year’s American Business Awards for consideration in a wide range of categories, including New Product or Service of the Year, Most Innovative Company of the Year, Management Team of the Year, Best New Product or Service of the Year, Corporate Social Responsibility Program of the Year, and Startup of the Year, among others. \nFor more information about InMoment visit http://www.inmoment.com/ . \nAbout InMoment \nInMoment™ is a cloud-based customer experience (CX) optimization platform that helps brands leverage customer stories to inform better business decisions, and create more meaningful relationships with their customers.
