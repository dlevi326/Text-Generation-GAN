On the other hand I saw this coming as many articles the past weeks could be read but not commented on. And even if you could comment it was quickly closed off as well?\nWhat is the main reason behind this? Was it the article where the ANC said the media is only reflecting negatively about the current government? But is there really anything positive that the media can report on that all citizens can be proud of?\nI agree that your word choice should be chosen correctly when you do want to comment but then again you can not call a spade a fork. Hopefully some on in government will read the comments and see that most citizens has had enough of the crime, inflated petrol prices, inflated electricity, unemployment, government hospitals that are pathetic, schools going down the drain, ANC members constantly involved in fraudulent activities, cadre deployment and much much more!\nHow will we as normal citizens make the government see how we really feel, as parliament is such a circus at the moment no one listens to any one and no problems has been addressed there for months?\nThere has been comments that made me understand the thinking of other racial groups a little better as well although I might not have been happy with what was said but it is also evident that many black South Africans (born free's) has been brainwashed with what their comments are. Commenting is a platform for debating and a debate can have one winner or no winner depending on who speaks the truth and bring cold hard facts to the table most of the time.\nI feel people calling for the removal of articles with comments are those people who's eyes has opened up and they started to read the truth and they can not handle that, as it is everything they were taught was not the truth.\nBut then again stop the comments. News 24 will soon see the damage it caused and in this current situation with high unemployment no business can afford to loose clients.\nI was always under the impression a news agency is there for the people to keep people informed not to jump when the government demands it, especially not post 1994 and in a \"Democratic\" country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T08:47:26.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
