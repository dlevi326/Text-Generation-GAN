To that end, members of the department meet with companies to better understand the technology.\n\nGoogle and several major car makers have been pursuing autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nGoogle has been testing self-driving cars in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.\n\nToyota early this month announced plans to invest $50 million into building artificial intelligence into cars, an indication it could be joining the race to develop driverless vehicles.\n\nThe joint research with Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will take place over the next five years, Toyota Motor Corporation said, emphasizing its interest in technology that could be used by people as they grow old or become less able to drive safely.\n\nWhile the Japanese automobile giant did not mention making cars that drive themselves, it did promise work on \"intelligent vehicle technology.\"\n\nREAD ALSO:\nDriverless car runs into problem: Cars with drivers \n\nA Stanford lab led by professor Fei-Fei Li will work with Toyota and MIT to use computer vision, machine learning and large-scale data analysis to enable vehicles to navigate complex traffic situations.\n\n\"Our team will work to help intelligent vehicles recognize objects in the road, predict behaviors of things and people, and make safe and smart driving decisions under diverse conditions,\" Li said.
