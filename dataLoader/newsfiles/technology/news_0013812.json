Monday night, the latest in a string of attacks against the Internet's privately run backbone.\nAT&T is offering a $250,000 reward in connection with the latest attacks. AT&T's fiber optic network is legally considered a critical piece of the nation's Internet infrastructure, and any attackers are subject to both state and federal prosecution. The FBI already has an open investigation into 14 similar attacks on California Internet backbones since last summer.\n‹ FCC approves AT&T, DirecTV deal with conditions AT&T data breach revealed: 280K customers exposed › Livermore is a San Francisco Bay Area suburb that's home to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and many high-tech commuters.\nMore from USAToday:\nApple's iOS9 to bring better battery performance\nHP to cut up to 30K jobs from enterprise unit\nDreamforce powers Salesforce's market rise\n\"It's a serious matter and affects public safety at large,\" AT&T spokesman Jim Greer said Tuesday.\nThe high-capacity lines , which aren't much thicker than a pencil, carry vast amounts of data. Everything from phone calls to computer transactions, emails, and even the security cameras feeds watching the cables themselves travel down the plastic or glass fibers as pulses of light. The cables are the interstate highways of the information superhighway.\nThe FBI says whoever has been attacking the cables usually opens a underground vault, climbs inside and then cuts through the cables' protective metal conduit before severing the lines themselves.\n\"It's being taken very seriously by the FBI and our law enforcement partners,\" said Michele Ernst, a spokeswoman for the bureau's San Francisco field office.\nSecurity experts say the attacks could be the work of a disgruntled employee or of terrorists probing the nation's infrastructure to see how long repairs take. FBI officials say it's possible whoever has been attacking the cables is dressed as a utility company employee.", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/09/09/apples-ios-9-bring-better-maps-low-power-mode-news-feature/71894656/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/09/14/dreamforce-powers-salesforces-market-rise/71907298/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/09/15/hewlett-packard-cut-up-30000-jobs-enterprise-unit/72331176/"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T20:11:58.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
