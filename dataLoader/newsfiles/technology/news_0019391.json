In asking ‘what’s next?’ GMTT 2030 views itself as an aid to business, policy makers and society in trying to understand the future for maritime industries and oceans.\nAssessing 56 technologies and then focusing on 18 specific areas of technology, GMTT 2030 builds on the scenarios in Global Marine Trends 2030 and Global Marine Fuel Trends 2030 to provide insight into the impact and – critically – the timescales of transformative technology. \nLR was the lead partner on the commercial shipping parts of the report and focused on eight technologies that will transform commercial shipping.\nLuis Benito, Marketing Director at LR, said: \"The marine world in 2030 will be a connected and digital one, bringing closer integration between people, software and hardware in a way that could transform the way we operate. We know technology is changing our world and there is a great deal of overlap between technologies and how they combine will be important.\"\nThe report identifies two groups of technology drivers - those that will transform the ship design and build space – leading to advancement in ship building, propulsion and powering and the development of smart ships; and the technologies that drive safety, commercial and operational performance – advanced materials, big data analytics, communications, sensors and robotics.  \nTo read an analysis on Big Data at ports and terminals, click here \nThe report presents ‘Technomax’ scenarios for bulk carriers, tankers, containerships and gas carriers. The Technomax scenarios are not concept ships but give an indication of the potential maximum technology uptake relevant to the four ship market sectors. \nTom Boardley, Marine Director at LR, concluded: “Shipping is likely to evolve quickly now. That evolution is likely to be uneven but while 2030 is not far away, we think that shipping is likely to have changed significantly.”\n\n(Source: Lloyds Register)\nFor all the latest on shipping, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T18:31:11.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
