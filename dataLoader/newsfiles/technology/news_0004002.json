Typically, business users have to request reports from the IT department. IT, in turn, extracts the relevant data, loads it into a data warehouse, and runs reports using an analytics tool. This process may take days or weeks, and limits data visibility. \nIn contrast, Veeva Network Reporting empowers commercial operations, data stewards, and other business users to quickly gain insights into master data, without relying on IT. The new reporting capability benefits both business users seeking to optimize data for strategic commercial uses, and data stewards looking to diagnose the root cause of errors and improve data quality. Veeva Network reporting saves time and IT resources, while enhancing business agility. \n“Visibility into master data is critical as it can impact both speed to market and customer engagement,” said Eric Newmark, program director, IDC Health Insights. “The industry has a strong need for capabilities that give business users unencumbered access and reporting so they can rectify errors before the data is used in sales, marketing, or medical outreach to customers.” \nGrowing numbers of life sciences companies are leveraging Veeva Network to manage their master data. It is enabling more tailored and compliant customer engagements by delivering a trusted single view of healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations. \n“Veeva Network is an enterprise-class master data management application that is specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of life sciences business users,” said Dan Goldsmith, Veeva’s chief strategy officer. “Veeva Network’s built-in reporting capabilities empower commercial teams to deeply understand their master data, and to rapidly resolve problems that could prevent business critical projects from delivering maximal benefit.” \nTo learn more, join a discussion with Veeva Network customer Medac Pharma on Tuesday, Sept. 29, at the PDMA event. Glenn Tate, senior director of IT, will describe how Medac successfully leveraged Veeva Network to help launch its first product, Rasuvo® (methotrexate injection). Visitors can also stop by booth #111/113 to see a demonstration of Veeva Network’s new reporting capability. \nAdditional Information For more on Veeva Network, visit: veeva.com/mdm Stay updated on the latest Veeva news on LinkedIn: linkedin.com/company/veeva-systems Follow @veevasystems on Twitter: twitter.com/veevasystems Like Veeva on Facebook: facebook.com/veevasystems \nAbout Veeva Systems Veeva Systems Inc. is a leader in cloud-based software for the global life sciences industry.
