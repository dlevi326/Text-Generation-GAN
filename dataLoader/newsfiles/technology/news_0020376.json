(Nasdaq: VRNS ), the leading provider of software solutions for unstructured, human-generated enterprise data, today announced the interoperability of its DatAdvantage and DatAlert solutions with the leading Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform, HP ArcSight. \nThe interoperable solutions from this new technology alliance will be showcased at HP Protect 2015, HP's annual enterprise security user conference, taking place Sept. 1-4 at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Md. Varonis will be at booth #401. \nImmediate Detection Capabilities \nUsers will now be able to easily send alerts from Varonis DatAdvantage and DatAlert into HP ArcSight, and begin identifying statistically unusual user behavior, mass deletions and modifications, malware and ransomware infections like CryptoLocker and Cryptowall, privilege escalations, unusual access to PII, multiple failed login attempts, and many more potential warning signs. Installation of Varonis DatAdvantage and DatAlert can take as little as an hour, and connection to HP ArcSight is as simple as configuring an IP address. \nDavid Gibson, Varonis Vice President of Strategy and Market Development, said, \"Enterprises need to be able to bring together threat intelligence from many sources. With the interoperability of Varonis and HP ArcSight, customers gain unprecedented intelligence in the realm of unstructured data – which is the type of data they typically have the most of and know the least about. From initial reconnaissance through data exfiltration and attack obfuscation, Varonis and HP ArcSight can help organizations spot the warning signs before they end up in the news because of a data breach.\" \nOrganizations store massive quantities of unstructured data – files, emails, spreadsheets, presentations – comprising some of their most valuable and sensitive information assets. These assets are frequently stolen in high-profile breaches, either by insiders who abuse their access or by outsiders who compromise insiders' credentials. Varonis has helped thousands of customers protect their unstructured data, through analyzing user activity with files and emails, permissions and file system metadata, as well as file content. \nFor more information on Varonis' solution portfolio, please visit www.varonis.com and join the conversation on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and YouTube . \nAbout Varonis \nVaronis is the leading provider of software solutions for unstructured, human-generated enterprise data.
