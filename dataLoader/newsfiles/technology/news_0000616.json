The S&P 500 gained 0.3 per cent, after both indexes declined sharply on Friday. Earlier the Dow industrials rose as much as 194 points.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 closed 0.9 per cent higher, having fallen 1.8 per cent in the previous session.\n\"It's quiet,\" Brett Mock, managing director at brokerage JonesTrading Institutional Services, said, describing lower-than-average stock-trading volumes on Monday. \"There's not a lot of catalysts here for stocks until earnings.\"\nWeighing on the market were shares of biotechnology companies. Traders pointed to a comment posted by Hillary Clinton on Twitter about how tomorrow she will outline a plan to take on \"price gouging\" by certain specialty drug makers. Before the comment by the presidential hopeful, the Nasdaq Biotech Index was hovering around the flatline. Following Mrs Clinton's remark, which referenced a New York Times article published Sunday on a certain drug's sharp price increase, the biotech index started its tumble. In recent afternoon trading, the index was down 4 per cent.\nOther than biotech stocks in the US, markets generally steadied Monday after the Fed's decision last week to keep interest rates at record lows sparked a global sell-off amid fears about the fragile state of the global economy. Although rock-bottom rates have helped fuel years of rising stocks since the financial crisis, the Fed's reluctance to lift borrowing costs was seen as a reminder that growth in the US and elsewhere remains vulnerable to a slowdown in China.\nSome investors warned the Fed's decision and the uncertainty it brings has created a lasting overhang on stock markets.\n\"We're in for a period of choppy markets,\" Julian Chillingworth, chief investment officer at Rathbone Brothers, said.\n\"People are now going to debate whether the Fed does or doesn't raise rates this year. With that uncertainty, markets will be focusing on the short term,\" he said.\nGlobal stock markets fell sharply in August. Although they have since steadied, there have been some big daily price swings.\nIn the US on Monday, healthcare stocks lagged behind the broader market.\nGiven the scale of recent declines, markets are liable to stage short-term rebounds unless additional bad news on the economy arrives, according to Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, head of multi-asset investments at NN Investment Partners. \"Without [a global recession] one should also be aware that a lot of problems are priced by now,\" he said.\nIn Asia, most indexes fell as markets reacted to Friday's decline on Wall Street, the biggest one-day loss in two weeks.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.8 per cent and Australia's ASX 200 lost 2 per cent. China bucked the trend, with the Shanghai Composite closing 1.9 per cent higher.\nJapanese markets were closed for a holiday.\nIn Europe, markets were mostly higher, encouraged by Alexis Tsipras' resounding win in Sunday's Greek election. Mr Tsipras' re-election after agreeing a bailout deal may soothe tensions with European creditors that jolted markets during the summer.\n\"We are left with the same government that signed the [bailout] deal. The positive part of the outcome was the parties critical of Europe didn't really gain,\" Thomas Wacker, head of credit research at UBS Wealth Management, said.\nGreece's Athex stock index fell 0.6 per cent, but remains more than 9 per cent higher in the past month.\nFrance's CAC 40 rose 1.1 per cent, Italy's FTSE MIB was up 1.1 per cent and the UK's FTSE 100 rose 0.1 per cent.\nFor global markets, Greece's politics have been on the backburner since Mr Tsipras agreed on a new deal with the country's creditors.\n\"The only thing that would make it an issue for wider markets again is if the [eurozone] exit risk returns. We've seen with this government that things can change quickly, but as long as they don't go back on signed commitments, it would be surprising for that to happen at this stage,\" Mr Wacker said.\nGermany's DAX lagged behind most markets in Europe, rising 0.3 per cent. The index was held back by heavy losses for shares of Volkswagen, which fell 17 per cent after the US Environmental Protection Agency accused the car maker of deliberately cheating emissions tests. The company halted American sales of popular diesel-powered cars and issued an apology for violating customers' trust.\nIn currency markets, the US dollar rebounded from its post-Fed-decision losses. The euro was 1 per cent lower against the dollar at $US1.1191. The dollar climbed 0.4 per cent against the yen.\nIn commodities, crude oil rose 3.3 per cent to $US46.50 a barrel. Gold was down 0.5 per cent at $US1,132.20 a troy ounce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T22:06:38.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
