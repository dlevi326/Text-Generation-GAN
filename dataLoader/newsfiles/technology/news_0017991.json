Among them: a rule that would make millions more Americans eligible for extra overtime pay, and a guidance suggesting that many employers are misclassifying workers as contractors and therefore depriving them of basic workplace protections. That is an issue central to the growth of gig economy companies like Uber.\nA federal appeals panel last month affirmed an earlier regulation granting nearly 2 million previously exempted home care workers minimum wage and overtime protections. And last week, President Obama’s appointees to the National Labor Relations Board pushed through an important ruling that makes it easier for employees of contractors and franchises to bargain collectively with the corporations that have sway over their operations.\n“These moves constitute the most impressive and, in my view, laudable attempt to update labor and employment law in many decades,” said Benjamin Sachs , a professor at Harvard Law School and a former assistant general counsel for the Service Employees International Union . The goal, he said, is to “keep pace with changes in the structure of the labor market and the way work is organized. That’s a theme that runs through all of this.”\nIn one sense, Obama foreshadowed these efforts as a candidate in 2008, when he famously suggested that, if elected, he would aim to be a Democratic version of Ronald Reagan . “Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not,” he told a newspaper editorial board in Nevada. “He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it.”\nOnce in office, Obama delivered on that implied promise in a few critical ways, particularly his health care legislation. But throughout much of his first term, he disappointed supporters with his inability to pursue a larger progressive agenda and with what they saw as his insufficient focus on the balance of power between workers and their employers.\nLabor unions complained that he failed to throw his energy behind a measure that would have made it easier for workers to organize by requiring employers to recognize a union once a majority of workers had signed cards, rather than allowing employers to insist on a secret ballot election.\nLiberals criticized the pace at which Obama put judges on the federal bench, including the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which has enormous influence over federal regulations. And they complained that he failed to move quickly in placing appointees at agencies like the National Labor Relations Board, which went without two of its three Democratic members until well into the second year of his presidency.\n“They were very weak on getting people into their positions in the first term,” said Lawrence Mishel , president of the Economic Policy Institute , a left-leaning research and advocacy group. “They lost many years of potential fruitful activity.” (The White House says that the president was prompt in naming appointees, whose nominations then became bogged down in the Senate.)\nAfter spending several months in 2011 on a failed effort to negotiate a deficit-cutting “grand bargain” with the new House Republican majority, however, Obama did an apparent about-face, deciding that he would use every tool available to enact what he considered to be a bold pro-worker agenda on his own.\n“Perhaps the most substantively important speech of the Obama presidency was the Osawatomie speech in 2011,” said Dan Pfeiffer , a former communications director and senior adviser to the president, referring to a speech that December in Kansas. “It was a set of marching orders to the entire government that increasing income inequality and declining economic mobility are the key challenge of our time. Given the congressional gridlock, the president pushed us very hard to pull every lever possible.”\nSince he has not been able to advance legislation through the Republican-controlled Congress, Obama has failed to achieve a number of important goals, most notably raising the federal minimum wage. And many of the recent actions could be undone by a future administration.\nAt the same time, the economic and political forces pushing in the other direction have proved extremely difficult to overcome. From 1979 until 2009, the hourly wage for the typical worker grew about 10 percent after adjusting for inflation, falling far behind the increase in productivity, a measure that wages once closely tracked. After the recession, the median wage fell for a few years and then made up little ground through 2014.\nLiberals and union supporters, while applauding Obama’s record in the narrow realm of labor rights, complain that he has undercut workers with his efforts to promote global trade agreements and balanced budgets.\n“As long as the budget deal the administration negotiated continues to restrict domestic discretionary spending,” the Labor Department ’s ability to enforce the laws guaranteeing workers a minimum wage and overtime pay “and fight misclassification will be severely limited,” Ross Eisenbrey , a researcher at the Economic Policy Institute who was one of the architects of the overtime regulation, said in an e-mail.", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-04T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T11:25:48.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
