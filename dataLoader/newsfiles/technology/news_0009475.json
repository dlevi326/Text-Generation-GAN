The loss to her family was huge - her father and a third sister had been killed when Boko Haram fighters attacked their village in the middle of the night.\nThis is just one of the many sad narratives by refugees displaced by Boko Haram insurgencies in West Africa.\nFor the past two years, people living in the Lake Chad region have been exposed to violent attacks by the Islamist group, resulting in massive displacements and a serious humanitarian crisis.\nThe region includes western countries like Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad.\nAccording to the humanitarian organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the attacks have increased in recent weeks and the situation in several refugee camps in the region is \"becoming unliveable\". This is despite increased military presence.\nStatistics reveal that since May, violence insurgencies by Boko Haram have led to widespread displacements.\nThe United Nations Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) indicates around 1.4 million people have been internally displaced in northeast Nigeria alone, and around 170 000 people have fled to neighbouring Cameroon, 75 000 to Chad and 100 000 to Niger.\nSee the interactive map below", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:05:40.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
