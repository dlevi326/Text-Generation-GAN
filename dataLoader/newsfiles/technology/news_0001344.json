Thursday was the deadline for companies to decide whether to take the money, and agree to the conditions.\nIn all, the program should make high-speed connections possible at 212,000 locations that currently have no such access, the FCC said.\nAT&T’s participation is the second largest, behind Louisiana-based CenturyLink. That firm will be paid $506 million over six years.\n“Like telephone service in the 20th century, broadband has become essential to life in the 21st century,” FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in a statement announcing AT&T’s participation.\nThe FCC says broadband Internet access is almost universal in urban areas, but still spotty in rural areas.\n“Access to modern broadband is critical to life in today’s society. The financial support provided by American ratepayers through the Connect America program is an investment in the future of our rural communities that will pay dividends for all Americans for years to come,” Wheeler said.\nTaxpayers will pay AT&T $428 million a year over the next six years. In turn, AT&T will provide broadband service to customers in 18 of the 21 states it offers high-speed Internet.\nThe new service will carry download speeds of at least 10 megabytes per second and upload speeds of 1 mbps.\nIn Texas, the Dallas-based AT&T will use its $42 million per year to expand service to 98,000 households or businesses by 2020. AT&T will be required to have reached 40 percent of those sites by 2017, and add another 20 percent each year until 2020.\nThe FCC estimates that by boosting the service to 98,000 sites, the new service could reach more than 200,000 Texans.\nMichael Balmoris, an AT&T spokesman in Washington, said most of the new service will be provided by AT&T’s new fixed wireless service. That involves setting up towers throughout the new service regions and installing antennas and routers for each home or building to be served.\nThe new rural service paid for by this program is in addition to commitments the FCC required AT&T to make in return for approval of its merger earlier this summer with DirecTV.\nThe company said in a statement that it deliberated carefully before agreeing to take the federal money, and to abide by the strings attached.\n“AT&T is committed to rural and small town America, and to using all available technologies to serve those who live in hard-to-reach and remote areas,” the statement said. “In deciding whether to accept the funding, we carefully analyzed a number of factors including the regulatory obligations associated with accepting the funds and whether the funding makes deployment economically feasible.”\nTwo years ago, the company turned down a similar offer by the FCC because it said it was still evaluating its rural strategy. The initial phase of the program offered far less money and required carriers who took it to commit to providing much slower Internet speeds. Last year, the company changed its mind, and accepted $100 million to participate.\nThe larger, second phase announced Thursday will require much faster minimum speeds than the initial program and provided AT&T far more money.\nFollow Michael A.
