The state Department of Health and Hospitals said he died from primary amebic meningoencephalitis - commonly known as PAM â€“ the brain infection caused by the amoeba entering the nose that leads to the destruction of brain tissue.\nSmith's family subsequently sued the parish arguing that it was liable for his death, and the parish and the family settled that suit earlier this month.\nIn July, the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals announced that it had once again found the deadly amoeba in the parish's water system during testing in June. The parish currently is undergoing a chlorine burn, where additional chlorine that kills off amoeba is pushed into the system.\nIn part as a result of Smith's 2013 death, state DHH in November 2013 adopted an emergency rule increasing the minimum disinfectant levels required for public water systems, for both chlorine and chloramine, to at least 0.5 milligrams per liter.\nThat rule also raised the required number of samples taken each month for both chloramine and free chlorine systems by 25 percent, and it laid out a more detailed process for monitoring, recording and reporting the disinfectant levels of public systems.\nThe deadly amoeba can survive and thrive in water that has chlorine levels at 0.4 milligrams per liter or below.\nIn October 2013, the family of Jeffrey Cusimano, whose St. Bernard death in 2011 was linked to the same amoeba, settled its lawsuit against NeilMed Pharmaceuticals Inc., maker of a \"neti pot\" that the 28-year-old used to clean his sinuses with water, and Rheem Manufacturing Co., which made a water heater in his home.\nThe Cusimano family still has a suit pending against St. Bernard.", "external_links": ["http://abc13.com/video/embed/?pid=962666", "http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/general.html", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/31/health/brain-eating-amoeba-deaths/index.html", "http://www.gofundme.com/da2m8hj4", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Miracle-4-Michael/1458959324412570?fref=nf"], "published": "2015-08-31T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:55:19.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
