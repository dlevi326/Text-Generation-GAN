The streaming service’s new policy that extends unlimited parental leave to staffers excludes hourly DVD workers, according to SiliconBeat . The exclusion drew a small number of protesters to Netflix’s Los Gatos-based headquarters on Tuesday. While only about eight activists showed up to protest, they brought petitions with more than 100,000 signatures asking the company to expand its parental leave policy to include hourly workers at the company’s distribution centers. Company CEO Reed Hastings and Netflix’s head of human resources declined meeting requests with the activists, the report said. The activists were allowed to hand over the petitions to a company facilities manager and then directed to leave the property. Get A.M. business scoops.

The subscription streaming service launched the new policy in early August, only hours after the company’s stock hit an all-time high. “At Netflix, we work hard to foster a ‘freedom and responsibility’ culture that gives our employees context about our business and the freedom to make their own decisions along with the accompanying responsibility,” Tawni Cranz, Netflix’s chief talent officer, wrote in a blog post at the time. “With this in mind, today we’re introducing an unlimited leave policy for new moms and dads that allows them to take off as much time as they want during the first year after a child’s birth or adoption.” Tech companies have become increasingly generous with parental leave as their employees start to age. Yahoo gives mothers 16 weeks off, while fathers get eight weeks paid leave. Google gives moms five months off and dads seven weeks off. Facebook gives both mothers and fathers four months of paid leave. Microsoft and Adobe announced more generous parental leave policies shortly after Netflix’s policy change. But generous perks haven’t extended to hourly workers, a trend that has been a problem for those who provide security, food services and transportation in Silicon Valley. Earlier this year, shuttle drivers who transport staffers for Apple, Facebook and Google won a long battle to unionize and received a raise and more generous benefits. Other service workers are considering similar measures to bridge the wage gap. The median income for skilled tech workers in Silicon Valley tops $118,700, but low-skilled workers' wages hover around $27,000 , according to a recent report from Joint Venture Silicon Valley. The activist groups represented at Netflix on Tuesday included UltraViolet, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the Working Families Party, Democracy for America, Make It Work and Coworker.org. The protests come as Netflix makes its first move into Asia, launching in Japan on Wednesday. The expansion will test Netflix’s appeal in the Asian market. \nGet Silicon Valley  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:51:07.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
