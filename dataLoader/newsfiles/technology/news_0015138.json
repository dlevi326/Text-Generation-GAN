These two cloud services join Oracle's other iPaaS services, including Oracle Integration Cloud , which was announced in June. \nUsing the industry leading Oracle SOA Suite as its foundation, Oracle SOA Cloud Service is a comprehensive and unified cloud-based integration platform that is built for developers' diverse requirements. It provides easy provisioning, simplified management, automated upgrades and the ability to easily scale out, enabling users to quickly develop and deploy APIs and integration projects to deliver innovative services faster. Additionally, it supports hybrid integration with its deployment portability feature, enabling customers to easily migrate their integration platform from the cloud to on-premises and back again to support changing business requirements. The portability feature is ideal for organizations that want to move their integration workloads to the cloud, do dev/test in the cloud, but deploy production on-premises, as well as in instances of regulatory compliance changes where an application deployed in the cloud needs to move on-premises. \nAgility is key to surviving and thriving in today's business environment. While organizations need to quickly build or mobile-enable existing applications, integrate with the cloud, and connect IoT devices to existing systems to stay competitive, the complexity and scale of new applications is unprecedented. Organizations are increasingly emphasizing REST- and SOAP-based APIs as a strategy to mitigate this risk. Oracle API Manager Cloud Service enables developers to create new custom APIs and expose them to internal or external consumers in a secure way to help develop innovative offerings for end users. \n\"IT teams are challenged with long lead times required to provision an integration platform, which often has inflexible capacity, expensive manual infrastructure management, and time consuming maintenance activities that significantly slow the speed of innovation,\" said Amit Zavery, senior vice president of Oracle Cloud Platform. \"The Oracle SOA Cloud and Oracle API Manager Cloud services enable our customers to provision integration and API management platforms for developers quickly and simplify administrative steps so they can accelerate innovation.\" \n\"Oracle's iPaaS portfolio, which now includes Oracle SOA Cloud Service and Oracle API Manager Cloud Service, meets various integration requirements and supports multiple use cases that today's competitive digital businesses need,\" said Ravi Gade, senior director, IT Applications at Calix. \"It empowers integration developers to focus on enabling strategic initiatives by simplifying administration and configuration of the integration platform.\" \nOracle Cloud Platform for Integration The Oracle Cloud Platform for Integration portfolio provides a range of integration services developed for specific users that help simplify and accelerate integration of cloud and on-premises applications. With its simple, intuitive application integration service, Oracle Integration Cloud is ideal for Applications IT and LOBs integrating SaaS applications. On the other end of the spectrum, Oracle SOA Cloud was designed for integration developers and provides a full integration platform with fine-grained control and ability to support various use cases, including dev/test, lift and shift, etc. The portfolio includes Oracle SOA Cloud Service, Oracle Integration Cloud Service, and Oracle API Manager Cloud Service. \n\"With 88 percent of respondents to a recent Ovum survey showing inclination to adopt cloud-based integration platforms for appropriate use cases, it is clear that enterprises realize the need for an agile approach to hybrid integration. Digitalization and the need for greater agility at a lower cost of ownership are driving adoption of hybrid integration solutions with an 'SOA and iPaaS' combination being a preferred option. Enterprises should plan to distribute integration processes in a way that ensures efficient utilization of both on-premise and cloud-based integration infrastructure and operational spend,\" said Saurabh Sharma, senior analyst, middleware at Ovum. \"Oracle's unified iPaaS portfolio, which includes Oracle Integration Cloud Service and Oracle SOA Cloud Service, combined with its on-premises SOA Suite, enables users to ease the complexity of hybrid integration.\" \nOracle Cloud Platform Part of the Oracle Cloud , Oracle Cloud Platform is experiencing exponential growth and is already powering some of the world's most recognizable organizations. More than 2,500 customers are using the Oracle Cloud Platform. The Oracle Cloud Platform includes services for Application Development, Business Analytics, Content and Collaboration, Data Management, Integration, and Mobile. \nOracle Cloud continues to show strong adoption, supporting 70+ million users and more than 33 billion transactions each day. It runs on 54,000 devices and more than 700 petabytes of storage in 19 data centers around the world. \nAdditional Information", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:34:12.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
