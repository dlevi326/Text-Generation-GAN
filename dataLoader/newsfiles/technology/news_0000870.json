The 5,300 square foot build-out features advanced cooling and UPS technologies, and will result in significantly increased power efficiency, energy savings and competitive pricing for customers. \nThe upgrade was spurred by the addition of a new client, contact lens manufacturer CooperVision , which will occupy 1600 square feet over time. CooperVision has engaged in a 60-month contract with CentriLogic worth in excess of $3.5 million on co-location, professional services and dedicated network services. \n\"Downtime for us can equate to millions of dollars an hour,\" says Steve Baxter, global director of IT for CooperVision. \"We're confident that CentriLogic will help us maintain the strict uptime we need to stay productive while also getting the best return possible on our IT infrastructure spending.\" \nThe new space will deliver a PUE (power utilization efficiency) rating of 1.2, an 80% increase over the data center industry average of 2.0. This translates into a 40% reduction in cost per kilowatt hour of IT load, or approximately $400,000 in annual operational efficiency savings. To achieve these metrics, CentriLogic installed indirect evaporative cooling technology from Schneider Electric, which uses a combination of water, outside air and refrigeration to reduce energy use for maintaining the desired temperature within the server racks. CentriLogic also installed a modular, 500-kilowatt UPS system, which will enable more cost-effective, on-demand capacity planning for clients. \n\"This upgrade makes our Rochester facility one of the most sophisticated data centers in New York State,\" says Michael Ryder, director of facilities with CentriLogic. \"Indirect evaporative cooling is still new to the industry, and using it will allow CooperVision and other customers to grow vertically instead of horizontally, thereby minimizing purchases on additional cabinet or floor space. We expect other customers to benefit similarly from these improvements, as we move toward deploying this technology across the facility over time.\" \nThe Rochester site is one of CentriLogic's largest data centers, occupying a total of 22,000 square feet and servicing local enterprise customers such as Delaware North, Kodak Alaris and Bausch & Lomb (now Valeant). The facility currently employs 25, with plans to expand staff by 15 over the next 12 months. CentriLogic owns and operates ten interconnected data centers throughout North America, Europe, and Asia, and recently achieved five-year revenue growth of 1,217%. \n\"Our customers are growing their business with us, and in turn, we need to continue to make the kind of investments in our facilities that will deliver the best performance on the market,\" says Robert Offley, CEO of CentriLogic. \"We are also committed to upgrading our facilities in an ecologically friendly way, using technologies that minimize energy usage as part of our commitment to corporate social responsibility.\" \nAbout CentriLogic \nCentriLogic is a global provider of managed hosting, cloud computing, and advanced IT outsourcing solutions.
