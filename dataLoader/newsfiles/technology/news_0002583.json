Smart Cities are much more than just an effort by sovereign nations to modernize their infrastructure - they are a focal point for growth drivers in several key ICT areas including: M2M/IoT, Connected Devices, Broadband Wireless, Cloud Computing, Big Data and Analytics. Smart City developments are causing many technologies and solutions to integrate with convergence seen across with many resource areas including energy, water, sanitation, and other essential services. The manufacturing industry is rapidly transforming as technology, competition, and the evolving demands of global consumers dictate the need for continuously improving efficiencies and flexibility. The Internet of Things (IoT) will overtake human communications rapidly as there are vastly more objects in the world than humans, they can communicate much faster, much more frequently, and for many more reasons than humans. Industrial IoT (IIoT) represents a very important segment, which includes manufacturing, automation, and virtually any process or operation that does not directly involve direct consumer interaction.This research assesses Smart Cities, Big Data in Manufacturing, and Industrial IoT. Mind Commerce evaluates how Big Data is helping manufacturing sector to design new business models, revamp operational process, and facilitate cost effective supply chain solutions. We also provide key observations identified during the research, which provides information about perception and expectations of Big Data solutions in manufacturing. The report includes forecasts and quantitative data for Big Data in Manufacturing by sector, segment and region. Mind Commerce also evaluates the technologies, companies, solutions, and market outlook for IIoT. The report evaluates key trends, analyzes market drivers, and provides forecasting for IIoT. All purchases of Mind Commerce reports includes time with an expert analyst who will help you link key findings in the report to the business issues you're addressing. This needs to be used within three months of purchasing the report.
