I had thought that the SABC had hit an all-time low but this statement drags then down to an even lower level.\nThe ruling party and their mouthpiece, the sANC, are doing what all other communistic and socialistic countries do and that is to not encourage freedom of the press. One would never have to fear freedom of the press or journalists if there was not some form of skulduggery taking place.\nPress freedom is enshrined in our Constitution and your attempt to muzzle it will only encourage other media formats to bypass your self-serving censorship. Social media brought Egypt to its knees and there was nothing the government could do about it. Wake up and smell the printing ink.\nWhile you are at it Motsoeneng why donâ€™t you stop reporting on the weather as that encourages storms & rain. The same goes for sports and education; you would not want to encourage people to take up sport or become educated would you?\nLastly, stop reporting on Zuma as it encourages the current ruling party to plunder & pillage even more.\n1. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Crime-reporting-encourages-criminals-SABC-boss-20150902", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T16:05:08.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
