Mr. Shenping Yin , Chairman and CEO of Recon stated, \"The past twelve months have been difficult for us as our major customers cut their capital budgets, canceled or delayed new projects in light of slowing domestic production for oil and gas and plunges in oil and gas prices. As a result, we faced continued challenges throughout the fiscal year of 2015 and saw declines in overall revenues for the first time in the Company history. While the oil and gas industry is likely to continue to face multifaceted challenges in the near term, we firmly believe that we are well prepared to withstand the storm and to capitalize on an eventual recovery of the oil and gas industry.\"\nFY2015 Financial Results\nRevenues\nFor the Twelve Months Ended June 30,\n2014\n2015\n2015\n%\n(thousands)\nRMB\nRMB\nUSD\nChange\nRevenues\nRMB\n93,447\nRMB\n51,513\nRMB\n8,460\n-44.9%\nHardware and software\n86,229\n48,981\n8,044\n-43.2%\nService\n478\n104\n17\n-78.3%\nHardware and software - related parties\n6,740\n2,428\n399\n-64.0%\nGross margin\n34.7%\n19.6%\nNM\n-15.1%\nOperating (loss) margin\n3.0%\n-68.9%\n-68.9%\nNM\nNet income (loss) attributable to RCON\n807\n(31,456)\n(5,166)\nNM\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share\n0.18\n(6.45)\n(1.06)\nNM\nFor the twelve months ended June 30, 2015 , total revenues decreased by RMB 41.9 million, or 44.9%, to RMB 51.5 million ( $8.5 million ) from RMB 93.4 million for the same period of last fiscal year as a result of weakness across all of our businesses, particularly during the first half of fiscal year 2015.
