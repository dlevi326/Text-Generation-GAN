Gujarat crossed 100 crore mark in e-transactions on November 26 last year. Andhra Pradesh is closed second with 131 crore followed by Madhya Pradesh with 93 crore e-transactions. According to 'eTaal', a central government web portal that disseminates e-transaction statistics, Gujarat accounted for around 20.2% of all e-transactions (747 crore) recorded in all state governments' services in the country in last 32 months. Gujarat's share fell from 27% to 20.22% as other states have been aggressively adapting to e-governance. The portal set up by the department of information and technology receives transaction statistics from web-based applications periodically on near real-time basis. Gujaratis do it paperless and take to internet for all registrations be it land record or a new birth. Gujarat has recorded 151.09 crore e-transactions from Jan 1, 2013 to September 2, 2015 in the standard services provided under state government projects. This year alone, over 39.84 crore e-transactions have been recorded in state. According to eTaal (Electronic transaction aggregation and analysis layer), public distribution system, land revenue and utility and bill payments are the top three services which record the maximum use, comprising of 70% or around 105 crore of e-transactions in state. Gujarat is next to only central government in terms of use of e-services for governance as central government projects recorded over 250 crore e-transactions since January 2013. Gujarat government currently offers more than 500 services through e-governance. The government is also implementing 'mobile governance' across the state as an extended arm of e-governance. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=e-transactions,Department of Information and Technology  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T12:42:18.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
