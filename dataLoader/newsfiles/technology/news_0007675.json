ULTRA's testers, who have deep technical skills and heightened abilities like pattern recognition, are paired up with seasoned engagement managers recruited from top-tier digital agencies and software development firms. \n\"ULTRA is an amazing company with both an important mission and an innovative business model. Importantly, ULTRA delivers world-class quality assurance testing services that help Tribal New York exceed its clients' expectations. We're proud to have built a partnership that is not only meeting a critical business need, but is also creating a lasting social impact,\" said Rich Guest, President of Tribal Worldwide- North America. \n\"Our teams are 100% onshore, agile-trained, and consistently extend bug detection rates for our clients.

Up to one third of adults with autism have a high school diploma and in some cases undergraduate and graduate degrees, and yet 80% of the population is not employed due to challenges with communication and social interactions. \nAbout ULTRA Testing ULTRA Testing is a New York based company that provides high-quality software testing services. We deliver consistently superior results through onshore teams that include individuals with Asperger's syndrome and similar autism spectrum profiles, who can have heightened abilities that are an exact match for software testing; e.g., pattern recognition, attention to detail, and tolerance for repetition. For brands, agencies and developers requiring consistently high-quality software testing, ULTRA provides a highly responsive, competitively priced onshore service. For talent on the autism spectrum, ULTRA provides an opportunity to excel at their jobs in a working environment designed to fully utilize their exceptional talents.
