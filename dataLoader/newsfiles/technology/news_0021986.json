Produced by massive accelerating bodies, these perturbations are expected to be abundant across the Universe, but they are yet to be detected directly. \nAlthough not aiming at detecting gravitational waves , LISA Pathfinder will test the approach that could be used for this daunting endeavour. In particular, the goal is to achieve the best free-fall ever, reducing all the non-gravitational forces acting on two test masses and controlling any residual effect with unprecedented accuracy. \nLISA Pathfinder will operate from a special location in the Sun–Earth system: the Lagrange point L1, 1.5 million km from Earth towards the Sun. After launch, it will take the spacecraft about eight weeks to cruise towards its operational orbit around L1. \nFirst, it will lift off on a Vega rocket from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana, as shown in the left frame of this illustrated sequence. The Vega rocket, which is specially designed to take small payloads into low Earth orbit, will place LISA Pathfinder into an elliptical orbit . \nThe upper right frame shows the spacecraft riding the final stage of the Vega rocket, while the fairing is being released. \nAfter the final stage of the Vega rocket is jettisoned, LISA Pathfinder will continue on its own, as shown in the lower right frame of the sequence. During this phase, the spacecraft will use its separable propulsion module to perform six manoeuvres, gradually raising the apogee of the initial orbit. \nEventually, LISA Pathfinder will cruise towards its final orbiting location, discarding the propulsion system along the way, one month after the last burn. Once orbiting L1, LISA Pathfinder will begin six months of demonstrating the technology for future gravitational-wave observatories in space. 22 hours ago 15 LISA Pathfinder takes major step in hunt for gravitational waves November 15, 2011 \n(PhysOrg.com) -- Sensors destined for ESAs LISA Pathfinder mission in 2014 have far exceeded expectations, paving the way for a mission to detect one of the most elusive forces permeating through space  gravitational ... Ready for launch: Heart of space mission, LISA Pathfinder, successfully tested June 5, 2013 \nThe optical bench of the LISA Pathfinder (LPF) mission passed with flying colors extensive testing at the Institute for Gravitational Research (IGR) at the University of Glasgow. LISA Pathfinder: From CAD models to ready-to-fly hardware September 2, 2013 \nLISA Pathfinder space mission reached another important milestone: Its heart, the optical bench, was now further integrated into the core assembly of the satellite. Dr Christian Killow (Scottish Universities Physics Alliance ... Image: ESA's Vega rocket with IXV payload February 3, 2015 \nESA's Vega rocket, with IXV on top, now awaits its fourth flight with liftoff on 11 February at 13:00 GMT (14:00 CET) from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. Image: Optical bench of LISA Pathfinder March 12, 2015 \nAn intimate view of a key part of the payload of ESA's LISA Pathfinder satellite, which will be the 'stillest' ever flown in space – in fact, the distant-orbiting spacecraft is set to become the single most stable place ... Image: LISA Pathfinder electrode housing box June 22, 2015 \nThis photo, suggestive of an old-fashioned lift cage, in fact shows inside a much smaller enclosure: one of the electrode housing boxes that will fly on ESA's LISA Pathfinder mission, planned for launch later this year. The ... Recommended for you Distant planet's interior chemistry may differ from our own September 1, 2015 \nAs astronomers continue finding new rocky planets around distant stars, high-pressure physicists are considering what the interiors of those planets might be like and how their chemistry could differ from that found on Earth. ... World's most powerful digital camera sees construction green light August 31, 2015 \nThe Department of Energy has approved the start of construction for a 3.2-gigapixel digital camera - the world's largest - at the heart of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).
