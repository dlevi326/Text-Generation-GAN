While boys and girls all over Washington are kicking off another year of classes, however, far too many working adults don't have the education they need to advance in their careers or the skills and knowledge our economy demands to remain competitive. \nWGU Washington is doing its part to narrow the statewide skills gap. The state-endorsed, nonprofit university is offering the Back-to-School Scholarship to help professional men and women get quality, career-driven educations. WGU Washington will award multiple scholarships – worth up to $2,000 each – to aspiring students with some college experience who now wish to complete their bachelor's or master's degrees. \nThe scholarships will be awarded to as many as five new students who apply this fall to attend the nonprofit, online university. Unlike traditional schools, WGU Washington starts new terms on the first of every month, so it's never too late to apply for one of university's more than 50 bachelor's or master's degree programs in business, IT, K–12 teacher education or health professions (including nursing). \nThe scholarship will be applied at a rate of $500 per six-month term, renewable for up to four terms, toward WGU Washington's already-low tuition of about $6,000 per year. More information about the scholarship, as well as details about how to apply, can be found at washington.wgu.edu/backtoschool . \nWGU Washington uses an innovative approach to earning a degree called competency-based education, which measures learning rather than time spent in class. Students earn their degrees by demonstrating mastery of the subject matter they need to know to be sucessful — real-world competencies developed with employer input. Designed to meet the needs of adult learners, competency-based education allows students to take advantage of their knowledge and experience to move quickly through material they already know so they can focus on what they still need to learn. WGU Washington faculty members work one-on-one with students as mentors, offering guidance, support, and individualized instruction. While WGU Washington's degree programs are rigorous and challenging, competency-based learning makes it possible for students to accelerate their programs, saving both time and money.
