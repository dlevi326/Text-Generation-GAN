With the very vague information that was released about the drug controversies have become more and more such as the inaccuracy of the records of the trials done on the drug and the provision of false data deviated pharmaceutical trial protocol and the failure of those conducting the trial to protect their subjects’ safety.\nClinical research misconduct is not a new thing when it comes to seeking approval; and license from the FDA but with the alarming number of Xarelto users experiencing adverse reactions and untoward side effects from the drug it has compelled people to file their case against the company through a . These lawyers would do everything to assist the patients through the entire legal process so that they may be given due compensation for the harmful effects of the drug.\nIn the issue brought out by Seife he questions why the FDA has withheld these gravely serious proofs of by the makers and manufacturers of Xarelto; wherein fact they should be protecting the welfare and safety of the patients. However even if Xarelto has been legally distributed and used for treatment because of its promising effective therapeutic claims hundreds of lawsuits were filed against Bayer Pharmaceuticals and Janssen.\nThe case against these companies is basically about their and their failure to provide the public about the bleeding tendencies that Xarelto may have on its consumers. This has been evidenced by patients being discovered and diagnosed to have cerebral hemorrhage gastrointestinal bleeding etc; and for a fact this has put the lives of the patients who were given the drug in a great risk of fatality. And because Xarelto has no known antidote the effects of the drug could not easily be reversed.\nAbout \nXarelto Injury Lawsuits Info is an online resource center created by The Meldofsky Firm.
