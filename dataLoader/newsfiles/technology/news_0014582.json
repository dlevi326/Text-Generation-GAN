There might even be a field of dark wind-blown dunes, among other possibilities.\n\"Seeing dunes on Pluto - if that is what they are - would be completely wild, because Pluto's atmosphere today is so thin,\" said William B McKinnon, a GGI deputy lead from Washington University, St Louis.\n\"Either Pluto had a thicker atmosphere in the past, or some process we haven't figured out is at work. It's a head-scratcher,\" said McKinnon.\nImages returned in the past days have also showed that Pluto's global atmospheric haze has many more layers than scientists realised, and that the haze actually creates a twilight effect that softly illuminates night-side terrain near sunset, making them visible to the cameras aboard New Horizons.\nThe New Horizons spacecraft is now about 5 billion kilometres from Earth, and more than 69 million kilometres beyond Pluto. The spacecraft is healthy and all systems are operating normally.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T22:24:21.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
