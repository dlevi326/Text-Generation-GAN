Research recently released from an August 2015 study by Porter Research, and commissioned by medical claims clearinghouse, Navicure , reports that 57% of respondents are not on track for the federally mandated changeover on October 1. \n\"Clinicians don't have the time to learn and master the complexity of ICD-10,\" says ICDLogic CEO, Monique Fayad . \"They should not have to be distracted by becoming coding experts in order to get paid for their services. The software should do the coding. So we've created Cypher, an automated, functional learning tool that teaches clinicians the complexity of ICD-10 while they see patients, and simultaneously improves clinical documentation to protect against denials and queries.\" \nCash flow denial due to incorrect reimbursement code assignment was the single biggest fear practices cited in the Porter research. More than 94% of study participants expect increases in denials of payment, yet only 30% have taken steps to improve their denials processes. A June 2015 study fielded by the Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI ) also found nearly 50% of small practices were still unprepared for ICD-10. \nICDLogic's Rapid Readiness platform involves short video tutorials and a Getting Started guide that reside in its cloud-based Cypher software. There's nothing to download or install. Users rapidly customize Cypher for ICD-10 codes based on their specific medical specialty. Because Cypher is highly intuitive and built for speed and ease of use, physicians quickly learn to identify the most specific and accurate ICD-10 code in minutes. \n\"We have found that Cypher virtually eliminates ICD-10 training costs for clinicians based on consistent user feedback. More importantly, by automatically generating the most specific ICD-10 codes and guiding clinicians to document comprehensively, Cypher minimizes queries and provides protection against denials so clinicians can spend more time with patients and less time protecting cash flow,\" says Fayad. \"Doctors and nurses are entitled to swift reimbursement for the wonderful care they deliver, without having to become coding experts. That is our mission at ICDLogic.\" \nAbout ICDLogic ICDLogic builds intuitive, web-based clinical documentation and coding software that enables providers to easily comply with complex healthcare reimbursement regulations, and to receive timely and fair reimbursement for the care they provide. Focused on improving documentation accuracy and efficiency, ICDLogic's fast, easy and affordable tools empower providers to avoid lost productivity and protect cash flow by minimizing the queries and denials that are forecast to increase with the ICD-10 implementation transition in October 2015.
