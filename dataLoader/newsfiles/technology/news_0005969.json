RELATED BENGALURU: Michael Dell said the Indian operations of his namesake company was witnessing near unprecedented growth, and indicated that it was at least partly on account of the greater focus Dell could bring to its business after it went private two years ago. \"Last year (ended January 2015), the business grew 30%, the fastest growth among our top ten countries,\" he told the media on Monday on a visit to Bengaluru, where the company has its India headquarters.India is the third biggest market for Dell, after the US and China. NEW DELHI: Dell said the India business was growing four times faster than the overall market. He said that the company in India held the highest marketshare last quarter in servers, workstations and notebooks. Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake Partners completed a $24.9 billion buyout of the public shareholders of Dell in October 2013. Dell said being a private company had allowed it to focus on a three to ten year vision, instead of getting bogged down by short-term stock market and investor pressures. \"We have been able to build our R&D, our sales force capacity . About 20% of my time has been freed up, and I'm spending it on customers, products, team members. There was a 28% increase in the number of patents issued last year, and that's a staggering increase for a company of our size,\" he said. Dell's marketshare, he said, had grown for 11 successive quarters, and that this was happening for the first time in a decade. Amit Midha, president of Dell Asia Pacific & Japan, said there had been a cultural change in Dell and noted in particular that the speed of decision making had increased significantly .Dell is now focusing on the enterprise IT infrastructure and software stack, as also continuing with its consumer PC business. Dell said though the PC market was shrinking, his company's share within it was growing. He said there was a lot of scope to increase PC penetration in India. \"Only 10% of the households in India have a PC, compared to 35% in China and 64% in Malaysia,\" he said. Dell in India has significantly expanded the number of exclusive stores, where it sells its PCs, and plans to aggressively expand it further. \"It will be 825 by the end of the year, from 600 now,\" Dell said. Dell India MD Alok Ohrie had told TOI earlier this year that only Cafe Coffee Day and Bata perhaps have more stores than Dell. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Michael Dell,Dell India,Dell,Alok Ohrie Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T13:46:24.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
