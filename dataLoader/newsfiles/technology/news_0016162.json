Could not subscribe, try again later Apple iOS 9 will be available on every iPhone from the iPhone 4s to the new iPhone 6s \nApple is making iOS 9 available to download for free today - and the new software will bring plenty of new features to your iPhone. \nA new Low Power feature means that battery life will be improved and there's a host of new emojis you can use to taunt your friends. \nSome critics are complaining about a \" lack of newness \" from the new update - but Apple fans are already voicing their support on social media. \nHistorically, Apple's new OS sees a much greater adoption rate than the latest version of Android or even Microsoft's ageing Windows platform. \nUnlike iOS 8 which required around 4.5GB of storage space to install, iOS 9 should only come in at around 1.3GB. \nThat means that, especially if you've got a 16GB iPhone, you should still have some space left to actually install some apps. \nHere's a round-up of five of the improvements in the new operating system: Siri will proactively alert you Getty Siri \nEvery year Apple seems to enhance the iPhone's virtual assistant and this year is no different. \nSiri will now proactively try to help you by letting you know about traffic delays or upcoming meetings. \n\"iOS 9 can even learn what you typically listen to in a certain location or at a particular time of day, so when you plug in headphones at the gym or hop in the car before work, it can automatically display playback controls for your preferred app,\" says Apple. News and Maps have been improved Apple iPhone6 with iOS 9 \nApple is launching a news app that will replace Newsstand and act in a similar way to other news feeds like Flipboard and Feedly. \nIt will pull together all of the stories you want to read into a magazine-style aggregator. \nMeanwhile, Apple Maps has also been enhanced with public transport routes. So you can finally check the bus and tube timetables on the move like you can with Google Maps. Better support for Apple Pay PA You can now pay for stuff with your iPhone \nThe big news about Apple Pay is that it has arrived in the UK . \nInside iOS 9, Apple is renaming Passbook to Apple Wallet and has enhanced the app to manage even more credit cards and store membership options. iPad-specific benefits Apple iPhone6 and iPad Air 2 with iOS 9 \nIf you like your Apple gear a little bit larger, then there are some iPad-specific enhancements that you'll get from iOS 9. \nThere are new multitasking features for iPad meaning you can snap two apps together side by side rather than having to switch between the two - so that means you can watch a video while browsing the web or composing an email. Security and notifications \nWhat will make your iPhone more secure? That's right, six digits instead of four \nForget the old four-digit passcode. Apple is making things even more secure by upping the amount to six digits. That's on top of the fingerprint scanner available in several iDevices. \nAnd, for the first time, you can clear all the Notifications from a day simultaneously, rather than having to get rid of them on an app-by-app basis. Which is handy if, like us, you're really popular.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T02:24:49.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
