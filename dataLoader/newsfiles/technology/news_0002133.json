That’s especially true thanks to a new generation of home-grown geothermal plants, which don’t run off the steam of natural hot springs and geysers. No need to find those hydrothermal gems; today, geothermal engineers are making their own reservoirs by drilling down into hot rock and pumping in water.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T00:47:58.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
