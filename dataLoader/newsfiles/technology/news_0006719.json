They were a thing in America and they’ve now travelled across the Pacific just in time for Father’s Day. First stop: Nine’s Today Show.\nMy love is like a red, red bacon coil. Source: NewsComAu\nNow, it’s not exactly clear what happened on Today just then, because we were actually watching the tennis between Lleyton and Bernie.\nThe main points we could glean from the other screen were that Karl and the other blokerrific members of the Today crew were receiving what we thought were bouquets of flowers ahead of Father’s Day this Sunday.\nAh, but then they started eating them and it soon became clear that these were not ordinary flowers. They were in fact what local carnivorous restaurant chain Ribs and Rumps describes as “bloquets”, meaning bouquets for blokes.\nRibs and Rumps further goes on to describe “bloquets” as “delicious rosettes of rump wrapped in sizzling bacon”.\nRosettes. See what they did there? Nice work, Ribs and Rumps.\nYou can’t look, yet you can’t look away. Pic from the Ribs and Rumps Facebook page. Source: NewsComAu\nImmediately after viewing this revelatory television segment, we rang Ribs and Rumps, who’d you really have expected to have their phones on after the best bit of public relations ever. Sadly, nobody answered. Seems they are all pork and no talk.\nFor those who want to know how to make your own bouquet ahead of Father’s Day, we helpfully point you in the direction of a few blogs, like this one here , and this one , and this very helpful YouTube video.\nTwo quick things to add before we all race off and shape shreds of fauna into fatty flora.\nOne: News.com.au’s excellent lifestyle reporter Rebecca Sullivan just rather indignantly said “hey, not only blokes like bacon”, and she’s right. Women do love bacon too.\nSecond point: when you’re buying bacon for this weekend’s fatherly festivities, for god’s sake buy free range bacon. Pigs being locked up indoors their whole lives, in stalls they can’t turn around in, is not cool. Be wary of labelling too. Sometimes free range doesn’t really mean free range.
