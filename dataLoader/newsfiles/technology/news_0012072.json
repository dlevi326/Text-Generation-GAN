Thanks to a free trial from Scientific Learning Corp. (OTC:SCIL), educators can kick off this school year with a proven intervention that addresses the root cause of students’ difficulty, once and for all. Beginning this month, Scientific Learning isoffering K–12 public, private and charter schools in the United States and Canada a free, four-month trial of the award-winning Fast ForWord® program. \nThrough this trial, which is ideal for students reading below grade level, students receiving special education services, and English language learners (ELLs), educators will get access to the full Fast ForWord program for up to five students. Fast ForWord uses the principles of neuroplasticity — the ability of the brain to rewire and improve — to target the root causes of slow academic progress in struggling students and ELLs. After Fast ForWord, students can improve their language and reading skills by up to two grade levels in as little as three months. \n“This is much more than a free trial. It’s an opportunity for educators to help students make fast and lasting improvements in their language and reading skills, while simultaneously boosting performance across all areas of study,” said Robert C. Bowen, CEO of Scientific Learning. “Our results are demonstrated in over 270 research studies and we’re one of the only educational software companies whose neuroscience research continues to be published in peer reviewed journals. We’re offering schools four free months of access to this proven intervention because we’re confident they’ll experience positive results with their students.” \nAs part of the free trial, students will use the Fast ForWord program a minimum of 30 minutes a session, three days a week. Those who complete at least 50 percent of a Fast ForWord product will receive an automatic pre- and post-assessment to measure their results. Fast ForWord is accessible through a web browser or Chromebook, or on the iPad®.
