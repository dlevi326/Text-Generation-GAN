That says it all about this high-style, high-tech, highly personal device.\n\"It's a worthy winner of the 2015 gadget of the year.\"\nThis year's outstanding achievement award went to Palmer Luckey, the inventor of the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset.\nSince creating the first prototype six years ago, Luckey's company has been bought by Facebook for a reported $US2 billion ($A2.79 billion).\n\"I really love getting awards, but it's way cooler to see how people respond to what we make,\" Luckey said.\n\"When we go to a show and people go 'wow this is incredible', that's really cool. I feel like this reward is a reflection of that.\"\nOther winners on the night included BMW, whose i8 won car of the year, while LG beat Samsung to the TV of the year prize.\nAmazon's Instant Video also beat streaming rival Netflix to the entertainment award.\nTo mark the launch of Windows 10 this year, Microsoft Windows was named as the T3 hall of fame entrant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:19:35.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
