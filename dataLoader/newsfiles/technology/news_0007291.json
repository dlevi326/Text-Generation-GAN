The representation of women it hopes to have is within reach. For instance, it is targeting 35 per cent female representation in its global staff, up from 34% currently. It wants women to hold 16 per cent of tech jobs, up from 13 per cent now, and a quarter of its leadership positions, up from 22 per cent now.\nTwitter has a bigger gap to breach for under-represented minorities in leadership roles in the US. By next year, it wants 6 per cent of domestic leadership roles to be filled by under-represented minorities, who are not white or Asian. There are currently zero, a drop from 4 per cent last year.\nThe company considered factors like US Census data, Department of Labor statistics, the matriculation rates of under-represented minorities at domestic colleges, industry peers and internal data in coming up with the target figures.\nTwitter’s diversity goals come amid ongoing criticism that tech companies aren’t doing enough to address the problem of low diversity. Last year, companies such as Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. began releasing information about the makeup of their workforces. Now, Twitter has joined Pinterest Inc. as one of the first companies to announce diversity goals.\nFor the most part, Twitter’s workforce portrait still looks mostly white and male. Asians comprise about a third of its domestic employees. But in the past year, the percentage of women in its workforce and in tech jobs increased. In the US, however, under-represented minorities such as blacks and Hispanics fell to 10 per cent, down from 12 per cent the previous year. Twitter aims to increase that to 11 per cent by next year.\nIts overall workforce has grown significantly, to 4,100 at the end of June from 3,300 in the same period a year earlier.\nIn a company blog post, Twitter said it will partner with organisations that offer career guidance to under-represented minorities, be present at historically black colleges and Hispanic-serving institutions, and work on its recruiting and hiring tactics to attract a more diverse pool of candidates. For instance, it has been mindful that its job descriptions appeal to a broader range applicants, interview panels are diverse and job postings are available in places where under-represented prospective candidates will see them.\nWall Street Journal.", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/news/technology"], "published": "2015-08-31T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T06:33:15.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
