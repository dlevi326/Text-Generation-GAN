The videos highlight how a relocation company, a security solutions provider and a social services agency have leveraged AT&T Mobile Forms, powered by ProntoForms, to improve their operations and reduce costs. ProntoForms helps accelerate the sales of Microsoft Windows mobile devices and Cloud services because the platform is rapid to deploy and allows for easy configuring of business data routing to the Cloud. \nHeadquartered in Montgomeryville, PA, Movers Specialty Service is the nation's largest executive relocation mover. AT&T Mobile Forms has accelerated customer billing by 24 hours and reduced costs in the billing department. Management now has greater visibility into the work performed by its contractors, who no longer have to spend several hours every night completing and faxing paperwork. \nLocated in Memphis, TN, Dillard Door provides complete commercial security solutions, from security doors to cameras to alarm systems. Prior to AT&T Mobile Forms, field technicians filled out work and time sheets exclusively on paper forms, which did not reach the office until the following day. With AT&T Mobile Forms, as soon as a form is completed, it is submitted to the office, empowering management with real-time business data and visibility of field operations. The solution has also eliminated delays in the customer billing cycle, allowing Dillard Door to bill customers two to three days faster. \nFeatherfist helps Chicago's homeless community advance toward self-sufficiency and residential stability by providing transitional and permanent housing. This not-for-profit relied on manual paper-based processes to collect vital information on homeless clients, leading to substantial lags in data entry, which impacted how rapidly the agency could assign housing. Featherfist now efficiently captures information about clients and their housing requirements on mobile devices in the field. This data is immediately submitted to the office so appropriate housing can be identified. AT&T Mobile Forms empowers Featherfist to more rapidly match housing to homeless people, eliminating delays that can have substantial health and emotional impacts on the agency's patrons. \n\"These stories are powerful examples of how diverse types of businesses can benefit from mobilizing organizational processes and how our solution is robust enough for large enterprises yet simple enough for small community organizations,\" said Alvaro Pombo, ProntoForms Founder and CEO. \"It's inspiring to see how these people have transformed their organizations with mobility. We're honored to have documented these stories in collaboration with AT&T and Microsoft.\" \nSee our customers tell their own success stories at http://mobileforms.att.com/customer-solutions/client-videos . \nAbout ProntoForms \nProntoForms is a mobile workflow platform used by more than 3,500 businesses to collect and analyze field data with smartphones and tablets.
