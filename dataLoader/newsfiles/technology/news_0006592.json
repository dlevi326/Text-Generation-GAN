Furthermore, core voice and messaging services are becoming increasingly marginalized. As fourth generation (4G) cellular via LTE is optimized globally via LTE Advanced (LTE-A), raw data services are next to realize ever shrinking margins. Recognizing this issue, certain leading CSPs offer telecom data Business-to-Business (B2B) services in a Data as a Service (DaaS) basis to various third party companies such as Over-the-Top (OTT) application providers. Telecom data is provided over Application Programming Interfaces (API) from various CSP databases including number portability, messaging, location, and subscriber databases to name a few. Enterprise customers, OTT players, and others pay CSPs for data in a DaaS business model. This model is expected to expand globally beyond the current large CSPs to smaller CSPs, many of which are located in developing countries. Additionally, Mind Commerce anticipates the coming of a Telecom API enabled Application Marketplace. This marketplace will be in many ways similar to those of Google and Apple with the key difference that apps rely upon CSP data delivered via APIs in a DaaS B2B business model. Finally, we see CSPs ultimately realizing that they must embrace the app marketplace to offer their own Value-added Service (VAS) apps, which they will initially target for their most important customers: enterprise.This research evaluates CSP B2B data services opportunities.
