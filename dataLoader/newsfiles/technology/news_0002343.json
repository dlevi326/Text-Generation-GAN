RELATED Giving public transport the cold shoulder, working professionals travelling from Ghaziabad and Meerut to Noida are carpooling to work, thanks to the many ride-sharing apps launched recently. Young working professionals living in Meerut or Ghaziabad and working in Noida have had their fair share of bus and train rides, as they commute every day from home to work and back. And no matter how back-breaking the bus rides are, you can't help but grin and bear it. After all, who can afford to spend half the salary on cabs, and that too at a beginner's pay? But thanks to a number of ride-sharing and car-rental apps and online portals, many commuters are giving bus journeys a miss and carpooling to work. All they have to do is post about their trip on these online forums, and others looking to share the ride can contact the person directly. Ride-sharing services say that the trend is fast catching up among Noida's working lot. Carpooling works best for long distance journeys While carpooling and ride-sharing is not new as a concept, it has seen a new lease of life with the launch of these services that enable users to connect online. An official from Ridingo, which was launched in February this year, says, \"In terms of usage of ride-sharing services, the satellite towns of NCR almost rival Delhi. This is because of the lack of proper public transport facilities in the cities. Someone travelling to Ghaziabad from Noida, after a long day at work, would want his/her journey to be comfortable - something that you can't get in inter-city buses. So, young office-goers are increasingly opting to share car rides with others travelling on the same route. And they can easily connect to other individuals via ride-sharing apps and websites. A car journey is much more convenient than a bus ride, especially for long distances.\" Greg Moran, CEO and co-founder, Zoomcar, says, \"In India, ride sharing is still largely in its infancy but an increasing number of commuters going to a similar end location have started opting for car-pooling instead of public transport now. It has a particular relevance for the NCR region given that young professionals in satellite towns travel long distances on a daily basis for work. We have seen that while car-pooling was always a viable option in the region, many commuters stayed away as they did not know how to connect to these individuals. These services have now given them the required platform. The trend is even helping allied services like self-drive rentals where one can hire a car for a day and then share a ride.\" Noida commuters travel to Chandigarh, Jaipur and West UP cities Data from ride-sharing services shows that the most visited destinations by commuters from Noida are Chandigarh, Jaipur and West UP cities such as Agra and Meerut. They say that most of these are professionals returning to their hometowns over weekends and vacations, while others are daily commuters. Raghav Gupta, India country manager, BlaBlaCar, says, \"People are making frequent trips to their hometowns at affordable prices through ride-sharing in this region. This service benefits everyone who needs to travel by helping them cut costs, reduce traffic congestion and minimize their carbon footprint, while meeting like-minded people. For the occasional or weekly travellers, the most travelled cities from Noida are Chandigarh, Jaipur, Agra, Dehradun, and Meerut. Daily commuters usually go to nearby cities like Meerut and Ghaziabad.\" Carpooling is reliable, cheaper and comfortable: Commuters Regular commuters say that in the absence of reliable and cheap means of transportation in the region, carpooling is a natural option. The only reason it has picked up now despite being a viable option for several years is that people have started using apps as the platform they need to meet people they can carpool with. Rajesh Varma, who travels from Ghaziabad to Noida every day, says, \"I started working in Noida five years ago but wasn't staying there. Initially, I tried driving to work, but every trip used to cost me around Rs 400-450. Carpooling is not very popular or prevalent and I didn't know any other people who travelled to Noida so I used to take private buses. But they are very unreliable in terms of time. Earlier this year I heard about ride-sharing apps through which I got in touch with people who take the same route as I do. This gives me the option of travelling in a car instead of a crowded bus and the cost is shared among three to four people, which costs around Rs 150-200 per day, which is quite pocket-friendly.\" Dinesh Singh, a Meerut-based engineer who works in Noida Sector 16, says, \"People who work in Delhi have the option of taking the train, but that's not an option for those who work in Noida since there is no station here. I have been travelling to NCR from Meerut for 10 years and have just started carpooling. Though some people might feel a bit weird or even unsafe sharing a car with strangers, but most people are working professionals in MNCs, so it's more or less people from similar backgrounds, which makes it comfortable.\" Carpooling safer than over-crowded buses: Female commuters Raksha, a software professional who commutes between Meerut and Noida every week, says, \"I'm not saying that travelling in crowded buses is easy for men, but for women, the inconvenience is double. There are many instances in which people try to take advantage of the fact that the bus is so crowded and you cannot always fight everyone. Isse toh apne car mein travel karna is better. I've been carpooling with other girls I met through an app for two months now. The ride itself is fun apart from being safe, convenient and economical.\" Neerja, who works in a hospital in Sector 62, adds, \"I commute between Meerut and Noida daily. My job doesn't have fixed timings, so I get free quite late in the evening at times and travelling back to Meerut is quite impractical and unsafe. Fortunately, I came across other women from Noida through a ride-sharing app, many of whom travel around the same time in their cars. I always opt for ride-sharing with other female commuters when it gets late. And a one-way trip costs just over Rs100, which is not much more than the price of a bus ticket between Meerut and Noida. You get the comfort of an AC car along with safety at that price; I would say it's a fair deal.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:47:05.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
