Every piece of programming goes through cycles of review and revision; it’s sent to journalists for promotion; to partners overseas and at every transfer security and usage rights need to be enforced. And ever file has to be archived and made accessible for future use. \nTo manage its video content Foxtel has outsou rced and streamlined parts of the process using the cloud-based Media Room system from Australian company, Silver Trak. \nSilver Trak’s Media Room smart media storage, management and delivery service is used by some of Australia’s largest free to air broadcasters, streaming companies and content providers including Foxtel, Transmission Films and Entertainment One. Media Room addresses the specific needs of any broadcaster, production house, post production house or distributor who has media assets they want to store, manage and deliver from the convenience of any web connected device. In simple terms it gives the user 100% control over their assets and the ability to use Silver Trak’s services such as QC, file storage or Aspera fasp ™ high speed data transfers without paying any licence fees and without lea ving the comfort of their seat. \nMedia Room enables Foxtel’s production department and the production houses that develop and supply programming to easily share content and deliver it other parties, such as to journalists for review. Previously journalists were sent DVDs by courier. \nFoxtel Networks Australia Head of Content Operations , Rachel Thorley, said: “Media Room has been custom-built to Foxtel’s requirements. It’s simple to use and as it is completely outsourced, does not require additional hardware or storage. The seamless flow of content enabled by Media Room saves us time and money, which has helped us to be more efficient. ” \nShe added: “ Media Room also allows the creation of programming campaigns and distribution to external publicity parties with the added bonus of easily viewed usage statistics. In addition, Silver Trak's sales, service and support that backs up Media Room is excellent.” \nMedia Room’s latest feature is the system’s unique per-campaign per-delivery watermarking solution which enables users to upload their own watermarks and apply them in campaigns and deliveries. This new level of security sits alongside the already successful HLS-encrypted screeners and passcode protection offered by Media Room. \nMedia Room’s offering doesn’t end with storage and management of media assets. The system has been designed to allow for assets to be viewed in customised ‘media rooms’ where users can decide on access \nand viewing rights thereby enabling a personalised viewing service for their clients. Once viewed the assets can also be delivered anywhere in the world at the click of a button. Assets are automatically transcoded into five proxies and data selection is automated for any browser enabling a superior viewing experience irrespective of viewing device or speed of Internet access. \nSilver Trak managing director, Christian Christiansen said that Media Room was unlike any other asset management and delivery service. “All assets are stored redundantly and all are easily accessible at any time. This means all our clients can upload, view, amend and deliver those assets 24/7. No one need be restricted any longer by office hours, plane schedules or expensive courier deliveries.” \nHe added: “All assets are quality controlled via the industry-renowned Interra Baton system with the quality control reports readily available. When you’re ready you can send proxies as well as the high res olution assets using the infrastructure we’ve built on the world-class and industry standard Aspera platform. It really is as easy as that.” \nMedia Room is accessed via a secure web portal that is very easy to use. It allows Foxtel staff to stream content directly from the cloud to any internet-enabled desktop, tablet or smartphone, anywhere in the world . And it automatically configures the file for optimal viewing on whatever device is being used. \nMedia Room also provides many useful tools for managing large numbers of content files. Users can search on any part of a file name, extension or custom ID tag, and add their own searchable metadata tags. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T08:31:31.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
