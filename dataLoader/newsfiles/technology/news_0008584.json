Despite its steady output of superquick, technologically savvy bikes, the firm has never lost touch with its heritage – and this model is a proper classic. Paris Cycles was originally started in the 1940s by Harry Rensch, a friend and neighbour of Monty Young, Condor’s founder. Harry’s lightweight thoroughbreds soon became famous for their racing results and continental flair. Condor has now dug into its archives and recreated the Paris using today’s research and materials but staying true to the original design and celebrated colours. It’s not cheap, mind, but the marriage of retro styling and modern rideability will be irresistible for old-school race romantics ( condorcycles.com ).\nEmail Martin at martin.love@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter at @MartinLove166", "external_links": ["http://www.condorcycles.com/SALE/28896-Paris-Road-Frameset/flypage.tpl.html", "https://twitter.com/martinlove166?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"], "published": "2015-09-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T09:55:13.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
