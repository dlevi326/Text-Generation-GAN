Dubbed the LS7, the 7.0L engine was rated at 505 horsepower and 475 lb.-ft. of torque. JBA Headers created a pair of Long Tube Headers to squeeze even more performance out of the Vette’s LS7.\nThe stainless steel headers feature large diameter, mandrel-bent tubing to ensure unrestricted exhaust flow. Oversized exhaust ports promote more efficient cylinder evacuation. Exhaust gasses pass through the 1.875 inch primaries into JBA’s patented Firecone collector. The headers’ 4-2-1 design maximizes scavenging for greatly improved exhaust flow over stock.\nJBA Headers designed these headers specifically for the 2006-13 Corvette equipped with an LS7. That means the headers will fit snugly under the hood, with no installation headaches or hurried fabrication. Each header boasts a beefy 3/8 inch thick flange, to resist warping and distortion.\nPowerNation TV’s Engine Power team installed a set of JBA Long Tube Headers in a Corvette Z06 during its \"Hellion Mustang\" episode.\nJBA makes long tube headers for over two dozen vehicles, including:\n2011-14 Ford Mustang 5.0L\n2011-15 Dodge/Ram 5.7L\n2005-14 Toyota Tundra 5.7L\nCLICK HERE TO SEE A PAIR OF JBA LONG TUBE HEADERS ON EPISODE 17 OF POWERNATION TV'S ENGINE POWER.\nCLICK HERE TO SEE ALL THE JBA LONG TUBE HEADERS AT SUMMIT RACING.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12941563.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12941563.htm", "http://www.summitracing.com/oh/search/brand/jba-headers/product-line/jba-headers-long-tube-headers/", "http://powernationtv.com/episode/EP2015-16/hellion-mustang"], "published": "2015-09-03T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T09:39:05.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
