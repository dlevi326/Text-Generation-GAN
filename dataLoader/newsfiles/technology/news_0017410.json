ICD-10 shortens the traditional SOAP note by shifting major parts of data in the traditional SOAP note to the new 7-digit code structure, saving time and improving accountability at the same time. But a simple one-to-one mapping between the old and the new codes does not exist. That means that not only providers have tougher time figuring out the right codes, but also the standard claim scrubbing engines need to be modified to accommodate a huge increase in the number of codes. In our experience, insurance companies leverage any opportunity to delay longer and underpay more insurance claims. We leverage the cloud, billing experts, and Artificial Intelligence to analyze millions of insurance claims and generate effective transition rules,” says Lirov.\nClick here to learn more.\nAbout ClinicMind by Affinity Billing, Inc\nClinicMind by Affinity Billing delivers all-inclusive practice management software for mental health facilities, automating tasks and improving efficiency, cashflow predictability, and compliance.
