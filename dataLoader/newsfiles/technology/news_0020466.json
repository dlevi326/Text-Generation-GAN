It recognizes those partners who are working at the very highest levels of technology and standards while implementing web content management solutions for clients.\n\"This is a great achievement for our team,\" notes BlueModus Director of Application Development Nate Kresse, who oversaw the Quality Audit Certification from BlueModus' perspective. \"It has allowed BlueModus and Kentico to collaborate closely in order to agree upon best practices we will both hold our sites to, which benefits everyone. Our clients now have the best-performing, scalable and most secure sites possible. Now that we've completed this process, this same high standard of quality will be applied to all future projects as well.\"\nBlueModus was one of two global Gold partners, and the sole North American Partner to achieve this certification, after a rigorous review of their site implementations by Kentico’s top architects. The agency met Kentico’s strict requirements for security, performance, and coding best practices along with the correct, fully optimized use of Kentico features and integrations.\n\"Customers are demanding increasingly sophisticated WCM solutions,\" said Kentico Founder and CEO Petr Palas. \"They want seamless integration with other best of breed solutions across the enterprise. They are looking to maintain performance while dealing with more and more visitor traffic. And they are pushing digital marketing and marketing automation capabilities to greater heights. So we felt it was necessary for customers to know, with certainty, which Kentico partners are bringing the greatest technical assets to the table.\" Palas continued, \"The Kentico Partner Quality Audit program is designed to do just that. It is a win for customers, a win for Kentico, and it’s driving the industry towards superior levels of technical execution and delivery.\"\n\"BlueModus is very proud of achieving this highest level of certification from Kentico,\" said Kresse. \"By taking the time to work with us – to ensure we are taking full advantage of Kentico and meeting the highest level of performance, security and other standards – Kentico has shown once again that they truly care about partner success, client satisfaction, and the business output that comes from the use of their product.\"\nFor learn more about how BlueModus provides full-service business and Web solutions and services in support of it clients’ digital initiatives, visit http://www.bluemodus.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:57:10.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
