The position is honorary, without voting rights. It means that Daniel Borel will continue to interact with the board in addition to the numerous other roles he plays. \nAdditionally, at the meeting, Logitech’s shareholders elected to the board of directors Sue Gove, Lung Yeh and Edouard Bugnion. All other incumbent members of the board who stood for re-election were re-elected, and all other proposals at the AGM were approved. \nGuerrino De Luca, Logitech’s chairman of the board, said: “It’s a real pleasure to welcome Sue, Lung and Edouard to the board. I’m also pleased to return so much value to our shareholders this year through our dividend. Finally, I’m delighted that our co-founder, Daniel Borel, will continue his participation with the Company in the strategic, honorary role of Chairman Emeritus. Bobo, as we call him, has made an immeasurable contribution to Logitech over the years and while this title doesn’t reflect the true scope of his achievements, it allows us to continue his formal association with the Company. He adds this title to his other roles of founder, friend, entrepreneur and mentor.” \nLogitech expects the payment date for the dividend to be Sept. 22, 2015. The shares are expected to be traded ex-dividend on the Nasdaq Global Select Market starting on Sept. 17 and on the SIX Swiss Exchange on Sept. 18. Given the unaligned ex-dividend dates resulting from Logitech's dual listing, Nasdaq has informed the Company that it will temporarily halt trading in Logitech shares on its platform on Sept. 17, 2015, from the start of the trading session on the Nasdaq market until approximately the close of the trading session on the SIX Swiss Exchange at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. Shareholders will find more information about the dividend on the Logitech corporate website at http://ir.logitech.com . \nAbout Logitech \nLogitech designs products that have an everyday place in people's lives, connecting them to the digital experiences they care about.
