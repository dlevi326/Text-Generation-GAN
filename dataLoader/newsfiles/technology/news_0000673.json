More information can be found at http://www.kidcheck.com .\nBoise, Idaho\nKidCheck, providers of secure children’s check-in software, is pleased to share a new blog series providing insight on planning, creating and implementing a child protection policy (CPP) to help churches and other organizations caring for children.\nA CPP helps ensure that anyone who comes into contact with children has a defined set of working principles and minimizes the grey area regarding interacting with kids. It also offers a layer of protection for staff, volunteers and adults against the scenario of false accusations. In essence, it is an important policy to help create a safe environment for children.\n“The process of planning and creating a personalized Child Protection Policy can be a daunting task and will be different for each organization,” said Alex Smith, CEO KidCheck. “That’s why we created the Child Protection Policy blog series, to provide direction and help for organizations to start the process, understand what items to take into consideration, and ultimately create a strong policy.”\n“KidCheck is much more than a secure children’s check-in provider,” continued Smith. “Our goal is to partner with churches and organizations caring for children to provide helpful resources to assist in reducing risk and increasing the care and safety of children. These resources include articles on the KidCheck blog, plus available free eBook and safety video downloads; all of which deliver actionable tips, tricks and best practice ideas.”\nAbout KidCheck\nKidCheck, Inc. provides secure, web based children’s check-in software and complete check-in station solutions for churches, fitness facilities, and organizations caring for children.
