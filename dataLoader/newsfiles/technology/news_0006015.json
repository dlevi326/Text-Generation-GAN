Designed without a display or keyboard, Remote Spectrum Monitor automates the method of conducting radio surveillance, interference detection, and government spectrum policy enforcement while bringing greater flexibilities and cost efficiencies to network management. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150908/264483 \n\"Operators have asked for a scalable and integrated solution to meet the test needs of their wireless network from a performance and cost perspective. Additionally, government regulators are often interested in monitoring the spectrum for illegal or unlicensed broadcasts. Anritsu addresses these requirements with Remote Spectrum Monitor, a bundled solution that provides an efficient platform that is flexible and expandable to evolve along with networks,\" said Gerald Ostheimer, Anritsu Corporate Vice President/General Manager. \"Remote Spectrum Monitor leverages Anritsu's wireless field test expertise and our network monitoring proficiency gained through our market-leading MasterClaw Monitoring(TM) tool to create an innovative solution to help optimize network operation.\" \nRemote Spectrum Monitor features two spectrum monitor modules at introduction. Each module has power of arrival (POA) algorithms to monitor for interference and approximate the position where the interfering signal is being generated. \nTo address the rapid expansion of wireless communications, Anritsu has developed the MS27102A, which is designed to maximize network capacity by more efficiently solving issues associated with the presence of illegal or unlicensed signals that interfere with authorized transmissions. Certified with an IP67 rating, the MS27102A is the ideal solution for outdoor monitoring applications and can be wall- or pole-mounted. With an operating temperature range of -40 degrees C to +55 degrees C, one (or optionally two) weather-resistant RF In ports, a rugged weatherized case and splash proof design, the MS27102A performs in the most extreme weather conditions. \nThe MS27103A helps operators provide quality services to consumers and meet KPIs for a maximum return on network investment. Designed for multiple antenna applications that cover wide frequency ranges, the MS27103A is a rack-mountable multi-port RF In probe that constantly monitors the spectrum to ensure optimal performance. Anritsu has developed this monitor for cellular operators requiring spectrum monitoring coverage for multiple sectors and numerous frequencies per sector at their BTS locations. \nCovering 9 kHz to 6 GHz, the probes have sweep rates up to 24 GHz/s, allowing capture of many interferers, including periodic or transient transmissions as well as short \"bursty\" signals. The modules also have low power consumption of < 11 watts. \nThe spectrum monitor probes are designed for robust field deployments, with capabilities for remote power cycling, automated system recovery protocols and secure firmware updates. A \"Golden\" firmware image is placed on each unit and can be used to return the probe to full operation in the rare case the firmware is corrupted. \nAnritsu has developed Vision(TM) Application Software to automate collecting measurement data, providing useful information about network health and spectrum use. Vision Monitor automatically records spectrum data, maintains a searchable spectrum history database, enables alarm functions for unusual signal activity and provides tools for managing the spectrum monitoring system. \nUsers can also write custom monitoring program applications using available SCPI commands. Each pair of IQ data output is time-stamped using high precision GPS signals, allowing the IQ data to be used for Time Distance of Arrival (TDOA) applications for geo-locating signal positions. IQ data time stamp resolution is less than 9 nSec for precise signal location calculations. \nAn integrated web server is embedded into each spectrum monitor probe. Using either Chrome or FireFox, a user from anywhere in the world can log in to the spectrum monitor module and control any of its features using a PC/laptop, tablet or smartphone. Each module also features Gbit Ethernet for fast transfers of measurement data and control information. \nRemote Spectrum Monitor complements Anritsu's MasterClaw Monitoring multi-technology solution and expands Anritsu's network monitoring portfolio that helps operators protect their network investments, achieve higher operational efficiency and increase revenue. Trusted by leading carriers globally, MasterClaw provides 24/7/365 visibility of network, service, app and customer usage, along with unrivaled troubleshooting. \nFor more information, visit our CTIA Super Mobility 2015 online press kit here: http://ctia.vporoom.com/Anritsu \nAbout Anritsu \nAnritsu Company is the United States subsidiary of Anritsu Corporation, a global provider of innovative communications test and measurement solutions for 120 years.
