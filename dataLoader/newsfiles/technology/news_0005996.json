Researchers surmised the remaining penguins from their study either died at sea or moved away. \nThe data from the sensors showed the penguins generally stayed hundreds of kilometres apart as they feasted in the ocean. \nHowever, researchers found one case where a couple had nearly 2,500 kilometres between them. \nWhen the birds finally got back together they promptly turned into homebodies, with most of their time spent at the nest. \nIt led researchers to note that birds like Emperor penguins, which do not build a home together, are less likely to be monogamous. \n\"Penguins may use the same nest site or nesting area to breed every year, over and over again,\" Thiebot said. \"This probably helps the two partners to meet up ashore at a known place.\" \nThe birds' elaborate courtship rituals may also help them recognise each other. \nAmong the penguins it was mums who set out first after breeding, leaving nearly a week earlier than dads. The lady birds also went on to cover hundreds more kilometres than the males in their half a year away. \nAccording to Thiebot the findings highlight the need for new safeguards to protect against man-made disasters like oil spills. \nHe noted that an event that kills 1,000 penguins could in fact be killing half of 1,000 couples. \n\"We know that when a bird loses his/her partner, its success of breeding with a new mate generally decreases, at least temporarily, or the bird even skips breeding,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T11:13:50.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
