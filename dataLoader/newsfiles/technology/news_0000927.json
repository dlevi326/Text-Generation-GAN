Oh, Angry Birds ! I know Angry Birds. \nIt was an addictive app released in 2009 by a Finnish development company where you would slingshot birds at structures holding green pigs in an attempt to knock down the structures and pop all the pigs. Based on the puzzle game’s cartoon physics, certain builds would take extra tries to knock down with the allotted number of birds. The game would introduce other birds with specialty features like a boomarang ability or fragmenting into three smaller birds, also destructive materials like TNT would be added to the structures. \nIf you are a human capable of reading this year, you probably played at least one iteration of Angry Birds . There was even a few Star Wars variant apps released by developer Rovio, and the Hasbro toy company which introduced the mechanic of being able to “scan” additional characters into the game using a special QR code reader that would work with a smart phone. Then, there was the glut of advertising: stuffed animals, shirts, and amusement park attractions at such worldly diverse places from Särkänniemi adventure park in Finland to Kennedy Space Center in the US. \nSo, of course there is a movie. I guess I feel bad being so skeptical about its existence. Really, how has there not been a movie already? Let’s see how this goes. \n0:00: We fade up on The Carpenters “(They Long to be) Close To You,” which is a song about loving someone or at least being obsessed about them. Maybe this movie is going to be a romance? More likely this is because the first line of the song involves birds. \n0:13: There’s the red bird, on some sort of bird island. His (it is a he since he’s currently falling for the old mistaken-wave-from-a-lady trick) torso has been elongated from the game so he looks more suitable walking upright than being launched like a pebble out of a slingshot. I’m distracted thinking about this design choice, I’ve barely noticed that this gag has never made me laugh. Of course she’s waving at someone else. \n0:19: See, there’s the more attractive bird, sitting above him. Why is the music still going? That was the punchline. \n0:23: Attractive bird stomps on the head of Red Bird and the music stops. Oh no, this movie doesn’t know where the punchlines of jokes are. It thinks that physical violence is a punchline in itself. I know this movie. This is like Minions , but with birds, isn’t it? \n0:27: Red tries to kick his lunch pail and misses, face planting. Joke number three if we count joke number two being that Red runs into a tree right before trying to kick the pail. This is not going well. \n0:28: This movie is coming next year. \n0:32: Red speaks! He tells an orange bird (that I don’t recognize, but that means I could have just skipped his expansion) that he’s horrible. In the background is a sign that says “The Early Bird gets the Worm” above an open worm shop and a worm shop that is closed “Again” because it is called “Late Risers.” A+ level background humor here, folks. \n0:33: Meet Red (Jason Sudeikis). \n0:41: Red lives isolated on the beach, apparently, and physically assaults a small child for kicking a soccer ball against the side of his house. Presumably this is supposed to be funny because the child bird is the same size and shape as the soccer ball. Maybe this is supposed to foreshadow some sort of arc-based kicking that Red has to do later in the movie. It is yet another punchline based on physical comedy. \n0:46: Chuck (Josh Gad). \n0:53: Apparently Chuck is the hyperactive one who may or may not have a thing for the pink yoga instructor bird. Chuck is modeled after the Yellow Bird from the game, so I am used to seeing him more angry. Chuck does not appear to be angry even though he is at a class about how to reduce anger through yoga. \n0:56: Here’s a joke based around the idea that Chuck puts his butt in Red’s face. I guess that’s a punchline not based on violence, but it is based on physical comedy. Also, the pose is called “downward dog,” right? Chuck’s a duck. Chuck the duck. Ducks are “water birds,” by the way. \n0:58: Bomb (Danny McBride). “Bomb,” that’s it? \n1:04: He’s shy about how he explodes when he’s “upset.” So the guy named Bomb literally is a bomb. Red is red, and Chuck is a duck. \n1:08: That old cartoon trope where explosions destroy non-living things but just get some soot on the living characters. I’ll allow it because an Angry Bird finally destroyed a structure, which is something I assumed I’d be getting more of from this movie considering how integral it is to the game. \n1:13: A fine punchline (“party foul”) gets stomped on by a small bird face-planting.Heaven forbid we make a movie that has dialogue-based comedy, right? Otherwise it wouldn’t play well in China. Or Finland, maybe? \n1:14: Leonard (Bill Hader). Oh good, another character with a name that doesn’t describe him. Is he Leonard because it sounds like Leonardo, and in Bad Piggies — the pig’s game franchise in the Birds universe — the pigs are inventors? \n1:19: Leonard is a pig. He proclaims it. Pigs also have been given torsos for the movie and roll up to bird island in a big boat that looks like a steam-punk Jawa sandcrawler for the ocean. \n1:30: Leonard has practiced discovering islands of new species, apparently. Chuck does not know what a pig is; none of the birds do. Is this movie a prequel movie to the app? Are we going to see the pigs steal the eggs and build fortresses out of flotsam and jetsam? \n1:34: “The Angry Birds Movie.” \n1:44: A cheerful sign encouraging Red to smile is making an annoying sound. The Michael Jackson music has cut out, so I can feel that this is building to something. Is this the moment Red becomes truly angry? Is he going to launch himself at this creation, full speed, and learn the power of slingshotting? \n1:51: Oh, maybe he’s going to let his anger go? No, something else is going to happen. \n1:57: After casually hitting the bird sign while walking past, the bird sign rubber bands back to hit him. Okay, maybe the movie is subtly planting the in-game physics needed to elicit joy from birds being slingshotted at pigs in structures. \n2:02: Red was not able to let the anger go. He tackles the sign and flies off screen. End teaser. \nAfter watching that I don’t know what Angry Birds is about at all, except that everyone is going to annoy Red, our protagonist who is the only angry bird in the teaser. Maybe Red’s anger ends up being the power that Bird Island needs to harness to take on Leonard and the — you know what? I’m trying too hard. This is a movie based on an app, what are its chances of being good?
