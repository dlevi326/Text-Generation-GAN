That's a 13 percent premium to the Westlake, Texas, company's Friday closing price of $49.45. \nThe companies put the deal's value at about $6.5 billion, including debt. \nSolera's board unanimously approved the acquisition. \nThe transaction is targeted to close no later than 2016's first quarter. It still needs approval from Solera shareholders. \nSolera's stock gained $4.05, or 8 percent, to $53.50 before the opening bell on Monday. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
