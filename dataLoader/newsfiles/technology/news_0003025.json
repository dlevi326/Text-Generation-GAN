It targets and blocks the occurrences of nausea and/or vomiting without the use of drugs.\nJoseph DiLustro, CEO, Pressure Point Inc., co-founder and developer of Pressure Right said: Using the base knowledge of traditional Chinese/Eastern medicine has allowed us to develop a far more reaching medical solution for the prevention and/or treatment of nausea and vomiting.” “DiLustro further said: The product’s 72-hour duration profile and its lack of side effects out-perform antiemetic drugs on a comparative cost-effective basis.”\nInherent in the operating mechanism of Pressure Right is the established medical history of traditional Chinese acupressure. This medical philosophy has been established over several centuries. It utilizes the human body’s network of energy channels resulting from the stimulation of positive energy to achieve the desired remedy. Therefore, acupressure stimulation lends itself to treat health deficiencies within the human body, such as nausea and vomiting.\nAccording to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the primary connecting channel for preventing and/or treating nausea and vomiting is the P-6 stimulation point within the human body.\n“Using the base knowledge of traditional Chinese/Eastern medicine will also allow our company to explore mobilizing the penetration of P-6 stimulation for clinically improving poor memory as well as promoting sleep benefits, according to DiLustro.”\nPressure Right was medically proven at the esteemed Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California under a medium sized, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial as part of a multi-modal antiemetic strategy. In fact, the Pressure Right clinical trial data was peer-reviewed and published in 2012.\nOne of the “best” US hospitals for adult surgeries located in the upper Midwest, has been using Pressure Right as an effective preventive remedy for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) since 2012.\nPressure Right has received clinical clearance from the FDA for indications related to surgery, chemotherapy, pregnancy morning sickness and travel sickness.\nIn addition, Pressure Right has received market clearance from the Chinese FDA and the India Ministry of Health.\nWenting Zhang, M.D., representing Wuhan Jian Qiao Medical Instrument Company in China said: “Given the enormous population and the need for medical care in China, the availability of Pressure Right to Chinese hospitals and medical centers will be favorably received.”\nDr. Zhang graduated from Beijing Medical University and gained working experience as a neurologist at Beijing Tiantan hospital. She has been in the medical field in both China and US for almost 25 years, including the clinical research field.\nCVS Murthy, general manager for Juno Pharmaceuticals and newly formed Zywie Medical Devices Private Limited in Hyderabad, India, also said: “We have designed a country-wide media campaign in India to introduce Pressure Right to Indian medical professionals. Our proof-of-concept data has proven positively for Pressure Right with Indian patients.”\n“With our two esteemed international partners, we plan to leverage our proprietary Pressure Right brand across China and India,” DiLustro, added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T03:11:20.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
