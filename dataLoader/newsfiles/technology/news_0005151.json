It drastically misunderstood its users with a fundamentally changed user interface which didn't make any logical sense and was hard to learn. It failed us. It failed itself.\nThankfully 2015 Microsoft is pretty different to 2012 Microsoft. The key management of the corporation has changed. It has woken up to the fact that people can choose other operating systems. It's keen on making stuff for OS X, Linux, iOS and Android. As you'll hear, it's allowing apps from other platforms to be easily ported to Windows, too.\n\nMicrosoft believes the future of Windows is as a platform for all. Like Android, the strength of Windows is in the thousands of companies that develop for it (see the section about Universal apps for more on the relationship with developers) and use it in their products.\nThat's why Windows 10 is no longer just an operating system for 32 and 64-bit PCs. It will also run on the ARM platform for smaller tablets and smartphones. Windows 10 is going to run on phones – it's the new version of Windows Phone , but it's not that clear whether Microsoft will brand new Windows Phones as 'Windows 10' or not. If you know what Windows RT was, then don't worry, because it's nothing like that.\nUniversal apps will run not only on PCs, but on Windows 10 phones, Windows 10 for IoT devices and Xbox as well. \nLike Windows XP, Vista , 7 and 8 before it, Windows 10 is part of the Windows NT family. \n\nFrom the Windows 10 Preview to RTM We were part of the Windows Insider program, which has given people early access to Windows 10 through various phases of its development. The latest version, which this article is based on, is known as build 10240, made available on 15 July . It is the RTM- or Release to Manufacturing - version. RTM will also be on Windows 10 PCs . \nRTM doesn't have the usual 'Windows 10 Insider Preview' text on the desktop, and it has also been released to everybody in the Windows Insider program – even those who didn't want the latest updates (the 'slow' ring as opposed to the 'fast' ring).\n\nEven now Windows 10 is eleased, the Windows Insider program will continue, and Microsoft will release Windows 10 updates to members of the program first.\nWhile it's natural that Windows 10 will be considered as 'finished' by reviewers (us) and consumers, Microsoft doesn't subscribe to this point of view, and says it will carry on developing the OS with additional tweaks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:10:32.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
