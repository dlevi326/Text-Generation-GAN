In 2002, while completing his engineering in IT from Mumbai University, he started a network-based software system for cybercafes. This venture helped him pay for his own education. Not wanting to work in a formal setup, he joined a startup called TeamExcel Technologies during campus placements in 2005. \n\nHe worked for a year before personal issues with the company forced him to quit. Leaving the startup culture behind, Singh joined HCL in 2006 and calls it \"the worst career decision of my life.\" He quit in five months and joined EA (Electronic Arts), where his 9-to-5 job triggered a mid-life crisis and made him join Nivio, a Gurgaon-based startup providing desktop virtualization service. In need of more people, Singh started hiring and Debayan Banerjee and Saurab Paruthi were two of the people hired. \n\nThe three of them became good friends and used to discuss product ideas whenever they got a chance. In 2011, Singh quit Nivio. During an event conducted by startup accelerator 500 Startups, called Geeks on a Plane, many recognized the talent the three had. They had developed a technology which helped solve the app distribution problem through a phone scanner. After working for almost 12 hours straight, Singh recalls calling up Paul Singh (their mentor at 500 Startups) at 3 in the morning to tell him that the solution was ready. \n\nThey went on to win the top prize at the event and were offered a seat at the Morpheus accelerator. The Times Group's TLabs accelerator offered them a spot in their first batch. When they secured $40,000 in a seed round, Saurab quit Nivio too. They launched their product, Bring, in 2012. But the app did not do well. \n\n\"We had the money in the bank and an interesting technology to work on so we decided to change the product,\" Singh says. They approached sports analytics company Tam Media Research and told them about their software technology. Using the technology brands could now identify when their brands were photographed across social media in real-time.\n\nAt the same time, they became one of the 10 startups to be selected for the startup conference UnPlugged. With only Rs 80,000 left in the bank they decided to attend and renamed their company to GazeMetrix. The reception was great, Singh says \"There was a queue of VCs waiting to talk to me after I displayed our product.\" \n\nThe product was covered in a number of media and got the first 400 signups from big brands, one of them an Atlanta-based beverage company. \"It was hard to sell to US customers sit ting in India, but we did it,\" says Singh. In February this year, they approached Canada-based Sysomos, a social listing and analytics company, to partner with them. They had access to data which GazeMetrix could use for image analytics. But it turned out to be really close relationship. Last week, Sysomos acquired GazeMetrix. \n\nSingh says they will continue to run independently since Sysomos benefits from their customers as well. He will shift to the US. Singh can't help but thank his wife for her support. \"I wasn't able to give her enough time. She had to deal with a lot of stupid things.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:19:47.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
