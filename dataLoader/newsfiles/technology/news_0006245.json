The deal comes after issuance of company debt came to a halt Tuesday, capping off the worst September for global sales in four years.\nThe proposed securities, which are being marketed at a premium to Hewlett-Packard’s existing bonds, bring the technology company another step closer to a split-up that management has said will allow each segment to be more nimble and specialized. The enterprise unit will funnel cash raised in the offering to HP Co., which will then use the money to redeem as much as $8.85 billion in debt and refinance other obligations, the company said Wednesday in a regulatory filing.\n\"The enterprise bonds are coming substantially behind the current HPQ bonds,\" showing the company is offering concessions to get the deal done and highlighting the diverging credit profiles of the emerging entities’, said Erin Lyons, an analyst with CreditSights Inc.\nThe company’s enterprise services business has lost about $4 billion in annual revenue since 2011. Standard & Poor’s gave it a BBB rating Sept. 23, two levels above junk, citing \"revenue declines in legacy hardware and services markets\" and the \"significant capital expenditures\" required by its IT outsourcing services businesses, as among factors in the rating choice.\nKait Conetta,, a spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard, couldn’t confirm the size of the offering and declined to comment on the sale beyond information provided in company press releases and presentations.\nThe longest part of the proposed securities will be a 30-year bond that may yield as much as 3.6 percentage points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. That’s 0.51 percentage point more than the average yield paid Tuesday on Hewlett-Packard’s existing bonds of the same maturity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nHP Inc., which will sell printers and PCs, will have $2.3 billion in net debt once the split is complete, according to a Sept. 15. company presentation .\nThe sale and refinancing should provide soon-to-be HP Inc. \"a clear runway in terms of maturity profile to weather the downturn in the PC cycle,\" but the split leaves existing bondholders \"with pure exposure to the more volatile PC and printer business,\" Lyons said.", "external_links": ["http://h30261.www3.hp.com/~/media/Files/H/HP-IR/documents/events/09-15-2015/HPI-SAM2015-CFO.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-09-30T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:12:06.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
