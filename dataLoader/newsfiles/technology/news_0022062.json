Substantial 3G deployments took place in Brazil, India, the Middle East, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam,\" said Stéphane Téral , research director for mobile infrastructure and carrier economics at IHS . \n\"Brazil kicked off a massive 2G GSM to 3G W-CDMA migration, and Thailand has ordered mobile operators to shut down their GSM network to re-use the spectrum for LTE,\" Téral said. MORE MOBILE INFRASTRUCTURE MARKET HIGHLIGHTS In 2Q15, the worldwide macrocell mobile infrastructure market totaled $11.4 billion. LTE revenue was essentially flat (+1 percent) in 2Q15 from 1Q15, but grew 10 percent from the year-ago 2 nd quarter. IHS believes LTE will peak at $23 billion in 2015 and then start to decline as a result of diminishing rollouts worldwide. 422 commercial LTE networks have been launched as of July 2015, 363 of which are of the FDD (frequency division duplex) variety. Ericsson and Huawei share the LTE infrastructure market share lead in 2Q15, each claiming just over 20 percent. Mobile infrastructure software is forecast by IHS to grow at a 5-year (2014-2019) compound annual growth rate of 8 percent.
