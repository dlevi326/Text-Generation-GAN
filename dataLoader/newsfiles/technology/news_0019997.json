Through one simple integration, B2C Europe customers will now be able to access additional tracking statuses at no extra cost. \nThere are now three additional tracking statuses for customers and their consumers which are in transit – received at national postal hub, in transit – received at local postal depot and out for delivery. This will provide online retailers including those selling on marketplaces such as Amazon and ebay, as well as their consumers, more visibility as to where their parcels are within the UK postal network. \nRetailers will not need to print any complex barcodes on their address labels or implement any additional IT integration. They can provide this tracking information directly to their consumers via the B2C Europe automatic email service using their website. \n\"B2C Europe is always looking for new ways to improve its services for online retailers and their consumers\", said Stuart Rivett, managing director of B2C Europe. \n\"Even if a consumer is looking to reduce costs through the untracked option, we will now provide them with various additional statuses without increasing the overall postage price. They will be more aware of where their parcel is and retailers don't need to change their system at all\". \nB2C Europe provides integrated domestic and international distribution and return shipping solutions, along with a number of additional services such as customs clearance and tax representation. The company has a presence throughout Europe, China and the USA providing local warehouses and local distribution and returns solutions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:03:35.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
