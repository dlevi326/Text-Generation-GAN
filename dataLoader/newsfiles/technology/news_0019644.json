More than 1000 funders participated in the campaign.\nParis, France; Boston, Mass.\nBlue Frog Robotics, a robotics technology company and developer of companion robot BUDDY, announced today that its just completed Indiegogo crowd funding campaign exceeded its fundraising goal by more than six times -- raising $617,830. The 1000+ funders include robotics technologists, software developers, academic institutions, and business partners from the healthcare, elder care, insurance and distribution industries as well as individual consumers excited about the future of companion robots.\nThe Indiegogo campaign reached its $100,000 funding goal in less than a day. During the campaign, Blue Frog Robotics executives introduced BUDDY to consumers, technologists, investors and members of the media throughout the world and held events in London, Boston and San Francisco.\n“This is just the beginning,” said Rodolphe Hasselvander, CEO and co-founder of Blue Frog Robotics and the inventor of BUDDY. “The successful Indiegogo crowd funding campaign has validated BUDDY and companion robots, and that’s exciting news for us and for our many contributors to whom we are so grateful for getting this project off to a fast start. We learned so much from the recent global tour where BUDDY was met with universal enthusiasm. Now it’s time to take what we learned and continue to evolve BUDDY into a world-class, affordable and useful companion robot.”\nBUDDY, recently described in consumer electronics web magazine Engadget as having “R2-D2's versatility but with Wall-E's emotive abilities” and also recently featured in TechCrunch , a leading online publisher of technology news, can perform a broad range of useful, every day activities. It can alert a family member to an upcoming appointment, route and make phone calls, snap a picture or take a video, suggest a recipe and serve as a home security solution, among many other tasks.\nBlue Frog Robotics recently opened offices in Boston, Mass., ground central for robotics in the US, and in San Francisco, Calif. Executives from the company will be attending, along with BUDDY, Unite 2015 Boston and TechCrunch Disrupt SF, San Francisco, Calif., both from Sept. 21-23, and RoboBusiness 2015, Sept. 23-24 in San Jose, Calif.\nAnyone who missed out on the discount opportunity through the Indiegogo campaign will be able to purchase BUDDY at the retail price from Blue Frog Robotics in 2016.\nNotes to members of the media:\nName: BUDDY\nPlatform: Indiegogo\nURL: http://igg.me/at/buddy-companion-robot\nAmount sought: $100,000\nAmount raised: $617,830\nPress kit link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ap7pimboj69jtne/AAAZi4HftFFuYrHZk5gQxW6pa?dl=0\nBUDDY is being developed by Blue Frog Robotics, a French robotics company founded by Rodolphe Hasselvander who is available for interviews.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12949844.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12949844.htm", "http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/06/buddy-the-robot-wants-to-be-your-modern-day-rosie/", "http://techcrunch.com/tag/blue-frog-robotics/", "http://igg.me/at/buddy-companion-robot", "https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ap7pimboj69jtne/AAAZi4HftFFuYrHZk5gQxW6pa?dl=0"], "published": "2015-09-09T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T15:30:47.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
