START is an intuitive graphical platform for quick setup of appropriate drivers and middleware, and complete example applications. \nThe Data Visualizer plug-in now captures and displays run-time power data from an application, when used with the Power Debugger function or a supported Xplained-PRO board. It makes it possible precise correlation of power changes with code execution. Studio 7 also allows one-click import of projects created in the Arduino development environment â€“ with more than 1600 ready-to-use project examples.
