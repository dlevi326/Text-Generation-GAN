The company’s legal, sales, and procurement teams were seeking a comprehensive solution to replace manual approvals and reporting, and provide visibility into the content and performance of contracts to help ensure compliance. Revitas Contract Manager is a robust, automated contract management solution that will scale with the company’s growth. \nWith Revitas Contract Manager, LG will benefit from a single, centralized customer contract repository that is fully searchable and auditable, allowing the company to easily identify and manage contract terms and conditions. The solution’s interactive dashboards and detailed reporting functionality deliver advanced insight and real-time analysis of contract administration and performance so the company can easily review and report on important milestones, renewal dates, payment terms, and other key metrics. \n“LG sought to elevate its contract management processes with an automated solution that would streamline and enhance its contract management and reporting techniques,” said Michael Kerman, Vice President of Business Management at Revitas. “Revitas Contract Manager provides on-demand information and insights about contract performance so the company can extract maximum value from every agreement.” \nFor more information about the Revitas Contract Manager and Analytics solutions, please visit www.revitasinc.com . \nAbout Revitas \nRevitas helps organizations accelerate revenue through diverse, multi-level sales channels by delivering enterprise-class solutions that tailor channel and contract management to the needs of the business.
