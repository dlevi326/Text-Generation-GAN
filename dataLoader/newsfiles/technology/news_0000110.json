By only scrapping vessels of less than 6,000 TEU that are deployed mainly in North-South and intra-regional trades, nothing is done to alleviate the pressure on East-West routes, where virtually all of the newbuild capacity is placed. \nThere are only around 40 ships above 4,000 TEU that are currently older than 20 years, meaning that most of the immediate scrapping candidates will as before come from the sub 2,000 TEU sector. \nHowever, this will change in the next 3-4 years, with many more Panamaxes becoming theoretical candidates for scrapping, especially with the widened Panama Canal looming whereby trade route deployment becomes much more difficult. \nAn example of the importance of analysing capacity on a trade-by-trade basis is if all of the 20+ years old ships demolished tomorrow the global fleet would shrink by around 750,000 TEU, representing 4% of the total, yet ship utilisation on the embattled Asia-Europe services wouldn’t budge by 1%. \nThe Drewry View: Drewry expects scrapping to pick up a bit next year, but unless owners take the brave move to get rid of younger and bigger ships it is not the answer to the industry’s overcapacity problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T14:35:37.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
