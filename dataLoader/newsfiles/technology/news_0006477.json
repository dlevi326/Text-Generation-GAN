I feel for my fellow South Africans who share the same feeling. Walking around this weekend without real purpose, trying to find a way to answer the question. How did it happen? How did it happen, and this on one of the biggest platforms of rugby world history? And can we still win the Webb Ellis trophy? According to South African sport and because of our history, it is probably the biggest and most important competition in our country.\nFirstly: Mr. Meyer and OUR team; you need to understand that this country after the Japan shambles, are in pain, real pain. The aftermath of the match was visible everywhere, the atmosphere the following morning accompanied by the weather in Johannesburg was somber to say the least. You need to understand that this country is in a state of shock and dismay. The hurt is evident everywhere you turn. You need to understand that anger is a way in which you can see how important this is to the people of South Africa.\nTo be honest, we feel let down. We feel disappointed by the chosen warriors that need to represent this sport -mad country (remember sport in South Africa is extremely important, it changed us forever.) So, Mr. Meyer and OUR team understand what we are feeling in South Africa; they understand why we unite in sharing that feeling of desolation in our stomach. I think I speak for everyone when I say that we all feel the same. You are not alone even if the little percentage of people in South Africa wants you to fail. You are not alone, millions are STILL supporting, and millions are sharing in your pain. This is rock bottom not only for you but also for me, for South Africa and for the Rainbow nation.\nWe have hit rock bottom.\nBut... In the words of Harry Potter’s – J.K Rowling\n\"Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life,\"\nJean, Mr. Meyer you are on that foundation, use the foundation, use US as we are also at rock bottom, and use US as your foundation to rebuild this immense challenge to succeed. We will be there for you, supporting you, every step of the way.\nAnna White once Said: \"I think this is what we all want to hear: that we are not alone in hitting the bottom, and that it is possible to come out of that place COURAGEOUS and STRONG.\" Springboks, you've heard it, you are not alone, we are your foundation and you can come out of that place, STRONGER than before and more Courageous than ever. We as a nation is willing to only give our best in support and be the backbone of the green and gold that the whole world once feared.\nThis is all we want, we want your best and if your best isn't good enough, you will get a hero's welcome. We know what your best is; nobody can come close to your best.\n\"Everything: negative pressure; challenges, it is all an opportunity for you to rise.\" The media in England will put you under pressure; the media in South Africa will put you under pressure. People will say you can’t, people will laugh and say it has never been done before. But remember, we are here and we are with you. Myself, and all of the millions and millions of die -hard fans will be your foundation to rise, to rebuild, to succeed.\nYou're only representing 30 South Africans on the field. But you're wrong, you are 50 million South Africans on that field. We are your foundation, now and forever. You are my team. You are our team. You are South Africa's team.\nWe will be your foundation in which we pledge today, win or loose, bottom or top, we will be your foundation. So, dust yourself off, get up and look down, see me, see us there as your foundation for success.\nI am one of the millions that are starting your foundation again, to be the best in the world and to make history like only the South African team knows how.\nBring back the trophy once again; let’s make history together.\nThe country needs you.\nI am one of your supporters.\nShare the #foundationforboks we all need to back our soldiers.\n#foundationsoldier\nDavid.\n#foundationforboks\n#rwc2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T20:05:12.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
