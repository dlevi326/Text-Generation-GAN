This stylish activity tracker blends the functionality of an activity tracking band with the look and feel of a traditional men's analog watch. With features that take you from the gym to the office and everywhere in between, the Timex Metropolitan+ is the first product introduced in the brand's new Connected Style Collection . \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150916/267290 \nThe watch uses Bluetooth technology to connect to an app on your phone that tracks daily activity - including steps, distance and calories burned - with no charging required. View your stats right on the watch dial with just a glance to see how you are tracking towards your goals. The phone app stores all of your data, so you can access and analyze it at any time. \n\"In the fast-paced world we live in, today's active man works hard and plays hard, and he doesn't want to sacrifice style for technical features or vice versa,\" said Shawn Lawson Cummings, CMO of Timex Group USA. \"We recognized a void in the marketplace for fashionable, functional activity trackers that keep guys connected. The Timex Metropolitan+ watch can be effortlessly integrated into the dynamic, everyday lifestyles of our male consumers.\" \nThe Metropolitan+ will debut in two unique styles. One watch has a silver-tone case, a black dial with red accents and a textured leather strap. The other variation features a black case with a black dial and orange accents and comes with interchangeable black silicone and orange nylon straps. Both styles feature quick-release straps so you can easily change your look with a variety of strap options available at timex.com. Both watches also feature Timex's signature INDIGLO(®) night-light, and the phone app is compatible with both iOS and Android devices. \nAbout the Timex Group: \nTimex Group designs, manufactures and markets innovative timepieces around the world.
