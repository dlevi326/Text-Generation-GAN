The merger will enable a world-class product offering with massive scale, providing developers and advertisers the industry’s most complete end-to-end solution for mobile monetization and marketing. The merger is founded on a deep mutual understanding of the mobile ecosystem and its challenges with app distribution and monetization. The latest platform combination will allow developers to exceed monetization goals with a single centralized SDK which includes mobile video, offerwall, interstitial and display, in addition to full mediation support for all ad products. For performance and brand advertisers, the combined reach of one billion monthly users will dramatically enhance existing tools for user acquisition and brand campaigns.\n“There are many inconsistencies in the mobile industry that we are poised to solve with this merger. Issues such as cross screen tracking, user targeting and reporting. Together, our companies will become the go-to platform for mobile developers and advertisers,” said Tomer Bar Zeev, CEO of ironSource. “We believe that combining Supersonic’s strengths with ironSource’s data, scale and technology will position us to be the market leader in mobile analytics, distribution and monetization. With Supersonic, we are significantly adding to our reach to make us one of the largest players in the industry.”\nClient relationships are central to both companies, which will continue moving forward. Both company’s existing partners will work with the same dedicated teams and now have access to a more comprehensive set of solutions.\nGil Shoham, CEO of Supersonic, added, “While our businesses complement each other perfectly, the real driving force behind this deal was a shared vision.
