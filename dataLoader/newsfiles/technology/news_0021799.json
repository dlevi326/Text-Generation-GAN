But he said the commitment to the environment must be balanced against economic growth and jobs. \nHe has also supported a massive India-backed coal mine project in Queensland state, which environment groups say will exacerbate climate change. \nNewcastle's deputy mayor Michael Osborne told AFP the divestment would \"start happening straight away\" and continue as investments are due for renewal, with the shift expected to be completed in about five years. \nActivities considered to be environmentally or socially harmful include the production of pollutants, habitat destruction, nuclear power, uranium mining and human rights or labour abuses, the council said. \nIndustries listed as environmentally or socially productive include resource-efficient business, renewable energy and recycling firms, fair trade and equal opportunity employers. \nOsborne said he hoped the council's move would place Australia's big four banks under greater pressure to focus on \"ethical investments\". \nThere has been a growing global movement to divest from fossil fuels. \nHigh-profile examples include the Church of England and the Norwegian parliament's move to pull its sovereign wealth fund out of coal. \ngrk/mfc/sm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:02:43.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
