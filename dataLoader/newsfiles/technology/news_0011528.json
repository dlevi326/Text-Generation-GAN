For common conditions like asthma or a cold, a stethoscope and thermometer are usually first used to make a diagnosis. But what if you could do it yourself from home?To empower consumers to track their family’s health from home, CliniCloud has created a mobile connected digital stethoscope and non-contact thermometer. By working with an integrated app, you can store the readings such as respiratory and heart rate on your phone or secure cloud server. In partnership with Doctor on Demand, you can video chat with a physician and get your heart and lung examined as if you were there in person.This is a brilliant piece of technology for people who care for young children or elderly people and want to monitor health progress from the comfort of home. CliniCloud makes that easy to do with self-guided check-ups, analysis of vital trends and an overall picture of the family’s health stored on the app. It is also portable enough to take with you on holiday or leave with someone else. The Australian start-up has just announced it has closed a $5 million in seed funding led by Chinese tech giant Tencent. Ping An Ventures, the venture arm of Chinese insurance and banking conglomerate Ping An, was also a major investor. Others include prominent musician and investor, D.A. Wallach, Kosaku Yada (Sonar Group) and other private participants. The heavy backing by Chinese companies signals that CliniCloud has a big future in China’s growing ageing society.The funding will mainly be used to accelerate production and roll-out of the first shipment in about a month’s time. It will also be used to develop future products, expand the team and go global.Currently, CliniCloud is pre-selling the medical kit online for US$149. But a bigger-win for the start-up is a distribution sales deal with Best Buy in the U.S. and Canada, starting this Holiday Season.CliniCloud CEO Dr. Andrew Lin said:“The stethoscope and thermometer are gateways to critical information that helps physicians diagnose illness in patients. By digitising them and connecting them to a powerful apps and network of medical professionals through our partnership with telemedicine partners such as Doctor On Demand, we are empowering every parent and carer to play an active role in healthcare.”[youtubevid id=\"J8DfPZt9ESI\"]David Wallerstein, Tencent’s Chief eXploration Officer said:\"The mobile Internet is now ushering in a new era for health diagnostics. CliniCloud has taken a core tool for family physicians — the stethoscope — and brought it into the modern era. By allowing health practitioners to remotely listen to an individual's lungs or heart, issues can be identified, treatments discussed, or concerns put to rest. Diagnoses can occur as frequently as the user desires and with great convenience. CliniCloud's connected medical kit will empower users and provide them with new health choices and resources.\"CliniCloud was founded by physicians Dr. Andrew Lin and Dr. Hon Weng Chong, when they realized today’s patients are starting to play a more active role in their own care, and wanted to equip everyone with the right tools to make better healthcare and diagnostic decisions.", "external_links": ["https://clinicloud.com/"], "published": "2015-09-24T13:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T08:55:04.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
