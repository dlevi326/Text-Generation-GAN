After installation of XT, Serco gained insight into the path customers were taking to reach the agents, beginning in the auto attendant, by revealing vector routing information.\nFort Lauderdale, FL, September 02, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Serco Global Services Americas provides contact center outsourcing and web support for hospitality and corporate travel businesses in the US. Serco clients receive all the benefits of a full contact center without having to fund the infrastructure or maintenance required to operate one.\nIn 2010, Serco purchased Metropolis’ OfficeWatch Ultra call reporting software to help support their management team with the administration of their Avaya Aura Communication Manager phone system. With over 2,000 extensions to track, the implementation of OfficeWatch simplified the supervision of their customer service team’s productivity and made it easier for Serco to identify and report on outbound call efforts for clients.\nLaura Dollinger, CAB Administrator at Serco, explains, “Our clients are billed for their consulting time, and our internal departments are charged for their long distance costs.” With customizable rate tables in the software, Dollinger is able to set up different costs by division, hunt group, or even by individual client to “…recoup long distance charges, and set up departmental summaries to show the clients the calls made on their behalf.”\n.\nWhen Serco migrated to Metropolis’ XT Telemanagement in 2015, they were able to reveal more detailed information on the call activity of the entire call center. While OfficeWatch Ultra allowed users to pull reports in HTML format, XT allows Dollinger to export reports directly to a PDF, CSV, or Excel file with one click. “(With the classic software), we always had to convert the report to Excel ourselves. XT saves us a step.”\nThe XT Telemanagement system has enhanced enterprise-level functionality including improved customization options and upgraded automation tools that are run on a sophisticated database system, enabling XT to capture and reveal new fields of data. Serco utilizes vectors with their Communication Manager to set up teams and route calls based on which of their customer service representatives have received the proper training to handle those calls. After installation of XT Bruno Sannes, Serco’s Telecom Manager, gained insight into the path customers were taking to reach the agents, beginning in the auto attendant. “XT picks up our VDNs as extensions, so we can better manage our inbound calls. We can see right on the report how calls are being processed and which agent received a call. This includes calls to a voicemail port or to an ACD skill level.”\nThough the navigation in XT is designed to be very intuitive, Metropolis’ support team take great strides to setup and configure a client’s data and reports during each installation. Dollinger described, “(Metropolis’ Support Team) is very willing to transfer knowledge with their customers. They will teach you how to do things.”\nSannes concurred, “They know what they need to do and will call us back after an issue is resolved…The online training sessions are also very helpful. We attended a training session on the new platform and learned tips and tricks.”\nAs Serco continues to expand their global presence and evolve to continually meet their customer’s needs, XT Telemanagement will help them to sustain the oversight necessary to measure and report on the outcome of those changes on agent performance.\nFor more information about Serco Global Services, visit http://sercoglobal.com/.\nAbout Metropolis:\nFor over twenty years, Metropolis Technologies has provided advanced call accounting, 911/emergency management and telemanagement applications for businesses of all types in the US and abroad.
