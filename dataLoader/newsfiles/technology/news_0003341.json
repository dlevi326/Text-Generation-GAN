This version provides enhanced connectivity for users within an organization, resulting in invaluable customer insights from information locked within contractual documents. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140130/SF55291LOGO \nSalesforce.com is the world's leading CRM solution, and excels at managing customer activity and data. It can also store customer contracts, but a high percentage of those contracts are images, or non-searchable PDFs. In addition, all of the contractual information is captured as a small number of metadata fields that have to be manually entered and maintained. This often means specific contracts or data stored within Salesforce.com cannot be found using full text or concept searching. \nThe new Seal Software module enables businesses to locate existing contracts and extract key information that can then be uploaded to Salesforce.com, enriching their client data. By leveraging the capabilities of Seal Software, as new contracts are signed or amendments are made they can automatically be reflected in Salesforce.com. \nThis combination of Seal's and Salesforce.com's solutions to fully understand what is contained within contracts is helping companies: -- Obtain a complete and comprehensive view into customer relationships; -- Reduce the time salespeople spend chasing customer data so they can do more selling; -- Assist salespeople with new opportunities, including upsell, cross sell and renegotiation of terms; -- Uncover the possible use of non-standard language within sales contracts; -- Better understand renewal dates, auto-renewals and contract terms; -- Assess risk for many types of contractual provisions, including data breach obligations, IP protection, terms for conveniences, and other indemnifications; -- Understand the ordering and pricing incentives they've offered customers, including most-favored-nation (MFN), auto-renewals, dynamic pricing, etc.; and -- Ensure they are complying with changing GAAP and SOX 97-2 rules for revenue recognition. \nOrganizations can utilize the new Seal module by extracting all contracts within Salesforce.com and quickly turning them into searchable PDF files for placement back into the CRM system. This newest module can also extract contracts, and contractual terms and populate Salesforce.com with contract metadata. Finally, the module can be leveraged for ongoing management of contract data, working with Salesforce.com and synchronizing the metadata across both systems. \n\"The new Seal Software module for Salesforce.com makes it even easier to unlock and leverage all the essential intelligence about customer relationships,\" said Ulf Zetterberg, CEO of Seal Software. \"The technology is powerful, yet easy to use, and is everything our customers need to better support their customers, deliver on obligations, reduce organizational risk and uncover potential new opportunities from within their existing customer base. Our partnership with Salesforce.com is a testament to our best-in-class product and innovation in contract visibility and analytics, a market need that Seal Software identified and then developed a unique solution for five years ago.\" \nSeal Software has had a partnership relationship with Salesforce.com for more than two years, and both companies are users of each other's software. Seal is also an exhibitor at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference in San Francisco this week. \nSeal Software's new module for Salesforce.com is available now, and free for customers of Seal Software.
