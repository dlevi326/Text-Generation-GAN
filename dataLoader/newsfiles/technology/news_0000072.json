Less sexy is the increasingly critical element that helps them deliver that performance: the software.\nIn the case of Volkswagen AG, it was software that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says allowed about 500,000 U.S.-sold Volkswagen-made cars to run cleaner when they were being tested for emissions, compared with when they were actually being driven on the road.\nVolkswagen said Tuesday as many as 11 million vehicles could feature the software, which regulators have dubbed a \"defeat device.\" It also said it would take a EUR6.5-billion ($7.3 billion) provision in anticipation of legal and others costs to deal with the disclosure.\nA modern car can now feature as many as 20 million lines of software code, more than many airplanes, said Bodo Seifert, a U.S.-based automotive software expert. The software controls everything from running the engine, gearbox and diagnostics to more trivial items such as the radio and power windows. It can also help a car control the amount of pollutants it emits--by monitoring levels of things like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide--a byproduct of diesel-engine combustion. It can then figure out when to trap pollutants, or divert them through processes that can convert them into less-harmful substances to meet legal limits, according to Greg Schroeder, assistant director at the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research.\nAt different stages of engine use--for instance, idling versus cruising on the highway--engine combustion can create widely different levels of pollutants. Diesel engines don't emit much carbon monoxide, but they generally generate a greater amount of nitrogen oxide, or NOx--a component in acid rain and low-atmosphere ozone. In the U.S., where diesel passenger car sales are still comparatively modest, regulators have set far tougher NOx standards than in Europe, where they have long been more popular.\nIt is still unclear what the VW software in question did specifically to reduce emissions during testing. But by collating such data as tire rotation, steering, and use of the accelerator, a program could determine whether a car was being driven on the road or merely on a test bed at an emissions-testing station.\nIf such software sensed a lack of steering wheel inputs, for instance, it might have been able to predict it was being tested for emissions, and divert more pollutants to traps, treatment or conversion processes.\nVolkswagen hasn't named the specific software or component on the engine affected. On Tuesday, it said only its Type EA 189 engines--found in some diesel models like the Jetta--displayed \"a noticeable deviation between bench test results and actual road use,\" adding it was \"working intensely to eliminate these deviations through technical measures.\"\nExperts aren't even sure at this stage whether Volkswagen manufactured the software or components that have led to the discrepancy. Calibrating a third-party component or piece of software to respond in a certain way could be enough to make up for the discrepancy, experts say.\nGerman engineering company Robert Bosch GmbH said it made components for the Volkswagen cars now being probed. While the company said it \"develops injection and exhaust-gas treatment systems that can reduce emissions in every driving situation,\" the Stuttgart, Germany-based company added that \"responsibility for calibrating and integrating the components supplied by Bosch into the system as a whole lies with VW.\"\nChristopher Alessi contributed to this article.\nWrite to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"Volkswagen AG\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007664039\n 22, 2015 14:26 ET (18:26 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007664039"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T00:55:19.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
