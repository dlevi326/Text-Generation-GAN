The way I choose to see it is that we are equal not only in our rights but should consider our responsibility and bare in mind every culture is different but beautiful.\nThis hate that plagues this country is something that has been taught and handed down but should be forgotten.\nHistory should always remain in order to prevent us from repeating our mistakes.\nThis story of the students loosing their patience is outrages. This is an influence that is suppressing this marvelous country of ours.\nStudents have not spent enough time in school in order to deserve the reason to destroy statues or cause violence, this in patience that is spoken of is just a way for an angry country to vent its frustration.\nAll I know of apartheid is what I have been taught and what I have learnt along the way and this is true for students of all ages.\nThe problem does not come from the past or the Afrikaans language the issue that needs to be addressed is our governments way of solving situations and problems.\nThe Afrikaans language is dying very quickly even though it is such a young heritage.\nWhen I bleed my blood is the same colour as yours, that comes from my heart that beats just as yours does.\nThis desperation between each other is the only ignorance. We all love, cry, fear and laugh in the same way its time we join together instead of passing the blame.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T12:04:55.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
