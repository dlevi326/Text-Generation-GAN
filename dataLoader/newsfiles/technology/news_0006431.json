It exercises Java 7 and higher features, using the latest data formats (XML), communication using compression, and secure messaging. \nPerformance metrics are provided for both pure throughput and critical throughput under service-level agreements (SLAs), with response times ranging from 10 to 100 milliseconds. \nSPECjbb2015 supports multiple run configurations, enabling users to analyze and overcome bottlenecks at multiple layers of the system stack, including hardware, OS, JVM and application layers. \nReflecting the latest trends \n\"The new SPECjbb2015 benchmark reflects the movement toward virtualized hosts and performance trends related to containers, hypervisors, virtual machines and cloud computing,\" says Anil Kumar, chair of the SPEC Java committee. \"The faster response-time requirements and stricter results validation will help ensure a level playing field when evaluating the latest generation of physical and virtual Java environments.\" \nSPECjbb2015 replaces SPECjbb2013. It is expected to be used widely by all those interested in Java server performance, including JVM vendors, hardware developers, Java application developers, researchers and members of the academic community. SPEC members developing the new benchmark include HP, IBM, Intel, Lenovo, Oracle, Red Hat and VMware. \nAvailable now \nSPECjbb2015 is available immediately from SPEC for $1,500; discounts are available for qualified non-profit and accredited educational institutions. SPECjbb2013 license holders can receive a free copy of SPECjbb2015 upon request. \nFor more information, visit http://www.spec.org/jbb2015/ . \nAbout SPEC SPEC is a non-profit organization that establishes, maintains and endorses standardized benchmarks to evaluate performance for the newest generation of computing systems. Its membership comprises more than 100 leading computer hardware and software vendors, service providers, educational institutions, research organizations, and government agencies worldwide. \nCompany, product and service names mentioned herein may be the trademarks of their respective owners.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T09:25:13.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
