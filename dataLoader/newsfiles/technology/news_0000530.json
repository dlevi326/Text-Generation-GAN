That makes it appear about 14% larger and 30% brighter than it does at its apogee (the furthest point away from Earth.)Lunar eclipses happen when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, causing its shadow to fall over the Moon's surface. The refraction of light caused by this make the Moon appear dark and red, so the term \"blood moon\" is often used to describe an eclipse.People all over the world were able to catch the Lunar eclipse, sharing photos and comments over social media. Over 1.5 million tweets were sent out with the hashtag #SuperBloodMoon alone.If you missed the eclipse due to weather or timing, you've got a long time to wait until the next total supermoon eclipse - the next one doesn't happen until 2033. You don't have to wait quite as long for the next total lunar eclipse, though - those should occur in 2018 and 2019.Check out a gallery of some of the best eclipse images from around the world below.[gallery2012]", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/superbloodmoon"], "published": "2015-09-28T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T08:36:51.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
