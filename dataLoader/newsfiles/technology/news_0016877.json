Manipulating the irritating retargeting technology to its advantage, 3M —the company behind Post-Its—turned weakness to strength by placing an interactive spin on banner ads . \n“What if we could get rid of the evil part of this technology and keep all the good?” inquires a promotional video uploaded to Vimeo. \nCollaborating with Proximity Russia in a recent campaign as part of a case study, Post-It notes quickly took the country’s web by storm, reminding the Slavs both to buy more milk and that ad agencies are the devil. Rather than linking back to retailers competing for attention, 3M refurbished the links to direct users onto a private landing page wherein they could set and edit the notes that would appear in place of the commercials. \nIn the wake of the pay-to-remove-ads era, a service that’s both free and beneficial is a refreshingly innovative take on the matter. The move bares fruitful on part of Post-Its too, who’ve seen plummeting sales as society adopts screens in place of paper-rich content. \n“See? Maybe having banners follow you isn’t so bad after all.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:49:25.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
