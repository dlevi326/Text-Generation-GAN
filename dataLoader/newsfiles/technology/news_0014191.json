Adv. Thuli Mandosela, Joseph Mathunjwa and Musi Maimane are undisputed economical democrats who should be applauded for their bold stance on Jacob Zuma led regime The future of the South Africa does not lie in the hands of people like Vavi, Jim or Malema but in fair minded leaders like Mathunjwa, Mandosela and Maimane. What is the real truth for now is that Vavi, Jim and Malema have shrunken and only those believing that a rock can produce water will continue to support him.\nVavi, Jim and Malema are not a trademark that is worth funding or to expect to win future elections bearing in mind all the scandals they were involved in with previously. Malema is likely to be left with the smallest party since those calling for his ouster are powerful individuals.Mpho Ramakatsa and Andile Mngxitama are key members of the party and productive resources of the party that deserve esteem moderately than exploitation.\nAntiquity should judge Malema for now and those with eyes to see and brains will fathom why prevailing founder members of the party like Kenny Kunene, Mpho Ramakatsa, Andile Mngxitama and others discarded him. Thuli Mandosela is one leader with surefire aptitude to lead South Africa and transformation any game blueprint in order to yield outcomes. Malema has turned the EFF into his personal political party. While the ANC led government’s parliamentarians’ are largely made up of people who are over 60 years of age yet the Constitution stipulates that the pensionable age of a South African is 60 eons.\nWe are bombardment ourselves in the foot. A study of the maximum régime workers displays they are past their retirement age. Infact, if they were medicine prescribed by a doctor, South African could be taking expired medication. This makes voting for an over 60-year-old a sarcasm of one’s acumen. Exoticism creates its titleholder an obligation. The fee salaried is extraordinary. If folks deliberate accomplishment sophisticated is posh, let them try inexperience.\nWhat is also bothersome is how and why pension frames endure to gage and deduct dues from these illegal workers. To stop corruption, we need people of a good moral standing like Thulisile Mandosela. Such people must form an anti-corruption body which is independent.As long as we have corrupt people in our midst, we will not change anything, and it will end up as window dressing. It is one thing to categorize a wrong and it is quite another to put it right. In squat, we prerequisite to see action not lip service. And every Tom, Dick, and Harry ( everyone) must be transported under the microscope. No sacrosanct encyclicals or bullies.\nAuthor: Adam SibuyiMobile ID: +27 81 830 1974Email ID: adamsibuyi.myo@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:11:44.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
