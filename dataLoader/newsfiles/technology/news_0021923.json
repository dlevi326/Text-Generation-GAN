He clicks on one of the names - a holding company . According to its status with the registrar of companies, the holding company no longer exists, having been merged with another company some time ago.But its name still appears in the list of shareholders. \"If this company wasn't listed, and was approaching a bank for a loan? Information like this on demand can save so much time and trouble,\" he says. Ravishankar is talking about Probe42, a platform that collates information on companies - public and private, listed and unlisted from a number of sources, including the ROC, defaulter's lists, public filings and so on. It also adds a layer of analysis and makes it available on demand to customers. \"Our company is called Probe. You know that in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the answer to the question of life, the universe and everything is 42 - though no one knows what the question is. So, in our way, we're just saying that our platform is the answer - whatever be your question,\" says Probe CEO Atul Shinghal. Ravishankar founded Probe Equity Research in 2005. Shinghal took over as CEO in 2011. The founders pitched the idea of the data platform to Accel Partners and received seed funding towards the end of that year. \"There are some key differences between us and a service like Capitaline,\" says Shinghal, referring to the listed company financial database. \"One, their focus is on the financial statements of listed companies. Our data is broader.Two, we have information on unlisted and private limited companies as well. And it's information on demand, in realtime.\" \"See, one of the biggest problems facing banks today is that of non-performing assets (NPAs). We provide information that al lows banks to identify potential defaulters during evaluation. We offer prevention,\" says Ravishankar. The duo say that they are at various stages of engagement with several of India's top banks for the platform. \"We've also managed to have one of India's largest public sector banks looking at our product,\" says Shinghal. Ashish Dikshit, CEO of Madura Fashion and Lifestyle, has been using the platform for the past year.\"Probe allows us to evaluate the financial viability of our partners - we deal with a number of unlisted companies as suppliers and partners - franchisees, distributors and so on. It gives us the kind of information normally available on listed companies, and it's very easy to use,\" he says. \"Being an entrepreneur is hard work. Most of the time, the only thing that keeps you going is the amount of faith you have in your idea. You have to keep believing,\" says Ravishankar. He has one last list to display. \"If you want to find out all the company boards a person has been on, you just ask,\" he says as he pulls up a list of HR and media companies, quite a few of them defunct. The name he's punched in is Indrani Mukherjea. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=W S Ravishankar,Probe CEO Atul Shinghal,iPad  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T04:11:35.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
