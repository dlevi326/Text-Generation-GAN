If one node fails or loses connectivity, traffic fails over to the remaining n-Share nodes seamlessly, without experiencing downtime or loss of network connections. n-Share is engineered to scale in a virtually limitless fashion while being able to be managed as a single application. For more information about NetSapiens n-Share, download the high availability whitepaper .\n“NetSapiens is in the business of helping service providers grow and One Source Networks is certainly a success story,” says Dave Privee, VP of Sales and Marketing for NetSapiens. “We are pleased that n-Share is helping OSN to achieve the highest level of availability for their hosted voice services, as they grow their global voice network.”\nOSN’s global voice network now spans nine nodes across five continents. The network architecture is based on Sonus SBC 5210 and 7000 session border controllers for unlimited scalability and has also been certified for interoperability with Microsoft Lync 2013 and Avaya.\n“We have deployed NetSapiens n-Share, in conjunction with our Sonus-based voice network, to ensure consistent, high quality delivery of services like voice and UC to our enterprise clients,” commented Jamie Pugh, vice president of engineering, One Source Networks. “n-Share is helping us achieve geo-diversity by dynamically distributing information from one PoP to another. This has provided us with peace-of-mind and increased network resiliency as we continue to expand.”\nAbout One Source Networks\nOne Source Networks (OSN) is a leading managed communications partner to the world’s largest enterprises.
