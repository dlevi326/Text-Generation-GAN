RELATED By Prabha Raghavan NEW DELHI: Tejinder Singh is a big fan of pop-up stores — shops that sprout seemingly out of nowhere but are nowadays likely to be carefully stage-managed through artful social media promotions. \"You can pop up out of anywhere, fold up and then go to the next location,\" said the chief operating officer of omni-channel customized clothing brand Creyate. \"We've sold a suit worth Rs 80,000 through a home visit booked at our pop-up in Elante Mall (in Chandigarh).\" Increasingly, pop-up is also where online meets offline. Take FabAlley, which has chosen to stand the concept on its head. Its pop-up store at Delhi's DLF Place mall in Saket looks nothing like a temporary fixture — mannequins greet customers from behind a glass wall and a changing room at the back allows customers to try on outfits hanging from racks neatly lined up in the centre of the 350-sq ft space. There's even a glow sign at the entrance. \"We are not at premium malls just to be there, it is to get noticed. This is where our primary target shops,\" said FabAlley co-founder Tanvi Malik. Poor brand visibility, low consumer confidence and the inability to access most of their target consumers have pushed e-tailers towards using pop-up stores to attract customers offline. Even online furniture marketplace Pepperfry, which has focussed on marketing extensively through advertisements, has had year-long 100-150-sq ft pop-up displays in the Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru airports. Usually set up for a short period — anywhere between a few days to some months — pop-up stores help brands achieve wider reach without binding them to a location. While e-commerce brands have popped up in commercial and corporate spaces using temporary fixtures, many like FabAlley, Freecultr and Creyate are slowly turning to a permanent look with their pop-ups by renting store space on short-term leases. These kinds of pop-ups help such brands test the waters before they expand to the offline market. Online only accounts for less than 2-3% of sales across the country, according to Arvind Singhal, chief executive officer of consultancy firm Technopak. \"It is a good strategy to be there in a temporary capacity,\" said Freecultr co-founder and chief executive officer Sandeep Singh. The brand has been extending its popup store's lease in DLF Place Saket for the past one and a half years. It plans on opening a few pop-up experiential stores for its latest venture, Freecultr Express, which will predominantly be an online store. E-tailers believe pop-up stores help boost consumer confidence in their brand by letting shoppers check product quality. With most brands facing a shopping cart abandonment rate of 25-30%, they feel that having a touch-and-feel experience of the product makes customers surer of their purchase. \"I can zoom in as much as I want, but I will never know what the product is like until I see it in my hand,\" said FabAlley's Malik. The brand, which is opening a second pop-up store in DLF Promenade this Friday, also plans on expanding to malls in Mumbai and Bengaluru by the end of the financial year. Malls also consider temporary lease pop-up stores to be a better option than entering into a long-term agreement. \"It's not nice to get stuck with certain brands that may not do well,\" said DLF Promenade mall head Dinaz Madhukar. More e-tailing brands like Harpa Retail plan on opening pop-ups in the coming year to put their names on the map. \"We feel it is much better to open stores than to blow money on marketing,\" said Harpa Retail managing director Gurpreet Rangi. Apparel brands like Harpa that otherwise rely on e-commerce portals such as Jabong see pop-ups as allowing them freedom to showcase products the way they want to. The brand, which estimates offline sales to contribute 40% of its revenue in the future, plans to set up 10 stores in malls across the country and will be using pop-ups to test the market in cities it isn't familiar with. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Pepperfry,Jabong,FreeCultr,FabAlley,e-commerce  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T13:56:34.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
