Screens remain at 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches diagonally, but they have new technology offering shortcuts to frequent tasks. If you chop off the sides to match the iPhone's 4-by-3 ratio, resolution is about the same. Orange construction barriers look red using Samsung's Galaxy S6 phone, while a greenish statue came out grey. For video, the iPhone catches up with several Android phones and can now record at Ultra HD, also known as 4K. [...] images on the front camera improve to 5 megapixels, from 1.2 megapixels, matching Samsung's phones. Better yet, the new iPhone's screen functions as a flash so faces come out when snapping selfies in bars and other low-light settings. Imagine taking a shot of your kid blowing out birthday candles, then tapping the screen to see it in action. Press a bit harder on an app icon to access a contextual menu, similar to right-clicking the mouse on Windows computers. Inside, the chips are laid out differently to improve battery performance and let you activate the Siri voice assistant simply by saying, \"Hey, Siri.\" With Live Photos and 4K videos, your phone will fill up even more quickly, even with better compression to compensate for the higher resolution and animation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:08:54.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
