This is the result of a confluence of factors,\" the study found. \n\"The ubiquity of e- books means that online book piracy is more of a threat than it was in 2009. We've seen major consolidation within the traditional publishing industry, which means less diversity among publishers and their increased focus on the bottom line.\" \nTraditional publishers' dominance of the marketplace meanwhile is being eroded by the rise of self-publishing, the study noted. \nThe report also singled out Amazon—a frequent target of the writers' group—saying its dominance has led to the shuttering of thousands of brick and mortar bookstores and has \"made the business of authorship both more diverse and less profitable than it was six years ago.\" \nPublishers Weekly, which first reported the findings, said the study found a majority of authors would be living below the US poverty line if they relied solely on income from their writing. \n\"The picture's not pretty, but there are silver linings,\" the study said. \n\"The rise of hybrid authorship is an exciting development: authors can now have more freedom in choosing a method of publication and promotion that suits the needs of the specific book they're trying to market.\" \nAnd it noted that \"the opportunities for author-reader engagement are unsurpassed in the history of book publishing—even if this engagement competes with an author's writing time.\" Hachette pushes back after Amazon alleges price fixing August 11, 2014 \nHachette Book Group defended itself Sunday against accusations of pushing up prices for e-books amid a simmering dispute with online retail giant Amazon.
