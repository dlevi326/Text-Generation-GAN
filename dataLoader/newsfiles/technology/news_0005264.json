Yes, no more waiting for your contract to end. Now you can always have the latest iPhone - on the network that has the largest 4G LTE coverage in America. The new program allows you to turn in your phone and upgrade to a new iPhone every year. If you pre-ordered an iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, you're automatically enrolled in this program if you've elected the Device Payment option. If you're not interested in upgrading, you still have the option to pay your phone off in 24 low monthly payments. That's a better option than those \"lease plans\" offered by other companies, which can include surprise balloon payments just 18 months into your agreement, or ask you to turn over your phone without getting anything for it. Not with Verizon and thinking about joining America's largest and most reliable 4G LTE network? You can get up to $400 when you switch and trade in your old smartphone.
