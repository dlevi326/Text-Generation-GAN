Recently, the Universal prequel movie Kong: Skull Island that is supposed to be set in the 1970s jumped over to another major studio, Warner Bros. This is notable because Warner Bros produced last year’s American Godzilla reboot and is planning to put a Godzilla sequel in theaters in 2018. The rumor that came along with Skull Island ’s lateral move was that the King of the Monsters and the King of the Apes would face off in the 21st Century . \nNew insights reveal that the whole affair is much more complex than we initially thought and mostly has to do with Universal and Warner Bros relationship to the production company Legendary Pictures. Legendary has had quite the success with giant monsters, producing Pacific Rim and Godzilla with Warner Bros before making a deal with Universal to co-finance Jurassic World in return for a large chunk of the film’s profits. All three of those films did well internationally, even if Legendary’s other output has been less successful in the US. \nKong was being produced at Universal as part of a five-year deal between Legendary and the movie studio that only began in 2014. The movies Legendary has released through Universal under that deal haven’t done so well at the box office, like Blackhat and Seventh Son earlier this year. Suddenly, spending $125 million dollars on a King Kong prequel movie that had been having some pre-production frustrations didn’t look as good. Development wise, Universal seems to be concerned with two of the Legendary movies they co-financed, the upcoming CGI-made Warcraft by Duncan Jones and a Matt Damon sci-fi film The Great Wall . They’re described as “problem movies” in the report. \nGodzilla , made before Legendary’s deal with Universal when the production company primarily worked with Warner was a relatively large hit for the studio, making over half a billion worldwide. Warner Bros was quick to get director Gareth Edwards to commit to a sequel, even as he took on the duties of directing a Star Wars spin-off movie, Rogue One . Edwards will presumably move from post-production on Rogue One to the Godzilla sequel because Warner Bros wants a follow-up for 2018. \nWhat appears to have happened is that Universal balked at Legendary’s Kong: Skull Island script that not only had a large budget but referenced Project Monarch, the organization Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins characters worked for in Godzilla that had been tracking giant monsters. Universal opted out of participating in Skull Island , so Legendary who had a relationship with Warner Bros for Godzilla 2 spun that sequel deal into a three picture deal: Skull Island, Godzilla 2 , and a movie that would feature both monsters. \nPresumably all three of these films will be co-financed by Warner Bros. Thomas Tull the CEO of Legendary Pictures apparently wanted Universal to pitch in 25% of Skull Island ’s budget. Right now, we don’t know if adding two more giant monster movies onto that makes the percentage go up or down. via DeviantArt \nAt the moment, the plan seems to be to create a monster cinematic universe around the Monarch organization that has been around since at least the 1970s cataloging giant monsters that can fight Godzilla. Then again, when a King Kong small enough to climb the Empire State Building happens across Warner Bros’ Godzilla capable of knocking over the Empire State Building, they may not be enemies according to this odd paragraph in The Hollywood Reporter : \nA threshold problem is that Kong supposedly is much smaller than Godzilla. That fact was not lost on Universal. “There were funny comments about him having to be the size of the Empire State Building instead of hanging off of it,” says a studio insider. But a source close to Tull says Legendary is confident it can come up with a rationale to explain how Kong and Godzilla can do battle — and possibly become allies. \n“Can come up with a rationale” sounds a lot like they haven’t thought of it before now. That’s a bit concerning. The allies thing…well, that movie is at least four years away. \nOther than Kong and Godzilla revelations, the article also backs up recent internet rumors that Pacific Rim 2 had shut down. The sequel to Guillermo del Toro’s kaiju project was supposed to shoot for a 2017 release just like Kong , but Legendary has stopped production and may not pick it up again. That plus the news that Universal considers Warcraft a problem movie are both horrible developments. \nOn the plus side, there could be a movie where King Kong saddles up on Godzilla’s back to fight King Ghidorah.
