This product series supports Jumbo Frames up to 9.6Kbytes, and it provides high EFT, surge (2,000VDC) and ESD (6,000VDC) protection. In addition, all units have a dual power input design with a reverse polarity protection and a relay warning function to alert maintainers when any ports break or power failures occur. This makes it ideal for applications in a harsh environment requiring high reliability and distance extension capability. \nLMP-1002G-SFP and LMP-1002G-SFP-24 series have been designed to fulfill outdoor industrial automation application environments. Some of these environments include: high density traffic control equipment within ITS applications, remote PoE wireless radios, security surveillance systems, GigE vision systems, and quality inspection systems within factory automation. \nThis product series is pre-loaded with “Layer 2” network management software, of which, it supports the ease of use Web Console or Telnet using a serial console by CLI configuration. All Antaira managed switches provide the ring network redundancy function with STP/RSTP/MSTP and the ITU-T G.8032 (ERPS – Ethernet Ring Protection Switch) protocol which supports a <50ms network recovery time, eliminating the compatibility issue for any present networking concerns. The advanced network filtering and security functions, IGMP, VLAN, QoS, SNMP, Port lock, RMON, Modbus TCP and 802.1X/HTTPS/SSH/SSL increase determinism and improve network management for remote SCADA systems or control network. Plus, the advanced PoE ping alarm software function allows users to recycle power on any remote powered device (PD) through PoE ports. The external USB2.0 port allows users to export and save all the configuration settings. Lastly, the flexible “custom label” feature allows networking planners to name each connection port. By naming each port, the networking planners can easily manage remote field devices. \nThe LMP-1002G-SFP and LMP-1002G-SFP-24 series is backed by a 5-year warranty and the units are IP30 rated, compact, fanless, and DIN-Rail/wall mountable. Each unit is built to withstand industrial networking hazards like shock, drop, vibration, electromagnetic interference (EMI) and extreme temperatures. There are two operating temperature version models for either standard temperature (-10 ~ 70°C) or extended temperature (-40 ~ 75°C). The models have the dimensions of 46mm (W) x 99mm (D) x 142mm (H) and a unit weight of less than two pounds. \nAbout Antaira Technologies \nAntaira Technologies is a global leading developer and supplier that provides high-quality industrial networking and communication product solutions.
