CNET\nOyster, a subscription service for e-books that launched two years ago, is calling it quits.\nThe service's founders announced in a company blog post Monday that it will move toward retiring the existing service in the next few months. The blog post did not give a reason for the closure but hinted that there were other ambitions for the service.\n\"We believe more than ever that the phone will be the primary reading device globally over the next decade,\" they wrote. \"Looking forward, we feel this is best seized by taking on new opportunities to fully realize our vision for ebooks.\"\nRepresentatives for the New York-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOyster, which was founded in 2012 and launched its service a year later, took a novel approach to the ebook market, formerly offering only a subscription book service for $9.95 a month. The idea attracted the attention of Amazon, which last year launched a rival subscription service dubbed Kindle Unlimited that offered all-you-can-eat e-books and audiobooks for $9.99 per month.\nDespite Amazon's entry into subscription ebook market, Oyster's model did little to replace traditional book sales, mostly because binge-reading is more difficult than binge-watching movies. Consumers, who are flocking to other subscription services like Netflix and Spotify, appear reluctant to sign up to the equivalent for books. Even Amazon has declined to discuss how well its service is performing.\nOyster, which had raised $17 million, changed it model in April when it announced an expansion into online retail with an e-book store that would sell individual books, with hopes of attracting new customers to its service.\nOyster's move came at an auspicious time for the book industry, where publishers have begun setting prices evenly across the e-book market. By expanding into online sales, Oyster was gunning for Amazon, a juggernaut in the e-book industry, estimated to control more than half the US e-book market and even more abroad.\nHowever, Oyster did make early headway within the book industry by signing up three of the five biggest US publishers, amassing a library of more than 1 million titles. But even these publishers have chosen to wait as long as six months to release their newest titles on subscription services like Oyster.\nOyster users could also only access the service through an app for smartphones, tablets and computers -- but not Amazon's popular Kindle e-reader. (Oyster does have an app for the Amazon's Fire tablet , though).", "external_links": ["http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/01/c37f1aba-a68d-42c6-9a2e-e2b5ae08eb3f/resize/570xauto/fffc3dfc0bf0132c6a7776183f933303/large-hero-oyster-androidpromo.jpg", "http://blog.oysterbooks.com/"], "published": "2015-09-22T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T04:21:27.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
