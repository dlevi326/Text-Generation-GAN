Coupled with Hillcrest's Freespace motion software, ZTE's phones now provide more advanced, value-added features, such as always-on context awareness, gesture recognition and activity tracking, while delivering industry-leading sensor fusion, heading and motion tracking functions that are required to power all of the standard and third-party applications that rely on the Android® Lollipop sensor API. \n\"We are very proud to have been selected by ZTE to deliver a differentiated sensor-enabled user experience for its flagship smartphone lines,\" said Chad Lucien, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Hillcrest Labs. \"With our latest integration with ZTE, Hillcrest's technology is now used by some of the largest China-based handset manufacturers. This is a real testament to the product innovation being delivered by market leaders like ZTE.\" \n\"At ZTE, we are committed to delivering the best performance and capabilities across our smartphone lines, and sensors are critical to differentiate our functionality,\" said Adam Zeng, CEO of ZTE Mobile Devices at ZTE Corporation. \"As such, we are working with leaders like Hillcrest Labs to incorporate high performance sensors that provide ultimate power efficiency and always-on features.\" \nSensor hubs are a separate class of processors, uniquely enabled by specialized software and algorithms, that are designed to offload sensor management from the main processor for mobile phones and other devices. Hillcrest's Freespace sensor hub software reduces the power requirements to add always-on sensing capabilities in ZTE's smartphone lines. In addition, Hillcrest's proprietary motion detection algorithms are able to accurately detect user movements and device context to ensure an intuitive user experience. For instance, Hillcrest's Freespace motion software allows gestures to be used as shortcuts to common user interactions, and enables sensor processing to automatically adjust the user experience based on context (i.e. phone movement, positioning, etc.). One example of how ZTE has used Hillcrest's software is to enable a user to simply lift the device to their ear to answer a phone call, without having to activate the touch screen or unlock the device. \nFor more information about ZTE, visit: www.ZTEdevices.com .
