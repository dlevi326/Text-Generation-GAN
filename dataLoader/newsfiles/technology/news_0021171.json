Valeant and Astra will also share profits on sales of the drug.\nUnder the deal, Valeant said it will assume all development costs associated with the regulatory approval for brodalumab. It plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval in the U.S. and EU in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe Canada-based company will hold the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize brodalumab globally, except in Japan and certain other Asian countries where rights are held by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. under a prior arrangement with Amgen, which first developed brodalumab.\nAmgen pulled out of its own collaboration with AstraZeneca in May. The company cited \"events of suicidal ideation and behavior\" during clinical trials of brodalumab. The U.S. biotechnology company said these events would lead to restrictive labeling.\nAt the time, Astra said it would stick with the drug, pointing to positive phase-three trial data.\nAstra Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said the new agreement with Valeant would \"help to bring brodalumab to patients with psoriasis who need new treatment options through Valeant's expert focus on dermatology.\"\nBrodalumab is \"potentially the most efficacious therapy yet for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis,\" said J. Michael Pearson, Valeant Chairman and CEO.\nWrite to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com\nSeptember 01, 2015 03:55 ET (07:55 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:49:46.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
