In separate reports released Sunday, Internet watchdog group Citizen Lab and German software auditing company Cure53 said they found a catalog of worrying problems with \"Smart Sheriff,\" the most popular of more than a dozen child monitoring programs that South Korea requires for new smartphones sold to minors. Smart Sheriff and its fellow surveillance apps are meant to serve as electronic baby sitters, letting parents know how much time their children are spending with their phones, keeping kids off objectionable websites and even alerting parents if their children send or receive messages with words like \"bully\" or \"pregnancy.\" Sometime afterward, Citizen Lab, based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, and Cure53, acting on a request from the Washington-based Open Technology Fund, began sifting through Smart Sheriff's code. Children's phone numbers, birth dates, web browsing history and other personal data were being sent across the Internet unencrypted, making them easy to intercept. [...] Citizen Lab Director Ronald Deibert said Smart Sheriff, a government-mandated program intended to monitor the intimate moments of so many children's lives, merited special scrutiny. Park, the law professor, said the security flaws should push the government \"to revisit the whole idea of requiring a personal communication device to be equipped with software that allows another person to monitor and control that device.\" Yoon Jiwon told The Associated Press that she had previously been put off by the way in which the battery-hungry app kept sending her misleading alerts about her sons being bullied, prompting her to cross-examine them about each chat and text message, breeding frustration and mistrust. »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T07:18:41.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
