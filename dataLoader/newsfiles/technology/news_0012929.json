Picture: BLOOMBERG Related articles Sisi swears in new Egypt government Egypt to return to international bond market in first half of 2016 WHEN an ancient Egyptian statue was put up for sale by a British museum, the government in Cairo called for its rescue on behalf of the nation — without offering to put up the cash itself.\nInstead, the minister for antiquities urged Egyptians to dip into their pockets and buy it. He was following his boss’s example: such appeals have become a policy trademark under President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi.\nThe former general raised more than $8bn to expand the Suez Canal by selling investment certificates to the public, and may be tempted to repeat the formula.\nSisi is touting a series of megaprojects to revive Egypt’s economy, from widening the Suez Canal to reclaiming swaths of desert and building a new capital east of Cairo. But who will pay for them?\nEgypt has one of the region’s biggest budget deficits, capping its ability to sell more bonds. And the Gulf nations that backed Sisi through the turmoil of recent years may be looking to scale back aid, as the oil slump hits their own finances.\n\"Funding will be a problem,\" says Edward Coughlan, head of Middle East and North Africa analysis at BMI Research, a unit of Fitch Group. \"Egypt’s dire fiscal position does not allow for much more debt — either domestic or international.\"\nThat’s why the president is turning to the public — even though average income is only about $3,000 a year in an economy that has faltered amid political turmoil.\nThe budget deficit soared above 10% of output after the uprising of 2011 and stayed there, debt is nearing 100% of gross domestic product, and the central bank had to deplete reserves to prop up the Egyptian pound.\nThere have been signs of recovery lately. Growth edged above 4% in the past fiscal year for the first time since 2011, according to the International Monetary Fund.\nTo maintain the momentum, the government will have to keep spending, says Hany Genena, chief economist at Cairo investment bank Pharos Holding.\nIt is state-led projects, such as the Suez overhaul, along with new roads and power plants, that are driving the rebound, he says — and that makes it fragile.\n\"It’s worrying that in the coming six months or year, we’re relying on a single entity, the government, whose capacity is limited given the availability of financing,\" Genena says.\nSisi’s crowdfunding drive began shortly after he took office in June last year. He set up a fund to collect contributions, naming it Tahya Masr — Long Live Egypt — and primarily targeting wealthier Egyptians. Leading by example, Sisi pledged half of his monthly salary E£42,000 ($5,364), along with half of his assets.\n\"I swear to God, if I had $100bn I wouldn’t think twice, I’d give it to Egypt,\" Sisi told local businessmen during a meeting in June, according to El Watan newspaper.\nA year after its foundation, the fund has only E£6.75bn, less than 1% of total state spending, according to the newspaper.\nPresidency spokesman Alaa Youssef did not answer phone calls or a text message seeking comment on the issue.\nThe biggest success for Sisi’s crowdfunding was when he offered something in return. Egyptians snapped up in less than a weekE£64-billion of special investment certificates, issued to fund the Suez expansion. They pay a 12% annual interest rate and aren’t traded on secondary markets. Only Egyptian individuals and institutions were allowed to subscribe.\nThe government might issue more certificates to fund the planned new capital city, Al Mal newspaper reported.\nSuch instruments \"are an alternative source of liquidity that doesn’t necessarily come from the banking sector\", says Razan Nasser, senior Middle East and North Africa economist at HSBC Holdings in Dubai, adding that, \"some people use the money from under their mattresses\".\nThere are other advantages for the government. Borrowing through that channel doesn’t show up on the official budget, so it avoids making already bad metrics look worse, according to Coughlan.\n\"The debt raised is less susceptible to rising global interest rates and investor sentiment towards Egypt,\" he adds. \"There’s an element of patriotism when it comes to some emerging markets, so it’s often cheaper to raise debt that way.\" Coughlan predicts more such sales.\nBy contrast, the effort to raise cash for the Pharaonic statue — an image of the scribe Sekhemka, carved from garnet about 4,500 years ago — was a flop. The Northampton Museum has sold it to an anonymous private collector.\n\"There was little hope of saving the statue to begin with,\" says Moushira Moussa, a spokeswoman for the Egyptian Antiquities Ministry. \"Now it is lost forever.\"\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:25:10.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
