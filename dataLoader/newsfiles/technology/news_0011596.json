My name is Chris Schulz and I'm here to help you. I ran a successful Computer Repair Business for a span of about 4 years. Being employed at the same time at a corporate job leading a team of 4 employees, busting my butt there then heading out to take care of my Computer Repair clients took up a lot of my time. Trading my time for money was definitely not my idea of living life. With myself nearing the age of 40 I knew I had to take action in a different direction. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed earning two income streams, yet I was not having the free time to enjoy the money. Having the ability to only travel three times from the ages 25-36 (12 years) I was sick of the grind. How did things change? I had known since I was young boy that the live's I was seeing others live was not going to be my destiny. My change all started with the realization that the information I was programmed with since a young boy had not served me well. You may have had your parents and society in general also poisoning your fertile mind with things like, ''Money doesn't grow on trees'' or ''Get a good education and get a good job'' or ''Money is the root of all evil''. This programming has been poisoning the minds of society for a century now. Time's have changed and I took a hold of a growing industry knowing it would be my way out of the rat race, set my own schedule, and travel when I want where I want with who I want. Back in 2012 I fired my boss, packed 2 suitcases, moved to South America to be with my sweetheart, got married, & haven't looked back. My motivation changed over the years from wanting to make money to paying it forward to help others live life on their terms. It's time for YOU to break free from corporate slavery and go after your dreams. Contact me by TXT ONLY at (226)240-4156 or Call at 1-713-714-5221.
