For school-age kids, Kurio Smart is a great first computer and educational tool that takes them seamlessly from homework to play. For younger children, Kurio Xtreme 2 is the safest, most fun, full-featured Android tablet built especially for kids, offering kids access to the apps and games they love and giving parents peace of mind. The two new Kurio devices are now available for purchase in the U.S. \nKurio Smart(TM) Windows Tablet \n\"In doing our market research, we've found that 3, 4 and 5 year olds represent about half the kid tablet users, demonstrating a void in the market for 8 to 12 year olds up until now,\" said Eric Levin, Kurio strategic director. \"We believe one of the reasons for that is because that's about the age when kids need productivity solutions for schoolwork and they start asking for 'my first computer.' We've worked with Microsoft to create Kurio Smart, the first Windows 2-in-1 hybrid device specifically designed for kids, giving them everything they want in a first computer for less than $200.\" \nKurio Smart is a sleek, lightweight and portable Windows tablet-and-laptop-in-one with a 9\" touchscreen and a detachable, magnetic keyboard that closes up to become a hard carry case. It includes a one-year free subscription to Microsoft Office, 32GB of internal memory (expandable by 32GB with microSD card) and up to one terabyte of One Drive cloud storage, plus more than 40 preloaded apps and games (a $200 value) for out-of-the-box play. \nKurio Smart is perfect for writing papers, reading e-books, studying and safely browsing the web. Providing hours of after-school entertainment, Kurio Smart also allows kids to take photos and videos, stream music and videos from Spotify, YouTube Kids and Netflix, Skype and stay connected with kid-safe email. Parents can access hundreds of thousands more apps through the Windows Store. \nLike all Kurio kid tablets, Kurio Smart comes with powerful parental controls to put mom's and dad's minds at ease. Microsoft's Family Safety system allows parents to determine the websites, apps and games their kids can use, monitor kids' usage and also set time limits. \nKurio Smart features a Quad-core Intel Bay Trail-T processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0., front and rear-facing cameras, a micro USB port, and a micro HDMI port, which allows the device to be connected to a TV. Initial units will ship with Windows 8.1 OS (users can easily upgrade to Windows 10) and a free year of Microsoft Office 365 Personal; units produced after September will come with Windows 10 and the new Microsoft Office Mobile apps. \nAppropriate for kids ages 6 and up, Kurio Smart, is now available in blue/white and pink/white at Toys\"R\"Us stores across the U.S. and online at Toysrus.com/Kurio . \nKurio Xtreme 2(TM) Android Tablet \n\"This year, we're introducing our fourth-generation 7-inch Android tablet and, thanks to the great feedback we've received from our Kurio customers, we've implemented some new features that we feel takes our offering to the next level,\" said Eric Levin, Kurio strategic director. \"Kurio Xtreme 2 is our safest, most advanced, durable, content-loaded, Android kid tablet yet, offering tremendous value at just $129.99.\" \nKurio Xtreme 2, a full-featured Android 5.0 (Lollipop) kid tablet, combines a new, modern design and the most advanced tablet technology with kid-tough features. It includes a protective bumper that is reinforced in the corners to protect against drops or spills, and also ships with a shatter-proof screen protector for increased durability. Xtreme 2 also has a kickstand built in, so that today's on-the-go kids can comfortably watch movies, read e-books and play the games they love, anywhere. \nThe stand is perfect for playing Kurio's exclusive Kurio Motion body-movement-controlled games that will have kids up off the couch--running, jumping and dancing in front of their tablets. All-new Kurio Motion 2.0 multiplayer games--found in the \"Extreme\" and \"Playground\" Motion game packs--allow kids to play cooperatively and competitively as they knock baseballs out of the park, raft down rivers, race drones, show off their dance moves and more. Thanks to the micro HDMI port, the Xtreme 2 can be connected to the TV so that that the entire family can gather in the family room and compete head-to-head in any of the 18 exclusive Kurio Motion games included. \nKurio Xtreme 2 comes preloaded with more than 60 apps (a $300 value) for out-of-the-box play, including some of the most popular gaming apps: Subway Surfers(TM), Berry Rush(TM) and Zombie Tsunami(TM). Kids can also stream music and videos from Spotify, YouTube Kids, Toon Goggles and Netflix, Skype and stay connected with kid-safe email. Plus, with parents' permission, kids can access millions more apps through the Google Play store. \nAs always, Kurio tablets let parents customize their child's tablet experience in a password-protected Parental Area, setting time controls, managing apps and determining web access for up to eight user profiles. The proprietary Kurio Genius Internet filtering system allows kids to safely search the web, covering more than 500 million websites in 170 languages and providing in-app web filtering to block inappropriate content. \nParents can also access Kurio SOS, Kurio's live, instant 24/7 customer care service right from the tablet. Kurio SOS offers free, unlimited live chat sessions with a tech expert--and Kurio's technicians, based right in the U.S., can actually remotely takeover the device and resolve any issues that may arise. This way, the kids can get back to their tablet and parents can look like tech support superheroes. \nKurio Xtreme 2 features a MediatekÂ© MTK8127(TM) Quad-core processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, 16 GB of internal memory (expandable by 32GB with microSD card), front and rear-facing cameras, micro HDMI and micro USB ports. \nAppropriate for children ages 3 and up, Kurio Xtreme 2 comes in blue and is available in stores and online at major retailers across the U.S. A pink edition is available exclusively at Toys\"R\"Us stores and online at Toysrus.com/Kurio . \nAbout KD Interactive KD Interactive, a division of KD Group, is made up of an international team of specialists, including engineers, educators and scientists to ensure the highest possible quality of products for children.
