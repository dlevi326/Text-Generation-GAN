LOUIS, MO, September 26,   The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center's Maker Group will host their second St. Louis Raspberry Pi Jam, an interactive community event on Saturday, October 3, 2015 from 1 P.M. - 5 P.M. This free event is open to all ages, families, engineers, science and robot enthusiasts, and educators. During the STEM event, demonstrations and activities by local makers and robotic groups will showcase and explore the use of Raspberry Pi microcomputers. The low-cost hardware and software engineering tools along with other maker projects will provide a day of collaborative science and fun. \"Many educators in our area are finding new ways to incorporate educational hardware into their curriculum,\" explained the Center's Maker Group cofounder, Malia Gehan, Ph.D. \"The grant from the Raspberry Pi Foundation assists our goal of demonstrating how low-cost computers can be used for hands-on education and invite the public to learn more about these microcomputers.\" The Maker Movement is a growing trend with a global community of hobbyists and professional inventors, designers, engineers, artists, programmers, and tinkerers. Maker spaces are popping up across the country in libraries, museums, community centers, and schools--giving people of all ages access to mentorship, programs and tools like 3-D printers and scanners, laser cutters, microcontrollers and design software. Throughout the day attendees of all ages will have an opportunity to interact with scientists and maker hobbyists, participate in tours of the Danforth Plant Science Center while enjoying raspberry-themed treats. Last January, nearly 400 people ages 5 - 70 explored the event creating a demand for more public interactions in this area. Guests participated in interactive demonstrations and activities displayed by STL Raspberry Pi Meetup group, Arch Reactor and Zagros Robotics. By promoting custom engineering projects at the Center, the Maker Group serves as a significant source of cross discipline training to the postdocs, graduate students, undergraduates, technicians and staff in the areas of computer science, engineering, digital phenotyping, programming, and instrument prototyping. This event was made possible thanks to a one year, $13,195 grant from the Raspberry Pi Foundation to engage local educators in the St. Louis region to develop an educational package that introduces students to electronics, plant science and computing.About The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center Founded in 1998, the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center is a not-for-profit research institute with a mission to improve the human condition through plant science. Research aims to feed the hungry and improve human health, preserve and renew the environment and position the St. Louis region as a world center for plant science. The Center's work is funded through competitive grants and contract revenue from many sources, including the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Agency for International Development, the Bill & Melinda Gates and Howard G. Buffett Foundations.
