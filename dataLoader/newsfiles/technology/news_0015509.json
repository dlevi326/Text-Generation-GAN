There have been no new-class drugs developed for Glaucoma for 20 years, since Pfizer introduced Xalatan (latanaprost). The multi-billion dollar Glaucoma market is underserviced and the 60 million people suffering from the disease is expected to grow to 80 million by 2020 (W.H.O 2010). There is no cure for Glaucoma and new therapeutics are highly sought after. Current therapies and surgical procedures are not optimally effective, are painful and not well tolerated by patients. The Mannin platform is both unique and first-in-class and we are the only drug company targeting this mechanism of action.\nPlease listen to the interview by following this link to The Wall St. Analyzer http://wallstreetanalyzer.com/q-biomed-otcqbio-ceo-denis-corin/ or visit our website http://www.qbiomed.com\nAbout Q BioMed Inc.\nQ BioMed Inc. \"Q\" is a biomedical acceleration and development company.
