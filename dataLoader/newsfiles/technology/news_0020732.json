I have to get onto the N1 in Paarls direction but in order for me to get there I have to sit in traffic on Kromboom Road, Milner Road and then try and switch into the right lane once I'm on the M5 while everyone else is trying to get onto the N2 going to CT. Nobody also wants you to come over because it is such an inconvenience and will make them so late.\nThen we have traffic cops who come park in the middle of the road (the section where the people crossover to get onto M5 from rondebosch). Everyone know it is illegal to drive accross a solid line but in peak traffic going at 10km/h it is not causing any harm, They like blood sucking ticks - parasites. They just want to issue fines. You not doing us any favours. Why not patrol other areas where there is more danger. Also what is up with or cars being at a location when only 2 cops are doing work.\nI don't understand why Provincial Government also don't improve the M5 - intoduce the MyCiti bus route into Southern Suburbs. Have 2 lanes to turn onto the M5. I have a design for the improvement of that section already. If I'm a young engineer - with only a few years experience surely the government can figure this out as well with the staff that they have. What was the point to improve Nelson Mandela Boulevard a few years back when the road feeding on the N2 is a total mess. Driving can be so much easier if this country use their resources properly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:08:40.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
