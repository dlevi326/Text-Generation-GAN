The depository says there is no need to sign up for the service, since the NSD system automatically detects the possibility of conducting settlements using an algorithm. \nRussia has also been reforming its own securities markets as part of a long-term plan to integrate with international markets and attract more investment, although in recent years that drive has been undermined by political events in Ukraine. Nevertheless, the Putin government ultimately aims to turn Moscow into a global financial centre, a plan which has seen various changes including the creation of the NSD itself in November 2012, as well as the creation of a unified Moscow Exchange to replace the two separate exchanges that had previously existed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:29:25.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
