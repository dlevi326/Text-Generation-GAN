It was called Good-Bye to All That , and it offered a detailed account of the causes and effects of what Graves summed up as “ my bitter leave-taking of England.” The book was a tale of disillusionment—the kind that sets in gradually and then suddenly—and it sold spectacularly. It was one of the books that would get its author and his cohort alternately praised and derided as “the Lost Generation.” It was, Amazon reports today , “ among the bitterest autobiographies ever written.” Graves was only 34 when it was published.\nRobert Graves was surely not the first bitter human to turn loss into literature. But something about his book—something about the very particular idea that the best way to deal with disappointment was departure—resonated with later generations. “Goodbye to All That” was resurrected, as a title and as a conceit, in Joan Didion’s famous 1967 essay . In turn, Didion’s piece was resurrected in many other essays and essay collections and songs and films , making the departure declaration a literary subgenre unto itself. As The New York Times put it of a very specifically Didionesque subset of the genre: “T he ‘Goodbye New York’ essay has become a de rigueur career move for aspiring belle-lettrists.”", "external_links": ["http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/11/01/new-york-i-love-you-but/", "http://tywls12ela.wikispaces.com/file/view/Joan+Didion+Goodbye+To+All+That.pdf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55428.Goodbye_to_All_That", "http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781580054942", "http://gawker.com/5922392/i-used-to-love-her-but-i-had-to-flee-her-on-leaving-new-york", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_New_York", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2437548", "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/fashion/From-Joan-Didion-to-Andrew-Sullivan-some-writers-leave-behind-letters-when-they-leave-new-york-city.html", "http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/09/why-im-glad-i-quit-new-york-at-age-24.html", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385093306"], "published": "2015-09-10T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:25:45.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
