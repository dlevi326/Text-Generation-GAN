The service will allow users to submit their own 3D files and customise designs through an array of materials and colours as well as adding text, figured and images to any printable project. The platform also features a responsive, interactive 3D viewer so users can preview their creation before it’s printed. \n“We are thrilled to support Staples through our 3D Printing Cloud Engine. This is an exciting time for 3D Printing in Retail,” explained Clément Moreau, CEO & Co-Founder of Sculpteo. “Staples will become an entry point for both businesses and the general public to benefit of 3D printing, and we are proud that Sculpteo’s technology will help to make that possible”. \nBehzad Soltani, vice president of services, e-commerce for Staples, Inc., added: “This is a great addition for our business customers that are looking for an easy way to prototype with quick turnaround time, and at an affordable price. The platform allows beginners get a taste and try 3D printing by selecting one of our existing models and making it their own through our customisation options.” \nStaples has offered 3D printing as a service in its retail locations and through its Copy & Print sales teams, but the new service offering is set to make 3D printing even more accessible for businesses. The company was the first major U.S. retailer to stock 3D printers and has since expanded its 3D technologies offering to cover 3D printing hardware and accessories in select stores.
