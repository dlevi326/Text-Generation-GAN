It also states that lettering of any kind shall not be put on the tricolour.\nThe reactions in the virtual world came thick and fast as the controversy continued to rage.\nAsked whether the Prime Minister's action of signing on a national flag was an offence under IPC, Congress Party's chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala said in New Delhi, \"we are not petty like BJP. We respect the office of the Prime Minister\".\nAt the same time, he said that the Prime Minister must look within and take corrective action as respect for the national flag is the responsibility of 125 crore people, more so for the Prime Minister.\n\"However high you may be, the National flag is above you, you should understand this,\" Surjewala said.\nCongress leader Manish Tewari tweeted, \"Has PM read Para 2.1 sub para 6& Para 3.28 of Flag Code 2002 that states lettering on National Flag is misuse.3 yrs jail under PINH Act 2003.\"\nPrime Minister told the chef that he had done him proud by preparing an elaborate menu for his guests -- over 50 top American CEOs who met him at the Waldorf Astoria hotel here.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T06:29:53.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
