Roses in Concrete is a newly created charter school that's not only a place for children, but also serves as a center for education, health, and job training for the local community. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150916/267208 \n\"America's kids are playing far less than any other previous generation, with only one in four children getting the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity or active play per day,\" said Darell Hammond, CEO and Founder of KaBOOM!. \"We are thrilled to partner with Coupons.com and Roses in Concrete to give students the balanced and active play they need to thrive.\" \nThe new playground will bring more than two hundred children in East Oakland one step closer to having the play-filled childhoods they deserve. In two years, that number is expected to grow to over 500. Jeffrey Duncan-Andrade, winner of the prestigious Jefferson Award for Public Service, founded the school with the goal of creating a school that makes students want to stay - or come back - to Oakland to be the next generation of change agents. The school opened its doors on August 24, 2015. \n\"This partnership is an important moment for our school community,\" said Jeffrey Duncan-Andrade, founder of Roses in Concrete. \"Large percentages of children in our community live in poverty and have limited access to safe places to play and thrive. Together with Coupons.com and KaBOOM! we will be able to provide the kind of playspace our students deserve and encourage them to stay active and play.\" \n\"Bringing more laughter and play into kids' lives is a priority for us at Coupons.com,\" said Michele Boal, Co-founder and Chief Philanthropy Officer of Coupons.com. \"Through this partnership, we are thrilled to continue our Coupons for Change mission to help ensure all kids get a fair start in life.\" \nThis is the second playground built by Coupons.com, an initiative spearheaded through their philanthropic arm, Coupons for Change. Last year, Coupons.com and KaBOOM! built a playspace at Bell Street Park in East Palo Alto, CA. \nBuild day begins at 9:30 a.m. PDT on Thursday, September 17, 2015 at 4551 Steele Street in Oakland, CA 94619.
