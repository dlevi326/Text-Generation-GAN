However, the vertical images are still cropped to 4:3 aspect ratios.\nThe horizontal photos seem to work up to at least 16:9, although they will look smaller in the users feed.\nThe users can toggle between formats by clicking the icon to select between square and full-size images. It will still appear as a cropped square in the users profile grid but will show in the feed of their followers in the correct format.\nIn addition, the company is updating filters for videos. Unlike before using a separate set of effects, videos now support the same selection of presets as stills. The users can also now adjust the intensity of these filters.\nThe iOS and Android apps are both available for download.\nFirst Published on August 28, 2015 9:39 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:02:22.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
