Jawbone announced that the firmware updates will be done over-the-air and the updates are available for both iOS and Android versions 4.7 or later. The updates add several new features, as following: Passive Heart Rate The update for UP3 fitness tracker will add a new heart rate sensor function on top of the existing Resting Heart Rate. With the update, UP3 will now also detect Passive Heart Rate, captured periodically throughout the day during moments when you are still. Passive Heart Rate, when compared to your Resting Heart Rate, gives you a more complete picture of your heart health and helps you become aware of how factors such as caffeine, stress, and other stimuli can affect your heart in daily life, Jawbone announced in a press statement. As UP captures a user's Passive Heart Rate over time, Smart Coach gets a more complete picture of the user's health and is able to offer even more tailored advice. Automatic Sleep Detection This updates will add Automatic Sleep Detection to UP2 and UP3, the statement said. Users can simply wear the band to bed and UP will automatically detect when they fall asleep at night and wake up in the morning. A user's sleep graph will appear in the home screen of the UP App when the band syncs with his or her phone, without any need to change modes on the band. The system will continue to recognize and track detailed sleep stages, with UP3 capturing Wake, REM, Light and Deep sleep as it did before. No More Tapping The addition of Automatic Sleep Detection also eliminates the need to switch modes by tapping the band, a request that came directly from the UP community. The band still supports tapping to dismiss Smart Alarms and Reminders, and band pairing. And if a user prefers to track sleep manually, he or she will still be able to log sleep through the UP App. 184 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T19:27:35.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
