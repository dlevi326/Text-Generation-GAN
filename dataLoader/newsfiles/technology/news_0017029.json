(MyNews4.com & KRNV) -- It's amazing the tools used to teach students today, and companies like ZSpace are helping to enhance that learning process. ZSpace allows students to create and manipulate objects, like a human heart, by using a 3D interactive machine. Through this new technology, officials hope to excite students about careers in science, technology, engineering and math. The makers of ZSpace are bringing their equipment into classrooms across the country and now they're making their way to Reno. They just unveiled their latest technology, an all in one desktop that allows teachers and students the chance to learn about subjects like anatomy and electricity. While they put a focus on students in grades K through 12, this technology can also be used in higher levels of education. Officials say medical students and doctors can use it to practice surgeries and organ dissections. This technology is more than a visual display. People can pick up and manipulate what they're seeing on the desktop screen. This device is already being used in nearly 250 school districts globally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T05:14:00.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
