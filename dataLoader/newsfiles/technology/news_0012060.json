Earlier that weekend, the dog was named Service Dog of the Year at the 2015 American Humane Association Hero Dog Awards .\nPhoto credit: Jason and Axel / Facebook But Haag, 35, said his travel plans were interrupted when an American Airlines gate agent began to question him about the dog and his disability.\n\"The first thing this guy asked me is, 'Is that a real service dog?'\" Haag told ABC News . \"I just find that question kind of odd because nobody at the airport has asked me that and I fly all the time. I said, 'Yes.'\"\n>> Read more trending stories\nHaag said the gate agent then asked the veteran what his disability was, how the dog assisted him and whether he had paperwork. When Haag didn't provide the paperwork and instead showed the agent an ID, the agent said Haag was noncompliant and that the ID was fake, Haag said.\n\"I then tell him I called eight days ago, registered him with your disabilities department,\" Haag told ABC News . \"I flew out here three days prior on the same airline, and I didn't have any issues.\"\nHaag said the airline refused to let him board, so he had to take a different flight the next day. The airline paid for the hotel room and rebooked the flights.\nThe American Humane Association issued a news release about the incident, saying the airline requires only one of the following forms of identification for a service dog to board a flight: an animal ID card, a harness or tags, written documentation or verbal assurance. The AHA said Axel had been wearing a service vest and the airline received \"credible verbal assurance\" from Haag, so the requirements should have been met.\nOn Monday, American Airlines issued a statement apologizing to Haag.\n\"We apologize to both Captain Haag and his family for the confusion with the travel plans yesterday,\" spokeswoman Victoria Lupica said. \" Thank you, Captain Haag, for your service to your country. We are extremely proud to fly you, Axel and your family.\"\nRead more here.\nWell ladies and gentlemen we have been denied access and not been allowed to board our plane by American Airlines due to...\nPosted by Jason and Axel on Sunday, September 20, 2015\nAxel with his Medal ó¾Œ³ðŸ˜Ž\nPosted by Jason and Axel on Sunday, September 20, 2015\nTrending on Facebook\nWoman jumps from moving car after seeing spider, causing wreck, police say Must-see: Mad dad slams Common Core with hilarious check to school Dad & kids reel in 483-lb. shark off Cape Cod Child's left-handed writing allegedly called 'evil' by teacher WATCH: Wise little girl gives heartfelt advice to her divorced parents: 'Be friends' More popular and trending stories\n</p", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/JasonandAxel", "https://www.facebook.com/JasonandAxel/posts/773973259378594:0", "http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/airline-stops-hero-service-dog-from-boarding-plane.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/", "http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/airline-stops-hero-service-dog-from-boarding-plane.html", "https://www.facebook.com/JasonandAxel?fref=photo", "http://abcnews.go.com/US/veteran-accuses-american-airlines-stopping-service-dog-boarding/story?id=33943749", "https://www.facebook.com/CMGNationalNews", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/09/24/db/71/servicedog.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/JasonandAxel/posts/773766146065972:0"], "published": "2015-09-24T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T09:55:43.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
