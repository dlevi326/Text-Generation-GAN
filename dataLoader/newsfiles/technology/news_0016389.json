Before Facebook? The internet used to be a completely different place.\nOn this week’s episode of Updog , a podcast about the internet, we talk about things we used to get up to on the internet: from angsty LiveJournal blogs and Harry Potter fanfiction to whether or not the stairs in your house are protected or the Narwhal bacons at midnight . \nAnd now, we’d like to hear from you: when you were younger, what did you used to get up to on the internet? Do you understand how One Direction fans feel because you too were part of a fandom? Were you a Myspace celebrity? Or are we just not going far enough back into internet history to cover your internet past?\nWhatever web community you were a part of, we’d like to know about it. We’ll use the best stories in a future episode of Updog. Share your stories with GuardianWitness by clicking on the blue button.
