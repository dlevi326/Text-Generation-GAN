The feature is being launched first on the web. It will be made available on Android in a week. “Sometimes you get mail from someone who’s really disruptive. Hopefully it won’t happen often — but when it does, you should be able to say, ‘Never see messages from this person again.’ That’s why you can now block specific email addresses in Gmail — starting today on the web and over the next week on Android,” Sri Harsha Somanchi, Product Manager at Google, said in a blogpost. After this, all blocked mails will go to the spam folder. If users change their mind, they can unblock the id. “In addition, the unsubscribe option is now making its way to Android, so you’ll be able to opt out of eligible mailing lists directly from the Gmail app. It’s perfect for those newsletters you subscribed to a while back but don’t read any more,” Mr. Somanchi said. In June, Google had introduced the ‘undo’ option that allows users to cancel delivery of an email within 30 seconds of hitting the send button.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T20:31:40.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
