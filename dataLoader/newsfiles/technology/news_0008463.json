Louie Douvis by Ben Potter Company directors have backed Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's decision to seek consensus on reform priorities, with business, community and union leaders saying his approach was creating \"a strong sense of optimism\".\n\"I think it's so palpable you can feel it. There's a much more engaging discussion taking place. I think it's in the broader community as well as the business community,\" said KPMG Australia chairman Peter Nash.\n\"I think Turnbull has struck a chord because Australians at large like their politicians close to the centre.\"\nMr Nash said it was to the credit of The Australian Financial Review and The Australian newspapers that they had created an environment for debate and captured the attention of the new Prime Minister by holding reform summits.\n\"I think that Turnbull coming in has provided the opportunity for a fresh look with no strings attached at the dialogue that took place,\" he said.\n\"I think that under the previous regime both from a Labor and Liberal perspective it was sort of, 'Can we forget about that and move on?'.\"\nMr Nash said it was promising that Mr Turnbull was consulting his colleagues and not making policy on the run.\nNeed to walk the talk But the Prime Minister would eventually have to \"walk the walk\" and while business hoped this would result in progressive policy, \"that's the piece that's still to take place at the moment\".\nTony Shepherd, chairman of Macquarie Specialised Asset Management and former chairman of WestConnex and Transfield Services, said Mr Turnbull's agreement to meet the leading business, civil society and union leaders was \"a great move\" and a \"very positive development\".\n\"Getting in a new Prime Minister does enable you to refresh things and go back over what you have considered before. So I think it's a great opportunity to reset.\"\nMr Shepherd praised the Business Council of Australia – he is a former president – for pushing the reform agenda forward over the years and said it was good that it had \"prime ministerial endorsement\".\nInnes Willox, chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, said Mr Turnbull's embrace of the reform summits was a chance to \"reframe the economy for the 21st century\".\n\"We need agreements that our economy is low and slow when it comes to growth, that we have enormous competitive challenges, we have emerging trends around the sharing economy, Uber, Airbnb and the like, automation, our workplaces are changing, [and] our expectations of our workforce are changing,\" Mr Willox said.\nMr Nash said the most exciting thing about Mr Turnbull was his understanding of innovation, the new economy and disruption – which would be the source of future jobs.\n\"You really get the sense that he understands the importance they they pose for the economy, whereas it was entirely unclear where the previous group stood on this,\" he said.\n\"Having someone who understands this is a massive step forward. I think we ran the risk of falling behind in terms of international competitiveness. It's still a risk but now we seem to be having the right discussion and having the right issues on the table.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:19:45.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
