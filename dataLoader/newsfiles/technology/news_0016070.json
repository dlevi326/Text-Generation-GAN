Photo: Via Facebook.\nUNSW staff are scrambling to contain an embarrassing outbreak of undergraduate humour, after the university's Facebook page was hacked on its annual open day.\nAs the university prepared to showcase its faculties and grounds to thousands of potential students, its Facebook page was infiltrated by images of scantily clad women, cleavages and bare backsides, causing concern among some students and ROFLing (rolling on the floor laughing) among others:\nAll avenues were tried internally to regain access to the site, but administrators had been locked out altogether\nUNSW spokeswoman UNSW's Facebook page was hacked.
