Its goal is to have the cars capable of driving completely on their own by 2020. Ride-hailing pioneer Uber has teamed up with Carnegie Mellon University on a Pittsburgh research center in its quest to build driverless cars. \nToyota Motor Co. has already promised to have collision-prevention technology installed in all its U.S. cars by 2017, but isn't as optimistic about building a car capable of driving entirely by itself within the next decade. \nInstead, Toyota envisions cars becoming gradually smarter and more independent of humans as its own engineers and the research centers at Stanford and MIT discover breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and robotics. The company wants to eventually equip its cars with safety systems that can automatically steer the vehicle toward the middle of the road and issue warnings when a human driver appears to be distracted. \nPratt, a former program manager at the U.S. government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, will play a key role in Toyota's drive toward automation. During his five-year stint at DARPA, Pratt oversaw a popular program that challenged engineers to use robotics to perform specific tasks and solve problems. \nThe MIT research center will focus on inventing ways for cars to recognize their surroundings and make decisions that avert potential accidents. If the goals are realized, Toyota might be able to build a car \"incapable of getting into a collision,\" said Daniela Rus, the MIT professor who will lead the university's research partnership with the automaker. \nBesides working on recognition technology, the Stanford research center will try to create artificial intelligence programs that can predict behavior patterns so cars can quickly adjust to potentially dangerous situations. Stanford's research will be led by Fei-Fie Li, director of the university's artificial intelligence laboratory. \nNot far away from Stanford, both General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. have established offices in Palo Alto, California, in their own quests to make smarter cars. \nMeanwhile, just to the south, Google's self-driving cars are regularly cruising the roads of the company's hometown of Mountain View, California, during ongoing testing of the vehicles. \nCalifornia law still requires humans to be in the self-driving cars to take control in dangerous situations or if something goes wrong. Most of the time, though, Google's self-driving cars are being controlled by a computer. They logged a combined 147,000 miles in autonomous mode from June 3 through August 31, according to Google. The self-driving cars were involved in four collisions that caused no major injuries. The robot cars were rear-ended by vehicles driven by people in those accidents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:26:49.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
