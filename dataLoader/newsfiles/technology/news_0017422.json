As part of the study, researchers from Bristol's School of Physiology and Pharmacology found that the physical restraint of the animal is the main cause of stress. \nIn this paper, the team demonstrate a new handling technique used on rats which avoids the use of physical restraint. The study then compared the physiological, behavioural and emotional impacts of restrained versus non-restrained injection procedures in the rodents to assess their stress levels . They found that the new handling method resulted in the rodents being in a more positive affective state, lowering their stress hormone levels by around 50 per cent. \nThe results have important implications for scientific research as well as animal welfare as we know that the release of stress hormones can alter an animal's physiological, neurochemical and psychological state as well as its response to drug treatments. \nDr Emma Robinson, lead author of the study from Bristol's School of Physiology and Pharmacology, said: \"While major steps have been made in the development of alternatives to using animal models in research and to reduce the number of procedures undertaken, further improvements in animal welfare can be made through refining existing procedures. \n\"This study highlights important welfare implications associated with physical restraint and demonstrates a new method to reduce this which benefits the animal's welfare as well as experimental outcomes.\" How farm animals 'feel' contributes to productivity December 8, 2010 \nCSIRO is researching ways to improve the welfare of livestock by developing scientific methods for assessing how animals 'feel' in response to common management practices. Change thinking to keep animal welfare on agenda September 17, 2013 \nTo keep animal welfare on the political and societal agenda, there needs to be a change in the way we present the argument, a leading international animal ethicist says. Animal welfare could be improved by new understanding of their emotions December 3, 2014 \nNew research from researchers at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) looking at how goats express subtle positive emotions could lead to greater understanding of animal welfare. While there has been a great deal of research ... Stress in pet cats—how it manifests and how to manage it June 22, 2015 \nA variety of day-to-day events - from conflicts with other cats to changes in their daily routine - can cause cats to become stressed. This can trigger a number of behavioural changes and be detrimental to their welfare. Improved farm animal welfare – added value or a necessity? August 10, 2015 \nSeveral years ago I started to study an economic issue related to farm animal welfare. Quite soon I realized that this issue can trigger an intensive discussion and receive attention among citizens and in the media. Almost ...
