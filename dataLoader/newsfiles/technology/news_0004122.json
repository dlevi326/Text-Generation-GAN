Doctors use medical imaging to locate and measure aneurysms, but they are unable to detect when a vessel has reached bursting point.\nUniversity of Western Australia biomechanic Dr. Grand Joldes says his team developed an algorithm to quickly map the amount of stress, or tension, on an artery wall.\n“It is an extremely simple simulation for computing wall tension in abdominal aortic aneurysms,” Dr. Joldes says.\n“Until now, there are no methods that can give you, in high certainty, an indication if the aneurysm will rupture or not, and so it is very difficult to make clinical decisions whether to operate or not,” Dr Joldes says.\nHe says by measuring the deformed artery’s geometry and applying existing computer algorithms, the scientists can model stress distribution without needing to know tissue properties, which vary greatly between patients.\nA ruptured aorta.
