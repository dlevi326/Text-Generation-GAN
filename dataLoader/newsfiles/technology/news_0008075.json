Seeking justice in the courts has been painful for me personally and professionally, and for my family. I am now moving on, paying Kleiner Perkins’ legal costs and dropping my appeal,\" Pao wrote in an essay on Re/Code.\nBut Pao remains defiant.\n\"My experience shows how difficult it is to address discrimination through the court system,\" she wrote.\nOnward http://t.co/tocXA9iISb\n— Ellen Pao (@ekp) September 10, 2015 A jury found that Kleiner Perkins did not discriminate against Pao. Pao had been seeking $16 million in damages, claiming the venture capital firm discriminated against her because she was a woman, denying her promotions. She was ultimately fired.\nIn June, Pao appealed the jury’s verdict that she failed to show Kleiner Perkins discriminated against her and then retaliated against her for complaining about it. Pao was ordered to pay $275,966.63 in legal fees plus interest to her former employer, Kleiner Perkins. Kleiner Perkins had sought $1 million in legal fees.\n\"We are glad to put this trial behind us. There is no question diversity in the workplace is an important issue. KPCB remains committed to supporting women and minorities in venture capital and technology both inside our firm and within our industry,\" Kleiner Perkins said in an emailed statement.\nPao's case intensified attention being paid to the treatment of women in Silicon Valley and trained new attention on the secretive, mostly white-male, venture capital profession.\nWomen, blacks and Hispanics have been largely left out of one of the world's greatest wealth-creation machines in Silicon Valley. Nowhere is that lack of diversity more evident than in venture capital firms, which control the spigot of wealth in high-tech. The profession has begun to take steps to address the lack of diversity. The National Venture Capital Association has formed a diversity task force and the trade group has taken a diversity pledge.\nUSA TODAY\nExclusive: Venture capital to make diversity pledge\nUSA TODAY\nVenture capital is facing up to its diversity problem\n\"I think I brought these important issues to the forefront of the conversation, but the online aggression has had a toll on me and my family,\" Pao told Re/code's Kara Swisher. \"That so many people heard what I had to say, against all that was brought to bear against me, is a testament to the depth of the problem related to women and tech.\"\nPao stepped down as the interim CEO of Reddit four months after the jury verdict in the midst of a widespread protest over the firing of a popular moderator.\n\"Some businesses are now making changes to prevent discrimination — and importantly measuring and talking about it,\" Pao wrote in the essay. \"But we have a long way to go, as women and minorities continue to make up a small fraction of the management at our most lucrative and productive companies.\"\nPao says she will continue to work in the tech industry and advocate for women and minorities.\n\"Going forward, I am optimistic that our efforts will drive change to improve the work situation for women and minorities. Personally, I plan to continue moving these issues forward by writing, investing and working in the technology industry,\" she wrote.\n24 CONNECT 70 TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 18 //usat.ly/1UJxH2j TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774887865966331-Pao.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UJxH2j&mini=true", "http://recode.net/2015/09/10/ellen-pao-speaks-i-am-now-moving-on/", "http://usat.ly/1UJxH2j", "https://twitter.com/ekp/status/642022960891453440", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UJxH2j&text=Ellen%20Pao%20drops%20appeal%20in%20gender-discrimination%20suit&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/82570164577ff975034ec1cf15fba86c56398a2e/c=83-0-422-339/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/12/07/635535714234419304-122486570.jpg", "http://t.co/tocXA9iISb", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04b8bec6b09be4c8ec13e127598f748ba87fa9e0/c=170-0-853-683/local/-/media/2015/08/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635742112767099708-Obama.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/559cbf7d6f12e03fd6c7fcd7b53b54a66794ecc7/c=0-13-749-1012&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/09/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774887865966331-Pao.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-10T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:33:46.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
