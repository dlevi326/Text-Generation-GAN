However, the processability of pharmaceutical materials using 3D printing poses the main challenge to the development of this area. The aim of this project is to primarily focus on preformulation evaluation of pharmaceutical materials to identify materials and the conditions under which they can be successfully processed using 3D printing for the preparation of solid dosage forms. The student will receive a wide range of training on pharmaceutical processing and characterisation. The outcome of the project is expected to significantly contribute to the development of the new field of pharmaceutical 3D printing \nEntry Requirements: \nApplicants should have a minimum of a 2.1 degree in Pharmacy, pharmaceutical sciences, engineering or other relevant disciplines \nFunding: \nThis project is offered on a self-funding basis. It is open to applicants with funding or those applying to funding sources. Details of tuition fees can be found at http://www.uea.ac.uk/pgresearch/pgrfees . \nA bench fee is also payable on top of the tuition fee to cover specialist equipment or laboratory costs required for the research. The amount charged annually will vary considerably depending on the nature of the project and applicants should contact the primary supervisor for further information about the fee associated with the project. \nTo discuss the application process or particular projects, please contact the: Admissions Office, email: pgr.enquiries.admiss@uea.ac.uk or telephone +44 (0)1603 591709 .
