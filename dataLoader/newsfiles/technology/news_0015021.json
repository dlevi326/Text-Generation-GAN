The deal is expected to close in the final quarter of 2015.\nSan Francisco-based Envivio is slated to join Ericsson's TV and media business. The company makes software to process and distribute Internet protocol-based video.\nIts customers—telecom companies and content providers—use the software to provide consumers with video on a range of devices, from smartphones to laptops. The company's software uses video compression and IP video networking technology that runs on industry standard hardware.\nEricsson shed jobs this year as it transitions from a hardware provider into a global leader in mobile-network software. The layoffs were part of the overhaul of Ericsson's business away from costly hardware into software and services. In 2004, 73% of the company's revenue came from hardware, and only 27% from software and services. By 2014, that mix had been almost completely reversed.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com\n 10, 2015 08:15 ET (12:15 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:57:08.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
