This is great news for customers who require high-availability and compliance from their collocation services.”\nMr Riad said in 2014, Telstra added two new Points-of-Presence (PoP) in Equinix’s SY3 data centre in Sydney, and in its ME1 data centre in Melbourne.\nTelstra also has PoPs in Equinix’s other Sydney data centres as well as in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo.\nThe move comes amid a wave of local data centre efforts as the market for enterprise cloud computing services heats up.
