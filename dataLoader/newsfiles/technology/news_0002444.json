Other investors were Spain's Torreal and the International Finance Corporation, a investment arm of the World Bank.\nTelecoms and internet companies are expanding in Africa to take advantage of growing demand for data-heavy services as more affordable smartphones encourage consumers to browse the internet, stream videos and download applications.\nNetherlands-based Afrimax already runs high-speed 4G networks in Uganda, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nIt follows in the footsteps of another private firm, Simile Telecoms, which raised $365 million last week to extend its existing 4G LTE mobile network in three African countries.\n(Reporting by Tiisetso Motsoeneng; Editing by Mark Potter )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T20:16:32.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
