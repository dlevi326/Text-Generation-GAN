The Manufacturing Day event is one of over 1400 across the nation, and is an opportunity for companies to address challenges and concerns while celebrating the industry.\nIn particular, this event will highlight the Tek Starz summer camp. Tek Starz is developed by the Chamber of Commerce and Arkansas State University at Newport with assistance from the Arkansas Manufacturing Extension Partnership and local manufacturers. During the summer camp, students visit local manufacturers and learn about the industry through hands-on projects and other activities. During the event, presentations from the June camp will be made to sponsors.\nHytrol’s Vice President of Manufacturing & Engineering Operations, Chris Glenn, said that Hytrol’s participation in Manufacturing Day is an important representation of the company in the industry.\n“Manufacturing is who we are at Hytrol, and we understand the importance of it in the U.S.,” said Glenn. “Supporting Manufacturing Day demonstrates Hytrol’s support for all manufacturers. We have suppliers that support us through manufacturing, and we support our customers by manufacturing products for them. Manufacturing supports so many families here and elsewhere providing a good quality of life for each and every person. It’s imperative that we recognize the importance of manufacturing to our culture and how it touches everyone.”\nBill Kraus, Manager of Client Services at AEDC-Manufacturing Solutions, commented, “Arkansas Manufacturing Solutions was privileged to be a part of Tek Starz week. For nearly three hours, 13 very bright and energetic seventh and eighth graders participated in two rounds of our Lean 101 workshop. As a result of their enthusiastic and cooperative teamwork, they transformed an initially ‘chaotic’ Buzz Electronics layout into a ‘creative’ Lean system. The scorecard results achieved by these youngsters rivalled those of many of their older contemporaries. The hopes for a bright manufacturing future are secure in their hands.”\nAbout Hytrol Conveyor Company, Inc.\nHytrol’s Technology Center is the birthplace for many industry-changing solutions, such as EZLogic® accumulation conveyors and the E24™, an energy efficient, motor driven roller conveyor series.
