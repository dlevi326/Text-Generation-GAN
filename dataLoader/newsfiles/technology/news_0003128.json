But it's just any table. It's a wireless charging side table from Fonesalesman , a London-based company that's expanding its US presence (and makes other charging products like the QiStone+ portable wireless charger we offered up in a giveaway earlier this year).\nNow the company's working on a line of furniture, FurniQi , that uses the Qi charging standard to power Qi-compatible gadgets such as the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge ; Google Nexus 6 and Nexus 7; and Nokia Lumia 830 and 930 . Two round charging pucks fitted into the bottom of the table transmit power. Plop your device onto one of the bamboo table's ringed zones to charge it up. (CNET just tried a FurniQi table at the 2015 IFA tech conference in Berlin; read our take here .)\nEach FurniQi assembly kit comes with a wood tabletop, two interlocking leg pieces, four bolts and a hex key for putting it all together. Fonesalesman will be launching an Indiegogo campaign to raise awareness of FurniQi early next month, and says the product will ship to early backers in time for the holidays, with others receiving it later. This week's giveaway winner gets an early prototype worth approximately $150. For devices that aren't set up for wireless charging, a iQi receiver will do the trick -- and Fonesaleman will include one if our giveaway winner needs it.\nSo what do you have to do to be that winner? There are a few rules, so please read carefully.\nSome assembly, but not much, required. Tyler Lizenby/CNET\nRegister as a CNET user.
