It walks on four hydraulically-actuated legs.\nDOD The robot can be controlled from up to 500 meters away\nIt also features a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) laser imaging sensor - similar to the ones Google puts on its self-driving cars .\nThe US military has previously talked about using robots in battle situations to carry heavy equipment out in the field - or scout for IEDs. A bit like a lethal game of fetch.\n\"We want to continue to experiment with quadruped technology and find ways that this can be employed to enhance the Marine Corps warfighting capabilties,\" said Capt. James Pineiro, the branch head for Marine Corps Warfighting Lab.\nSpot is electronically powered, as opposed to the gas powered engine that runs both BigDog and Boston Dynamic's other pet-like robot, LS3.\nDOD Spot the robot dog during training\nSpot can canter along next to a human, climb stairs and walk off-road.\nMost impressively, it can even maintain balance when knocked by a human or obstacle.\nOn-board sensors work quickly to stop it from falling over should it, for example, trip up while out in the field.\nVideo loading\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/e1/pd/4221396001/4221396001_4042117974001_DOG.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-09-22T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T10:30:26.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
