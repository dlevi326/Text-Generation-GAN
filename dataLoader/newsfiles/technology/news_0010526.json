Wyatt Roy was rewarded for his loyalty to Mr Turnbull, with the posting of Assistant Minister for Innovation.\n“Christopher’s department, the Ministry for Industry, Innovation and Science, will drive the government’s focus on investing in ­science, promoting science technology, engineering and mathematics, education, supporting start-ups and bringing together ­innovation initiatives right across government,” Mr Turnbull said.\n“Christopher is going to be at the centre, as is the whole government, of one of our most important agendas. If we want to remain a prosperous, first-world economy with a generous social welfare safety net, we must be more competitive, we must be more productive, above all we must be more innovative.”\nBefore yesterday’s reshuffle there had been no minister responsible for overseeing the direction of the government’s policy towards start-ups. Innovation was an official portfolio under the Rudd government when Kim Carr was minister for innovation, industry, science and research but it was dumped by Mr Abbott when he came to power in 2013.\n“It would have been nice to get an actual dedicated minister for start-ups but this is a good start,” said jobs site freelancer.com’s founder and chief executive Matt Barrie. “This is obviously a big change of the guard, there are lots of new faces. But as Mao Zedong said: ‘We will just wait and see how it turns out now’.”\nJonathan Barouch, founder and chief executive of location-based social analytics company Local Measure, had also been hoping for a dedicated technology minister to drive policies for start-ups, but he said the addition of ­innovation to Mr Pyne’s new portfolio as well as the appointment of Mr Roy was very welcome.\n“Wyatt will be fantastic and he will completely galvanise the community behind start-ups and innovation,” Mr Barouch said.\nMr Pyne said he was “delighted” to be appointed to the ­industry, innovation and science portfolio.\n“With a sweeping tide of new disruptive technologies that will entirely transform the way we live and the way we work, Australian industry must continue to lead the world in research and innovation, ensuring our nation can seize the opportunities ahead,” he said.\n“We have the technical capacity and capability to remain a nation with industries that offer the jobs of the 21st century. As Minister, I will be working with industry and our institutions to continue on this course and look forward to the challenges ahead.”\nThe new portfolio of responsibilities will be of special significance to Mr Pyne who hails from South Australia, a state that continues to battle high unemployment and faces massive structural and economic challenges as car manufacturing subsidies are being withdrawn from the region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T01:03:08.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
