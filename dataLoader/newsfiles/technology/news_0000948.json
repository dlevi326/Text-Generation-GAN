Among the questions the FTC is exploring is whether Google uses Android to enhance its lead in online search, this person said.\nSmartphone makers are free to not use Google's licensed Android operating system. But to get access to Google's Play app store and other services that enhance Android phones, they have to agree to put Google's search service prominently on the devices.\nThe FTC previously conducted a detailed investigation of whether Google abused its dominance in Internet search, but closed that probe in early 2013 without bringing a case.\nIn that inquiry, FTC staffers concluded Google had biased its search results to benefit its own services and hurt rivals. But in what they termed \"a close call,\" the staffers recommended against a broad lawsuit, citing legal hurdles and Google's \"strong procompetitive justifications\" for its actions.\nFTC competition officials in the previous investigation recommended challenging three Google practices, including its alleged \"scraping\" of content from rival websites. The commission agreed to close its investigation after Google agreed to make voluntary changes to those practices.\nThe companies that have complained to the FTC recently about Google include app developers and other providers of online services. They say they have been hampered in their attempts to get prominent positioning on Android phones or to win the status of a preinstalled, default app for their products.\nThe FTC declined to address the issue. \"FTC investigations are nonpublic and we do not comment on an investigation or the existence of an investigation,\" said spokesman Justin Cole.\nEuropean antitrust officials are several months into a formal investigation of whether Google uses Android to stifle competition. The European Commission launched a full probe in April after several years of informal investigation.\nSeparately, the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, also has formally charged Google with skewing its search results to favor its own shopping services.\nBloomberg reported earlier Friday that the FTC was examining Android-related issues.\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com and Alistair Barr at alistair.barr@wsj.com\n 25, 2015 13:39 ET (17:39 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T11:48:38.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
