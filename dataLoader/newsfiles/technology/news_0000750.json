His family farmed corn, so every harvest, he'd shift the grain truck into gear and run it slowly alongside a combine harvester as the combine plucked the corn from the fields. \nBut it grated on him, a little. He didn't get why two whole trucks had to do the job he thought one truck could accomplish. \n\"I said, 'This is a very inefficient way to do this,'\" Dillon said. \nAnd so began his efforts to develop a combine that would carry as much grain as a grain truck and be able to empty it out, like a regular combine, once it got full. \nThe modern combine harvester itself is a combination machine — doing the work of a header and a thresher to first cut the head off of wheat and then thresh it, separating the useful portions from the waste. It was invented in the 1800s and came into widespread use in Midwestern farming starting in the early 1900s, pulled first by horses, then by hooking up to a tractor and finally becoming tractor and combine all in one. \nUsing a combine doubled or even tripled crop production compared to the header-and-thresher method and cut the number of people needed to harvest a field by up to 80 percent, according to a history of the combine harvester published on HistoryLink.org. \n\"The existing combine architecture ... has been around since 1940,\" Dillon said. \"But it's also maxed out.\" \nThe biggest combines on the market now can carry no more than 400 bushels, Dillon explained. The speed at which they funnel harvested crops into an accompanying grain truck is limited, as well. \nSo starting in the late 1990s, Dillon experimented with adding grain carrying capacity onto the back of a combine. \nWorking with Roger Baber, a neighbor and owner of a portable welding business serving mainly farmers, Dillon built what would become the first generation of the Tribine in the white pole barn next to the family homestead. \nThe duo built it with articulated steering — adding a pivot in the middle of the machine, like a door hinge, so the machine would have a smaller turning radius. And they built it to prove that the machine could, in fact, carry 1,000 bushels across a field, or as much grain as a grain truck. \n\"It was quite an accomplishment to build that first big one,\" Baber said recently. \nDillon and Baber continued work on second and third generations, tinkering with various elements — whether one or two augurs should be used to empty the Tribine once full, for example. \nOnce designed, a single generation prototype would take roughly nine months to build, Dillon said. \n\"We did not have an engineering team at that point,\" he said. \"It was pretty much myself and local fellas.\" \nBaber said the various generations of what would become the Tribine together made up \"by far the biggest, longest project\" he's had a hand in. \nThen Dillon teamed up with Agco Corp. to develop a fourth generation built onto one of Agco's Gleaner combines. \nA team of design engineers working out of Agco's Kansas facility helped Dillon solve problems as they cropped up, and Baber traveled to Kansas four times to assist with welding. That prototype was finished in 2012 and made a splash at an agricultural trade show the following year. \nBesides carrying the equivalent of a grain truck full of corn, the Tribine also empties quickly — unloading at nine bushels per second, or about 500 per minute. \"Our goal is to load the truck in two minutes,\" Dillon said. \nResponse at the Ag Connect Expo in January 2013 was \"overwhelming,\" Dillon said. \"We could've sold several if we'd been able to build them then.\" \nBut he wasn't done. A year later, Tribine Harvester LLC was formed independently of Agco and consisted of a design team and administrators in Newton, Kansas, plus another design engineer based in southern Indiana and Dillon, who remained on the family farm south of Logansport. \nThey designed a fifth generation from the ground up, rather than basing it on an existing combine harvester. \n\"This is the first one to be new from the ground up since the 1940s,\" Dillon said proudly. He currently holds 32 patents around the world on the fourth generation prototype and has another 15 to 20 pending from development on the fifth generation, he said. \nAnd that's the one he expects to manufacture starting next year. Real Agriculture reports the Newton (Kansas) City Council in July approved construction of the first Tribine harvester assembly plant. \nHe anticipates significant production through 2017, though he hesitated to make more specific estimates. \nBaber said he'd never doubted the machine would eventually make it to production. \n\"It was just a matter of when Ben decided he felt like it was time to do another one of the same thing,\" Baber said. \"Each time we've tried to make it better so it's neat that he's come up with one he thinks is going to be the best, so we can build more than one.\" \n\"It'll be great someday to tell my grandkids that I helped build the very first one of them,\" Baber added. \nThese days, Dillon spends about one week a month in Kansas with the design team. While the first 25 to 100 Tribine harvesters will have to be built at the Kansas facility, where design engineers can be on site to troubleshoot, Dillon expects that won't always be the case. \n\"Long range, we still have a vision of manufacturing in Indiana,\" he said. \nHe hopes eventually to build a manufacturing facility \"right up there on the corner\" — within sight of the farmhouse he still calls home. \n---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T13:13:43.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
