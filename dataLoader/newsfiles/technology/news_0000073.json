The new TVS-871T is the world’s first hybrid NAS/DAS/iSCSI IP-SAN that offers direct storage access with two Thunderbolt™ 2 ports, full NAS functionality through Gigabit/10GbE network connectivity. With 8 hot-swappable drive bays, the TVS-871T can pack a whopping 64TB of in-unit storage with blistering-fast transfer speeds up to 20Gb/s. The unit’s storage can be expanded via QNAP's TX expansion unit series , which provide up to a jaw-dropping 448TB of raw storage. \nWhile the raw specs are impressive on their own, what’s even more exciting for photographers and video professionals working with 4K Ultra High Definition video streams is the prospect of a single storage device that can handle the whole storage job, not just part of it. Today 4K video editors must ingest the raw video on high-performance direct-attached RAID storage and edit there, then export edited content out to a NAS or other storage with cloud access for client sharing, and then yet another device for archiving once the project is completed. \n“We at Intel are extremely pleased that QNAP has chosen to embed Thunderbolt 2 into their TVS-871T DAS/NAS/iSCSI/IP-SAN storage solution,” said Jason Ziller, Intel’s Thunderbolt Director of Marketing. “Thunderbolt is clearly cemented as the key connection technology for simultaneously supporting high-speed data transfers and high definition video displays. The new QNAP product is a testament to this vision.” \nThe TVS-871T also comes with a dedicated private cloud for easy remote access, file sharing and advanced virtualization features that allow the unit to function as a stand-alone PC. The TVS-871T also features an HDMI port for real-time, simultaneous storage and play-out of 4K content viewable on a 4K display. \n“The TVS-871T is really a ground-breaking innovation for video professionals,” said Erick Oliveros, Marketing Manager for QNAP. “We’ve made it possible for video professionals to simplify their workflow, cut costs by eliminating redundant storage, and collaborate like never before. The TVS-871T delivers unparalleled performance, connectivity, flexibility and is going to be absolutely delightful for the video production industry.” \nThe TVS-871T features QNAP’s QTS 4.2 management software that allows convenient management of the entire system from a single interface. Also included are apps such as the new Qsirch natural search feature for easily locating content on the NAS, as well as apps for virtualization, backup/data replication, video/photo sharing, and much more. In addition, the TVS-871T can be accessed via QNAP’s suite of iOS and Android mobile apps. \nTVS-871T Available Models TVS-871T-i7-16G: features Intel® Core™ i7-4790S 3.2GHz quad-core processor and 16GB DDR3 RAM, built-in dual-port Thunderbolt™ 2 and 10GbE ports TVS-871T-i5-16G: features Intel® Core™ i5-4590S 3.0GHz quad-core processor and 16GB DDR3 RAM, built-in dual-port Thunderbolt™ 2 and 10GbE ports \nPrice & Availability \nThe new TVS-871T models are currently shipping in the US and Canada markets.
