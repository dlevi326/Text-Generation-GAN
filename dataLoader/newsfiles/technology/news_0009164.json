October’s CEA Index will be a key metric as we head into the final months of the year.” \nTechnology Spending \nThe CEA Index of Consumer Technology Expectations (ICTE), which measures consumer expectations about technology spending, increased 2.1 points to reach 88.8 in September. The ICTE for the month of September remains lower year-over-year. \n“In recent months, consumer attitudes toward tech purchases have mirrored overall sentiment,” said DuBravac. “Should sentiment not pick up in October, expect to see retailers and manufacturers seek to stoke demand in the coming weeks in advance of the holiday shopping season.” \nThe CEA Indexes are updated on a monthly basis through consumer surveys. New data is released on the fourth Tuesday of each month.
