This intuitive solution is available as a native iPad application and can be accessed via the Internet virtually anywhere and anytime. \nThrough the convenience of a smartphone or tablet, doctors can capture images associated with patient symptoms and automatically upload the photos to the medical record. Plus, it’s an effective educational tool as physicians can show the photos to their patients. \n“EMA Otolaryngology was created using the same groundbreaking technology that has been so successful for our other specialties,” said Daniel Cane, CEO and co-founder of Modernizing Medicine. “In addition, with the new Protocols, physicians can develop their own master visits and customize their workflow. This will only further enhance EMA’s intuitive adaptive learning, since with only two clicks a physician can pull the master visit into the current visit to quickly document while seeing a patient. We look forward to showcasing EMA’s latest enhancements at this year’s conference.” \n“As a practicing head and neck surgeon, I had a difficult time finding an EMR system that knew my workflow and actually helped make me a more effective doctor,” said David Lehman, MD, Senior Medical Director of EMA Otolaryngology and EMA Ophthalmology®. “The development team and I built EMA with the level of detail to make it easy for me to generate an operative note, detailing every step I’ve done, in approximately 10 seconds. Plus, the automated coding can make the transition to ICD-10 easy as the EMA 3D Anatomic Atlas™ automatically captures information such as diagnostic details and laterality.” \nMembers of the EMA Otolaryngology team will provide demonstrations at Modernizing Medicine booth #733 during the Annual AAO-HNSF OTO Expo in Dallas taking place from Sunday, September 27 – Tuesday, September 29.
