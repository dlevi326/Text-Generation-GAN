Qu states, “Providing payment in local currency is vital to proper conversion and operational efficiency when selling in China. We help with that and other financial requirements.” \nQu further notes, “China’s monetary policy for decades was 'easy-in, difficult-out.' However, its large foreign reserve has caused a reversal in this attitude to better manage the country’s risk. Because of these changes and other factors, even the largest companies can be and often are confused and frustrated. We address that problem by efficiently facilitating one-stop China cross-border payments.” \nHeadquartered in Hong Kong, Geoswift has a number of international offices, including London and San Francisco. The company consults with local regulatory bodies in order to adapt the flow of their compliance requirements to ensure smooth and compliant handling of payments to business partners in China. \nGeoswift specializes in working with companies involved in travel, e-commerce and education.
