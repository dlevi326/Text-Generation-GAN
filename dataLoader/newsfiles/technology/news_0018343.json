(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) The Associated Press \nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Target is going on a health kick, aimed at both customers and its employees. \nThe discount-store chain will push granola bars over candy bars at the checkout and hand out free basic activity trackers from Fitbit Inc. to its more 300,000 employees as part of the effort. \nTarget will also give employees extra discounts on fruits and vegetables to employees, said Jodee Kozlak, Target’s chief human resources officer. It will also feature healthy grab-and-go snacks near the cash registers, downplaying high in fat and sugar. \nTarget’s partnership with Fitbit is one of its biggest corporate accounts for the activity tracker company, Kozlak said. Target employees will get the Fitbit Zip, which retails for $59.95.

The move mirrors a similar strategy adopted by drugstore chain CVS, which stopped selling cigarettes and changed its corporate name to CVS Health Corp. as part of a plan to become known as a health brand. \nIn June, Target said it would partner with CVS to have the nation’s second-largest drugstore chain run its in-store pharmacy and clinic businesses and expand what they offer. \nAs part of Target’s Fitbit program, employees who participate will be grouped into teams for a monthlong challenge. The winning team will get $1 million to funnel into a charity of their choice, Kozlak said. \nWellness is one of the key areas for Target CEO Brian Cornell, along with such areas as baby products and fashion. Target is adding more organic and natural food as it revamps its grocery aisles. \nCandy bar fans shouldn’t fret, though. They’re not going away. In tests in 30 stores, the chain is trying to get the balance right, so that it’s health push isn’t too pushy. \n“They don’t want us to be too preachy,” said Christina Hennington, Target’s senior vice president of merchandising. \nA few years ago, Target began working with various household and food suppliers to step up innovation in new products. It’s being marketed under the Made to Matter label and it is now a $1 billion business. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show that Target executives announced the moves, not Target’s CEO, and CVS Caremark changed its name to CVS Health.
