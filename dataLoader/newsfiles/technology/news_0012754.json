The unit will be led by Bill Ruh, who has been GE's software vice president and will become chief digital officer.\nThe U.S. conglomerate also announced that Mark Begor, GE's head of energy management, would retire after 35 years with the company. Energy management is to expand significantly with GE's impending acquisition of the grid business from France's Alstom; only last week Begor touted the deal at an RBC Capital investor conference.\nRussell Stokes, GE's transportation chief, will take over energy management, while Jamie Miller, chief information officer, will take over as head of transportation. The moves are effective Oct. 1.\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf ; Editing by Dan Grebler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T20:27:05.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
