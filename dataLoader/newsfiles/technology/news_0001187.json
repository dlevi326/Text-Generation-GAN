Last month, Vericred introduced PlanCompass Pro , a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application for insurance brokers utilizing doctor-centric search to show which of a client's doctors are in or out of every available plan's network, right next to the costs and benefits of those plans. Now the same provider-network data powering PlanCompass Pro is available to power doctor-centric search on every platform where an individual or business shops for insurance, or seeks to find a new doctor. Licensing sales for the API have begun, and one prominent web-based insurance broker has already licensed Vericred's data.\n\"We believe the transparency into provider networks delivered by PlanCompass Pro should be ubiquitous throughout the industry. That's why we are making our data broadly available,\" said Michael W. Levin , co-founder and CEO of Vericred. \"With the increasing shift to plans with narrow networks, consumers need tools to evaluate each plan's provider network and make informed decisions.\"\nA recent report from the UPenn Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics noted that in 2014, 41 percent of Silver plans offered on the marketplaces were \"x-small or small, meaning that they included 25% or less of the physicians in a rating area.\" In several states, more than 70 percent of Silver plans utilized these narrow networks.  \nVericred maintains complete provider-network data for individual and small group plans, on and off marketplace, in 34 states representing more than 70 percent of the U.S. population, with new states being added weekly. Vericred's provider-network data is mapped at the plan level allowing for easy integration into health insurance exchanges and platforms.
