Such policies tend to lower the value of a currency, helping the competitiveness of exporters. Now, the Fed's move to delay raising rates in the US will likely weaken the dollar, undermining the impact of stimulus elsewhere.\nMarkets in Europe and Japan reacted negatively to the Fed move, with stocks selling off sharply Friday. Germany's DAX was down 3.1 per cent, France's CAC-40 fell 2.6 per cent and Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down 2 per cent. The dollar also weakened against both the yen and the euro.\nMr Balls said the decision to hold off raising US rates for the first time in almost a decade increases the likelihood that ECB President Mario Draghi will follow through on a pledge earlier in September to expand the central bank's bond-buying program if it was merited.\nThe Pimco executive, whose firm manages $US1.5 trillion ($A2.1tn) in assets and ranks as one of the world's biggest bond investors, said further stimulus in the eurozone and Japan should push corporate bond prices higher.\nMr Balls said he holds a large position in credit markets relative to the benchmark indexes his funds track, and recently adjusted his investments slightly in anticipation the Fed would delay a rate increase, which many economists had expected to come in September up until recently. He said his funds are positioned to benefit if US interest rates move higher at a slow pace while inflation picks up.\nMr Balls said December is a likely lift-off date for the Fed if market volatility doesn't pick up again.\nFed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Thursday that the central bank wanted to take more time to evaluate the impact of recent economic and market turbulence on the US economy before raising interest rates. Financial markets have been choppy since China weakened its currency in August, sparking fears over a slowdown in growth in the world's second-largest economy.\nIt is \"reasonable\" for the Fed \"to be sensitive to global risks, and how they can spill over to the US,\" said Mr Balls, and the impact of rising US interest rates on emerging-market economies.\nStill, he also noted that, \"There is a lot to be said with just getting on with it [a rate increase]\" which would remove a \"big source of event risk in the market.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:32:15.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
