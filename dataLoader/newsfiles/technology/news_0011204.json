An artists impression of stone monoliths found buried near Stonehenge which could have been part of the largest Neolithic monument built in Britain, archaeologists believe. Picture: EPA Source: AAP \nHIDDEN remains of an extraordinary neolithic monument that could be unique in the world have been found buried beneath the ground, about 1.5km from Stonehenge. \nMore than 4500 years ago, at least 90 huge stone monoliths lined an impressive “arena” that may have been used for religious rites or solstice rituals. \nNow lying on their sides covered by three feet of earth, they remained undiscovered until archaeologists equipped with ground-penetrating radar probed the area around the famous stone circle on Salisbury Plain. \nThey are the most important find to emerge so far from the Hidden Landscapes project which is using state-of-the-art technology to map “invisible” archaeological features embedded in the Wiltshire countryside. \nThe stones, some measuring nearly four and a half metres, were placed along the south-eastern edge of what later became the Durrington Walls “superhenge”— a circular enclosure ringed by a ditch and bank that at nearly 1.5km across is the largest earthwork of its kind in the UK. The 4500-year-old stones, some measuring 4.5m in length, were discovered under 1m of earth at Durrington Walls ‘superhenge’. Picture: EPA Source: AAP \nExperts believe the stones, which may have been imbued with magical properties, were not originally part of the henge but were deliberately toppled before being incorporated into it. \nProfessor Vince Gaffney, from the University of Bradford, one of the archaeologists leading the project, said: “We’re looking at one of the largest stone monuments in Europe and it has been under our noses for something like 4000 years. \n“It’s truly remarkable. \n“We don’t think there’s anything quite like this anywhere else in the world. \n“This is completely new and the scale is extraordinary.” He added: “We presume it to be a ritual arena of some sort. \n“These things are theatrical. \n“They’re designed to impress and impose; to give the idea of authority to the living and the dead. \n“It really does create a massive impression and was clearly important enough to have been drawn into the developing landscape.” Ninety stones have been discovered so far and there may be more. What kind of material they are made of is unknown but they could be similar to the giant sandstone “sarsens” of Stonehenge. ”It has been under our noses for something like 4,000 years,” said Professor Gaffney. Picture: EPA Source: AAP \nProf Gaffney believes the stones may have been planted by the same people who built Stonehenge, but is sceptical about a direct link between the two monuments. \nThey were placed along a steep slope, or scarp, cut into a natural dry valley to form a C-shaped feature. \nPrecisely why the stones were put there remains a mystery. \nPart of Durrington Walls is aligned with the rising sun on the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, which may be significant. \nThe archaeologists believe that at some stage the stones were pushed over and incorporated into the emerging henge. \nThis was not an act of vandalism but a deliberate attempt to preserve whatever it was about the stones that seemed so important. \n“There was a transformation in the landscape that we do not understand,” Prof Gaffney said. \n“The stones had significance. \n“Societies are mobilised, as with the great cathedrals, to create these things.” The original Stonehenge as we know it, near Amesbury, Wiltshire, England.
