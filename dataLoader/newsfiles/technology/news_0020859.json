It will replace a serif typeface that Google has been using in its logo for more than 16 years.\nThe E in the company's name will remain slightly tilted to reflect Google's sometimes off-kilter thinking.\nAlthough this will be the sixth time that Google has changed its logo since Larry Page and Sergey Brin formed the company, this marks the most noticeable redesign since it dropped an exclamation point that appeared after its name until May 1999.\nGoogle thinks its new logo will provide a more versatile identity, the company said in a Tuesday blog post.
