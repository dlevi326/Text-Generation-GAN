That year, Romney said at a Montana fundraiser: “I hope people understand this, your friends who like Obamacare, you remind them of this, if they want more stuff from government tell them to go vote for the other guy — more free stuff.” Romney spoke after being booed at an earlier event with the NAACP.\nMost agree with Pope Francis on climate change: A poll released Friday morning showed most Americans agree with Pope Francis’ call to act on climate change .

The bill would do away with the “Cadillac tax,” a steep new tax scheduled to kick in about two years from now. It would apply to health insurance plans where total spending exceeds $10,022 for an individual or $27,500 for a family. The Examiner says Republicans have long wanted to repeal the tax, but now more Democrats are worried about how it could affect the ability of employers to offer better plans to those who want them.\nKanye West on Ben Carson: ‘Brilliant.’ Rapper and record producer Kanye West had high praise for Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson in an interview with Vanity Fair, calling the retired neurosurgeon “brilliant.” West tells the magazine: “As soon as I heard [Ben] Carson speak, I tried for three weeks to get on the phone with him. I was like this is the most brilliant guy.” West also said he’s “definitely” still interested in running for president himself — though he’d prefer “not to run against someone.”\nTrump says photos made him ‘look like a shmuck’: Donald Trump isn’t pleased with the Associated Press photographer who took a photograph of several empty chairs at an event in South Carolina on Wednesday . Trump told the Daily Mail the photographer is “a [expletive] thief” and a “fraud.” Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, told the Daily Mail the room was full. “Everybody surged forward,” he said. “I was speaking from the podium. Everybody was wrapped around the podium. If they hadn’t done that, there wouldn’t have been an empty seat.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2015/09/kanye-west-yeezy-season-2-interview", "http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/dems-call-for-repeal-of-obamacares-cadillac-tax/article/2572766", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3248214/It-s-godd-n-unfair-Trump-says-photos-half-South-Carolina-ballroom-look-like-schmuck-audience-crowded-podium-near-him.html#ixzz3mhPvpRo3", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/24/jeb-bush-win-black-voters-with-aspiration-not-free-stuff/", "http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2284"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:57:38.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
