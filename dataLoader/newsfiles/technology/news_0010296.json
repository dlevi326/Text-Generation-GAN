Unknown hackers infected legitimate programs by persuading app developers to download a tainted copy of the toolkit. It was the first time a company executive has talked about efforts to secure the App Store since the attack surfaced late last week.\n\nChinese app developers have told Reuters they resorted to downloading the tainted software kit for developers from unofficial, third-party sources because of slow speeds downloading from Apple's official servers located overseas. Many complained the US tech giant should do more to support developers in the company's second-biggest market.\n\nSchiller also said that Apple plans to list 25 tainted apps that the company has identified so that customers can delete and update them, according to the Chinese-language site.\n\nHe said the company knows of no cases where tainted apps have been used to transmit customer data.\n\nThe company announced that it was moving to clean up its App Store on Sunday, after several cyber security firms reported finding a malicious program dubbed XcodeGhost that was embedded in hundreds, possible thousands, of legitimate apps.\n\nIt is the first reported case of large numbers of malicious software programs making their way past Apple's stringent app review process. Prior to this attack, a total of just five malicious apps had ever been found in the App Store, according to cyber security firm Palo Alto Networks Inc.\n\nResearchers said infected apps included Tencent Holdings Ltd's popular mobile chat app WeChat, car-hailing app Didi Kuaidi and a music app from Internet portal NetEase Inc.\n\nApple removed the malicious versions of those apps from the App store and those developers replaced them with clean updates. Apple iOS 9 arrives: Top 9 features of 10 Apple’s latest mobile operating system iOS9 is here. The new mobile operating system offers several new features including battery improvements and a smarter virtual assistant.\n\nHere are the top features of iOS 9… Besides under-the-hood improvements, a new low-power mode will reduce or turn off non-essential tasks such as visual effects and automatic downloads. The phone also won’t check for new mail or update content for apps in the background as often in that mode. From the main home screen, swipe left to right for a new search screen. The Siri virtual assistant suggests frequently used contacts and apps and nearby businesses, taking into account whether it’s evening or lunch time.\n\nAs you jump around from app to app, some apps show a new back button on the top left corner to get you back to what you were doing. Swipe down from the top edge for missed notifications, with the most recent on top. Before, they were grouped by app, so you had to sift through weeks-old notifications from little-used apps to find the new ones.\n\nYou can restore grouping by app in the settings. If you choose a particular song as your alarm sound, the song will keep playing until you turn off the alarm or hit snooze.\n\nEarlier, the alarm used to automatically stop once the song ended, even if you didn’t hear it. Now, you’ll hear it over and over — though that might just encourage you to stay in bed.
