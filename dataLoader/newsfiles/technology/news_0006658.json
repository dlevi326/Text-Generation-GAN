Attending a hiring event is a great way of getting to know which companies and what industries are hiring. Getting veteran job seekers in front of those companies is “Job One” for reStart. And “getting the word out” is what MilitaryConnection.com does best.\n“At MilitaryConnection.com, we use our tremendous reach in the military and veteran communities to spread the word about those issues we know are important to our audience, such as employment, education, benefits and resources,” said CEO Debbie Gregory. “Face-to-face hiring events allow veterans to sell their abilities to prospective employers in ways that don’t translate on to paper.”\nreStart’s hiring events are dedicated to matching top veteran talent with national employers who recognize what the men and women who have served bring to the table. The company often partners with military bases, and many of the events include workshops, resume critiques, and workforce development services.\n“Whether you’re looking for immediate employment or passively checking-out the job market, reStart offers a convenient way to learn, apply, interview and develop relationships with several companies - all in one day,” explained CEO Ken Fuller.\nFor those job seekers who are unable to attend a live job fair, MilitaryConnection.com has an outstanding job board, as well as a Virtual Job Fair. In addition to being named a Top 100 Employment Web Site by the International Association of Employment Web Sites for five years in a row, the website was singled out as one of the honorees for the 2015 Users Choice Award. Chosen out of 200,000 employment websites by the job seekers, employers and recruiters who use them, the Users Choice Award indicates the intensity of support users have for their favorite sites.\n“Those who have served have so much to offer when they transition to the private sector. Besides having a work ethic second to none, they have demonstrated the ability to work under pressure, alongside a diverse group of people, in multiple environments,” Gregory added.\nAbout MilitaryConnection.com\nMilitaryConnection.com offers one of the most comprehensive directories of military and Veteran resources on the web. The website features thousands of pages of resources and information, with something for everyone. This includes the aforementioned Job Board and Virtual Job Fair, as well as comprehensive Post 9/11 GI Bill education information, a directory of thousands of scholarships, a Veteran school directory, news, press releases, special events, pay charts, benefits, service directories, commissaries and exchanges, golf courses and more. When the next tour is back home, it’s on Military Connection, the Go To Site.\nAbout reStart:\nreStart delivers the finest, most convenient and effective hiring events.
