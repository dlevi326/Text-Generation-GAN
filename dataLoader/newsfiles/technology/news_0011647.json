Amanda Forstrom, a technology expert and special reporter for NewsWatch, conducted the review and shared with viewers how this powder instantly stops minor bleeding. When bleeding, two of the most important things to do are stop the flow of blood and protect the wound. Well, WoundSeal does just that with their powder that instantly creates a scab by interacting with the proteins in the blood. The scab stops bleeding, protects the wound, and falls off naturally as the wound heals.\nWhen using WoundSeal, the powder needs to be directly poured onto the cut and pressed down for 30 seconds. This will stop the bleeding and form the scab. It’s been cleared by the FDA for everything from minor to nuisance bleeding.\nWoundSeal is great for people who tend to be accident prone or work in areas where injuries are common, and it’s especially valuable for the seniors with thin skin or those that bleed easily. WoundSeal starts at $7.29 for a pack of 4 and is available in over 25,000 stores across the US including all Walgreens, CVS and Rite-Aids, as well as other local retailers.\nTo learn more, visit http://www.WoundSeal.com today.\nAbout NewsWatch\nNewsWatch is a weekly 30-minute consumer oriented television show that airs on the Discovery Channel and ION Network.
