The new design approach overcomes these difficulties. \nThe research, published in Nature, was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and involved collaboration with Trinity College Dublin .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T11:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T22:12:06.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
