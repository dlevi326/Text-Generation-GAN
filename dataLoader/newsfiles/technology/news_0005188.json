He made no comment to media as he entered court.\nBut while the hearing has been a long time coming , Monday’s session is expected to be filled with more legal debate.\nDubbed the “Mega Conspiracy” by the FBI , US authorities allege Dotcom and his associates – Mathias Ortmann, Finn Batato and Bram van der Kolk – were involved in an organised criminal enterprise centred on copyright violation through Megaupload which earned them $175m (£112m).\nThe men are facing charges which, if they are found guilty in the US, carry decades of jail time.\nEarlier this month Dotcom made a last-ditch bid to the court of appeal to have the extradition hearing put off again, but it failed.\nJudge Nevin Dawson doesn’t have to decide whether the four are guilty or not, only if they should be surrendered to the US and go to trial there.\nThe hearing is expected to take several weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T09:00:07.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
