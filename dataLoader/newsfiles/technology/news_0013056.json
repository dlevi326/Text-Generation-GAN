It vowed to get aid to the victims. \n\"This dramatic situation is the result of heavy rainfall in recent days across our coastal area, causing flooding and destruction of bridges... All rural roads have deteriorated and flooded, and access to the place is virtually impossible,\" it said. \n\"Authorities report a toll of seven deaths, including two bodies found, five still buried in the rubble, 12 injured,\" the statement went on. \nTen homes were destroyed while livestock and poultry were missing and six hectares (15 acres) of palm oil plantation land had been rendered unusable, the government said. \n\"A dozen families are without homes in the rain. This is a fact of God and we trust in him,\" said Mamadouba Camara, confirming the deaths of his two sons. \nA neighbour, Alya Camara, had earlier told AFP that seven people were missing, including a man aged 50, two elderly women and four young men. \nDeaths and disappearances are frequent in Guinea, one of the wettest countries in west Africa, during the June-to-November rainy season. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:42:14.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
