Qapital now works with nearly 20,000 U.S. banks, credit unions and community banks. Qapital now also supports bank-affiliated credit cards for these institutions. This powerful integration offers Qapital's unique functions that link savings goals to everyday spending habits to millions of U.S. users. Here's how it works: After setting a goal and linking their checking account to an interest-bearing, FDIC insured Qapital account, users grow their savings by activating in-app Rules such as the “Guilty Pleasure Rule” (save when you shop at a particular place), “Moves” (tie your financial goals with your fitness goals), “Spend Less” (save money whenever you come under budget) and “Round Up” (save your change).\nQapital is the first banking app to have a channel on the web-service IFTTT (If This Then That), allowing users to transform their everyday online behaviors into opportunities to save money. Qapital users can use Twitter hashtags, Facebook updates, and Instagram posts as well as other popular apps, including Dropbox, Uber, Fitbit, ESPN, and Weather to save money toward their selected goals.\n“This news means that Qapital is now available to millions of Americans who are dissatisfied with the fees and headaches of modern-day banking,” said George Friedman, CEO of Qapital.\nAvailable now on iOS, Qapital will be introducing an Android app version later this fall.\nQapital accounts are held by Iowa-based Lincoln Savings Bank, a 115-year-old institution and member of FDIC.\nQapital has received funding from Northzone , a venture capital and investment firm with stakes in over 100 groundbreaking and technology-enabled companies, including the music service Spotify.\nMeet Qapital\nQapital was founded in 2013. Its mission: to help young Americans save for the things they want in life, by building a mobile banking solution that they love to use.
