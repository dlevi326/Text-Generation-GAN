He said they are eating up funding that might have gone into research in past years.\nOn Wednesday, Kendall said he understood that publicly traded corporations needed to generate returns for shareholders, and that budget cuts had limited the number of \"new program starts,\" which made it difficult for them to commit to larger internal investments.\nBut he said he hoped several key initiatives aimed at boosting innovation through specific technology demonstration programs would motivate companies to increase R&D spending in coming years.\nKendall told industry executives that years of mandatory budget cuts had taken their toll on the Pentagon, and left the U.S. military without the technology it needs to maintain a long-standing competitive edge over potential adversaries.\nHe said Defense Secretary Ash Carter's initiative to reach out to technology firms in Silicon Valley, and a separate project aimed at identifying critical long-term research needs, should provide targets for increased corporate investment.\nHe said details about the long-term research projects would likely not be released publicly to avoid giving secrets to potential foes, although companies in the sector would be informed.\n\"Those programs will give industry a target to aim at,\" Kendall told Reuters. \"If they're willing to make the investment, those are going to be competitive for the most part, and they're going to lead to the systems that follow, once we have the budgets to support them.\"\nKendall told executives at the event that he hoped they would relax a bit after he revised a plan to require government \"sponsors\" for internal research and development projects that can be billed as overhead, which had drawn sharp criticism from industry.
