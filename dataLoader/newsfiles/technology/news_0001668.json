The iVA was evaluated and approved for use by carrier employees and contractors for all types of on-site sweep testing, including swept VSWR, return loss, and distance-to-fault in the RF path.\nThe low cost, handheld iVA Cable & Antenna Analyzer only weighs 1.5 lbs (680 g), making it ideal for tower top environments. It can connect directly to devices under test, eliminating the need for a phase-stable cable, and can be managed by laptop or tablet via Bluetooth from the ground, if so desired. The iVA also enables geo-tagging and photos to be easily included in site testing reports for increased efficiency.\n“The iVA allows you to get up the tower, quickly make your measurements, and get on to the next site,” said Rick Hartman, Kaelus President, Test & Measurement, “This product is all about effective workflow. Your measurements can be instantly placed in your reports, and emailed to the customer. There’s no need for post-site processing, saving you time and money.”\nFor more information on the iVA Cable & Antenna Analyzer page on visit www.kaelus.com , or for a Quote: please contact Kaelus .\n###\nAbout Kaelus\nKaelus, a Smiths Microwave company, is a recognized leader in test and measurement instruments, cell-site filters, combiners and tower mounted amplifiers.
