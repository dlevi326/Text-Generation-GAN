Picture: Supplied But Mr Jacoby said buyers would have to get used to the new world order.\n“It is just more or less a perception from the customer they need a big engine and big horsepower to have the performance,” said Mr Jacoby.\n“I know they are charming and I like the sound of the V8 but times are changing. The technology is changing with more or less the same performance. The acceptance is changing, even in America.”\nThere is also no chance that Holden might import a budget-priced V8 sedan from the USA.\nHolden currently exports the Commodore V8 to North America where it is sold as a Chevrolet.\nBut there are no plans for Chevrolet to develop a successor in 2018.\nRed hot .... the popularity of the Holden V8 is ‘coming to an end’. Picture: Supplied “That (US car) phases out when we see manufacturing end in Australia,” said Mr Jacoby.\nThe GM executive insisted that the next generation Holden Commodore, likely to be imported from Germany, will still have “the same fun to drive same sportiness” as the current car, even though it won’t have a V8.\nHolden is also said to be planning on introducing the next generation Corvette, but it will likely cost in excess of $100,000.\nThat means Holden’s arch rival Ford will be the only brand with an affordable V8 in its showrooms within two years.\nThe Ford Mustang, available with four-cylinder or V8 power, arrives in Australia in December priced from $45,000 to $65,000.\n Holden V8 Commodore dead", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/97b697f8f509ba686162a725f7c1ec4c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/37bdba20203810c1a5dc315e11f9c313", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/aac9dd66c9b7ae2e70ac4617a84b97b8", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/holden-will-stop-making-the-v8-in-2017-citing-changing-technology/story-fnjwucvh-1227529227740?sv=85e091dfa8f035078594d3d58fc4dfda", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6fb85d062ddea53fbbe4fce53904a85d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8cb525e470f75e2f9d0aab5daecf42e8?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a26c02d2af5f58a22387758f30d2d7ee", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6e4bbdb278a268040c85b8ddb8e66e6a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4951916a7ddcd6134c70354e3e82e6f2?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-18T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T16:00:15.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
