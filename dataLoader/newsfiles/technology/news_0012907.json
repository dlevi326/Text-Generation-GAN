But the airstrikes mark the start of a new phase of the conflict that posed uncertainties for a US-led coalition that has been conducting military operations for a year.\nThe authorisation, which was passed unanimously by Russia's Federation Council, came after a request for military assistance by Mr Assad.\nRussia hasn't acknowledged the beginning of any airstrikes, although Syrian activists say they have seen stepped-up bombardment in the suburbs of Homs and Hama. Russian television in recent days has aired footage from journalists embedded with Syrian government forces in the vicinity of Homs.\nSergei Ivanov, the Kremlin chief of staff, said Russia's military involvement would be limited to an air campaign targeting Islamic State, also known as ISIL.\n\"As our president already said, the use of military forces in ground combat has been ruled out,\" Mr Ivanov said. \"The military goal of these operations is exclusively limited to air support for the Syrian government forces in their campaign against ISIL.\"\nThe authorization represents something of an about-face for the Kremlin. The Russian government has until now insisted that it was only sending \"military specialists\" to assist the training of Mr Assad's military and the delivery of military hardware.\nWednesday's resolution comes as a full acknowledgment that Russia is ready to take part in combat operations.\nThe Russian government's moves may clear up potential legal ambiguities raised by the deployment of Russian forces abroad. The government says it is acting in accordance with international law by sending forces at the invitation of Mr Assad's government, but some Russian activists have raised concerns about Russia ramping up its involvement in Syria without approving a formal deployment.\nMr Ivanov said that thousands of Russian citizens and others from the former Soviet Union are fighting on the side of Islamic State, and that many have returned home, presenting a direct threat.\n\"The point here is not in achieving any foreign policy goals or satisfying ambitions,\" Mr Ivanov said. \"We're talking exclusively about Russia's national interests.\"\nHe didn't specify how long the military involvement would be.\nThe Syrian presidency posted a statement to both its official Facebook page and the official Syrian Arab News Agency on Wednesday that said Mr Assad had sent a letter to Mr Putin requesting the deployment of Russian air forces to Syria. It didn't specify when the letter had been sent.\nMr Putin appeared Monday before the United Nations General Assembly in New York where he called for the creation of a broad front to confront Islamic State.\nBefore his appearance, Iraq said it had reached an intelligence-sharing agreement with Russia, the Syrian regime and Iran, further solidifying an emerging alliance among the four countries.\nPresident Barack Obama says Syria can no longer return to the pre-civil war rule of Mr Assad after years of bloodshed -- a contention that Mr Putin has dismissed.\nMr Putin's intervention would be a major complication to Western efforts in the region, where a US program to train moderate Syrian rebels has faltered and a coalition to counter Islamic State has been moving slowly at best.\nUS military officials have raised concerns about the possibility of an inadvertent confrontation between Russian and US military aircraft.\nGeneral of the Army Yury Yakubov, a senior Russian defense official, said the strikes would be carried out with the assistance of a coordination center in Baghdad set up by Russia, Syria, Iraq and Iran.\n\"Information about the conduct out of airstrikes will be communicated to American representatives in Baghdad as well,\" he said.\nThe US military's Central Command, which oversees military operations in the region, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nNews of the Russian government's readiness to carry out strikes drew approval from hawkish Russian lawmakers. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a Duma member and prominent nationalist, called the Kremlin's move a \"decision of global import.\"\nIf Islamic State is not halted in Syria, Mr Zhirinovsky said in televised remarks, \"then it will extend its grip to the south Caucasus and north Caucasus.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T17:58:03.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
