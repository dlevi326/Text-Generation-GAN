He said the new button is ready to be tested soon and could be rolled out broadly depending on how it does.\n___\nOnline:\nHighlights of Zuckerberg's Q&A: http://bit.ly/1W1dCam\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1W1dCam", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-09-16T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T11:15:51.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
