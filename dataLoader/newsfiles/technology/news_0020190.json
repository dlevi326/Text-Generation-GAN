Texting, a primary form of communication for Americans under 50, is frequently overlooked by small businesses as a tool to build repeat customer visits. SpringBIG’s loyalty marketing technology gives small businesses a new edge in building sales through a suite of easy-to-use features that include a digital rewards platform, text, email and social media. “Small business owners know they need to stay in touch with their customers but they lack the time and tools to do so effectively,” said Jeffrey Harris, co-founder and CEO, SpringBIG. “Including text in a unified marketing campaign is just one of the ways SpringBIG makes building customer relationships easier for small businesses.”\nA 3 month study of small businesses using SpringBIG technology showed that a SpringBIG business increased retail foot traffic by 185%, which translated to more than $4,000 in incremental revenue and preventing over $2,500 in leakage. A small business with an average of $26 in revenue per customer visit can increase ROI by 420% when customers sign up at the SpringBIG station.\nSmall businesses choose the scale of SpringBig that fits their business needs, staring with a free-forever level and building to a full suite of services for $139.95 per month. All accounts include a free tablet with $19.95 shipping charge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:44:01.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
