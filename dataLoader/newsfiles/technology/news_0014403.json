Thanks to a team of Northwestern students, the statistic may greatly decrease without senior citizens needing to change their nightly habits, thanks to Luna Lights . \nCreated by Donovan Morrison, Matt Wilcox and Wesley Youman, Luna Lights is a combination bed pad and light system that turns on lights when a person sits up from bed, and turns back off once they lie down. They created the device through Northwestern’s Design for America Summer Studio program, wherein they were tasked with solving the problem of decreasing night-time falls for older adults. Their solution allows these adults to have a light source immediately at their disposal, rather than blindly attempting to find a light switch or make their way to their intended destination in the dark. The system is portable and can be used in homes or in assisted living spaces. \nThe device uses a pressure pad that is placed on the mattress where the person sleeps and is connected to a piece of hardware underneath the bed. Once the person moves off the pad, the hardware sends out radio frequencies to turn on the wall lights. Once the user returns to bed, the frequencies stop and the lights are then turned off. \nThe system also measures how long the adult in question has been out of bed and can contact a specific person or institution if that time is longer than a designated amount of time. That way, if the adult in question does not have a health-monitor on them or if something unexpectedly happens, the appropriate authorities can come to their aid. This information can be accessed through the use of the caretaker’s phone. \nWhile Luna Lights is not currently on the market, it provides a clear and innovative model for how to shed light onto the problem of elderly injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:09:18.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
