IKD is an eight-person team of professional kitchen designers who provide custom designs online for people who want to purchase an IKEA kitchen for their homes. Of the 2,500 IKD designs, 98 percent of customers are based in the U.S. and Canada.\n“Worldwide, our clients seek out IKD for help using IKEA’s often-confusing kitchen planning tool,” said Michael Toth, Inspired Kitchen Design CEO/founder and one of the leading authorities in kitchen and bath design for almost 30 years. “Our team of experts does more than just fill in the Home Planner for our customers. The IKD team applies their years of kitchen design experience to bring their kitchens to life.”\nIKEA kitchens and furniture are extremely popular around the globe. IKEA Group (INGKA Holding B.V. and its controlled entities) reported a net profit of €3.3 billion (approximately 3.7B USD) in their Fiscal Year 2014 report.\n“In spite of IKEA’s appeal for the do-it-yourself crowd, we’ve found that our customers end up wasting a lot of their time trying to put together a kitchen using IKEA’s Home Planner,” said Toth. “When they hire IKD, we get them back on schedule with a design that just works.”\nHow Inspired Kitchen Design Works\nIKD offers two levels of engagement for customers needing help with their IKEA kitchen designs. All customers receive:\nAn online consultation with a first design draft being emailed in 3 business days\nTwo free revisions to the design\nA 3D, high-resolution, full-color rendering of the final kitchen design so they know how their kitchen will look in their home\nDetailed drawings with cabinet and wall measurements so they know where everything will go in their new kitchen\nFewer trips to the IKEA store, thanks to the 100 percent complete shopping list IKD creates that the Home Planner can’t create\nSee what Inspired Kitchen Design has done for 2,500 IKEA kitchens worldwide on the IKD online portfolio .\nAbout Inspired Kitchen Design\nInspired Kitchen Design (IKD) has created 2,500 IKEA kitchen designs completely online since 2008. Aside from avoiding the Home Planner, all customers receive and love the high-resolution color renderings, detailed drawings with cabinet and wall measurements, and the complete shopping list they get from IKD.
