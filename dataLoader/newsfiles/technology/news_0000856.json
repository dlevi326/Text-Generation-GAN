(NYSE: RHT), the world's largest provider of open source software solutions, today announced that Corvesta, Inc. has selected Red Hat CloudForms as part of Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure to manage its build-out of a cohesive, hybrid cloud infrastructure aimed at business diversification. CloudForms will manage Corvesta's existing private cloud infrastructure consisting of resources from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, Amazon Web Services ( News - Alert ) and VMware. \nCorvesta, Inc., a company dedicated to advancing oral health, evaluated multiple cloud management platforms in order to transform their legacy infrastructure into an agile sandbox environment for development, as well as to explore the possibility of horizontal scaling through cloud computing that could respond to the business' demand. They selected Red Hat CloudForms for its open source ecosystem, which allows the solution to fully integrate and serve as the primary interface for Corvesta's existing cloud and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization resources with little-to-no modification. Additionally, Red Hat CloudForms includes Corvesta's required infrastructure and management tools as well as a robust suite of offerings around compliance and policy management, service catalog management, automation and reporting, and optimization and utilization toolsets. \nAlong with automation and management tools, Red Hat CloudForms' support of multiple programming languages and the REST API allowed Corvesta to customize modules for their web interface and quickly develop test environments for those products through an automated service catalog- reducing the process from several days to less than 48 hours. Red Hat CloudForms' ability to run as an appliance on a virtual machine also allowed the platform to easily integrate into Corvesta's high availability and disaster recovery infrastructure by following a standard cloning and migrating process between data centers. \nIn the future, Corvesta expects to expand their virtualization and storage resources, and migrate more proprietary resources to Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, especially as they continue to grow their business in the oral health and related industries. \nSupporting Quote \nJoe Fitzgerald, Vice President, Management Business Unit, Red Hat \n\"We are pleased to see Corvesta moving towards an open source management platform with Red Hat CloudForms. CloudForms' ability to scale across open hybrid cloud environments out-of-the-box makes it an ideal choice to expand enterprise cloud footprints; we look forward to supporting Corvesta as they expand their cloud-based offerings on a foundation of open source technologies.\" \nDean Rodil, Corvesta's Director of Technology and Infrastructure Strategy \n\"Corvesta is excited to be working with Red Hat on our cloud initiative. Working on our CloudForms and hybrid cloud proof of concept with the Red Hat team has given us a great opportunity to learn how CloudForms and hybrid cloud architectures can enable and enhance our enterprise infrastructure.\" \nAdditional Resources Follow Red Hat on LinkedIn \nAbout Red Hat \nRed Hat is the world's leading provider of open source software solutions, using a community-powered approach to reliable and high-performing cloud, Linux, middleware, storage and virtualization technologies.
