(NYSE Paris:SESG) (LuxX:SESG) and O3b, a company in which SES holds 45 per cent, offer an essential advantage to customers with the combination of their respective satellite fleets at two orbits, the Geostationary Orbit (GEO) and the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO). This is the conclusion of the new SES White Paper “GEO-MEO. Proven. Efficient. Scalable.” that SES has published today at the opening of the World Satellite Business Week, held this week in Paris. \nSES owns and operates 52 satellites in GEO at 36,000 kilometres distance from the Earth. With their wide beams and combined with innovative High Throughput technology, this fleet is the ideal and proven infrastructure to cover large geographies efficiently with high-quality linear broadcast and with broadband and data solutions. O3b operates a dozen satellites in the lower MEO, at 8,000 kilometres distance from where high speed data and broadband connections are possible with a low latency and, per consequence, at fibre-like speed. \n“GEO and MEO is the ideal proposition for customers to develop entirely scalable, versatile and hyper-efficient network topologies,” the new SES White Paper concludes. “The combination of GEO and MEO fleets is a technological breakthrough that is transforming the connectivity landscape. This combined offering is the key differentiator in delivering reliable and fast Next Generation Data services across many different sectors and geographies. The match between GEO and MEO satellites and the scalability of both fleets offer an essential advantage to customers and will fulfil growing future demands.” \nRead the full SES White Paper: http://read.uberflip.com/i/570274-ses-wp-geo-meo \nFollow us on:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T13:17:29.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
