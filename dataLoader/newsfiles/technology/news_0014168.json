Rough cut (no reporter narration). Reuters Video Video: Craters on closeup: NASA releases new hi-res images of Saturn's moon Dione Zou said the mission’s objective would be to study geological conditions on the moon’s far side, also known as the dark side.\nThat could eventually lead to the placement of a radio telescope for use by astronomers, something that would help “fill a void” in man’s knowledge of the universe, Zou said.\nRadio transmissions from Earth are unable to reach the moon’s far side, making it an excellent location for sensitive instruments.\nChina’s next lunar mission is scheduled for 2017, when it will attempt to land an unmanned spaceship on the moon before returning to Earth with samples. If successful, that would make China only the third country after the United States and Russia to have carried out such a manoeuvr.\nChina’s lunar exploration program, named Chang’e after a mythical goddess, has already launched a pair of orbiting lunar probes, and in 2013 landed a craft on the moon with a rover onboard.\nChina has also hinted at a possible crewed mission to the moon.\nChina sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 and has powered ahead with a series of methodically timed steps, including the deploying of an experimental space station.\n More Related to this Story Jupiter-like planet spotted by camera featuring Canadian-built parts\nStars align for a spectacular Perseid meteor shower\nToday’s ‘blue moon’ wasn’t that big a deal (and might not even be a blue moon)\nTopics: China Comments A A", "external_links": ["http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/c3e/video/article26045281.ece/ALTERNATES/w140/2015-08-21T043443Z_1_OV2X1EVK1_RTRMADC_0_SPACE-SATURN-MOON-ROUGH-CUT.XML"], "published": "2015-09-09T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T11:59:04.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
