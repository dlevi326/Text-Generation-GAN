Like BlackBerry, Good has a very strong presence in enterprises and governments around the world and, with this transaction, BlackBerry will enhance its sales and distribution capabilities and further grow its enterprise software revenue stream,” he added. \nBlackberry said Good’s capabilities and technologies are complimentary to its own and allow it to expand its presence with global enterprise and government customers. The company noted Good serves more than 6,200 organizations, including more than half of the Fortune 100, and industries as diverse as banking and manufacturing. \nThe Waterloo-based company will integrate Good within its enterprise portfolio, which already includes BBM, WatchDox – which the company bought earlier this year – and Good Work. \nBlackBerry expects the transaction to be completed toward the end of the company’s 2016 fiscal third quarter. It remains subject to customary closing conditions.
