The pacemaker, mechanical heart valve and hearing aid all began life in Minneapolis, arguably the largest hub of medical device innovation. This November, thought leaders and top suppliers across the Minnesota medical device and manufacturing community will gather at Minnesota Medtech Week, presented in partnership by Medical Design & Manufacturing (MD&M) Minneapolis and LifeScience Alley, the most respected medtech association in Minnesota. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150914/266338 \nMinnesota Medtech Week is an unprecedented combination of the two most important medical device and health technology events in the region. MD&M Minneapolis (est. in 1994) and LifeScience Alley's conference (est. in 1984) have a combined 50-year history in the Twin Cities, and have joined forces under one roof. Engaging the entire medtech community, Minnesota Medtech Week will gather all key players in the industry - from engineers and product developers to physicians, hospital administrators and executives. Nowhere else will attendees experience the same level of comprehensive discussion and education. \nMinnesota Medtech Week and all co-located events will take place November 4-5, 2015, at the Minneapolis Convention Center. \n\"Led by world class content, an expanded exhibit floor and even more networking opportunities, Minnesota Medtech Week forges a powerhouse partnership between the leader in medical manufacturing events and the most important regional healthtech association,\" said Stephen Corrick, senior vice president, UBM Canon. \n\"In a region vital to the global medtech industry and the home of the world's largest medical manufacturer, Minnesota Medtech Week brings the community together to demo new technologies, exchange ideas, meet new partners and ultimately provide inspiration to continue designing and manufacturing life saving devices,\" said Shaye Mandle, president and CEO of LifeScience Alley. \nMarket Access & Patient Engagement: Educational Opportunities & Top Industry Speakers Minnesota Medtech Week features world-class educational sessions packed with practical learning. Two concurrent conference tracks take deep dives into two of the most important industry topics--market access and patient engagement--with sessions around advanced design innovation, medical reimbursement, new technologies and medical innovation. An additional conference track will feature a day of sessions on 3D printing, and another day will be devoted to a design innovation workshop with Insight PD. \nMore than 50 leaders from medtech giants Boston Scientific, 3M, Medtronic, UnitedHealthcare, Olympus, St. Jude Medical and more will share their insights. \nMore than 1,000 Suppliers Featured at the Expo The expansive Expo will feature more than 1,000 medtech suppliers of the latest technologies , materials, and services . On the expo floor, Center Stage will offer free presentations (including how wearables can predict life expectancy and how to speed up the FDA approval process), product teardowns, and other fun activities. Also at Center Stage, the complimentary speed networking session will match and introduce participants according to their interests. \nCo-Located Events Cover Wide Scope of Advanced Manufacturing Minnesota Medtech Week will expand its focus further to include six additional high tech manufacturing events, bringing in suppliers from a broad cross-section of the advanced manufacturing industry. The flagship event, MD&M Minneapolis, has long been co-located with MinnPack, which is focused on final packaging. This year, the expanded event will also feature Design & Manufacturing Minneapolis, ATX Minneapolis (automation technology), PLASTEC Minneapolis (plastics), and Quality Expo Showcase Minneapolis, all produced by UBM Canon. Broadening the scope even further, UBM Canon will bring in Embedded Systems Conference (ESC), welcoming embedded systems hardware, software and firmware developers. \nFor more information and to register for Minnesota Medtech Week and all co-located events, visit: -- MD&M Minneapolis: mdmminn.mddionline.com -- MinnPack: minnpack.packagingdigest.com -- Design & Manufacturing Minneapolis: dm-minn.designnews.com -- ATX Minneapolis: atxminn.designnews.com -- PLASTEC Minneapolis: plastecminn.plasticstoday.com -- Quality Expo Showcase Minneapolis: qualityexpo-minneapolis.designnews.com -- Embedded Systems Conference Minneapolis: embeddedconf.com/minneapolis \nAbout UBM Canon UBM Canon is the leading B-to-B event producer, publisher, and digital media company for the world's $3 trillion advanced, technology-based manufacturing industry.
