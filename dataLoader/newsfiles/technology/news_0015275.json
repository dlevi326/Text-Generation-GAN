Egyptian archaeologists take pictures next to the sarcophagus of King Tutankhamun in his burial chamber in the Valley of the Kings, close to Luxor, 500 kms south of Cairo on September 28, 2015 \nRadar to scan the walls \nCircled by archaeologists and officials from Egypt's antiquities department, Minister of Antiquities Mamduh al-Damati listened attentively to the expert from the American University of Arizona as Reeves said the frescos in the chamber could conceal two secret doors. \n\"The theory is a very good theory but it doesn't mean it's true. The best theories don't always work,\" he added with caution, in the midst of the Valley of the Kings where on November 29, 1922 another British Egyptologist, Howard Carter, discovered Tutankhamun's tomb. \n\"But I think it's definitely worth checking because we can check easily and without damage,\" the archaeologist said, explaining that with a radar being brought in from Japan he will be able to scan the chamber's walls. \n\"I hope we can do some radar and find out whether there is a hollow,\" Reeves said, aiming to start the tests in late November. \n\"You have to get security clearance and that always takes time,\" he said. A Nefertiti bust is pictured during the exhibition \"In The Light Of Amarna\" to mark the 100 years of the Nefertiti bust discovery at the Neues Museum in Berlin, on December 5, 2012 \nReeves has been on a visit to Egypt, ending with a press conference in Cairo on Thursday, to discuss his theory with Egyptian colleagues and for preliminary research in the field. \n\"I am now 70 percent certain that we are going to find something,\" said Damati, the minister, as he stepped out of the tomb. \nExperts from his ministry would have to approve more advanced excavations, which could take between one and three months, to ensure the radar can scan the walls \"without damaging them\", he said. A picture taken on September 28, 2015 shows the golden sarcophagus of King Tutankhamun in his burial chamber in the Valley of the Kings, close to Luxor, 500 kms south of Cairo \nBut the minister was not so sure that Nefertiti's tomb would be discovered. \nHe speculated they could find the tomb of Kiya, another of Akhenaton's wives, or even another royal family member whose tomb would have been extended to make room for Tutankhamun. \n\"If another wing to this tomb or one that predates it is found, that alone would be a major discovery,\" Egypt's antiquities minister said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T23:13:37.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
