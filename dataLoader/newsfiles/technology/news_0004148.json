It is a simple innovation that allows users to refill the ink tanks, instead of replacing the entire cartridge. This makes it cost efficient by having more affordable inks and less repairs if the machine is damaged from repeated replacements of cartridge. and easier to handle.\nBrother Philippines President Glenn P. Hocson said, “Brother’s Refill Tank System’s CMYK refillable ink bottles, and competitively priced 6,000 page-yield that meets high print volume users’ need for lower ‘running’ costs mean bigger savings for consumers.”\nDCP-T700W\nThe new line is part of Brother’s “Customer-First” approach which sees to it that customers get the most user-friendly experience when operating Brother products, by having minimal effort and improved convenience.\nThe new lineup which includes the DCP-T300, DCP-T500W, DCP-T700W, and the MFC-T800W are claimed to be ideal for both home and small scale businesses. The ink bottles that are used to refill the tanks are priced lower than most cartridges, which would boost profits of businesses, and save cost for other businesses and home use. Despite the low-cost ink, these printers continue to produce high-quality printouts. These printers have a 6,000 page yield for black ink, and 5,000 for colored ink.\nDCP-T500W\nBrother held a demo on how to refill the printer’s tanks. The steps are simple and straightforward. At the side of the printer is the tank, which are visible for the users to see. Accessing the tank, users only have to remove the cap and pour in the ink. The ink bottle may be gently squeezed a few times for faster refilling. Once that’s done, users all have to do is put back the cap. It was fast and easy.\nAs the ink tanks can be seen from outside the printer, this will allow users to monitor how much ink they have left. It’s another sleek and simple innovation that is well appreciated for the market.\nThe high page yield also means reduced time and effort to go out and purchase inks, adding to Brother’s commitment to their “Customer-First” approach. The use of the refill inks also reduces print head damage that can be encounteredfrom using other inks.\nAs mobile experience continues to expand, Brother has set up their printers with wireless features.\nUsers will be able to print directly from their smartphones and tablets.\nThe Refill Tank series is already available from Brother Philippines’ authorized dealers.\nCosts are inclusive of taxes and include a 1 Year Warranty, plus a 1 Year Extended Warranty, or 30,000 pages — whichever comes first, that is supported by Brother’s Service Centers.
