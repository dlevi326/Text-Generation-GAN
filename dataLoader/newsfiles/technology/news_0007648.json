Goaloop, the Goal MarketÂ®, has joined the Global Goals effort to end hunger, promote opportunity and education for all, and protect the planet by 2030. When nearly 200 world leaders meet at the United Nations on Friday to adopt a series of 17 global goals, Goaloop will provide a platform to help the world achieve them. Those who want to take action on the Global Goals can sign up on Goaloop.com . Goaloop is a free, global online platform. Goaloop helps individuals and groups to achieve goals, and then matches complementary goals. For example, a goal to reduce your carbon footprint matches another goal to sell reusable coffee cups.\nGoaloop also enables the merging of goals. If you find a goal similar to yours, you can propose a goal merger to embolden the effort.\n\"Every goal is a footprint of common ground,\" said Lori Terrizzi , Goaloop's CEO/Founder and Site Architect. \"Millions of people worldwide share the desire to reach these 17 global goals. Goaloop was built based on the belief that together, we can achieve anything, but we've lacked a way to organize and connect with one another to fulfill our individual and collective potential. Goaloop's unifying goal platform fills this void. Connecting goals, we can achieve anything together.\"\nGoaloop is based near Columbia University , just north of Central Park, the site of Saturday's Global Citizen Festival. Hosted by Stephen Colbert , Kerry Washington and Salma Hayek Pinault , and featuring Beyonce, Pearl Jam, Common and Ed Sheeran , the event will be broadcast on MSNBC and streamed online worldwide. Meryl Streep, Stephen Hawking , Nobel Prize Winner Malala Yousafzai, Arianna Huffington , Chiwetel Ejiofor , Matt Damon , Bono, Kate Winslet , Leonardo DiCaprio , Emma Thompson , Usher, Bill Gates , and Richard Branson are among the Global Goals' supporters.\n\"Goaloop provides a global platform which will accelerate the achievement of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals,\" said Janet Hanson , Goaloop investor, advisor, and founder of 85 Broads (now Ellevate). \"Goaloop's platform uses the most sophisticated technology to mobilize collective resources around goals, which is incredibly timely and exciting.\"\nOn Goaloop, goals can be advanced through funding (which is optional), by completing action steps, by offering a product or service, participating in a think tank, becoming a goal partner, mentor or mentee (paid or volunteer), voting on a goal, broadcasting a goal via social media, or by simply tracking a goal. Users sign up as an individual, a non-profit or a business.\n\"Goaloop is a women-led productivity platform whose model makes it effortless to help others as you help yourself,\" said Barbara Clarke , Goaloop investor, advisor and Founding Member of Astia Angels. \"Our goals are not only interconnected, they help one another: If your goal is to bike to work, that matches an organization's goal to lobby for a new bike path. Goaloop's real-time stream of goal activity across users enables fast collaboration, feedback and accountability -- and it's fun. Set goals as an individual, a group, business, non-profit, city, country, you name it! No matter what goal you have, someone else has a goal that will help you to achieve it.\"\nGoaloop Advisory Board Member Ellen Moran, former White House Communications Director, Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Commerce, and now GM at H+K Strategies, D.C. Office , said, \"Goaloop is a powerful, flexible tool to organize and mobilize yourself and others. It enables supporters to join in your action steps and execute strategies to achieve your goals. Goaloop's goal network, linking goals across sectors, from for-profit business objectives to non-profit missions, advances collaboration and innovation for the 21st century.\"\nGoaloop's team includes many with ties to Columbia University , with roots in 14 countries, who have come together to build a global network, using the goal to transcend geographic, social, business and ideological boundaries to focus on getting things done.   \nGoaloop is patent pending and has raised $1.2 million . Launch partners include YWCA-NYC, Ellevate, The Rao Institute. Goaloop is an Astia company. Got a goal?
