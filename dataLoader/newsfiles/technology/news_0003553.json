How we feel about the land that hosts our crown jewels as their own is another matter altogether, it’s the rounded attempt at trying to recreate ’95 that is of our greatest concern for the next few weeks.\nThe South African rugby team, or Springboks as they are affectionately known in some parts, will only kick off their tournament the next day, because just like us, they want to watch the opening ceremony with a persuasive drink in hand. As they inevitably run out on the green there will surely be pride rapturing from the chest of each chiselled gladiator, as they would imagine that they share the honour of representing their nation. They will face the prospect of getting sin binned for the cause, they will infringe instinctively at the breakdowns with the dual cause of not just winning it all, but also trying to glue the natives of their country but for a short while.\nThat is the unimaginable burden on the shoulders of 31 men who will be wearing a mostly green with gold trimming shirt, lion feed on right arm and a protea on the chest. Every game they walk on out to, every tournament, has them trying to recapture the singular moment in our young time as a democracy, we believed in an ideal whole heartedly. With Nelson Mandela walking out of Ellis Park and trying to pass for a blindside flank. Every world cup since has been an opportunity to try getting South Africans nostalgic and remind them of the possibilities and it’s no different this time around as well.\nFor all the nation building exercise that gets thrown around every match day squad that is announced, there is an equally chilling reminder of why that dream has since deferred. We are a nation united in pride and patriotism, but equally as divided because for a large many, the 31 men that go to battle for the country, don’t fully represent the strides we have hoped our nation would have made by now. In defiance, some have adopted opposing nations as a symbolic gesture against what the springbok emblem once stood for and represented.\n It’s a tightrope situation, whereas the vast majority are willing on the team to success, some quarters are perhaps hoping there is a less than favourable outcome this tournament for one reason or another. For the rose tinted glass few, it further aids their articulation that things are better run and much more successful, when done so in fair skin and blue eyes. Others are just blinded by national pride and a genuine pursuit of that one time ideal, trying to capture the perfect moment so we can own it again. For the ones on the opposite side of the fence, much like when the national football team is taken to task for their unbalanced win column and the makeup of their colour scheme, they just want to get their own back, while the rest are just keen to see the back of one Heynecke Meyer.\nThere is a general perception that rugby remains South Africa’s sole beacon of hope when it comes to success on the international stage. It presents itself as our most realistic opportunity and it’s hard to argue against the two world cup trophies we boast. Our footballers are quite oft ridiculed and laughed off, while the cricket representation seems to be in much need of the Heimlich Manoeuvre. The contention arises around the matter raised above. So do the Springboks remain the sole beacon of hope for the country on a grand scale symbolically, because they are still in the hands of white privilege and represent the argument that white South Africans have been holding onto in a bid to prevent the change so demanded by many. Or are they the beacon of hope because in the pursuit of the perfect high, 1995 threatened to give us a taste of utopia, the promise and possibilities of our beloved nation lay in a moment where we could not be bothered by sight of a man once banned for his ideals, standing hand in hand and in the top of a man now more synonymous with a packet of Lay’s.\nSo settle on the couch, grab a cold one, get security detail for the remote control for a second as we empathise with Cobus Reinach & Marcel Coetzee, remember that if you believe those 31 out there represent you, then that means so do Siya Kolisi and Rudy Paige…", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:05:51.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
