Henceforth, we will now be offering PSB plan, by default, to our entire base of nearly 157 million existing and new pre-paid users,\" Sashi Shankar, Chief Marketing Officer, Idea Cellular said in a statement. \n\nWith call drops on the rise, telecom secretary Rakesh Garg had also said plans where customers get some free minutes and billing is minute-based need to be examined. \n\nThe problem of call drops has become acute in the last 3-4 months. The scale was such that last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi too voiced serious concern on the issue and asked the officials concerned to take urgent steps to address the problem. \n\nIdea said it has spent Rs 4,050 crore (excluding spectrum) in 2014-15 and has increased its capex plan for FY16 to Rs 6,000-6,500 crore. \n\n\"The company will continue to invest in expanding its robust network of nearly 1,50,000 cell sites covering over 3,60,000 towns and villages with voice and data offerings on 2G and 3G and roll out 4G LTE services in 10 key markets, starting 2016,\" it said. \n\nThe company has made a total investment of Rs 65,094.7 crore in the Indian telephony market so far.
