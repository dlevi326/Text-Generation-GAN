To describe the comeback of Widdop as timely would be to underestimate the significance and influence the 26-year-old has had on the Dragons since making his club debut in round one, 2014.\nIn 23 appearances for Saints this season, Widdop has provided 20 try assists, scored more tries (nine) than any other player for the Dragons while also landing 78 per cent of his goal-kicks.\nHis combination with halves partner Benji Marshall — who returns to the finals arena tonight for the first time since 2011 — is the key to success for the Dragons tonight.\nMarshall holds such a high regard for Widdop that he recently described their partnership as similar to the one he shared with Scott Prince when they combined to lift the NRL premiership trophy at the Wests Tigers in 2005.\nDragons coach Paul McGregor said that with his side’s position as “rank outsiders’ came the prospect of playing tonight without “any pressure.’’\n“It’s (training) been really positive,’’ McGregor said.\n“It’s a place where everyone wants to be at this time of year and for a group that’s come together last October and worked so hard over the last 10 months, it’s really important we go out and put our best foot forward against Canterbury.\n“It’s a new competition starting and for us it’s about playing better than the Bulldogs, for one day of the year, which is this weekend.\n“Regardless of what has happened previously with their club or our club during the year, it’s about us putting the best 80 minutes of football we possibly can.’’", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dd1157697704384181c4cf623f1d18b0?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cc61b189a2d38d791f14ba5922d998e5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/524f4517f20a2d39a4e94ed88452de75", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/47e1109e0009b022c8af38bb169fe2d7", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7f79850cb8606d7ecc2b734ae3d12ccf", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3b7bbc3e5334a8be7fd6493d1d721706", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/00b0f4cbc5942edffdb11383172cd63d", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-11T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T10:04:59.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
