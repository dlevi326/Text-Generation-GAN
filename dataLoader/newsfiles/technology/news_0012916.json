Taking this risk will lower his odds of success. \nAnd that’s quite obvious. Someone doesn’t know something means it’s a walk in the park for others to misinform him. \nA prevalent misconception \nA number of enterprise owners are misinformed. They think having a desktop switch means they don’t need a router. This misinformation is quite prevalent among many small business owners, who seem to be informed people. I’ve even talked to some of them, and you won’t believe what they told me. Recommended for You \nThey told me buying a desktop switch, and a router would cost them more, and that’s why they’ve decided to settle for only one of them. \nThat was the height of ignorance! \nSwitch vs router \nContrary to what many people believe, a router is not exclusively for wireless connection. And just because you have a desktop switch doesn’t mean you don’t need a router. If you ever visit my friend’s office, you’d find an unmanaged DES-1024D 24 port ethernet switch. \nBut you’d also find an HP router there. The router connects networks, and the desktop switch creates networks. That’s the difference between them . Around twenty people sit in the room that has the router and the switch, and all of them use LAN connection. If tomorrow, someone brings a device that’s WiFi compatible, the router can enable him to connect wirelessly. \nThe buddyship \nYou may have a hard time believing it, but wired and wireless connectivity are in a buddyship. An enterprise owner can use simple techniques and turn a router into an access point that can support WiFi devices. \nHere I debunk another myth, that wired and wireless connection are in a loggerhead. The truth is you can extend your existing wired connection to create a simple access point. \nIt’s simpler than you think. You just need two routers, one primary and another secondary. The primary router is to specify the first DNS slot of the secondary router. If your primary router generates an IP address through the DHCP server, and if the address is 192.168.1.1, your secondary router’s address can be 192.168.1.2. \nConfiguring the secondary router \nThe configuration process begins after you set the IP address. Go to the wireless section and check the Enable Wireless box. Select Access Point from the Wireless Mode drop-down menu. On the same page, you’ll find the SSID input box, security and encryption drop-down menus and the shared key input box. \nThe secondary router’s security, encryption, shared key and SSID should be same as those of the primary router. You might have to use a different SSID, but that’s only if you face problems configuring it. The primary and secondary routers should have different channels. If you’ve selected 1, 6, 11 for the primary router, select 3, 8, 13 for the secondary router. \nAfter channel selection , click on Save to make your secondary router functional as a WiFi access point. It can function as an ethernet access point too, for that you need to connect an Ethernet jack to its LAN port. \nCustom enterprise-grade AP \nLet’s suppose you don’t like the idea of DIY. You can then purchase a custom-built enterprise access point. The DIR-855 from D-Link, WRT320N from Linksys and ZoneFlex 7363 from Ruckus Wireless are such access points. \nThey come with scores of benefits, which a makeshift access point cannot offer. The benefits include automatic avoidance of interference, smart firmware, dynamic beamforming support, dual band support, etc. \nCloud access points \nYour options don’t end here. There are cloud vendors providing enterprises cloud-enabled and cloud-managed wireless connectivity solutions. I recommend you to go for the latter as the former puts the wireless controllers on the cloud, which implies connection downtime if the virtual machine ever malfunctions. \nThe cloud-managed solution eliminates the need for a wireless controller by replacing it with a SaaS network manager; the benefit of this model is the access point runs in the absence of a wireless controller . The cloud server might go down, but the access point will stay functional. \nMake an informed choice \nThe purpose of obtaining information is to be able to make an informed choice. I laid out as much information as I could in this article only for you to make an informed choice regarding your connectivity needs. \nImage Courtesy: twitter.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T08:30:41.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
