Sehat launched in 2009 and was the first Indian corporation to provide health news, advice, and expertise around the country.\n“We are proud to announce our first acquisition and welcome Sehat to the Ask The Doctor family” said, Prakash Chand, President and CEO of ATD Health Network Inc. “With Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Digital India initiative, the timing of this acquisition couldn’t have been better as it now allows us to partner with the Indian government to give everyone in the country who has access to the internet, the ability to connect with a doctor.”\nAsk The Doctor, which was founded in 1996 by Cardiologist Dr. Patrick Golden and then later acquired by serial entrepreneur Prakash Chand in 2010, will use the 25,000+ Indian doctors on Sehat’s platform to fulfill the large demand of medical questions coming in from rural India. With the acquisition, Ask The Doctor has increased the number of doctors on their platform to well over 35,000+ doctors.\nAsk The Doctor currently has just over 500,000 active users globally on its secured medical platform (SMP) and receives a large volume of medical questions daily that are answered by top doctors within an hour by email. The company will be launching its phone, video chat and text chat options to the American market in their third quarter of this year.\nAll of Sehat’s 48 employees will go over to ATD Health Network Inc. but a majority of Sehat’s services will remain untouched.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXNrdGhlZG9jdG9yLmNvbS9oZWFsdGgtdG9waWNz", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VoYXQuY29t", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXNrdGhlZG9jdG9yLmNvbQ=="], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T14:09:58.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
