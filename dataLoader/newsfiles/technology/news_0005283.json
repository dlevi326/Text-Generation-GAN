Source: Pebble\nPebble is going full circle with the introduction of the Pebble Time Round. It’s the company’s first smartwatch with a circular display, and it’s also the thinnest and lightest smartwatch on the market, said Eric Migicovsky, Pebble’s CEO.\nThe stainless steel casing is remarkably thin at 7.5 millimeters, weighing about half what a 38-millimeter Apple Watch does. Despite that, it works exactly the same as existing Pebble watches. It runs on the same “timeline” operating system found on Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel . And it uses the same setup as all previous Pebble watches, with three buttons for navigating around the software located on the right side of the watch. The 1.25-inch diameter display is still color e-paper—and there is still no touchscreen.\n“We’ve been making smartwatches for a long time and there’s always been a small number of people who’ve told us that our watches were a bit too big for their wrists,” Mr. Migicovsky told the Journal in an interview. “We really do believe that smartwatches aren’t a one-size-fits-all proposition, but with the right options, smartwatches can be for everyone.”\nThe Pebble Time Round is the thinnest smartwatch on the market. Source: Pebble\nPebble’s simplistic, notification-centric take on the smartwatch remains intact and there’s nothing Pebble Time Round can do that Pebble Time and Time Steel can’t, and vice versa. Yet there is one big difference between the new watch and its big siblings: It has much shorter battery life.\nThe Pebble Time Round will run for two days on a full charge, says Mr. Migicovsky, compared to seven days with the Pebble Time and 10 days with the Time Steel. Still, two days is about double what you’d get on the Apple Watch or any watch running Google’s Android Wear . The Time Round is also the first Pebble to have a quick charging feature, providing a full day of battery life after 15 minutes of charging.\nThe Pebble Time Round will be offered with either 20mm or 14mm band sizes, and it’ll start at $249 with a leather band. The casing will be offered in black or silver finishes in both sizes, or rose gold in the 14-millimeter size. The Pebble Time Steel will be available for preorder starting today at Pebble.com, and it’ll be available through retailers like Amazon, Target and Best Buy in early November.\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/pebble-time-review-the-smartwatch-that-beats-android-wear-1432746001%E2%80%9D", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KL140_Pebble_G_20150923090437.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KL139_Pebble_G_20150923090225.jpg", "http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/09/03/moto-360-and-samsung-gear-s2-first-look-trying-to-run-circles-around-the-apple-watch/%E2%80%9D", "http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/09/21/a-more-useful-apple-watch-watchos-2-inches-forward/%E2%80%9D", "http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/03/03/one-week-later-pebble-launches-high-end-steel-model-of-time-watch/%E2%80%9D"], "published": "2015-09-24T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T04:26:10.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
