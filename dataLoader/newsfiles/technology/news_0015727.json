It is a bigger version of the Satellite Click Mini which launched earlier this year and solves two major pain points. \nFirstly, it has a bigger display (10.1-inch compared to 8.9-inch) which makes the browsing experience a bit less cramped. And secondly, the Z3735 processor has been replaced by an Atom x5-Z8300 model which promises significantly better performance. \nBut this comes with a much higher price tag: while the Satellite Click Mini can be purchased for as little as £199.99 (about $300, AU$430), the suggested retail price of its bigger brother has been set at 499 Euros (about £365, $555, AU$800). \nWhat's more, the Satellite Click Mini comes with a year's subscription to Office 365 Personal, which makes it an even better deal. \nAnyway, enough talk about pricing – let's move on to how the Satellite Click 10 performed, and a quick play with the device showed that it was perfectly responsive for most tasks. \nAs for the rest of the spec, both models share the same configuration: a WUXGA touchscreen display with a 16:10 aspect ratio and a massive bezel to allow for one-handed holding, 2GB DDR3L RAM (with a 4GB option available which will almost certainly accompany a different Intel Atom processor) and 32GB of eMMC storage (expandable to 64GB). \nThe feature list goes further, and also includes a microSD card slot, a front-facing HD camera and an 8-megapixel camera on the rear, Dolby Digital Plus – with side firing speakers – and a battery life of up to 14 hours and 45 minutes when using the keyboard's battery. \nSpeaking of the latter, its layout is similar to the Click Mini with everything – including the touchpad – being just a bit bigger than the 8.9-inch model. Toshiba included two full-size USB ports (2.0 and 3.0 flavours) plus a full-size SD card on the keyboard docking station and a USB 3.1 Type-C port on the tablet. \nThe keyboard, as one might imagine, suffers from the sort of issues that affect ultra-portable devices. Because of the small form factor, it is more difficult to touch type and there's a small but noticeable amount of flex on the keyboard. The touchpad could also be bigger but that would probably be demanding too much. \nTwo interesting features are worth noting. The Satellite Click comes with a dedicated button for Microsoft's Cortana, an integral feature of Windows 10, with dual-array microphones. Then there's an intelligent charging system that will charge the tablet first and discharge after the keyboard to improve its use when docked. Early verdict \nThe obvious target for this new tablet is the Surface 3 which it will manage to trump on some features while losing out on others. We like the fact that the keyboard docking station is included and it is actually a very decent one. \nIt's much preferred compared to Surface 3's passive keyboard solution, and while it makes the combination heavier, it also adds battery life and expansion ports while making the typing experience slightly more comfortable. \nThe Surface 3 will appeal to those looking for a pen and will be the perfect companion for OneNote. However, you still have to pay extra for this and it may have limited appeal if you are primarily interested in typing. What is a hands on review? \n'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.
