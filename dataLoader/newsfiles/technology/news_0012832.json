Arena Analytics, is a robust business intelligence (BI) solution , powered by GoodData that enables companies to build meaningful insights into how their product-related business processes are performing and see these results refreshed at-a-glance. \nUnlike spreadsheets, Arena Analytics can create reports that examine data and key performance indicators (KPIs) from multiple dimensions to provide deeper insights about business processes. Once created, reports and metrics are updated and are always available within Arena PLM. This eliminates the need to re-email multiple versions of spreadsheets to stakeholders every time the data changes.\nFinally, Arena Analytics is fully integrated with GoodData's leading BI and analytics delivery platform. There is no need for users to invest in additional IT resources to build an on-premise BI infrastructure. Arena provides the complete ETL (extract, transform, and load) infrastructure so customers can focus on creating the analytics that help improve their business.\nIn addition, the Fall 2015 release of Arena PLM includes Simplified Supplier Access, which provides a way to designate when suppliers are responsible for building products at the top-level assembly of a bill of materials (BOM). Once this designation is made, these suppliers will have access to the entire BOM, making the task of setting up supplier access much easier. The BOM sharing view provides complete visibility into each BOM item's sharing status and now includes the name of each supplier that is able to view each BOM item, giving users a clear picture of what each sourced supplier can or cannot see in the product BOM.\n\"Our Fall Release gives manufacturers and product designers a powerful new capability for accelerating time to market,\" said Steve Chalgren , executive vice president of product management and chief strategy officer. \"Arena Analytics gives customers easy-to-understand dashboards on critical data points like product development cycle time, product health, and component risk management. Armed with this data, Arena customers can identify and drive continuous improvements to their new product introduction processes and their overall product portfolio.\"\nAbout Arena Solutions \nPioneer of cloud-based PLM, Arena's suite of PLM and supply chain solutions enable engineering, manufacturing and their extended supply chains to speed prototyping, reduce scrap, streamline their supply chain, improve margins, and collapse time to market.
