China's bank lending retreated in August, the central bank said Friday, after a sharp rise in July when the government directed funds into the stock market.\nDomestic banks extended new loans of 809.6 billion yuan ($127.06 billion), down from a massive 1.48 trillion yuan in July, the People's Bank of China said. \nBut total social financing -- an alternative measure of credit in the real economy -- reached 1.08 trillion yuan last month, rising strongly from 718.8 billion yuan in July and slightly exceeding a consensus forecast of 1.0 trillion yuan, according to Bloomberg News. \n\"Credit growth is staying on track despite the stock market volatility,\" Larry Hu, Hong Kong-based head of China economics at Macquarie Securities, told Bloomberg. \"We're going to see a pickup in the fourth quarter (economic growth).\" \nIn August, China cut interest rates for the fifth time since November and reduced the reserve requirement ratio -- the amount of money banks must hold in reserve -- for the fourth time. \nBut Chinese growth has slowed further this year, to 7.0 percent in each of the first two quarters, after 2014 expansion hit a 24-year low of 7.3 percent. \nAnalysts believe Beijing will further ease its monetary policy to keep the economy on track. \nANZ Banking Group said in a research report after the lending data was released that a 50 basis point reduction in reserve requirements for banks was expected in the fourth quarter, in addition to ongoing open market operations, to encourage bank lending and maintain ample liquidity. \nChina on Friday loosened the means for calculating the reserve requirement ratios of banks, the state news agency Xinhua reported, effectively increasing the amount of money banks can lend. \nThe move does not amount to a formal cut in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), but will allow banks to undershoot it by as much as one percent on a daily basis as long as they meet the requirement on average. \nLoosening the RRR is also a stimulatory measure as it increases the amount of money banks can lend, which can boost economic activity. \nDecades of rapid growth in China have been spurred by huge exports and massive state spending, but Beijing says it is keen to retool to boost domestic consumption if its economy is to continue to grow sustainably. \nFears over the Communist authorities' ability to manage this transition have sent jitters through financial markets around the world, where China has until now been a bright spot on an otherwise largely gloomy horizon. \nAn announcement earlier this week by the country's finance ministry that it would accelerate major construction projects, encourage private capital to invest in key areas and cut taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises to support growth also appeared to be easing concerns, some analysts said. \nIn another positive move, media reports said that China is preparing to unveil broad reforms for state-owned companies which will see some firms shut and others introduce more diversified ownership. \nFriday's report stated that China's central bank has changed \"its reserve requirement rules, replacing the current daily assessment of bank reserves with an averaged approach\", Xinhua reported. \n\"Starting from Sept. 15, the reserves of commercial banks will be regulated on an average basis during an assessed period, but there will be a minimum daily amount of reserves, the central bank said in an online statement.\" \nIt did not specify over what period the average will be calculated. \nBy the end of each business day, the reserve ratio of commercial banks will be allowed to be less than one percent lower than the compulsory ratio set by the central bank. \nThe report quoted the People's Bank of China as saying that the reform will \"help commercial banks ensure both efficiency in their capital use and a safe liquidity level\". .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T00:35:45.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
