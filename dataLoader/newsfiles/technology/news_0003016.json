He will also get 3.1 million euros to prevent him from working for a competitor, the group said in a statement on Friday.\nThe board had made the changes following a request from Combes himself, the company said.\n\"Combes confirmed with the board that he would remain at the company's disposal until the closing of the operation with Nokia,\" Alcatel-Lucent added.\nDrugs company Sanofi faced criticism from rebel investors in May over payments to attract a new boss and the severance package for his predecessor.\nThe Alcatel-Lucent decision, taken at a board meeting on Thursday, followed recommendations from the French corporate governance oversight body and observations from France's AMF financial regulator.\nIt also comes after French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron last week described Combes' departure before the finalisation of the takeover by Nokia, set to close by the middle of next year, as \"shocking\" and \"bad corporate behaviour.\"\nCombes has taken up new jobs as chief operating officer of telecoms networks operator Altice and chairman of its French subsidiary Numericable-SFR.\nCombes had defended his package, saying he would receive a significant sum as he had agreed to maximise the variable part of his pay to reflect the risk of failure.\nHe argued that he had saved the company and created value for shareholders. Alcatel's share price has risen from less than 1 euro before he took over on April 1, 2013, to trade mostly between 3 and 4 euros this year.
