Qubit received the highest possible score in the Forrester Wave in the customer satisfaction category and received among the highest scores in the online testing market trajectory category. \nIn a market full of point solutions, Qubit is challenging the traditional siloed testing paradigm with its data-driven experience management approach. \nCentralized customer insights captured by Qubit’s Visitor Cloud can be leveraged across its personalization, optimization, and experimentation solutions. Qubit’s experience management portfolio includes: Online and Mobile App Testing, Personalization, Recommendations, Digital Analytics, Tag Management, and Voice of Customer solutions. This end-to-end suite of solutions prompted Forrester to name Qubit’s Web Analytics, Mobile Analytics, and Testing & Optimization capabilities as a ‘proprietary, best-of- breed’ among enterprise-marketing centric vendors recently in a separate report aimed at defining the emerging digital customer experience delivery platform (Market Overview: Digital Customer Experience Delivery Platforms, Forrester Research, 9th December 2014). \n“We’re delighted to be the only new entrant in this Online Testing Wave,” said Graham Cooke, founder and CEO of Qubit. “The AB and MV testing industry has been quietly ineffective for the past decade. It's the dirty little secret of testing but clients have become enlightened and are more than ready for a change. We've taken 30 Enterprise customers away from the other vendors in this Wave in the past 12 months alone. We have won many more in head-to-heads and feel the market is ripe for more disruption yet. We already deliver world class customer experiences through our platform and know that even the very best testing capability is, on its own, insufficient to meet the needs of modern consumers. Qubit uses testing merely as a validation step to personalization and deeper customer experience.” \nQubit’s own research and methodology has shown that testing UI changes in 99% of cases has a less than 1% impact on conversion rate. The average online change increases conversion rate by less than 0.2%. \nIn contrast, built on its Visitor Cloud, Qubit’s personalization and content delivery is validated through smart segmentation and then AB or MV tested before being pushed live to the personalized segment. This uniquely targeted approach delivers an average success rate of 3X higher than that of an untargeted solution in terms of uplifts. \nQubit drove a 15.6% uplift in conversions for visitors to ‘ink & toner’ pages on the Staples Europe website through its greater understanding of visitor needs and ability to implement the right layer to direct customers to the product they wanted more easily. \n“Qubit’s tool has given us the insight to understand our customers’ needs, and respond to them, all within one single workflow,” said Melanie Kyrklund, Head of Site Optimization, Staples Europe. “This means that we are creating greater experiences for our customers, and building better relationships for the future.” \nQubit, which has a 95% client renewal rate, received the highest possible score in the Forrester Wave for customer satisfaction and showed the highest trajectory with its online testing solution that drives significantly more ROI than competing solutions for its hundreds of customers including Lenovo, Staples, Legal & General and TopShop. \nBut testing remains just one element of Qubit, the world’s most advanced customer data platform, which leverages the power of real-time customer insights to deliver powerful digital experiences and proven value to top brands around the world. “The holy grail for marketers is a customer experience delivery that drives revenues in the short term and loyalty in the long term,” says Cooke. “This can only be achieved with an integrated platform of all the solutions.” \nAbout Qubit \nQubit introduced the industry’s first data-driven customer experience platform.
