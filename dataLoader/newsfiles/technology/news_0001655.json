The store's location at 53rd Street is just five short blocks from Apple's flagship retail outlet, the famous glass cube, located on Fifth Avenue and 58th Street.\nAs with Apple's store, Microsoft's New York location will be the Windows maker's biggest and boldest store to date. The outlet will consist of five floors and run 22,269 square feet, leaving ample shelf space for the company to showcase the latest in Xbox, Windows PCs, Office and Surface devices.\nAs with other Microsoft Stores around the country the Fifth Avenue location will feature an \"AnswerDesk,\" Microsoft's answer to Apple's Genius Bar. Similar to the Genius Bar, the Answer Desk will be a place for customers seeking help with technical questions, troubleshooting and repairs regardless of the device or where it was purchased. The store will also house a \"CommunityTheater\" and immersive video walls throughout to show off the latest Microsoft products in action.\nIn addition to the New York store, the tech giant also announced plans to launch a new 6,000 square foot flagship location in Sydney, Australia on November 12. The company has launched over 100 retail stores around the world since its first location opened in Scottsdale, Arizona in October 2009.\nWhile the number is a far cry from Apple's current roster of over 400 locations, Microsoft is hoping to experience similar successes with its budding chain. According to data released from retail tracker eMarketer earlier this year, Apple was the most profitable retail outlet in the US in sales per square foot, raking in $5,009.\nThe announcement of the new flagship stores starts off a busy few days for Microsoft. On Oct. 6 the company is holding an event in New York where it is rumored to be unveiling new updates to Xbox, Surface, its Band wearable and Windows Mobile phones.\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n9 CONNECT 33 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1KKWvEN TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791762176344432-Rendering-of-Microsoft-on-Fifth-Ave.-in-New-York-City.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5b3cd9256a3484ff8674798dea4b57a748398d76/r=500x357/local/-/media/2015/09/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791762176344432-Rendering-of-Microsoft-on-Fifth-Ave.-in-New-York-City.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KKWvEN&text=Microsoft%20announces%20opening%20date%20for%20new%20flagship%20Fifth%20Avenue%20store&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7ec5978412a82bc3b360b26a0bae140e6a282a57/c=113-0-4388-3214&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791762176344432-Rendering-of-Microsoft-on-Fifth-Ave.-in-New-York-City.jpg", "http://twitter.com/eliblumenthal", "http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Apple-Still-Sells-Most-per-Square-Foot/1012523", "http://usat.ly/1KKWvEN", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KKWvEN&mini=true"], "published": "2015-09-30T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:55:37.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
