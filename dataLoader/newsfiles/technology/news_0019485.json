We design with women in mind, even though men love us too. I believe the solution to the world’s problems with money has to start with helping women first,” Mr Lord said.\nMr Lord teamed up with co-founder and CEO Jemma Enright, who said, “There is a huge opportunity to breakdown old, stuffy models of pedalling financial products and get real about how you truly improve the lives of people, by empowering them with the insight needed to make smarter money choices.\n“We coined the phrase, the Money Maslow, to reflect our philosophy on financial wellbeing. If you don’t have the basic needs under control, like paying your bills and spending within your limits, you can’t have a conversation about goals and building wealth. You can’t get ahead,” she said.\nShe said MoneyBrilliant, whose service is currently free, is planning an aggressive roll out of product developments beyond the current cash management service to move customers towards longer term financial wellbeing and to help users maximise their savings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:15:35.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
