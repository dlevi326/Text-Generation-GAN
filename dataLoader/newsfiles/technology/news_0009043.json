They promise more privacy, more comfort and better outcomes. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Tuesday in Sherman and was back in court the next day for a series of emergency hearings.\nIf the new financing, being offered by its landlord, is not approved, the hospital is almost certain to close — and soon. Citing difficulties in getting supplies, the private equity investor who leads the company that manages the hospital said the hospital’s patient load is way down, to an average of 1 to 3 beds a day.\nThe landlord is Sabra Texas Holdings, LLC.\nMore than 150 people, mostly health care professionals, work at the hospital. The company said in its bankruptcy filings that if it is not allowed to keep paying those workers, it will struggle to find replacements.\nU.S. District Judge Brenda Rhoades, chief bankruptcy judge in the Eastern District of Texas, held hearings Wednesday in Sherman to discuss the hospital’s future. A proposed order treating the case as a complex bankruptcy, with more than $10 million in debts and 50 involved parties, was posted late Wednesday on the federal court’s online record system, known as PACER, but was not signed.\nForest Park’s largest secured creditor, Texas Capital Bank, has opposed parts of the hospital’s bankruptcy petition, insisting deposits should remain under the bank’s control as collateral.\nHigh-end hopes\nForest Park Medical Center Frisco was formed in 2010 amid high hopes by four founders who bet that patients who could afford it would choose high-end medical care provided at small hospitals largely owned by physicians. It opened its doors in 2012.\nTodd Furniss is president of Dallas-based private equity firm GlendonTodd Capital and is one of eight members of the hospital’s board.\nHe called the hospital board’s decision to seek Chapter 11 protection unfortunate but said its chairman has assured him that if the financing plan is approved, the hospital will emerge from its restructuring.\nIn its filings, Forest Park said it initially expected to prosper as an out-of-network hospital where patients would agree to be treated even if their insurance policies paid far smaller shares of their hospital bills than if they had gone to cheaper, in-network providers.\nBut beginning in 2013 or soon after, with revenue lagging behind expectations, the company began seeking to join insurance companies’ networks in order to broaden the base of its potential customers. In filings, the company said that change in strategy failed to produce enough lower-margin customers to make up for the smaller amounts they were allowed to bill.\nThe Affordable Care Act of 2010 included disincentives for doctor-owned hospitals to thrive, based on arguments that such hospitals lead to higher overall health care costs. The American Hospital Association has opposed them because they say doctors have a built-in conflict of interest when they are both hospital owners and physicians.\nConsolidation blamed\nBut Furniss said the real obstacle for hospitals like Forest Park has been the consolidation rampant among both North Texas hospitals — where he said the four largest control more than 95 percent of the market — and among national insurance companies.\nSmall hospitals like Forest Park have been left in a precarious bargaining position, he said.\nEighty-six physicians own 68.7 percent of the Frisco hospital. But Furniss and partners control a management firm that runs the hospital for a 3 percent share of its revenues.\nA second firm controlled by Furniss and his partners is an investment vehicle that owns 13 percent of the hospital itself.\nForest Park Medical Center Frisco is one of seven independently structured partnerships formed to launch doctor-owned hospitals in Dallas, Austin, Plano, Southlake, San Antonio and Kansas City, though the last has not yet opened.\nThose seven companies were launched by four founders, identified in the bankruptcy filings as Dr. Wade Barker, Dr. Richard Toussaint, Mac Burt and Alan Beauchamp. Some of those founders, including Toussaint, are no longer involved.\nThe hospital offers amenities rarely found in larger, more traditional hospitals.\n“The Frisco hospital,” according to a description filed with the federal court, “pays close attention to details necessary to a luxury medical care facility, such as a lobby water feature, soothing scents in the HVAC system, meals cooked to order by an on-site chef, green views from every room, calming colors and low lighting to increase relaxation, and softened textures.”\nFollow Michael A.
