As a development center, the program will contribute to future releases of ESRI's products. \n\"Our GIS program really covers all the bases,\" said Dr. Denis Dean, dean of EPPS. \"We've got one of the founding fathers of the discipline on our faculty in the person of Dr. Brian Berry. We've got some of today's best regarded thinkers and researchers in the field with people like Dr. Dan Griffith and Dr. May Yuan. And we have great up-and-coming future stars with people like Dr. Yongwan Chun. \n\"Under the leadership of Dr. Fang Qiu, the program has really started to take off -- it's still a small program, but it's been growing rapidly over the last couple of years,\" Dean said. \"With the great students, faculty and support staff we have in place, I think the future of this program is incredibly bright.\" \nOther recent honors include: \nYuan, Ashbel Smith Professor of Geospatial Information Sciences, recently was invited to serve as a member of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Science Advisory Board Environmental Information Services Working Group. \nGriffith, Ashbel Smith Professor of Geospatial Information Sciences, was named a 2015 Fellow of the American Statistical Association for his contributions to the theory and practice of spatial statistical analysis. \nQiu, professor and head of the program, won an award for the Best Scientific Paper in Remote Sensing from the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing. \nUT Dallas students and recent graduates, including Yuhong Zhou, Parmanand Sinha, Vini Indriasari, Caiyun Zhang, Harini Sridharan and Caiyun Zhang, have won awards for their research from the Association of American Geographers, the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, and ESRI. ### \nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T01:07:47.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
