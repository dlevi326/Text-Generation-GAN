By joining forces, we make growing community easier, we streamline and simplify processes and we offer unrivaled resources to projects and developers alike.”\n“The Dojo Foundation project leads and I are all very excited to be joining up with the jQuery Foundation,” said the Dojo Foundation President Dylan Schiemann, who will join the jQuery Foundation board with the merger. “We share a common mission, purpose and approach, and our combined ability to serve the needs of the JavaScript development community is going to take the Open Web to new heights.”\nTimmy Willison, jQuery Core Project Lead, agreed, adding, “I'm a big fan of Dojo projects and the Dojo Foundation. I am excited and honored to work alongside such capable, talented developers and I look forward to discovering what we can achieve together.”\n“Some of the most innovative developer ideas are coming out of the JavaScript community and our clients see a great deal of value from it,\" said Todd Moore, Vice President IBM Open Technology. “We are excited to see the jQuery Foundation and the Dojo Foundation joining forces in an open collaborative developer oriented environment.”\nSaid James Burke, Project Lead for RequireJS, “I have contributed to projects that have been under both Foundations, and I appreciate how both make it easy for people to start contributing in a welcoming environment by keeping the legal and mechanical processes as low-friction as possible. Both Foundations are also committed to creating maximally-useful code through very permissive Open Source means. By combining their efforts, I believe it will be easier for new projects to choose this successful approach.”\nJohn-David Dalton, Lo-Dash project lead, added, “Combining the resources of the Dojo and jQuery Foundations is a win for developers. Among the many advantages this merger will bring, consolidating CLAs and streamlining processes will make it much easier for projects to grow and better serve the application developer community.”\nWith this merger, the jQuery Foundation continues to move toward its mission to make the web accessible to everyone. By adding the projects of the Dojo Foundation to the family of projects it supports, the Foundation is able to reach a larger community of developers in its efforts to increase diversity and accessibility in its projects and the open web as a whole. This is just the first major step in the jQuery Foundation’s plans to further serve developers.\n# # #\nAbout jQuery Foundation\nCreated in 2012, the jQuery Foundation is a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the needs of web developers.
