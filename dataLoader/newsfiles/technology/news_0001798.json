September 28, 2015 Comments are off for this post. \nAn app that sends users an alert every time a US drone strike is reported in the news is too crude for Apple. \nThe company has pulled the plug on Metadata+ , an app from journalist Josh Begley that simply notifies people of publicly-available drone strike data. \nBegley also runs the @Dronestream Twitter account, which pretty much does the same thing as his app. It was there he reported Apple’s decision to pull the app: \n— Dronestream (@dronestream) September 27, 2015 \nApple’s incomprehensible disdain for this app actually goes back to 2012 . Begley had problems getting Apple to approve his app, called Drones+ at the time. \n“If the content is found to be objectionable, and it’s literally just an aggregation of news, I don’t know how to change that,” Begley said at the time. \nMaybe a name change? That’s exactly what he did and last year, the Metadata+ app launched. It lasted for a while, before Apple yanked it on Sunday. \nIt’s still available in the Google Play store . \nApple’s always been rather puritanical with its app approval process – but that mostly has to do with the company’s inability to understand that adults might want to use apps with adult content. \nBut as Gawker points out , Apple has plenty of “crude” apps sitting in its App Store. \nAnd a simple app that reports the news isn’t really one of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T09:35:37.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
