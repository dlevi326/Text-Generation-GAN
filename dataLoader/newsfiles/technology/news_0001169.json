(I was at local restaurant till 4am the next morning!), and 2007? (I was at the final!) and when Japan won Boks (I was at the game..). Yes it was such a big event on Bok timeline.\nWe won in 95 as Kitch had Jake White as technical assistant, in 07 as Jake White relied on input from Eddie Jones and we lost in 15 as we have the likes of Ricardo Loubsher as assistant.\nMeyer ignored the technical skills of a Jake White, Rassie Erasmus or Brendan Venter who could have made a massive difference and all would have jumped at the opportunity due to their passion for SA. Heineke prefer the route of surrounding himself with yes\" men\" and players who won Super 15 5 years ago (a lifetime in Rugby) with this \"staan terug manne ek sal dit sort\" arrogance.\nWe lost Bok momentum in June 2014 when we won Wales with penalty try after full time siren. I have said this many times to many people. Watching this game in 2014 and the attitude of snr players in rugby witnessed during holiday in SA I predicted an implosion. And boy this implosion became to a spectacular fruition against Japan of all teams who will struggle to compete against a good Currie Cup side like Lions.\nWhy? Senior players are more interested in coffee shops in Umhlanga than training, forced Jake White to quit the Sharks when he had the audacity to request them to arrive at work at 8.30 as professional rugby players. They play 10 minutes of rugby before selection and walk in the team - \"Hey I was great one game five years ago now I demand a free ride!\"\n Now this culture found it way to the Springbok team - just look at the anthems being sung at Japan match. Most Boks looked annoyed being there and would rather we in bed watching movies that facing this nonsense of playing a team like Japan - hardly worth getting out of bed.\nWhat do we need to do?\n1. Jean De Villiers played his last game ever for Boks on Saturday.\n (O how history repeats itself..an Injured Bobby Skinstad is better than a fit Teichman (WC 99)...John Smit is a best in position (WC 07) We just refuse to learn from previous mistakes.\n 2. Ditto Ruan Pienaar. Can anyone recall a match where you can say \"We won because Ruan did something spectacular?\" Neither can I..\n 3. Play Alberts, Vermeulen or whoever. Its been 5 weeks since selection and I don't care about injury. Get injured against Samoa? GO HOME and send the likes of Hougaard, Whateley, etc. Guys who want to be there.\n 4. Heyneke resign. He is out of his depth and drowning.\nWhy did we lose? Apart from lack of respect for the Bok jersey or opposition, average age of 102.5...Eddy Jones. He is all too familiar with our one dimensional game plan. Ruan shovel ball to same side crash ball one = Beast, crash ball two = Schalk, Crash ball three = Peter Steph, run out of space, do the same again. No variation allowed! Kirschner do the same thing every time (kick up and under exactly 20.5meters from where you catch it, chase and hope for the best).\nMeyer thank you for vintage rugby by going back to seventies style of play. Stop meet and greets and shaking hands with supporters. Take note from teams like All Blacks, England and Ireland. They play Rugby NOW and will sign autographs in FIVE WEEKS, not the other way around!\nCan we turn it around? We showed flashes of brilliance against All Blacks in 15 and 14, but ultimately run out of oomph in final quarter - thanks MNet for awarding Boks penalty to save us from another defeat!\nUltimately there is a superior commitment from All Blacks to their jersey, they train harder (not seen that often on the beaches or in coffee shops) and they have pride in what they believe in..Why should we expect anything less from Boks?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T20:03:34.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
