It was done in partnership with Agency 2.0, the premier crowd sourcing marketing firm, based in Hollywood, CA. Princeton Audio is a High Fidelity, Design and Manufacturing company headquartered in Princeton, Wisconsin. “This has been a culmination of a lot of hard work over the past 14 months” said Mike Pelland, CEO and Founder, “we have put in countless hours in all aspects of this product to make it special. We engineered this from the inside out, knowing full well we wanted to make a product line that was made from sustainable materials and crafted in the vein of the best musical instruments in the world.”\nPrinceton Audio’s Site:1 is a handcrafted, portable speaker made from hand selected tone woods and with the patent pending, upgradeable, external interface - engineered to never be technologically obsolete. Its unique triangle design, outside of being award winning, has proven to be one of the best shapes in speaker design.\nPrinceton Audio was founded by Pelland on June 16th, 2014 with a mission to bring economic development to rural Wisconsin and spin up a Hi-Fi Brand back in the state. “For too long we have been losing jobs to overseas manufacturing and we wanted to bring jobs, people and excitement, back to the area” Pelland continues, “we felt this was the vehicle to do this, building products where human hands actually makes things again. We call it craft audio.”\nPelland was approached by Andrew Erlick, the Director of Hardware, Design & Technology from Indiegogo, after Princeton Audio won an award at an International Design competition (IDA) in April of 2015 and convinced him to run a campaign on their portal .\nPelland continues, “The Agency 2.0 folks are straight up rock stars when it comes to this and we are super excited to work with them on this and future product releases. We have gone through a rigorous process with all involved and it culminated in the launch of our campaign on September 8th. We are super excited to get these products into people’s lives and see if they love them as much as all of us do. The 8th was an end to a long journey, but in reality, it is only the beginning.”\nA 30 day crowdfunding campaign to fund $50,000 US dollars for the production of Princeton Audio’s Site:1 has been launched on Indiegogo on September 8, 2015 with an early bird deal of $249 (including free shipping within the US), originally retailing at $399.99 + shipping.\nFor more information, please visit the Indiegogo campaign .\nYou can also follow Princeton Audio on Facebook .", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL1ByaW5jZXRvbkF1ZGlv", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWVnb2dvLmNvbS9wcm9qZWN0cy9zaXRlLTEtdGhlLXdpcmVsZXNzLWJsdWV0b290aC1oYW5kbWFkZS1zcGVha2VyL3gvMjk3ODgyOSMvc3Rvcnk="], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T20:37:07.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
