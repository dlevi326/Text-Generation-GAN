Notably, the device was launched in Japan back in May this year , and the international variant is identical in terms of specifications. The Taiwanese company also launched the HTC One M9+ Supreme Camera , which is almost identical to the One M9+ smartphone but with a few upgrades in the rear camera setup. \nThe HTC Butterfly 3 runs Android 5.0 Lollipop, sports a 5.2-inch QHD (1440x2560 pixels) IPS LCD3 display, and is a water and dust resistant device with IPX5/ IPX7 and IP5X certification. It runs on 64-bit octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 MSM8994 (quad-core 2GHz + quad-core 1.5GHz) SoC coupled with 3GB of RAM and Adreno 430 GPU. The smartphone comes with 32GB built-in storage and supports expandable storage via microSD card (up to 2TB). \nThe handset sports a 20.2-megapixel rear camera with dual-LED flash, while it also houses a 13-megapixel front-facing camera. Notably, the Butterfly 3 also sports a dual rear camera setup. \nIt supports 4G LTE connectivity apart from Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS/ A-GPS, GPRS/ EDGE and 3G connectivity options. The HTC J Butterfly (HTV31) or the Butterfly 3 comes with a 2700mAh battery, which is same as the one found on HTC J Butterfly launched last year. The Taiwanese company notes that the smartphone also features Qualcomm Quick Charging 2.0 tech. The smartphone would be launching in Taiwan on October 20 with a price tag of TWD 19,900. The global availability and price details are yet to be known. \nMoving on to the HTC One M9+ Supreme Camera, the smartphone shares all the same specifications with that of HTC One M9+ except the new laser autofocus system and better rear camera. The new variant now features a 21-megapixel autofocus rear camera with OIS and an f/2.2 aperture. It still boasts a dual-lens design but now the secondary rear camera on top acts as the laser autofocus system. The front-facing UltraPixel camera remains unchanged. For reference, the One M9+ includes a 20-megapixel shooter (f/2.2) rear camera with the secondary camera acting as the depth-sensor. \nThe handset features the same 5.2-inch Quad-HD (1440x2560 pixels) display and is powered by 2.2GHz octa-core MediaTek MT6795T Helio X10 processor coupled with 3GB of RAM. The inbuilt storage on the device is 32GB, which is further expandable by a microSD card (up to 128GB). It is also backed by a similar 2840mAh non-removable battery. The smartphone would be available in Gunmetal Grey and Silver Gold colour variants. The availability and price details are yet to be confirmed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:06:02.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
