PowerData is a robust benchmarking service that reports your website analytics and compares the results against industry results based on a dataset of over 1400 optometric practices in North America. PowerData compares a practice’s website performance data to other practices based on size, State, number of ODs, location, time in practice, annual revenue and EHR used. \nMeasuring, tracking and understanding the performance of your website is the foundation for making improvements and generating more appointments and more revenue for your practice. EyeCarePro makes all of this information readily available to PowerData participants on a monthly basis. “Your website is the salesperson for your practice online,” stated Michael Porat, COO of EyeCarePro. “Like any salesperson, you want to see how he is performing his job and PowerData can provide this insight about your website.” \nAccording to EyeCarePro CEO, Daniel Rostenne, “We are in the unique position to offer this valuable service because of the vast number of practices we serve. This type of data can have a positive influence on the industry as a whole, helping optometrists to improve the way patients find their services online. There is no other company out there that can provide this type of data and we are thrilled to be able to offer it to any practice, client or not, for free.” \nThe monthly report includes an easy-to-read and understand version of the practice website Google analytics, along with the PowerData score which measures how your website results compare against similar practices. Additionally, it provides the number of new and existing patient appointments made through your practice website, which is a clear indicator of the effectiveness of the website at bringing in new business.
