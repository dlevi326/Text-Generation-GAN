Credit: NOAA/National Severe Storms Laboratory \nResearch using NASA satellite measurements has given scientists a better understanding of what happens to rain and snow that falls on land—how much runs off into rivers, lakes and aquifers; how much plants use; and how much simply evaporates. Among the new findings: plants around the world use less water than previous studies had indicated, and most freshwater passes more rapidly through soil than previously thought, with less exposure to the nutrients and contaminants contained there. \nUnderstanding how precipitation, plants , soil, groundwater and other fresh water interact is important for improving large-scale climate models and regional and local hydrology models. \nWater that has taken different pathways through the water cycle—water released by plants during photosynthesis versus water evaporated from a lake, for example—contains different ratios of hydrogen and the hydrogen isotope deuterium. Researchers from the University of Utah, Salt Lake City; and Oregon State University, Corvallis, analyzed the two forms of hydrogen in atmospheric water vapor as measured from space by the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) on NASA's Aura satellite, and also in global water samples. The researchers accounted for each different isotopic signature in a computer simulation, producing a narrow range of estimates of the amount of water released to the atmosphere by each pathway. \nMore than a quarter of the rain and snow that falls on continents runs off directly, ending up in the ocean. Of the water that does not run off, two-thirds is eventually released by plants during photosynthesis. The last third evaporates—mostly from plant leaves, with a few percent evaporating from bare ground or water. \n\"Some previous estimates suggested that more water was used by plants than we find here,\" said University of Utah hydrologist Stephen Good, first author of a paper on the research recently published in Science . Good said that means \"either plants are less productive globally than we thought, or plants are more efficient at using water than we assumed.\" \nGood noted, \"In a variety of models—from large-scale climate models to regional and local hydrology models—we try to simulate all these pathways, but we currently have difficulty measuring them individually. Our study presents a new approach for measuring the importance of these pathways and provides a new, improved estimate at the global scale.\" \nMore information: For more information on the study, see unews.utah.edu/news_releases/water-cycle/ \nTo learn more about TES, see tes.jpl.nasa.gov/ SMAP will track a tiny cog that keeps cycles spinning January 27, 2015 \nWhen you open the back of a fine watch, you see layer upon layer of spinning wheels linked by interlocking cogs, screws and wires.

Perennial biofuel crops' water consumption similar to corn July 6, 2015 \nConverting large tracts of the Midwest's marginal farming land to perennial biofuel crops carries with it some key unknowns, including how it could affect the balance of water between rainfall, evaporation and movement of ... NASA balances water budget with new estimates of liquid assets July 8, 2015 \nMany pressing questions about Earth's climate revolve around water. With droughts and flooding an ongoing concern, people want to know how much water is on the move and where it is going. To help answer those questions, a ... Where does water go when it doesn't flow? July 9, 2015 \nMore than a quarter of the rain and snow that falls on continents reaches the oceans as runoff. Now a new study helps show where the rest goes: two-thirds of the remaining water is released by plants, more than a quarter ... New research will boost grasp of North American carbon cycle July 29, 2015 \nFor centuries, people have transformed and splintered landscapes and ecosystems in North America. This radical altering of nature makes it tough for scientists to analyze the continent's life-sustaining carbon cycle—the ... Testing of soil water compartmentalizing indicates it is widespread among many biomes September 3, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—A trio of researchers with the University's of Saskatchewan and Calgary, both in Canada has found evidence that backs up a theory that has suggested that soil water is compartmentalized.
