Requirements management, software architecture, programming, testing, change management,continuous integration, project management, and release management are fundamental to lifecycle management. Modern software development processes are complex.New systems must accommodate all manner of server, cloud, and virtual computing platforms. Software frameworks are evolving that require attention to the entire application focus. Mobile devices need to be accommodated. A software framework is a platform for developing software. Applications depend on functions that can be used to input variables from a process. Input is used to manage hardware devices, and permit interaction with system software. ALM streamlines the development process permitting programmers to achieve efficiency through reuse of code when developing a new application. A framework is similar to an application programming interface (API), though a framework includes an API. A framework serves as a foundation for programming, while an API provides access to the system elements. ALM supports code libraries, a compiler, and other programs used in the software development process.WinterGreen Research is an independent research organization funded by the sale of market research studies all over the world and by the implementation of ROI models that are used to calculate the total cost of ownership of equipment, services, and software.
