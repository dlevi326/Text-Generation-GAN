The court normally follows the advocate general’s opinion; ECJ judgments are binding on EU countries.\nThe finding is a fresh victory for the Austrian campaigner Maximilian Schrems, who initially brought a claim against Facebook in Ireland in the wake of Edward Snowden’s revelations about the activities of the US National Security Agency (NSA).\nRelated: Facebook data privacy case to be heard before European Union court\nThe opinion by Bot contains far-reaching recommendations that threaten to upend many current commercial practices and assumptions in the digital industry.\nIf any EU country considers that transferring data to servers abroad undermines the protection of citizens, the advocate general’s finding said, it has the power to suspend that transfer “irrespective of the general assessment made by the [EU] commission in its decision”.\n“The access of the United States intelligence services to the data transferred covers, in a comprehensive manner, all persons using electronic communications services, without any requirement that the persons concerned represent a threat to national security,” Bot’s opinion noted in one of its most damning sections.\n“Such mass, indiscriminate surveillance is inherently disproportionate and constitutes an unwarranted interference with the rights guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the charter [of fundamental rights of the EU].”\nThe Luxembourg court found the Safe Harbor agreement between the US and Europe, which gives spies access to huge banks of data, does not stop watchdogs from investigating complaints or bar them from suspending the transfers.\nThe arrangement allows the NSA to use the Prism surveillance system exposed by Snowden to wade through billions of bits of personal data, communication and information held by nine internet companies.\nThe opinion states that the commission’s past decision on Safe Harbor within the US is invalid. It said internet users in Europe have no effective judicial protection while the large-scale data transfers are happening.\nSchrems said the ruling could have major implications for EU-US data flows and American internet companies operating in Europe.\n“After an initial review of the advocate general’s opinion of more than 40 pages it seems like years of work could pay off. Now we just have to hope that the judges of the court of justice will follow the advocate general’s opinion in principle,” he said. Schrems said that while his case was specific to Facebook it may also apply to other tech giants like Apple, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft.\nThe final ruling by the ECJ’s 15 judges is expected later this year.\nEveryone on the social network in the EU signs a contract with Facebook Ireland, audited by the data protection commissioner in that country. Under the US-EU data transfer all their details can be accessed by the NSA.\nRelated: NSA files decoded: Edward Snowden's surveillance revelations explained\nSchrems’s challenge to seek an investigation into which of his data was sent to the US will come back to the high court in Dublin after the ECJ issues its final ruling.\nSnowden, a former NSA contractor, triggered a wave of controversy when he leaked tens of thousands of documents about surveillance programmes run by the US intelligence services and foreign counterparts, including Britain’s GCHQ, in 2013.\nCommenting on the ruling, Jan Philipp Albrecht, home affairs spokesperson for the Green party in the EU, said: “The advocate general has today made clear that the transfer of EU citizens’ private data to the US by Facebook is at odds with EU law. This welcome finding must provoke an immediate response by the relevant authorities in Europe. The Irish data protection commissioner must immediately move to prevent any further data transfers to the US by Facebook, which operates under Irish jurisdiction.\n“The finding also confirms the position of the European parliament, which has already called for Safe Harbor to be suspended. It is unacceptable that the European commission has ignored this demand for a year and a half. It is now time for the commission to finally suspend Safe Harbor.\n“We need robust, common data protection rules for the EU, which can also be applied to internet operators and the online sector from the US. To this end, we need to swiftly agree the reform of the EU’s data protection laws to ensure strong and implementable individual rights.”\nLaywers in the UK suggested that, if confirmed, the ECJ decision would force every European company that stores data on American servers to review their contracts.", "external_links": ["http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=168421&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=330213"], "published": "2015-09-23T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T15:53:28.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
