Microsoft unfortunately decided to not bring it back in Edge because they believe that extensions will cover the needs of those who want it. Reply LimboSlam September 20, 2015 at 11:18 am # \nSo, looks like the Firefox I once knew is gone!! I just had it in my head that maybe Mozilla will reconsider their unnecessary decisions, I guess not. \nWell it's a good thing the Pale Moon Team has my back. Reply not_black September 20, 2015 at 11:45 am # \nPale Moon is shit. It's not even a decent Firefox fork. It's being \"developed\" (or rather compiled) by one guy from older Firefox source code. From a security point of view, it's a disaster. Reply Yuliya September 20, 2015 at 12:00 pm # \nWhat's the problem with Firefox allowing users to block tracking services directly from optsions? o.O You make it sound like it's a bad thing. I only wish they'd allow me to add my own filter list ABP-like so I can block everything; may be in future. \nI'm not saying Pale Moon may not be a good browser, but really, such a comment towards a feature that actually helps the user indicates blind fanboyism and nothing more. It really sounds more like a bot now that I'm reading your comment again. Could fit any Firefox-related article, lol. abcdef September 20, 2015 at 1:18 pm # \nYou sound like a shill to me. Reply Brandon September 20, 2015 at 1:54 pm # \nHow is this feature a bad thing? People will crap on literally any decision Mozilla makes these days, its ridiculous. not_black September 20, 2015 at 11:49 am # \nI wonder if Firefox's Tracking Protection or EFF's Privacy Badger is a better option. Reply anon September 20, 2015 at 12:26 pm # \nMartin, since this is somewhat related, do you plan on adding HTTPS to gHacks? :) I guess you're waiting for this first: https://letsencrypt.org/ Martin Brinkmann September 20, 2015 at 12:33 pm # \nI plan to enable this soon ;) Reply Tom Hawack September 20, 2015 at 12:43 pm # \nAs far as trackers are concerned I don't understand very well how strict protection may block certain sites from functioning properly unless to consider that a given external called site provides and valid data/scripts and tracking scripts/cookies (worst scenario) in which case a granular approach only provided by add-ons such as uBlock Origin, uMatrix or Policeman can do the job correctly. Otherwise it'll be correct display & tracking verses no tracking & bad rendering. Nevertheless a good start. As a user of a 80,000+ address HOSTS file together with PeerBlock managing 26,000,000+ IPs, both including trackers' data I very, very seldom meet a site which would display incorrectly because of one of those two. It gets more complex with greater granular protection and that's where an add-on such as uBlock Origin makes the difference. \nI'm not surprised by the gain in page display speed (44%?!), mainly on certain sites which can make up to (and more?) 30 calls to external sites (when sometimes the site runs perfectly well all by itself!) : those Websites are not giving a damn about the user. Total lack of respect. \nSo, Firefox's trend/move to blocking at the source this exponential hysteria aiming to condition a site to more, and more, and more ads, trackers and all the scum a non protected Web user encounters is a good, a very good thing, even if, as it is planned at this time, far, very far from insuring the best privacy shield possible. Reply Tom Hawack September 20, 2015 at 1:09 pm # \nI forgot to mention that I do NOT use uBlock's 3rd-party unbreak list, with no issue up to now, on the ground that I do not and will not make a privacy/security exception for a site on the ground that I'd have no choice : if I'm driven to choose I avoid the site never my privacy. Fortunately granular settings provided by (my!) uBlock Origin make it possible in almost all scenarios to combine no exception and total site's functionality. Reply anon September 20, 2015 at 1:12 pm # \nIf you want a current in-use implementation of Firefox's Tracking Protection, then take a look at Internet Explorer 9/10/11.
