Previous attempts were made for gold and copper. While gold is quite stretchy, it has significant cost restrictions, and copper broke on only 30% stretching. Then, the Washington State University researchers decided to look at indium, a soft and malleable metal already used in electronics with surprising results. When banded to a layer of plastic, Indium easily stretches to twice its length. Further stretching was stopped due to the plastic layer breaking. Flexible electronic technology could pave the way for bendable batteries, flexible displays, connected fabrics, and robotic skins. The limitations of metallurgy have until now restricted the creation of scientists. Manufacturers developed tiny metal springs for flexibility instead, but the springs are don’t work as desired as they are bulky and require more power and bigger batteries to conduct electricity. “The circuitry ends up requiring a ton of real estate and bulky batteries,” said a lead. One of the lead scientists note “this is a quantum improvement in stretchable electronics and wearable devices.” The team plans to study the properties of the metal in greater detail with the goal of commercializing the process for its use in the production of flexible electronics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T15:26:11.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
