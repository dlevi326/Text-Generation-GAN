Under consideration are rules that could put requirements on student-loan servicers to help lower some borrowers' monthly payments and change the way they process payments to lessen the chance of default, according to people familiar with the matter. They could also address debt-collection tactics when borrowers fall behind on payments. The CFPB says it has also made it a priority to take enforcement actions against companies engaged in illegal servicing practices.\nThe CFPB, along with the U.S. Education Department and Treasury Department, on Tuesday said they are working together to strengthen servicing protections for student-loan borrowers.\n\"We feel there are various practices in [this] industry that are subpar, very much like mortgage servicing practices have been very subpar,\" said CFPB director Richard Cordray while testifying in front of the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday. \"We are looking at trying to figure out how to clean that up.\"\nAny new rules would likely have an impact on borrowers of all ages, including parents and other adults who have cosigned for students' loans. It could also represent the strongest move yet by the four-year-old CFPB to try to arrest the increasing prevalence of default among student loans.\nWith servicing, the CFPB doesn't have oversight over federal student lending, which is handled by the Education Department and accounts for 93% of outstanding student debt, according to MeasureOne, a San Francisco-based firm that tracks student loans. Instead, the bureau's oversight is in student servicing, an industry comprised of fewer than 10 major firms including banks, which handle payments on both federal and private student loans.\nThe bureau also oversees private student loan originations.\nLoan defaults among students can have a domino effect on other parts of the economy because they result in lower credit scores for student borrowers as well as cosigners, limiting their access to mortgages and other financing.\nThe CFPB also released a 152-page report on student loans Tuesday outlining problems it has uncovered in recent months, citing poor customer service and routine transfers of student loan servicing rights from one company to another as causing setbacks for borrowers.\nAmong the biggest issues being raised by the CFPB is that some servicers aren't providing struggling borrowers with adequate information about affordable repayment options--in particular income-driven repayment plans--and those borrowers can end up in default as a result.\nThese plans lower borrowers' monthly payments to 10% to 15% of their discretionary income. A report last month by the Government Accountability Office raised concerns that millions of borrowers might be in the dark about these plans.\nAny new rules could be a year or more away, with the report serving as the first step in a long process.\nAs part of its efforts, CFPB is considering steps that would put a halt to practices that have been compared with the robo-signing problems that led to banks being fined billions of dollars during the foreclosure crisis five years ago.\nThe bureau's report also raises concerns about issues with private student loan servicing, in particular the difficulty cosigners have when they try to get out of a loan years after student borrowers are making payments. Most private student loans have cosigners.\nThe bureau's first public enforcement action against a student loan servicer, Discover Financial Services Inc., occurred in July. The company, which didn't admit or deny wrongdoing, was accused of engaging illegal debt-collection tactics and denying borrowers information about how they could receive federal income-tax benefits.\nLast month, Citigroup Inc., which exited student loan lending by 2012, said it was involved in a regulatory investigation concerning student loan servicing. The bank declined to comment further.\nNavient Corp., the largest U.S. student loan servicer, which spun off from SLM Corp., or Sallie Mae last year, has been under CFPB investigation since last year and is also being investigated by a number of state attorney generals, including Illinois and Washington, and in a probe by the New York Department of Financial Services. The company declined to comment, but in a recent regulatory filing said that it \"continues to believe that its acts and practices relating to student loans are lawful and meet industry standards,\" adding it \"is committed to resolving any potential concerns.\"\nWrite to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nSeptember 29, 2015 15:44 ET (19:44 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:16:52.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
