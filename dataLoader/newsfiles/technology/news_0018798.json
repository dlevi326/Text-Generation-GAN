Picture: SOWETAN Related articles Will top court make good call on ‘bad faith’? Constitutional Court to hear ‘Please Call Me’ case Court cuts off inventor of Please Call Me In this article JSE-listed companies: Vodacom Companies and organisations: Constitutional Court VOD View company tearsheet THE battle between Vodacom and former employee Nkosana Makate over the \"Please Call Me\" concept will be heard by the Constitutional Court on Tuesday.\nThe highest court is Mr Makate’s last hope in his seven-year court fight with the cellphone giant to be rewarded for coming up with the successful concept.\n\"Please Call Me\" is a money-spinner for cellphone networks and allows users to send a free SMS requesting a call back.\nMr Makate’s financial backers have said Vodacom may have benefited to the tune of R45bn from the concept.\nLast year the High Court in Johannesburg decided Mr Makate’s idea led to the \"Please Call Me\" service, and that he and former Vodacom director and product development head Philip Geissler had entered into an oral agreement that Mr Makate would be paid if the idea was feasible.\nMr Makate still lost his case because the court said that, in order for Vodacom to be liable, it must have authorised Mr Geissler to contract on its behalf.\nMr Makate had not made a sufficient case of \"ostensible authority\" — he had not shown that Vodacom acted in such a way that he was entitled to rely on the agreement with Mr Geissler.\nThe court also found the claim, made seven years after the agreement, was too late.\nMr Makate’s counsel, led by Cedric Puckrin SC, said the High Court was wrong on the law of ostensible authority. But if the Constitutional Court agreed with the lower court on the law as it stood, it needed to be \"developed\" to bring it in line with the values in the Constitution, Mr Puckrin said.\nCourts should factor in whether one party was \"at a significant disadvantage in relation to the bargaining power\" between parties.\nAt the time, Mr Makate was a junior employee negotiating with his employer, \"a large company\".\nCourts also needed to consider whether there was bad faith on the part of the other party, he said.\nMr Puckrin said Vodacom had accused Mr Makate of having stolen the idea, \"later admitting this was false\". Then former CE Alan Knott-Craig claimed the idea as his in his autobiography, adding \"impudence to dishonesty\".\nBut Vodacom’s counsel, led by Fanie Cilliers SC, said the argument on ostensible authority was raised for the first time at the highest court. It was \"a belated attempt\" by Mr Makate to \"constitutionalise his case\". He said it was undesirable for the final court to hear arguments that had not been made in the lower courts, and he disputed that Vodacom benefited \"handsomely\" from the idea.", "external_links": ["http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=VOD"], "published": "2015-09-01T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T08:38:50.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
