In rand terms, revenue was 3% higher.\nMaster Drilling, which operates in SA, Africa and Latin America, said currency fluctuations combined with its fleet mix and utilisation had pulled revenue down, but this had been offset by cost savings and operating efficiency to drive the profit line. Cash holdings grew to $13.6m from $12.5m at the end of December.\nOutside its ‘rest of the world’ revenue base, which fell 81% to $222,000 in the period, the next largest fall was in SA where the mining sector has come under pressure.\nRevenue from SA fell 25% to $17.4m.\nRevenue from Africa shot up 56% to $13.7m, while Latin America’s revenue fell 9% to $29m.\nGross profit growth came from Africa, which grew by 26% to $6.8m, while SA’s gross profit inched up 2% to $6.98m.
