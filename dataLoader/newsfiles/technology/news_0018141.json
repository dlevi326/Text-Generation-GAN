The STRIVE Awards recognize the vital role patient advocacy groups play in giving a voice to individuals affected by DMD, with the ultimate goal of facilitating unique, inventive ideas, methods or programs supporting patients and families within the DMD community. Award entries were received from 27 organizations from across 19 countries.\nThis awards program was established to support initiatives that will benefit the DMD community by increasing awareness, diagnosis and education, and fostering the development of future patient advocates. An independent panel of external experts with knowledge in rare diseases, patient advocacy and funding initiatives judged entries for feasibility, creativity, budget, impact and sustainability. Five one-year awards of $30,000 are being presented to each of the recipients.\n\"We have a tremendous amount of respect for the important services and programs provided by these organizations for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy community,\" said Mary Frances Harmon , Global Head of Patient Advocacy, PTC Therapeutics, Inc. \"PTC Therapeutics shares the same commitment as each of these organizations with patients at the center of everything we do. We are delighted to have received such a positive response and really look forward to seeing these initiatives make a real impact on the lives of people living with this devastating condition.\"\nAbout Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)\nPrimarily affecting males, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle disorder caused by the lack of functional dystrophin protein. Dystrophin is critical to the structural stability of skeletal, diaphragm, and heart muscles. Patients with DMD, the more severe form of the disorder, lose the ability to walk as early as age 10 and experience life-threatening lung and heart complications in their late teens and twenties. More information about DMD is available through the Muscular Dystrophy Association ( www.mdausa.org ), Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy ( www.parentprojectmd.org ), Action Duchenne ( www.actionduchenne.org ), United Parent Projects Muscular Dystrophy ( uppmd.org ), Muscular Dystrophy Campaign ( www.muscular-dystrophy.org ) and AFM (l'Association francaise contre les myopathies), ( www.afm-telethon.fr ).\nAbout PTC Therapeutics\nPTC is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of orally administered, proprietary small molecule drugs targeting an area of RNA biology we refer to as post-transcriptional control.
