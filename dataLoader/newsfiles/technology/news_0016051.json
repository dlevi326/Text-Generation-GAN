Professor Hall said that shared laughter can signal compatibility for some couples\nAfter studying students in a blind date-style test, researchers found that the men and women who laughed at the same time were most likely to be romantically interested in each other.\n“Part of what it means to be social is the ability to joke along with people,” Professor Hall said.\n“Men are trying to get women to show their cards. For some men it is a conscious strategy.”\nProfessor Hall ran a series of experiments to examine the role of humour in courtship using students as test subjects.\nIn the first study, 35 men and women explored the Facebook profile pages of 100 strangers to gauge their personalities, before their responses were compared to surveys by the profile holders.\nProfessor Hall found that men and women posted similar amounts of “humorous content” online and that strangers perceived people sharing jokes to be more extroverted than intelligent. A professor at the University of Kansas conducted the research\nIn the second study, almost 300 students filled out a survey that found no connection between how intelligent people were and how funny they claimed to be.\nThe final part tested 51 pairs of single, heterosexual university students who had never met and put them in a blind date scenario.\nThey were given a selection of question cards to start a conversation, which was recorded by researchers.\nAfter being observed talking alone for 10 minutes, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire assessing their “date”.\nProfessor Hall found that although men and women made similar numbers of what he called “attempts at humour”, female students laughed more than the men.\nHe suggested that the couples may have been adhering to a “culturally informed courtship” ritual.\n“The script is powerful and it is enduring, and it dictates everything from asking someone out to picking up the tab,” the researcher said.\n“Shared laughter might be a pathway toward developing a more long-lasting relationship.” Love and sex news: in pictures\nProfessor Hall noted that laughter was not a true indicator of if someone truly finds a comment funny as “people laugh at jokes they do not fully comprehend and comprehend jokes they do not laugh at”.\nBut he argues that it still has a role sculpting first impressions by signalling personality traits or performing other functions, like expressing agreement or irony.\nIn the conclusion to the study, Professor Hall wrote that joking and laughter could also be considered as respectively dominant and submissive, where some women provide the “audience” to a man’s performance.\nThe “ambivalent sexism” in both the men and women studied may be to blame, he said, along with ideas of desirable “masculinity and femininity”.\nProfessor Hall added: “Perhaps flirting by joking around by males is particularly attractive to traditional females, and females serving as a responsive audience are most attractive to traditional males.”", "external_links": ["http://evp.sagepub.com/content/13/3/1474704915598918.full.pdf+html"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T19:14:44.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
