The study concluded that 100 ml of extracted fat (Lipoaspirate) per each unit of BMI is a safe baseline for determining how much fat should be extracted from each patient. The study noted that extracting more than 100 ml of lipoaspirate per unit of BMI led to an increased risk of complications. Los Angeles plastic surgery group Beverly Hills Physicians notes that, because liposuction is extremely safe when performed by a qualified and attentive plastic surgeon, surgeons should abide by such guidelines in order to ensure that this very safe procedure remains so.\nWhile the exact number of 100 ml per unit of BMI is a new guideline expressed by the study, Beverly Hills Physicians notes that the general idea that surgeons could safely extract more lipoaspirate from patients with higher BMIs has been known by plastic surgeons for years.\nIt’s an intuitive idea, they explain: because patients with a higher BMI also typically have more body fat that makes up a larger percentage of their body’s mass, a larger volume of lipoaspirate can be removed while still removing the same percentage of a person’s fat. Since more fat removed means a larger overall change that the body must adjust to, removing somewhat less tissue means a patient is more likely to seamlessly transition into their new size without any unexpected complications.\nBeverly Hills Physicians also notes that, although a liposuction procedure is an outstanding way to get rid of fat in problem areas, it is in no way a cure for obesity. For those who need to lose a serious amount of weight to shed their severe obesity and any weight related health problems, BHP doctors may often suggest weight loss surgery. They note that, in addition to offering a full range of cosmetic, plastic and reconstructive surgeries, they are also home to some of the Southern California’s most respected bariatric surgeons.\nPatients interested in scheduling a consultation to learn more about liposuction, weight loss surgery, or any one of the procedures performed by the surgeons at Beverly Hills Physicians can visit the medical group online at http://www.BeverlyHillsPhysicians.com or call their main office today at 800-788-1416.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/BHP/Lipo/prweb12966094.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.beverlyhillsphysicians.com/services-plastic-cosmetic/liposuction.php", "http://www.beverlyhillsphysicians.com/", "http://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Fulltext/2015/09000/Is_There_a_Safe_Lipoaspirate_Volume__A_Risk.7.aspx", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/BHP/Lipo/prweb12966094.htm"], "published": "2015-09-22T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:43:05.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
