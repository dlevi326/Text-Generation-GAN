The new camera is clearer and the images have far less noise.\nApple highlighted the abilities of the camera in the iPhone 6 with the popular “Shot on iPhone 6” campaign which used images shot by ordinary iPhone users in advertising and billboards around the world. (Disclaimer: one of my photographs featured in that campaign.) It’s not yet clear if it plans to extend the campaign with the iPhone 6S.\n“Each year I do this comparison, and each year I am impressed at how much the iPhone camera technology has improved,” Bettany says in summary to her test.\nHow does the #iPhone6s camera compare to every other iPhone generation? http://t.co/Z8aVLaZqcp pic.twitter.com/WmJKohJMHh\n— Lisa Bettany (@mostlylisa) September 28, 2015 “The iPhone has made it easier to capture and share our memories. Each new phone gives us a better tool to capture better quality images and create incredible photographs.\n“The improved sensor, software updates and new A9 processor on the iPhone 6s has made this camera the best yet. There is an apparent increase in the speed of auto focus and improvements to colour accuracy, details and sharpness, especially in low light.”\nThe proof is in the pudding.
