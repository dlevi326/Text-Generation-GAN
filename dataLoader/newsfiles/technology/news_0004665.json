The latest from the UN Foundation (CNW Group/Frankly Inc.) Real-time global chat (CNW Group/Frankly Inc.) SAN FRANCISCO , Sept. 23, 2015 /CNW/ - Leading engagement and content management platform Frankly Inc. (TSX VENTURE: TLK) (\"Frankly\") and the United Nations Foundation (\"UN Foundation\"), which connects the work of the United Nations with others around the world, announced the launch of a new United Nations Foundation mobile app for iOS today and Android devices coming soon. The app will be the centralized source of all news, shareable content, and conversations related to the Foundation's mission in order to give people around the world a platform to discover new conversations and ways to engage with the United Nations issues they are passionate about. The app is currently supporting the soon-to-be-adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals. On September 25, 2015 , world leaders will commit to 17 global goals to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and fix climate change over the next 15 years. The UN Foundation will use the app to facilitate conversations around each goal, grow awareness, encourage participation, and create new ways for supporters to get involved. Developed by Frankly, the app aims to educate audiences about the global goals and give peers and organizations the ability to connect so they can discuss them in real time with mobile messaging. Each goal will have its own chat room, and the app will also feature news, blog posts, and announcements from the UN Foundation and verified sponsors. Additionally, a donate button will allow users to contribute to directly to the UN Foundation. This development replaces the current United Nations Foundation mobile app and follows the earlier announcement of Frankly's partnership with the United Nations Foundation. \"Mobile technology helps ideas cross borders. With the United Nations Foundation app, people of different age groups, viewpoints, and nationalities can come together around a cause that unites them. When a user reaches for the app they'll find interesting people to speak with, official updates from leading organizations in the space, ways to get involved immediately, and an insider's look into the UN's events and activities,\" said Frankly founder and CEO Steve Chung . \"Download the app for an interactive way to learn about the world's most pressing issues, and see what people around the world say about them.\" \"Mobile technology and social media give billions of people a way to be better informed and more engaged on behalf of a more peaceful, healthy and prosperous planet,\" said Aaron Sherinian , Chief Communications and Marketing Officer at the UN Foundation. \"You cannot make progress on global issues unless people have access to information and actionable data. Creative platforms like these are at the heart of that effort and are giving voice and visibility to the most important issues of our time. Mobile applications have the power to connect people everywhere to the realities of children's health, peace and security, empowerment of girls and women, climate and the environment, and U.S.-UN relations. This is a great example of how technology connects us as sisters and brothers. A better world -- and a better future -- are in all our hands. \" About United Nations Foundation: The United Nations Foundation builds public-private partnerships to address the world's most pressing problems, and broadens support for the United Nations through advocacy and public outreach. Through innovative campaigns and initiatives, the Foundation connects people, ideas, and resources to help the UN solve global problems.
