Its shares closed Monday at 33 pence, valuing the business at 371 million pounds ($563 million).\nThe firm made a pre-tax profit of 6.3 million pounds in the six months to August 31, up from 4.5 million pounds, on revenue up 35 percent to 90.8 million pounds.\nBoohoo said it now has 3.5 million active customers, up 32 percent year on year after it cut prices and stepped-up promotions and marketing spend.\nThe company makes nearly two thirds of revenue in Britain, where sales rose 30 percent, having increased 27 percent in its first quarter.\n\"The autumn/winter marketing campaign #WeAreNow is supporting a good start to the second half.
