Thin Ice is the first technologically-enhanced weight-loss apparel that hacks a person’s metabolism to help them lose weight. Featured on Daily Mail and the Toronto Star, Thin Ice is a game-changer in the weight-loss industry. Simply by inserting the Thin Ice insoles or wearing the Thin Ice lightweight vest, a user can burn calories at work or home, by just wearing their clothes. Thin Ice’s technology basically tricks the body into thinking it’s in a colder environment. This creates a cascade of physiological responses in the body that kick their metabolism into overdrive, burning fat and allowing the user to get leaner.\nThe Thin Ice insole and vest target regions of the body with high concentrations of thermoreceptors. These neural receptors alert the body to the presence of cold, triggering a metabolic response that generates heat in a person’s core. As the core’s blood warms, it then must be pumped all the way to the extremities. The best part of this process is that the body does all this calorie-expensive work automatically without even having to think about it. However, before everyone can enjoy this calorie-burning apparel line, Thin Ice needs help. That’s why they launched this campaign .\nThe goal of this project was to raise $15,000 by September 11, 2015. But, Thin Ice is happy to announce, they’ve currently raised over $500,000, making 3,000 percent more than the original goal. The funds raised will continue to help develop the product, perform any required modifications, and manufacture it.\nTo help create this line of wearable, weight-loss technology, please visit the IndieGoGo campaign or click here . Backers can choose from many attractive rewards as a “thank you” for their donations.\nDon’t miss out on this great opportunity to lose weight by simply wearing clothes!\nKnow others that would love this?
