Researcher finds largest martian channels most likely formed by volcanic activity (w/ video) August 11, 2011 \n(PhysOrg.com) -- Since the Mars Viking missions of the 70s, humans have compared the topography of the Red Planets surface to their home and imagined a world that once contained flowing rivers that carved channels ... Vast systems of ancient caverns on Mars may have captured enormous floodwaters December 4, 2012 \n(Phys.org)—An international research team led by the Planetary Science Institute has found evidence that indicates that approximately 2 billion years ago enormous volumes of catastrophic flood discharges may have been captured ... Area on Mars reveals a surface modified by water over much of planet's history July 8, 2014 \nA new geologic map of part of the ancient Martian highlands produced by Scott C. Mest and David A. Crown of the Planetary Science Institute provides new insights into the planet's history of water modifying the planet's surface. Signs of extensive groundwater system on Mars May 20, 2015 \nIn its early years, planet Mars comprised large volumes of groundwater, which regularly flowed to the surface. This is the conclusion reached by Utrecht University's PhD candidate Wouter Marra following observations and scale ... Tracing the origin of ancient water flows on Mars in the lab May 22, 2015 \nBuilding our own copy of Mars in the laboratory was hard work. We had to shift 15 tonnes of sand to create a swimming-pool-sized model of the red planet. But the effort was well worth it as our experiments shed light on a ... Recommended for you Regional, not global, processes led to huge Martian floods September 11, 2015 \nGigantic groundwater outbursts created the largest flood channels in the solar system on Mars, 3.2 billion years ago. For many years it was thought that this was caused by the release of water from a global water table, but ... Sweeping over the south pole of Mars September 11, 2015 \nAn unusual observation by Mars Express shows a sweeping view over the planet's south polar ice cap and across its ancient, cratered highlands. Mysterious, massive, magnetic stars September 11, 2015 \nA Canadian PhD student has discovered a unique object – two massive stars with magnetic fields in a binary system. Matt Shultz of Queen's University, Ontario, Canada found the system – Epsilon Lupi – and will publish ... Europe launches satnav orbiters September 11, 2015 \nEurope sent two satellites into space Friday as it pushes to get its beleaguered Galileo satnav programme back on track. Underground magma ocean could explain Io's 'misplaced' volcanoes September 10, 2015 \nTides flowing in a subsurface ocean of molten rock, or magma, could explain why Jupiter's moon Io appears to have its volcanoes in the \"wrong\" place. New NASA research implies that oceans beneath the crusts of tidally stressed ... Astronomers find galaxy cluster with bursting heart September 10, 2015 \nAn international team of astronomers has discovered a gargantuan galaxy cluster with a core bursting with new stars - an incredibly rare find. The discovery, made with the help of the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, is the ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T15:11:10.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
