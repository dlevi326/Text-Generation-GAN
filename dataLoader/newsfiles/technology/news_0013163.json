Teachers can bring students to museums, other continents or even outerspace, using Google Cardboard viewers and virtual reality content accessible through mobile phones. The kit contains a tablet for the teacher, and Cardboard viewers and phones for every student. The teacher selects a destination through an app and then leads students through a virtual field trip, pointing out specific points of interest along the way.
