Since then, the terminal, declared a national historic landmark in 2005, has remained virtually vacant.\nThe joint venture plans to spend $265 million to construct the hotels and refurbish the terminal, which is connected to JetBlue's Terminal 5 via two elevated walkways. In exchange, the Port Authority will spend $8 million to build a pedestrian plaza and covered walkway from an existing AirTrain station to the new hotel. The authority will receive a percentage of the revenue the hotel complex will generate and rent, which the authority estimates will be $70 million over the life of the lease.\nA study, released last year by Global Gateway Alliance, an advocacy group, found that 16 airports in North America with the highest passenger traffic, including those in Chicago, Miami and Montreal, all have hotels on airport grounds. Today's travelers, short on time, are willing to pay higher prices for the convenience of having access to a hotel on airport grounds.\nMCR, which owns and operates 89 hotels across the country, including the High Line Hotel in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, across from the elevated High Line park, is expected to begin construction next year.\n\"Accessible to the general public, as well as all airlines from all terminals, the 505-room hotel at the rehabilitated TWA Flight Center will be a tremendous amenity for the entire JFK International Airport,\" said Tyler Morse, chief executive of MCR Development.\nThe latest LI business news in your inbox daily.
