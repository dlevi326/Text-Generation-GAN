One such scam uses the wording \"Get newly introduced Facebook dislike button on your profile [sic],\" adding that \"Dislike Button is invite only feature [sic].\"\n\nThe scam tricks the user into liking a page and sharing the link with their friends. Some of the scams are also directing users towards expensive premium rate mobile phone subscriptions, online surveys that generate the scammers income every time a user fills them out, or even downloading malicious software to their computers, security analyst Graham Cluley reports on his blog.\n\nHackread writes that it hasn't been confirmed that anyone has been infected with malware through the dislike button scam yet, but advises that users \"stay away from these malicious links because they won't be providing you with access to the dislike button.\"\n\nThe Sophos Naked Security blog advises: \"The important thing about a Facebook-provided Dislike button, of course, is that you wouldn't need to go to some random-looking third-party site to download it. So, Dislike button scams ought to be obviously bogus these days. After all, Facebook itself just reminded us that it doesn't have Dislike yet, but that if it gets one, it will be an official part of Facebook itself.\" 6 things you didn't know you could do on Facebo... of 7 Did you know you can add a pronunciation guide to your name on Facebook? Overlay colorful text on the photos you post? How about mark the end of a relationship without your 500 closest friends getting notified?\n\nMany of these tips and tricks aren't well known, even to veterans of the 1.5 billion-strong people-connector and time-waster. Facebook is constantly updating its service, adding new features or tweaking old ones. A lot can slip through the cracks even if you are scrolling through your friends' updates several times a day.\n\nHere are a few such tips and tricks. More than 83% of Facebook's users are outside of the US and Canada, and they use over 80 languages to communicate with friends and family. That's a lot of people, and a lot of different ways to say your name.\n\nTo add a pronunciation guide, go to the 'about' section of your profile and click on 'details about you', (called 'more about you' on mobile) then 'name pronunciation'.\n\nHere, Facebook will offer suggestions for your first and last name that you can listen to before selecting. If none work, you can also type in your own phonetic pronouncer. Logging in from a public computer? If you don't feel comfortable typing in your password on a shared machine that might have malicious software, Facebook lets you request a temporary one by texting 'OTP' to 32665.\n\nYou'll get an eight-character passcode that works for the next 20 minutes and cannot be reused. Anyone who's commented on a popular Facebook post, or belongs to a particularly chatty group, knows that those notifications telling you that \"Jane Doe and 4 others also commented on a post\" can get a bit annoying.\n\nYou can turn off notifications for individual posts by clicking on the globe icon on the top right corner of your web browser, then on the 'X' next to the individual notification.\n\nYou can also change your notification settings here to get fewer or more of them for each group that you belong to.\n\nTo do this on mobile, click to view the original post, then click the down arrow in the top right corner of the post. You'll see an option to \"turn off notifications.\" Announcing engagements and marriages on Facebook is fun. Post and watch the likes and congrats roll in. Bask in the love and glory. Fast-forward a few years for some couples, and the glory fades, not to mention the love and marriage.\n\nIn this case, you might not want to announce the irreversible breakdown to 450 of your closest friends.\n\nThankfully, you can still mark the end of a relationship without notifying everyone. Go to your profile and click on the 'about' section, then 'family and relationships on the left'. Under relationship, you'll see a gray icon that probably says 'friends', or maybe 'public'. Change it to 'only me'.\n\nThen change your relationship status. After a while, you can change it back if you wish. Your hundreds of acquaintances will be none the wiser, unless they are stalking your profile to see if you are single.
