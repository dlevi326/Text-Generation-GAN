The group's targets have included a number of Southeast Asian countries over the past five years, in addition to the United Nations.\nThe researchers discovered malware distributed by the group called \"greensky27.vicp.net.\" By searching for \"Greensky27,\" they were able to locate an array of social media accounts held by a PLA officer name Ge Xing. Those accounts included photos of his car, license plate, newborn child, Xing riding his bicycle, in addition to his educational history, which included graduating from the PLA International Studies University in 1998.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2570631 Through gathering details on events in his personal life over the years, researchers were able to distinguish a pattern in the attacks, noting that when Ge was out posting pictures of various trips and vacations, cyberattacks from the group dipped.\nAs \"Greensky27\" was on a forum searching for baby name suggestions, researchers noted, there was an eight-day gap in activity surrounding the group's attacks. When Ge was posting pictures of his trip to the Ge family's ancestral memorial hall, there was a similar variance in activity. (\"Returning home to pay respect to the ancestors, this ancestral memorial hall is not bad,\" his photo captions read.) When he posted pictures of a trip to the countryside, there was a four-day gap.\nThreatConnect called its discoveries \"a small shard in the tip of the Naikon iceberg.\" However, they also pointed out that other researchers could learn from their findings by noticing \"how a relatively small set of initial indicators can (with the right platform and processes) be developed into a much larger body of intelligence.\"\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2572015 The Naikon group was first identified by Kaspersky Lab in May. Its victims have included targets in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, as well as the United Nations and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T07:03:34.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
