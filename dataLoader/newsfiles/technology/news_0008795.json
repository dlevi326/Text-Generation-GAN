That size makes it suddenly attractive to move away from feeder services to being served directly by mother vessels. \n“Today, growth is restricted simply because it is excessively expensive and also because the transit times are excessive. İzmir is our first entry in Turkey but we are working to make sure it is not our last.” \nAPMT will be operating under a 28-year lease and the second phase of the terminal’s expansion aiming to boost total TEU capacity to 1.5 million. \nAPMT also recently announced its biggest ever port investment with the announcement for plans to spend $2 billion on a port in Nigeria. \nFact File: APMT has a global terminal network of 200 port and inland services operations in 58 countries around the globe. APMT designs, builds and operates port and terminal facilities, as well as providing inland cargo services for cargo transportation between port facilities and inland locations, as well as other associated cargo handling functions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:57:35.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
