Court 10 in the Durban Magistrates’ Court complex is packed to the rafters and bristling with automatic weapons carried by an eagle-eyed contingent of tactical response team officers who line the walls of the courtroom and hover around the entrance.\nThe unit, brought in to protect specialist prosecutor Khumbu Shazi, is well outnumbered by the supporters of Durban taxi boss Mfundo Gcaba and 10 of his associates from the Sonke Long Distance Taxi Association, who are crammed into the dock. The crowd is angry and restless. People murmur approval when Magistrate Vanitha Armu turns down a request for photographs from the media pack they are trying to stare into submission.\nGcaba, who runs the association along with elder brother Mandla, is Durban taxi royalty. His late father, Simon Gcaba, founded Sonke in the 1970s and turned it into the dominant association in the long-distance industry through a series of bloody taxi wars that ultimately cost him his life in 1996 – and later also claimed his son Moses.\nThe family has diversified into the bus industry and is legendary for its influence – and wealth – in the industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:15:07.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
