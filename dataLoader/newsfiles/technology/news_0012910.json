This RFI is not accepting applications for financial assistance. The purpose of this RFI is solely to solicit input for ARPA-E consideration to inform the possible formulation of future programs. ARPA-E seeks input from researchers from credit: leftcoastgrassfed a broad range of disciplines, including the physical, computer, and social sciences and all engineering disciplines, regarding the development and adoptability of advanced telepresence technologies in the context of reducing the energy use associated with transportation. These may include, but are not limited to, advanced technologies and concepts relating to 2D or 3D telecommunications, virtual or augmented reality, brain-computer interface, robotics for telelabor, and any other mixed reality technologies. Any opportunities for development and potential technical solutions that might be of interest to ARPA-E would require a demonstrable path to reducing the amount that people use energy in the transportation sector. Of essential importance is the argument that, whatever the technology or concept is, an individual would prefer it to the energy-intensive status quo. This would therefore relegate the potential emissions reductions and fuel import reductions as positive externalities, not primary motivations.
