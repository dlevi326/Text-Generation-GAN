A device with Quick Charge 1.0 managed a 30% charge in that time period. \nAt the Qualcomm 3G/LTE Summit , Qnovo , an innovator of software to enhance battery performance, today announced that its QNS adaptive charging software fully supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0. With Qnovo QNS software included on Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 compatible smartphones, mobile device manufacturers can now deliver a battery experience without compromise. Now smartphones can last two days on a full charge, power an entire day on a 20 -minute fast charge and still maintain a two year battery lifetime with an ultra-thin phone design that consumers demand. \n\nFast charging is a popular consumer feature which allows rapid recovery from a low battery or when a user forgets to charge. Additionally, consumer’s daily use of their devices is increasing, which potentially leads to premature battery wearout. With Qnovo QNS adaptive charging software, battery aging is slowed to make the cell last longer – even while fast charging. \n\n“Qnovo has a unique solution to age old battery tradeoffs,” said Alex Katouzian, senior vice president of product management at Qualcomm. “With Qnovo, the consumer gets fast charging and longer battery lifetime, the best of both worlds.” \n\nQnovo’s QNS solution interoperates with Qualcomm’s power management chip (PMIC) to manage the battery charging process in real-time. QNS software runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and dynamically measures and modifies how the battery is charged in order to reduce charge time and prolong battery lifetime. \n\n“With Quick Charge 3.0, it’s now possible to charge significantly faster,” said Nadim Maluf, CEO of Qnovo. “With Qnovo QNS, we greatly extend the life of the battery.” \n\nAvailability \n\nQnovo QNS software is available now for all Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 and 3.0 compatible platforms. \n\nAbout Qnovo \n\nQnovo is reinventing one of the most basic foundations of mobility – the battery and how it is charged. Qnovo develops innovative and patented charging algorithms that improve battery performance. By augmenting battery chemistry with software, Qnovo adaptive charging produces tangible consumer benefits – faster charging, increased daily runtime and longer battery lifetime. Qnovo technology is applicable to any battery-powered application that benefits from faster charging or extended battery lifetime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T03:41:44.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
