At this thickness the new material offers the world's highest magnetic permeability of 220 µ´ at 1 MHz (typ.). IFL16 is designed for a temperature range of between -40 °C and +85 °C and is suitable for the frequency range from 0.5 MHz to 1000 MHz. The standard size of the sheet is 300 mm x 200 mm. The sheet can also be supplied on a roll (300 mm x 100 m). The new sheet extends the existing TDK product spectrum of noise suppression sheets of types IFL10M and IFL12. Volume production will start in September 2015. \nDevelopment of smartphones and other mobile devices is still focused on the miniaturization of the individual components, while the range of functions increases. Apart from a PCB layout that supports EMC, adequate additional shielding of the devices is playing an increasingly important role. Noise suppression sheets such as the new ultra-thin IFL16 are a space-saving answer to this requirement. They can prevent emitted interference from penetrating the device or can prevent reflections created within the device from affecting the function of other devices. \nA growing number of devices use a stylus pen for input, which works on the principle of magnetic induction. In order to improve sensitivity, these devices use magnetic films for the inductive sensor unit of the display. This simultaneously demands both a high level of magnetic permeability and a very thin film. On the basis of its substantial competence regarding materials and technology, TDK is offering attractive solutions for such applications with its new IFL16 foil. Film capacitors with high pulse strength and current capability in a compact design July 10, 2015 \nTDK Corporation presents two new series of EPCOS MMKP capacitors, which employ a film that is metallized on both sides. The new capacitors offer particularly high pulse strength as well as a high current capability. Depending ...
