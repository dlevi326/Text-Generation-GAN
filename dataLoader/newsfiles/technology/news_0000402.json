These proven, high quality CMOS sensors have Global Shutter and provide 12 bit images at unprecedented speed. Image quality and overall performance can be even further improved by optional cooling and the speed increased by server computers with bigger PCIe TLP packet size.\nThe PCIe® interface that is implemented inside the camera eliminates any need for a framegrabber. Image data are seamlessly delivered and stored right inside the PC memory and are immediately available for processing and encoding by CPU and GPU removing any possible latency.\nFor users who intend to synchronize multiple cameras: the models include opto-isolated inputs and outputs exposed from compact and robust camera body with industrial connector. To slim down the footprint both connectors are placed on the bottom resulting in size of mere 60 x 60 x 38 mm and weigh 175 grams. Additionally, as usual for XIMEA cameras the power consumption is conveniently low at 6 Watt.\nRaising the comfort of use new models are outfitted with an integrated lens interface that is compatible with Canon EF-mount lens and allows remote control of aperture, focus and image stabilization.\nComplimentary XIMEA API/SDK offers the choice of working under Windows, Linux, Mac OSX and or just C/C++.\nApplications include flat panel display and printed circuit board examination, persistent stadium or border security and wide area surveillance, 360 panorama, cinematography, aerial or city mapping.\nAbout XIMEA\nDrawing on two decades of experience in the industry, XIMEA offer consists of state-of-the-art cameras with USB 3.0, USB 2.0, PCI Express and FireWire interface as well as X-RAY, Hyperspectral and Thunderbolt™ technology enabled cameras.\nFor more than 20 years XIMEA has developed, manufactured and sold standard or OEM cameras for machine vision applications in motion control, assembly, robotics, industrial inspection and security, as well as scientific grade cameras for life science and microscopy.\nThe main distinction is based on extremely robust way the cameras are built while still providing highest speed like for example the USB3 Vision camera line.
