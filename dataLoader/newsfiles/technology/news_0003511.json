Sometimes the devices themselves might be difficult to embed appropriate security in. So we want to see the ingenuity that we see behind all these terrific new devices and services also thinking about how to embed security.” \nThe FTC has made cyber security a priority, pursuing more than 50 companies for “deceptive and unfair acts” that violate consumer privacy. A court ruling late last month allowed the FTC to press ahead with a lawsuit that alleges hotel company Wyndham Worldwide did not do enough to safeguard its customers’ personal data, which some in industry have worried will lead to more punitive actions by the agency. \nOn the sidelines of its first ‘Start with Security’ event, held in San Francisco, Ms Ramirez said the case simply validated the FTC’s already “vigorous enforcement work”, which the regulator intends to continue to pursue. \nBut she called on Congress to do more to address data security . FT Series \nCyber insecurity \nDevastating cyber attacks are on the rise, putting vast amounts of personal and business data at risk. FT examines how banks, companies and governments are trying to mount a concerted fight-back against the hackers \n“I personally feel that ultimately Congress needs to take action on data security. It is one of the most important challenges we face as a nation. The data breaches we hear about on a regular basis demonstrate its an area that requires more attention,” she said. \nSome companies have resented being pursued by the FTC for inadequate security when they feel attacks such as the recent high profile breaches at the US Office of Personnel Management , where records of more than 21m federal employees were stolen, show the government is also struggling to protect personal data. \nMs Ramirez rejects the idea that companies should not be pursued because government has also been vulnerable. “If you want to be in business and you want to stay in business you absolutely need consumers to trust your products and services. At the FTC our jurisdiction is commercial security so that is what our focus is on,” she said. \nThere are few clear standards on how companies should build their cyber defences, as it is hard to create concrete requirements when hackers frequently change tactics and find new vulnerabilities. Instead of creating a recipe for companies to follow, the FTC is trying to encourage companies to share best practices at a series of forums across the country, starting with the technology industry in San Francisco and heading to Austin in November. \nIt is also working with other regulators such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Association to tackle flaws in the security of connected cars, after a number of high profile ‘proof of concept’ hacks. \nThe FTC founded the Office of Technology, Research and Investigations centre earlier this year to expand its expertise and has recruited cyber security experts at hacker conferences such as Black Hat and Def Con to help improve its skills base.
