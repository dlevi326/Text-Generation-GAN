The survey, conducted during Dreamforce 2015, uncovers attendees' perceptions of how sales and marketing teams work together in an increasingly mobile-driven, dispersed work environment, and also reveals what tools and platforms sales reps are spending the most time on. The full report can be viewed here . \nEnterprise mobility continues to rise Mobile devices are increasingly becoming the first go-to device for work-related communications and content consumption. Sales teams today are already moving beyond more traditional mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, and are embracing wearables and other devices that enable reps and executives to access and manage critical sales information from anywhere, at any time. \nWhen addressing mobility in the workplace, the survey found that: 78% of respondents believe that mobile technology has dramatically improved their work life in 2015, which is up from 58% in 2014. An overwhelming 82 percent of Dreamforce attendees believe that having Salesforce accessible on wearable device will be useful for them. Almost 70 percent of respondents use their tablet more frequently than their smartphone for CRM, content management and presentations. \nFindings reveal where sales reps are spending the most time It's clear that sales teams, like the majority of employees today, are spending increasingly more time working on their mobile devices. For marketers, it's just as important to understand what platforms sales reps are accessing on those devices so they can meet their sales reps both on the tools and in the systems they are spending the most time using. \nThe survey found that: Sales teams are spending more time in Salesforce than ever before. Almost 70 percent of respondents in 2015 reported spending more than two hours each day in Salesforce, a 20 percent increase over what attendees reported in 2013. Aside from Salesforce, respondents spend a majority of their time on work-related email, with just over 80 percent spending 2 or more hours per day in email. Over 50 percent of respondents thought their companies' sales and marketing teams did not work well together, or only worked \"somewhat well\" together. \n\"As sales reps spend less and less time in the office, having solutions -- CRM, sales enablement platforms, etc. -- that are mobile friendly has become essential,\" said Doug Winter, CEO, Seismic. \"This increasing mobility has widened the gap between sales and marketing teams, making it more important than ever for marketers to ensure that sales collateral is available on the tools and platforms sales reps use most, like smartphones, tablets, Salesforce and email.\" \nAbout the Seismic Salesforce Spotlight The Seismic Salesforce Spotlight uncovers attendees' perceptions of how sales and marketing teams work together in an increasingly mobile-driven, widely-dispersed work environment.
