First released in 2007, the iPhone is Apple's best-selling device ever.\nAfter a dramatic redesign last year in which Apple enlarged the iPhone's screen and added mobile payments, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus boast more modest improvements.\nThe phones, which are the same size as last year's models, feature improved cameras and 3D touch, a display technology that responds according to how hard users press their screens.\nApple executives have said just a fraction of their customers have upgraded to the iPhone 6, suggesting they have plenty of room to grow this year. And lackluster offerings this year from rival smartphone manufacturer Samsung will help Apple's stand out in the marketplace, analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy wrote in an email.\n\"Over the long haul, the 6s will eclipse the 6 as Apple is even more competitive versus Samsung in emerging regions and is gaining share in traditional regions,\" Moorhead wrote in an email. \"Samsung didn't bring a whole lot of compelling features to consumers with their new lines of phones.\"\nThe iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which start at $199 and $299 with a two-year contract with a mobile service provider, will be available on Friday in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n(Editing by Stephen R.
