Furthermore, all four color models support the recently announced Canon PRINT Business application , available in the Apple App Store and Google Play, while the MF729Cdw and MF726Cdw models add enhanced support for Near Field Communication (NFC) technology built into Canon PRINT Business, which allows a user to print a document by touching an NFC-supported Android phone or tablet to the printer. \nColor imageCLASS MF700 Series \nThe Color imageCLASS MF729Cdw and MF726Cdw four-in-one wireless multifunction systems can help increase productivity and improve overall workflow.
