Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Paul Smith Australian social media customer intelligence platform Local Measure has stepped up its global expansion plans with new offices in Miami and London and a new advisory board of tech industry luminaries to help guide its growth.\nThe company, which has also opened a Singapore office during the past year, has signed on its first European customers and has added clients including Virgin Hotels in the US and Dubai Tourism to Australian clients like Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Qantas and hotelier Merivale.\nLocal Measure taps into social media chatter about businesses and brands and provides clients with a real-time dashboard to show what people are saying about them on networks such as Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare and Instagram.\nCompany founder Jonathan Barouch is planning to spend October in San Francisco as part of the company's push into the US market, and said the hiring of four experienced industry figures to form its advisory board was central to its aim of being a successful global operator.\nThe board comprises Google's US online sales vice-president Alan Moss, senior product designer at Salesforce.com Phil Richardson, former global sales and marketing head of casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp John Mims, who is based in Singapore, and British-based private investor and adviser Bart Swanson.\n\"Because the technology ecosystem is just starting to take root in Sydney it is often hard to find advisers and mentors in Sydney who've been through ups and downs or exited a number of start-ups and have been around the block a few times,\" Mr Barouch said.\n\"I was finding it challenging to get a global perspective, as well as local intel from people in the thick of things. Our advisory board provide the company with this kind of advice, warm connections but most importantly a pulse of what's going on in our space in other parts of the world.\"\nThe company was growing at a good rate, having tripled revenue in the past year, with similar growth forecast for the year ahead, he said. However, he admitted to being surprised at the length of time it took to gain significant traction overseas.\n \"You really need to put in a lot of hard work to first gain awareness, build your network and then your first few reference clients. We have learnt a lot over the last year having an office in the US and Singapore and I think we are applying the learnings to our new UK office to try to compress the time it takes to build out our pipeline,\" he said.\nDespite the growth plans, Mr Barouch said the company was comfortable financially, with no immediate need to raise funds. It is backed by ASX-listed Salmat, and Mr Barouch said it would consider seeking further funding if its global expansion required it in future.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/101552183386293013225/posts", "https://twitter.com/@SaysSmithy"], "published": "2015-09-14T10:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:21:29.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
