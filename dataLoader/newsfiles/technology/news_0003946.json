Jessica Metcalf , a Princeton University assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and public affairs , was one of 10 professors whose projects were chosen by the London-based Wellcome Fund for a new five-year, Â£75 million ($115 million) international initiative to study the links between human health and the health of the environment. Metcalf will use mobile-phone data to study shifting patterns of population density and how large-scale movement can drive patterns of disease, including outbreaks. The grant for Metcalf will be administered by the Princeton Environmental Institute", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T00:36:08.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
