Two extra hours was linked to 18 fewer points.\nUnsurprisingly, the results also showed that pupils doing an extra hour of daily homework and reading scored better - getting on average 23.1 more points than their peers.\nThe scientists said further research was needed to confirm the effect conclusively, but advised parents worried about their children's grades to consider limiting screen time.\nIn a breakdown analysis of different screen activities, the researchers found that TV came out as the most detrimental in terms of exam performance.
