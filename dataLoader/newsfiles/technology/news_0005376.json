(PRWEB) September 08, 2015\nIn just two weeks, the first Jesuit pope makes his first visit to the United States. In anticipation of the historic U.S. visit of Pope Francis, the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) has posted an online resource page with information about their religious order — the largest in the Catholic Church — and their unique spirituality.\nThe site provides background on the pope’s life as a Jesuit, the history of the Society of Jesus and famous alumni of the Jesuits' 2,300 schools in 67 countries.\nIn interviews, Pope Francis has said that he was attracted to the Jesuits because of their missionary spirit and emphasis on social justice and care for those living at the margins; he entered the Jesuits as a novice in 1958 and was ordained a priest in 1969. The pope’s spirituality has all the hallmarks of a Jesuit, and the way he prayerfully considers decisions — a Jesuit term called “discernment” — was outlined by the Society’s founder St. Ignatius in his Spiritual Exercises, a prayer and meditation manual, nearly half a millennium ago.\nBecause Jesuits solemnly promise not to \"strive or ambition\" for any high office in the Society of Jesus or in the church, there are very few Jesuit cardinals, which is why Pope Francis’ election in March of 2013 was so surprising to the members of his religious order. Though now pope, he is always mindful of his Jesuit roots: the pope’s coat of arms bears the emblem of the Society of Jesus.\nFor more information on the Jesuits, visit http://www.jesuits.org/pope .
