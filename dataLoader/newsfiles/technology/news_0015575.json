[but] despite having little, I'm all ready to help. I'm willing to give clothing, food, toys, household appliances and the use of my home,\" one woman posted. \nA German group, Refugees Welcome, which acts as a matchmaker for citizens willing to share their homes with refugees, has housed some 135 refugees to date, including people fleeing Afghanistan, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria. \nThe project said it had been overwhelmed with support - with hosts ranging from PR consultants and carpenters to students - and received offers of help to set up similar schemes in other countries, including Greece, Portugal and Britain. \nWhile the migration crisis has divided politicians and fueled the rise of right-wing populists, it has also inspired an outpouring of public support and activism across Europe. \nFootball fans in Germany held up banners at matches last weekend welcoming those fleeing persecution, while 20,000 people demonstrated in Vienna earlier this week after 71 bodies were found in the back of an abandoned truck in Austria. \nIn Britain, a plan to march next week through London to show solidarity with refugees was gaining traction on Facebook, and a petition on parliament's website to accept more refugees had garnered more than 200,000 signatures. \nThomas Wenn, one of the thousands of Britons offering to host refugees through websites and Facebook groups, hailed the impact of social media but said it was unfortunate that it had taken the image of a dead child to engage the public. \n\"Passive activism can do only so much, if we can directly help people then it would be far more helpful than just demanding that our government do something,\" Wenn, 32, who is self-employed, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
