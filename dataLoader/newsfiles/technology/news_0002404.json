It says it will make selfies more detailed than ever before. \nThe new iPhone will take Live Photos - which means it takes second and a half’s worth of frames either side of your snap. \nIt means if you do a force touch on the photo, the picture will “come alive” and show you the motion around the captured moment. \nIt’ll be supported on all your devices too - from Mac OSX El Capitan right down to the Apple Watch. You can even set Live Photos as your Apple Watch face. \nApple has also increased the power of the new phones with a brand new processor it calls the A9. \nIt’s 70% faster than iPhone 6’s A8 chip on CPU tasks, or 90% on graphics. Reuters Apple CEO Tim Cook introduces the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6sPlus \nBoth the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will ship with iOS 9 - the latest version of Apple's operating system. \nAccording to Apple's execs, the extra power and more efficient operating system leads to an even better battery. \nIn terms of storage space, Apple has decided to stick with the 16GB, 64GB or 128GB sizes of the previous models. \nPrices will also remain the same as the last generation. \nThe indication Apple gave was that prices will start at $199 for the 16GB iPhone 6s on a 24-month contract. \nThat goes up to $299 for the 64GB and $399 for the 128GB model. \nThe larger-sized iPhone 6s Plus will start at $299 for the 16GB version on a 24 month contract. \nThat then goes up to $399 for the 64GB model and $499 for the 128GB version. Both of which are on top of network fees. \nThe company hasn't revealed a specific UK launch date for the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus but it will undoubtedly be coming soon.
