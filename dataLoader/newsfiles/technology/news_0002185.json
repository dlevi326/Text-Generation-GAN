The blazes have forced thousands to flee their homes. \nMost of the largest wildfires are between 47 and 68 percent contained, with three almost fully controlled, CalFire said. \nHowever a 1,200-acre (485 hectare) blaze dubbed the Tassajara fire that broke out Saturday afternoon in Monterey County, along the state's central Pacific coast, is only 10 percent contained, the department reported early Sunday. \nThe weather also refuses to collaborate, with hot and dry conditions forecast throughout the weekend across the state. \nHigher temperatures increase the chances of flare ups in fire areas that were already controlled, CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant told Fox News. \nSeparately, Berlant said that firefighters get especially frustrated when residents ignore danger warnings and refuse to evacuate. \nTwo people killed in the Butte wildfire in northern California chose to remain in their homes after they were told to leave because of the imminent danger, he said. \n\"Our firefighters this week were forced to stop fighting the fire and went into rescue mode just trying to get people to evacuate,\" Berlant told Fox. \nThe fires have cost California at least $244 million since July 1, compared to $240 million ($216 million) for all of 2013. Last year, the bill amounted to $434 million. \nThe deadliest fire in California's history was the October 1991 Tunnel fire that killed 25 people and razed 2,900 structures. In terms of land burned, the 2003 Cedar fire holds the record with more than 273,000 acres destroyed. \nSeveral other blazes are also burning across the country, including in the states of Washington, Oregon, Utah, Montana and Florida. \nMore than 1,400 homes have been destroyed in two of the biggest wildfires burning in California, officials said Sunday, making them among the worst ever in the most populous US state. \nThe death toll rose to six after a person was killed in a new fire south of Monterey. \nResponders were shifting to damage assessment for the Valley and Butte fires, which have each burned more than 70,000 acres (28,000 hectares), as they were approximately half and 70 percent contained, respectively. \nMandatory evacuations for the Butte fire, burning about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Sacramento, were lifted Sunday, as were evacuations for some areas affected by the Valley fire, north of Napa Valley's wine country. \nThe damage assessments gave long-awaited answers to some of the thousands of displaced residents wondering whether they would have homes to return to. \nBut ten large fires -- including two new ones -- remained active in the state, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire), which said 10,500 firefighters were currently deployed. \nOne resident was killed in a new fire that sprang up Saturday afternoon south of Monterey. Ten homes have been destroyed or damaged so far by that 1,200-acre (485 hectares ) blaze, which was only 10 percent contained Sunday, CalFire said. \nThree residents have been killed and four firefighters injured in the Valley fire, which began last Saturday. \nAnd another two civilians were killed in the Butte fire, in the Sierra Nevada foothills, but residents were being allowed to gradually return to their homes Sunday. \nCalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant said those two residents killed had chosen to remain in their homes after evacuations were put in place. \n\"Our firefighters this week were forced to stop fighting the fire and went into rescue mode just trying to get people to evacuate,\" he told Fox News. \nAs the damage was tallied Sunday, CalFire said the Valley and Butte fires had become the sixth and seventh worst, respectively, in the state's history, after they razed parts of small, rural towns. \nBy contrast, the most damaging fire, 1991's Tunnel fire, tore through the heavily populated hills above Oakland, killing 25 and destroying some 2,900 homes and apartment buildings. \nLocal authorities say hot and dry weather is hampering efforts to control the ongoing blazes, which have thrived in drought-parched California. \n\"A warming and drying trend is under way, and a light wind pattern will enhance the warm and dry conditions until Monday\" in Northern California, CalFire said in a statement. \nThe fires have cost California at least $244 million since July 1, compared to $240 million for all of 2013. Last year, the bill amounted to $434 million. \nSeveral other major fires are burning in the state's national forests and other federally operated lands, though with less direct threat to homes or residents. \nOther blazes continue across the western United States, particularly northern Washington state. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T11:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T06:57:57.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
