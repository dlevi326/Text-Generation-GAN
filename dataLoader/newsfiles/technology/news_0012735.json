Seamless integration with the easy-to-use Applicability feature on the RegScan One platform makes this advanced feature a must-have for anyone managing compliance at multiple global facilities. \n\"Environmental regulatory requirements and recognized operational standards continue to become more and more complex, so we felt there was a need to even further simplify the process,\" said Ned Ertel, President and C.E.O. of RegScan. \"By grouping large sets of requirements together, the Applicability Wizard can drastically reduce the amount of time and resources it takes to create legal registers and audit protocols tailored to your global facilities.\" \nUsers of the RegScan One system can create custom legal registers and audit protocols for more than 140 jurisdictions around the globe.
