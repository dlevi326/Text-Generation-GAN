This simple, yet beautifully designed one-of-a-kind planter and birdfeeder has been developed to keep rodents, mostly squirrels, from getting to the birdfeed, non-invasively. The Defender was developed to attract a larger variety of birds as compared to ordinary birdfeeders. The Defender, by its design, protects the feed from all types of weather, including rain, sleet, snow, and wind gusts up to 70 mph when hung securely. The Defender is easy to fill and to clean and has no moving parts to be broken. When a plant is placed in the planter and changed based on the season, a beautiful variety of birds can be attracted.\nCreated by Arthur Myrberg, this awesome product is beneficial even if the defender is not suspended. If the owner does not want to hang it as suggested, it can still be of greater benefit than other birdfeeders. For instance, if placed on a pole, stump, stand or on the ground, The Defender will still attract more bird varieties and will still protect the feed from all types of adverse weather, just not rodents. However, before everyone can enjoy this innovative product, Arthur needs help. That’s why he launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $190,000 by November 21, 2015. The funds raised will go towards manufacturing, production, and shipping.\nTo help bring this incredible birdfeeder to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered by March 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help Arthur Myrberg reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nArthur Myrberg\n904-769-8402\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
