It declined to name the company that funded the latest Chipotle campaign.\nThe ad is \"a deliberate effort to smear us,\" Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said.\n\"These are agenda-driven people who are being backed by unknown parties. It doesn't matter who they are as long as they pay,\" Arnold said.\nPublic health experts have warned that Chipotle dishes loaded with cheese, sour cream and guacamole can approach or exceed daily recommended allowances for calories, sodium and saturated fat.\nThe company said it is different from other chains because diners choose what goes into each Chipotle meal.\nThe CCF ad is the latest blow against the popular company.\nA California woman earlier this week accused Chipotle of false advertising related to its claim that it had removed genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, from its food when many of its beverages contain a sweetener made with genetically modified corn.\nArnold called the lawsuit \"meritless\" and \"filled with inaccuracies.\" He added that Chipotle has been transparent about GMOs in beverages.\nChipotle won a loyal following by offering meat from animals that have never received antibiotics. Still, critics are quick to note that it serves conventionally raised chicken when such supplies fall short. And, Chipotle recently cited tight supplies for its decision to allow a new pork producer to use antibiotics to treat animal illness \"only when necessary.\"\nThe CCF in 2013 fought then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposed obesity-fighting sales ban on large sugary beverages by depicting him as a nanny.\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Bernard Orr )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T01:07:07.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
