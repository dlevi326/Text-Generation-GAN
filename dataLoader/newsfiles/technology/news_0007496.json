They use these cues in changes in air pattern to safely find their way. Moths are nocturnal creatures, so like most other insects they can’t rely of the sunlight to provide a landmark. “Imagine you’re in a hot air balloon, drifting with the wind at night, and you closed your eyes. And someone said, ‘Which way is the wind blowing?’ You would have no idea,” co-author Jason Chapman — who studies how animals move at England’s Rothamsted Research — told Inside Science. “You’re moving in the fluid, the air, and you’re in a sensory vacuum.” According to the laws of fluid dynamics governing turbulence, less disturbances are found when you’re flying downwind. Hence, if the moths could sense stronger turbulences, and in which direction these were directing the course of the moth, they could know the direction of the wind flow. The team referred to 15 years worth of radar tracked bird movement, especially during migration, and found the working of the Ekman spiral. Ekman spiral in Physics, states that air currents flow counterclockwise in the Northern hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern hemisphere (as Earth is on constant rotation on its axis), but those same currents in the Northern hemisphere shift to clockwise rotation at higher and higher altitudes. The radar data showed that the moths would mis-align ever so slightly to the right when flying downwind in the Northern hemisphere, and vice versa in the Southern hemisphere, supporting the Ekman spiral. Now that the mystery of what the moths use as a compass has been solved, the question of how they achieve this feat still remains unsolved. Scientists believe they use magnetic fields, an ability that flies, beetles, ants, bees, and termites are known to possess.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T11:33:25.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
