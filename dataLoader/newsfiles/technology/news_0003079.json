This policy change further validates the presence of an anesthesiologist in the monitoring and treatment of patients in endoscopic procedures. \nEffective 10/29/2015, BCBS of Minnesota will now automatically pay for any cases submitted (and justified) for ASA physical status II or higher. The previous version of the policy only paid for physical status III and higher and required provider groups to appeal medical necessity for other patients, including those with co-morbidities for which other BCBS plans would pay. \n“We are thrilled that BCBS of Minnesota has agreed to modify their medical necessity policy to include ASA physical status II based, in part, on our advocacy efforts on behalf of our clients. A larger percentage of BCBS members will now benefit from access to a qualified anesthesia provider during their endoscopic procedure,” said Brian Ramos, Director of Practice Operations at Plexus Management Group. “Further, anesthesia providers can focus on treating their patients at bedside, rather than fulfilling administratively burdensome requirements to get paid for services rendered.” \nBob McIvor, President of Plexus Management Group, shares his thought on the decision, “Plexus MG is pleased to see our efforts reach fruition. We realize that anesthesia is a particularly complicated field and any assistance we can provide to simplify the effort for both our clients and the industry is a step in the right direction.” \nPlexus MG is a subsidiary of MiraMed Global Services, LLC (MMGS). Plexus MG also works closely with Anesthesia Business Consultants, LLC, another MMGS subsidiary, to provide comprehensive services to the anesthesia and pain management industry. “Both Plexus MG and ABC are committed solely to the anesthesia and pain management markets” states Tony Mira, President and CEO of MiraMed Global Services.
