The integration makes the fastest, lowest cost solution for Microsoft RMS users to immediately process EMV transactions.\nGlastonbury, CT, September 22, 2015 --( PR.com )-- System Solutions released the Microsoft RMS EMV Chip and Pin Integration. The integration works directly with Datacap dsiEMV software which is being adopted by all major processors. The Datacap software communicates with the Chip and Pin device and sends the combined credit card transaction information to the credit card processor for authorization. The integration makes the fastest, lowest cost solution for Microsoft RMS point of sale users to immediately process EMV transactions.\nMicrosoft RMS is widely used across the United States and many other countries around the world. The EMV liability transfer effective October 1, 2015 requires that merchants are able to process EMV transactions or take financial responsibility for fraudulent in-store card purchases. System Solutions is well known for Microsoft RMS implementations and integrations supporting many Ingenico and Verifone devices past and present. “The RMS EMV Chip and Pin Integration makes the fastest, lowest cost solution to become EMV compliant now, and maintain future flexibility in choosing credit card processors and devices as more processors become certified on Datacap,” says Dave Durrenberger of System Solutions a Microsoft RMS Certified Partner.\nFor more information on the solution, visit: Microsoft RMS EMV Chip and Pin Integration", "external_links": ["http://www.syssolutionsllc.com/", "http://www.syssolutionsllc.com/page/Addons/RMSEMVIntegration"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T08:20:10.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
