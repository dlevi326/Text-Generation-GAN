As far as team mascots go I think the Springbok is one of the best out there, graceful in its agility. But, in this country the mascot of our national team has become more than merely that.\nIt's an icon, a symbol. It evokes flashbacks of Madiba, the fall of apartheid, the \"Rainbow Nation\". It is precisely for this reason I believe it should be retired. How can any mortal man where a badge with such rich historical connotations and not falter?\nThe alternative team mascot/symbol, the Protea is not at all that bad is you stop to think of it. Look at the top international teams in world rugby's team mascot. The feared New Zealanders have a fern leaf and the other two time world champions (Australia) have a wallaby, which is essentially a big rat.\nAlas I think it's time to leave the Springbok alone, let it rest in the history books, where its (actual) meaning will never be corrupted (seriously, Japan! That's bordering on blasphemy). Let's raise our Protea flags, we'll save on supporter's gear, one jersey will announce your support for both the national cricket and rugby sides. And we can keep out sacred Springbok, sacred.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:16:35.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
