Members of the G6 Alliance, in mid-August, announced additional four void sailings in their Asia-Europe trade-lane in response to changes in market demand. \nAll three Japanese operators – MOL, NYK And K-line, registered negative returns of 8%, 6% and 3% in August, respectively. \nThree-month returns were also disappointing with negative returns ranging from 12% to 19%. Yet, operationally, the tide could turn favourably in the second half for the Japanese carriers, on the strength of both the dry bulk and tanker shipping sectors. \nAP Moller-Maersk’s value eroded by 2% in August and 15% for the three months between June and August, 2015. \nThe flag-ship company – Maersk Line - is going through its biggest turmoil and may see suspension of two-to-four larger strings in Q4, 2015 to lift vessel utilisation. \nTotal volumes, especially on the Asia - Europe route, may also take a hit this year due to de-stocking in Europe, sanctions against Russia and a strengthening yuan against the euro.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:01:23.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
