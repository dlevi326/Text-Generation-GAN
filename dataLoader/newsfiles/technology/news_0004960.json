Picture by: Gcina Ndwalane \nA Durban software developer has designed a mobile app intended to make reporting faults and service delivery issues to the municipality much easier. \nLinton Achmad, of Wentworth, told the Daily News his aim was to streamline the process so that faults could be tended to quickly, using the myServ app. \n“People using the app can report streetlights not working, cable theft, potholes and other issues they might come across,” he said. \nThe app was released last month. \nAchmad explained that once a user typed in the address of the fault, the location was automatically picked up, matching it with the relevant municipality. The app automatically takes the exact GPS location of the fault when the person reports it. \n“The purpose is to make the lives of people easier by providing a direct platform to engage with the municipality cheaper and to empower the municipality to effectively gather key service delivery issues, because the municipality cannot be everywhere to identify faults.” \nThe system works with all smartphones, including And-roid, Apple, Windows and Blackberry. \n“It is really simple and easy to use. The app allows citizens to snap a photo of the fault and description and send the fault to the municipality, with little hassle.” \nThe relevant department is then alerted and a reference number, with updates following the initial report, is sent to the user, in the language of his or her choice. \nHe and his business partner, business analyst and chief executive of software development company OTSG, Thabo Ntshembeni, clubbed together and designed the app, which they funded out of their own pockets. \n“It’s cost us between R50 000 and R70 000, but it was worth it. We wanted to create something useful and affordable.” \nAchmad said he had been interested in new technologies and their development since a young age. “It all started with my Game Boy, I guess. Now I want to use that same interest to make something useful.” \nThe app is available for download from the Google Play store free of charge. \nThe eThekwini municipality has not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. – Daily News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T15:03:01.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
