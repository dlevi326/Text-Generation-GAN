Aerie said in June that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed the drug maker to modify the primary endpoint in the second Phase 3 trial.\nAerie said \"we are very impressed by\" the trial results. The company said it expects safety results from the trial at the end of 2015 or early 2016.\nAnother safety-only study in Canada is currently under way, while another trial is slated to begin in late September.\nBased on its previous discussions with the FDA, the company expects to file a New Drug Application for Rhopressa in mid-2016.\nLast week, Aerie named Richard A. Lewis chief medical officer. He is a former president of the American Glaucoma Society.\nWrite to Josh Beckerman at josh.beckerman@wsj.com\n 16, 2015 17:25 ET (21:25 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T03:16:06.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
