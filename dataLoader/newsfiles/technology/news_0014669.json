Bandwidth Commander uses IPDR (Internet Protocol Detail Records) data to collect usage from a DOCSIS-compatible CMTS. The tool looks at resources that are being used in real-time allowing limits to be put in place dynamically to help reduce bandwidth usage during peak hours, in addition to monthly usage quotas.\nLaunched in 1999 as a mobile phone company, Bluesky Group is now a leading regional telecommunications operator providing various combinations of mobile, broadband, TV, and landline services in American Samoa, Samoa, Cook Islands, and New Zealand. Since 2009, Bluesky Pacific Group has operated the only submarine fiber cable into American Samoa and Samoa from Hawaii.\nClick to Tweet\nBluesky was already using ZCorum’s TruVizion , a cable modem and CMTS diagnostics application that presents real-time and historical data on the performance of their cable modems and CMTSs. ZCorum was also provisioning Bluesky’s subscriber devices on the cable network. After a year of success with ZCorum’s tools and services, Bluesky was ready to deploy bandwidth management to further improve their subscribers’ experience. “This solution is ideal for Bluesky, who had been looking to lessen the impact of high bandwidth costs,” said Neal Grillot, ZCorum’s VP of Operations. “Bandwidth Commander will help the company delay the need for future bandwidth upgrades, and provide a better overall customer experience by reducing the impact of high-bandwidth use.”\nBandwidth Commander also allows the company to analyze their broadband packages and tie pricing to subscriber bandwidth use. The tool manages bandwidth usage based on the provider’s pricing tiers and monitors usage daily, hour by hour.\n“Bluesky will now be able to obtain real-time detailed bandwidth analytics with Bandwidth Commander and experience increased network efficiency,” said Julie Compann, President and CEO of ZCorum. “We’re excited to be a part of Bluesky’s continuously improving customer experience by providing them with another of our managed broadband solutions.”\nAbout ZCorum\nZCorum provides a suite of broadband diagnostics and managed services to cable companies, telephone companies, utilities, and municipalities.
