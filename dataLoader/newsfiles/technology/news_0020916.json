The last-minute decision followed reports from app developers testing almost-finished released versions of the software that the operating system update was causing dramatic battery drain. \nOne software developer, Kharis O’Connell, described the final beta version of operating system called “abysmal” and “defo (sic) not ready for prime time). \nAlthough after he repaired it to his iPhone, he remarked there was “crazy good battery” life in a tale of two extremes. \nO’Connel is an app developer for Vancouver-based CommandWear, which makes a communication app for emergency first responders. \nApple released a statement at 1am AEST about the delayed software release: “We have discovered a bug in development of watchOS 2 that is taking a bit longer to fix than we expected. We will not release watchOS 2 today but will shortly.” \nApple announced the release of the new operating system back at its WWDC conference in June. The update also featured prominently in the “monster” Apple event of last week in which the Cupertino-based technology giant announced two new iPhones, a new giant iPad and a revamped iPad Pro. \nDuring the event in San Francisco last week, Apple announced the Watch update would be available on September 16. By 4pm Wednesday AEST, the watchOS 2 page on the Apple website was updated to say “coming soon”. \nThe announcement of the delay for the software was issued just hours after Apple CEO Tim Cook made a high-profile appearnas on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. \nSome software developers, who claimed to be testing final beta versions of the operating system, took to social media to complain the update was draining the battery of their Apple Watch. Absolutely ABYSMAL battery life on #WatchOS2 GM. Worse than any previous beta - and defo not ready for prime time. — Kharis O'Connell (@rmtwrkr) September 10, 2015 I am pretty sure watchOS2 GM is killing my battery. 10% at 3pm? — Matt Nydam (@MattNydam) September 16, 2015 Battery life on watchOS 2 GM seems to be a lot worse than the beta. #WatchOS2 #developer — George Jones (@penguingeorge) September 15, 2015 Glad to see unpairing/repairing the Apple Watch resolved the WatchOS2 GM battery issues. Beta quirk I guess. — Mike Kresic (@kresic) September 12, 2015 #WatchOS2 GM chewed up 33% of battery in only 2.5 hours this morning with no actual use of watch.
