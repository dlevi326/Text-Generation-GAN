But this has hardly helped Vietnam’s tourism industry as foreign tourists to stay in Vietnam for at least three weeks, but the exemption period is only 15 days, Ung Phuong Dung, director of Indochina Services Travel Group, told Saigon Times Online.\nIt often takes more than 15 days to explore all major Vietnam’s destinations, meaning that many tourists still have to apply for a visa anyway, Tran Trong Kien, CEO of travel and hospitality group Thien Minh, was Quote: d as saying.\nAnother bottleneck is that tourists who enter Vietnam and then visit neighboring countries also have to apply for a visa if they want to return to Vietnam within 30 days from their exit.\nTourism authorities have yet to fulfill their promise about big promotion campaigns and national sales programs in order to help increase the visa waiver policy’s effects, complained tour operators.\nWithout making tourists in the target markets aware of the visa waiver rule, Vietnam will not be able to attract more tourists as it hopes, an unnamed representative of a travel company in Ho Chi Minh City said.\nAccording to the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT), more than 5 million foreigners visited Vietnam in the January-August period, down 7.5 percent year-on-year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:12:37.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
