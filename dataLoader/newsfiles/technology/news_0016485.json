From data theft to private e-mail leaks and more, hackers are finding their way into a host of different communications networks. \nThrough the relationship, Panasonic will combine Symantec’s highly reliable certificates and technology for detecting and analyzing cyber-attacks with its own in-house embedded cryptography technology to provide a highly secure and robust protection layer for its embedded surveillance products. \nSecure Communication is PC-level security for cameras and other embedded devices, providing three information protecting blocks: data encryption; communication encryption; and verification and key, all to ensure the robustness of video evidence and overall safety of video streams. Secure Communication specifically protects against spoofing (false data), video tampering or altering (changing images), and snooping of protected surveillance communications (stealing passwords). \nEquivalent to Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 Level 1, as required for FBI and Public Safety use, Secure Communication’s built-in design reduces maintenance costs while providing robust, yet simple operation. \n“Recognizing the potential for surreptitious tampering with or attacks on video streams, Panasonic’s Secure Communication provides a powerful and economical solution to enhance the security of networked surveillance communications,” said Charlie Hare, National Category Manager, Security and Mobile Video Solutions. \nPanasonic Group has set a clear target of reaching 10 trillion yen in sales by 2018, for its business-to-business solutions, and its comprehensive video surveillance specifications and implementations will play an important role in achieving this global growth target. \nSecure Communication will be available in Q4 FY2015 on all new Panasonic 3, 5 and 6 Series Models and will specifically protect against denial-of-service attacks, IP spoofing and file tampering. \nFor more information about Secure Communication, visit http://panasonic.net/Symantec .
