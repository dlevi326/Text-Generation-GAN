Condominium dwellers in Toronto and other major Canadian metropolises are emerging as the haves when it comes to affordable super-fast internet access. The other 70 per cent or so of Torontonians who don’t live in high-rises, meanwhile, are getting left behind.\nCondo owners and renters fortunate enough to live in a building serviced by newer fibre broadband providers such as Beanfield Metroconnect, for example, have some of the fastest and cheapest Internet access in the country. A family living in a detached house just a few blocks away, however, typically pays much more with Bell or Rogers, only to get slower speeds, monthly data caps, or both.\nThe explanation is simple. Condo residents generally have three Internet “pipes” coming into their units — one from Bell, another from Rogers and a third from the likes of Beanfield. House dwellers usually have only the first two, so they get fewer choices in network providers and therefore higher prices and slower speeds.\nIt’s not just a hit on the pocket book. House-bound Torontonians are going to have a harder time accessing new Internet applications that require faster speeds and bigger data throughput.\nCount ultra-high-definition video — already streaming on Netflix — and many cloud services such as online document storage and sharing among those applications. These bandwidth-intensive services, and many more that have yet to be invented, will drive the digital economies of the future and provide new social interaction and entertainment possibilities. Slower speeds and usage limits means they’ll be barely usable, or not at all.\nThe disparity isn’t likely to improve on its own any time soon.\nBell recently began rolling out gigabit broadband — providing download speeds of 940 megabits per second — to more than a million homes in Ontario and Quebec, but at a premium price. A gigabit connection costs $150 a month, ensuring that only the richest households will subscribe.\nUpstarts are growing quickly — Beanfield has expansions planned into Markham and Mississauga — but they’re still focused only on condos.\n“I wish I could build everywhere,” says president Chris Amendola. Connecting houses would require difficult negotiations for rights-of-ways with individual home owners, he adds.\n“If the city were willing to step in and assist us with something like that, it would be a different story.”\nCanada falls behind\nThe condo-house discrepancy is also contributing to another digital divide — this one between Canada and the rest of the developed world.\nFewer than 4 per cent of Canada’s Internet connections were delivered via high-speed fibre in 2014, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Japan and South Korea, in comparison, saw 71 and 66 per cent of their respective connections come via the newer technology. Canada also lagged the United States, at 8.8 per cent, and the OECD average of 16.5 per cent.\nCanada has slid to 12th place among the 34 OECD members in broadband subscriptions per capita, from second near the turn of the millennium. The OECD finds broadband expensive in Canada relative to its peers, a key disincentive for people to subscribe to faster services.\nA recent report sponsored by Industry Canada concurs, with prices for higher-speed Internet services here found to be expensive compared to peer countries such as France and the United Kingdom.\nThe federal government and regulators have done little to remedy the problem. The Harper government last year set a target of providing nearly all Canadians with download speeds of at least 5 megabits per second by 2019. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission has the same speed goal, but hopes to get it done by the end of this year.\nNeither plan has firm targets on usage caps or affordability, while the 5 Mbps download goal — the bare minimum required to stream Netflix in HD, but far short of ultra HD — is unambitious compared to other jurisdictions. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission, for example, earlier this year reclassified broadband as having a download speed of at least 25 mbps. Germany recently announced a plan to get 50 mbps to everyone in the country.\nThe CRTC is in the early stages of a year-long review of broadband services in Canada, but the regulator has indicated it will focus heavily on the rural and remote parts of the country. While many residents in such areas can only dream of the speeds widely available in cities, policy makers should also be looking at how to stem the growing divide in urban centres.\nThe government, for its part, has focused much of its attention over the past decade to spurring more competition in wireless, which has sprouted new players such as Wind Mobile. Whatever party ends up in power after the October election needs to also turn its eye to home broadband.\nWithout leadership from the top, Canada will continue slipping farther behind the rest of the world and Canadians will find themselves stuck with yesterday’s Internet access.\nOr, at least those who don’t live in condos will.\nThe next generation\nThe federal government may be asleep at the broadband wheel, but not everyone is. A number of new developments hold out hope for Canadians looking to get next-generation Internet connections at affordable prices.\nCRTC Wholesale\nCanada’s broadcast regulator is reviewing how wholesale internet access is sold in Canada. Currently, smaller internet service providers such as Teksavvy and Distributel are allowed to rent portions of Bell and Rogers’ networks to deliver their own services. The regulator in July ruled that these alternative ISPs must get access to newer superfast fibre infrastructure, although the rates they'll have to pay network owners to do so have yet to be set. Access to faster speeds and lower wholesale rates will likely make the indie ISPs more competitive with the big players.\nGoogle Fiber\nSearch giant Google is spurring fresh competition in cities around the United States by building its own super-fast networks. The initiative, Google Fiber, is in turn provoking large ISPs such as Comcast and AT&T to improve their own services, both in terms of the speeds and prices being offered. Google is offering low prices and gigabit speeds not as an effort to make money as an ISP, but to get people using its online services more. Experts believe it’s unlikely Google Fiber will ever come to Canada, but the search company is setting an example of what an alternative ISP business model could look like.\nMunicipal broadband\nFed up with waiting for big telecom companies to provide fast, affordable service, some towns and cities are doing it for themselves. Olds, Alberta, a town of just 8,500, became the first “gig” town in Canada when it introduced gigabit connections to residents in 2013. The town secured a grant from the provincial government and built the network, weaning itself off what most small communities rely on — slow and expensive satellite or broadband access. Other towns, including Stratford, Ont. and Coquitlam, B.C., have followed suit with similar initiatives. Efforts in bigger cities are likely to have a tougher time getting off the ground given that most residents are already serviced by cable and telecom companies.\nMore on thestar.com\nApple broke its iPhone sales record, again\nFormer VW boss investigated for fraud", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:06:25.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
