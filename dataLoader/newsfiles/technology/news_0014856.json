Peak Apple. Someone is queuing in Sydney before THEY HAVE EVEN ANNOUNCED ANYTHING!!! pic.twitter.com/G16X0ze8eN\nâ€” Seamus Byrne (@seamus) September 8, 2015 Whether the person (or people) in that tent are there for an iPhone or a revamped Apple TV is unclear, keep in mind this happened last year, too . As some may recall, several people were in lines at Apple's flagship store in Fifth Avenue in New York days before an event would reveal the first official details of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.\nThe tent in that tweet features a logo, and as our story from last year notes , some people waiting in line in New York were paid to pitch products while camping out. It's possible we have a similar scenario here.\nAlso, Apple usually waits roughly two weeks between the event and the launch date of the device. So it looks like that tent will be there a while.\nApple is expected to reveal the next iPhone on Wednesday.\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .\n4 CONNECT 27 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1UECLoO TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1UECLoO", "http://t.co/G16X0ze8eN", "https://twitter.com/seamus/status/641235426699689984", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UECLoO&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70c39127c62fb4d01eed26669ff6d8f63635c938/c=54-0-969-688&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767085645419858-GTY-481503466-74652918.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UECLoO&text=There%20is%20someone%20already%20camping%20out%20at%20Apple%20store&via=usatoday", "http://twitter.com/brettmolina23", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767085645419858-GTY-481503466-74652918.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-08T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T23:51:35.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
