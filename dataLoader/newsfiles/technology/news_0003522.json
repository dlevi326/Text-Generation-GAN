For those who think the National Football League has taken a moral stance against \" daily fantasy sports \" by refusing to become a shareholder of either FanDuel or DraftKings, think again. It's not that the NFL has a stronger moral aversion to daily fantasy sports than the NBA and Major League Baseball. Rather, America's most profitable sports league has perhaps found a better way to profit from the emerging industry.While the NBA publicly became a shareholder of FanDuel in November 201 4 and Major League Baseball purportedly had a secret agreement including ownership rights in DraftKings that dates back to 2013 , the NFL does not have an exclusive agreement with either daily fantasy sports company. However, by remaining agnostic the NFL has been able to profit from both companies' businesses without incurring much financial risk or legal risk .Specifically, by not investing in either company, the NFL allows its team owners to pit the daily fantasy sports marketplace's No. 1 and No. 2 in terms of market share against one another for team endorsement deals. Because both brands are striving desperately to grow their footprint in the pro sports marketplace before [entity display=\"Yahoo\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"yahoo\" ticker=\"YHOO\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/4786\"]Yahoo[/entity], [entity display=\"CBS\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"cbs\" ticker=\"CBS\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/826\"]CBS[/entity], Amaya and various large international gaming companies begin to stretch their \"daily fantasy sports\" wings, the NFL teams are able to exert far better terms from FanDuel and DraftKings than would have likely been feasible if there existed a national, league-wide agreement.In addition, the NFL has mastered the art of selling large banner advertisements on their own website to both FanDuel and DraftKings. A review of the NFL.com fantasy page as this included numerous ads for both companies, and DraftKings (and to a somewhat lesser extent FanDuel) continue to poor their revenues back into advertising.[caption id=\"attachment_7498\" align=\"\" width=\"1280\"] The NFL website features banner advertisements for both FanDuel and DraftKings. Copyright, 2015, Marc Edelman[/caption]Finally, the NFL's strategy with daily fantasy sports albeit arguably not any more moral, is indeed legally safer. As daily fantasy sports continue to grow in scale, it is inevitable that the federal government, as well as various state governments, will give these games a closer look.Both FanDuel and DraftKings continue to operate in some states where there is undeniable legal risk, including Tennessee and Arkansas . Neither FanDuel nor DraftKings has ceased business in Michigan even after the state gaming commission indicated a belief that daily fantasy sports was illegal . And DraftKings even operates a single-tournament daily fantasy golf competition, which a rguably runs afoul to the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act as well as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act .But, of course, none of this is the NFL's problem.
