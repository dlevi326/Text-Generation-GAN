From best practices to industry data, this weekly communique reports on trend data, process improvement, and technology evaluations about picking, packing, shipping and profitability.\nCliff Holste is Supply Chain Digest's Material Handling editor. Holste recently reported that as a result of e-commerce, multi-channel marketing and on-going sales promotions, distributors are facing sudden increases and decreases in volume which directly impacts on-order fulfillment efficiency and productivity. Greater volatility requires a strong and rapid response capability along with greater operational and staffing flexibility. When demand drops, picking and shipping should be able to throttled back a little, but then be ready to quickly ramp-up again as needed.\nTo better manage these fluctuations, picking systems should be structured so that picking zones can be staffed with one or multiple operators and pick-zone boundaries expanded or contracted to optimize picking efficiency. Picking systems that utilize RF devices, pick-to-light and/or, voice directed technology can easily accommodate flexible zone boundaries and quickly increase or decrease the number of operators in a zone.\nAbout Pcdata USA\nBased in East Granby, CT, Pcdata USA (www.pcdatausa.com/about-us/about-pcdata-usa) is a global logistics systems leader for supply chain automation.
