Photo: Reuters, Beck Diefenbach \nApple launched a huge range of new products yesterday at perhaps the biggest event in the tech giant's history, including one that its late founder swore it would never release. \n“If you see a stylus, they blew it,” Steve Jobs said when he launched the first iPhone in 2007. Last night, Apple launched its Pencil - a new product that looks a lot like a stylus.It was launched as a way of interacting with the iPad Pro, the company's huge new business-focused tablet. \nAs well as the new iPad, Apple showed off the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, a new Apple TV and new accessories for the Apple Watch. \nThe pitch for the iPad Pro relied largely on the success of the existing iPads, the look of which has been heavily borrowed in the new iPad Pro. But the new screen is much bigger – at 12.9in, it is the same size as Apple's MacBooks and almost twice the size of its smaller iPads. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said the Pro was the “biggest news in iPad since the iPad” and the company's vision for the future of personal computing. The price was announced as starting at $799 (R11,000). \nOnstage demonstrations used the extra screen space of the iPad Pro to show apps including those for retouching photos and examining the human body. On the latter, a person was shown using the Apple Pencil to remove and add bits of muscle and bone from a virtual human body, using an app that is intended for medical students. \nThe new tablet was introduced first, and Apple opted to leave its most popular product - the new iPhones, the 6s and 6s Plus - until the end of the event. \nApple's pitch for the new phone - which looks almost identical on the outside to the old iteration save for a new “rose gold” colour option – was based mostly around a pressure-sensitive display and a vastly improved camera. Prices start at £539 for the 6s and £619 for the 6s Plus. \nThe new phones' 3D Touch display allows people to press hard for extra information. It works mostly by bringing up short cuts - so pressing hard on the Maps app would bring up the option to navigate home, for instance, and a deep tap on the Camera icon would bring up the option to go straight into the front- facing camera. \nThe back camera was upgraded to 12 megapixels. And new software enables the creation of “Live Pictures”, where the camera takes moving video before and after the picture, so they can be animated. \nApple also introduced new bands and colours for its Apple Watch. They included gold and rose-gold versions of its aluminium model, to match the colours of the new phone. They were also joined by a new watch created in partnership with the luxury brand Hermès. – The Independent", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T05:57:03.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
