That may change in near future as Facebook at Work -- designed specifically for communicating with colleagues -- comes along.\n\nThe tool has been in beta since January, but the pilot programme is ending, and the company is likely to launch a freemium version of the inter-office network by the end of the year, Re/code reported project head Julien Codorniou as saying.\n\nFacebook has been using a version of Facebook at Work internally for years.\n\nMore than 100 companies are using Facebook at Work as part of the beta. Many of those companies are just now starting to expand the product internally.\n\nHeineken, a leading lager beer company, for example, has been testing the product with just 40 of its top executives, but plans to expand Facebook at Work to all 550 US employees by the end of September.\n\nLinio, a Latin American e-commerce company, is expanding the product internally from 200 to 2,000 employees by the end of the month.\n\nFacebook may cash in on the \"familiarity\". \"If somebody comes into the company, they know how to use this tool from day one. So training cost is zero. That's important,\" Ryan Holmes, CEO of Hootsuite, which is part of the beta group, was quoted as saying.\n\nFacebook will need to convince employers that green-lighting Facebook use among the staff won't result in a loss of productivity.\n\n\"It is unrealistic that organisations try to lock people out of social. It is like telling people that they can't have their own personal phone,\" Holmes noted. Here's what you can earn working at Facebook of 20 Facebook is one of the most widely used websites in the world, which means it takes an army of designers, engineers, managers, and more to make sure everything is running smoothly.\n\nAnd over the past several years, Facebook has grown into more than just a social networking platform. It has dipped its toes into virtual reality, mobile commerce, and more, which is why it's always looking for fresh talent.\n\nUsing data from Glassdoor, we compiled a list of the highest salaries you can earn while working at Facebook, ranked from highest to lowest.\n\n(Note: Some positions listed on Glassdoor were excluded because there weren't enough shared salaries. Each average salary included in this roundup has about 10 reviews. Each salary reflects the base pay without bonuses.) Salary: $166,561\nEngineering managers are tasked with building and managing a team of engineers for a specific product â€” like data analytics of the Facebook platform. They're expected to have a little more problem-solving juice than your typical software engineer. Salary: $160,638\nThese are among the most experienced engineers in the company, so it's no wonder Facebook pays them well. Salary: $157,080\nEngineers with the title 'Software Engineer V' usually need eight to 10 years of experience, according to career site Monster. Salary: $147,469\nProduct managers make everything come together at Facebook. They package a product built from multiple teams and make sure it gets shipped on time. Given the breakneck speed at which Facebook delivers most of its products, these guys are absolutely critical.
