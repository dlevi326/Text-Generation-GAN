This report also forecasts the growth numbers till 2019 (on a YoY basis) and hence suggests the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for the estimated period.\nEurope creating a larger impact on the growth of Enterprise Social Software\nOver the last couple of years the growth for ESS has not been the best in the industry in North America (read it as USA). Market is near saturation even though there are greater potential areas of growth for Enterprise Social Software. In this situation of sales depression within North America, Europe has risen out of the box making eye brows to stretch to the most. ResearchFox believes that Europe could be the “next” revenue pocket for most of the ESS providers. Large enterprises have been using this social platform for increasing productivity, cross-functional interference and knowledge sharing. Just to give a taste of the market adoption within Europe, German engineering major Bosch uses IBM Connections for rigorous business plans, community management and business processes.\nSimilarly, Michelin Group uses BlueKiwi for creating initial communities for co-ordination, leadership, innovation, monitoring, communications and project management. SIKA and Bayer Material Sciences has adopted IBM Connections for training its internal employees, data sharing, establish goals and KPIs. Few others in the industry include Continental AG using IBM Connections and Firmenich using Jive. These aforementioned examples are enough to convince any expert in the industry that the “next go to destination” could be Europe.\nMarket Segments and Forecasts Covered in the Report\nThe Europe Enterprise Social Software market is segmented by:\n- Deployment (On-Premise, Cloud)\n- End users (Enterprise, Mid-size, Small Business)\n- Industry (Financial Services, E-commerce, IT and Telecommunication, Healthcare, Retail, Others)\nCompanies discussed in the Global Enterprise Social Software market research report are IBM, Microsoft, Jive, Salesforce, Zimbra, Mzinga, SAP, Opentext Corp, Socialtext, eXo Platform, EMC, Oracle, Google, Interact Intranet, Alfresco, Infor, Elcom Technology, Autodesk, Sitrion, Spigit (Mindjet).\nTo purchase the full report please call +1-408-469-4380 or mail us at This email address is being protected from spambots.
