My sources tell me it's a bit of a slimy wasteland at the moment. Even though the developers recently introduced a \"Super like\" option. But that's the way of fads.\nNeeding a 'new Tinder' Introducing: Cliick . Another dating app but one promising to match you with prospective dates based on your news consumption!\nIt's currently invite-only, apparently to keep a balanced user-base. But once you're in, you specify what gender you're interested in, an age-range then you're offered a news feed you can interact with. The stories are pulled from Buzzfeed, Business Insider, Upworthy etc - your usual trending content - and you can comment, share and like the stories. The free iOS app has a Facebook log-in requirement so the stories you see are tailored to your Facebook metadata. People that like similar stories on Cliick then come across each other during their swiping and then can start chatting.\nThe Cliick dating app promises to match you with prospective dates based on your news consumption. Cliick Tragically, I didn't actually encounter anyone else on this app; I think everyone is still in San Francisco. But for some reason that hasn't got me down. It only launched last month, and since it's invite only, they're probably still ironing out bugs. But I love the premise of matches made from news interests! Unfortunately, I found most of the trending listicles from Buzzfeed a pain to read, although you can break up your browsing into different categories. An app that could connect me to someone who read say, The Economist, The New Yorker and Vogue would be someone to go out for coffee with though, so hopefully the app begins to get to know me a bit better and more people get on it!\nCliick seems to be a little more genuine than Tinder, which after a while became like playing the pokies. Swipe. Swipe. Swipe. And relied so unashamedly on the aesthetics of someone's profile picture, that meaningful connection found through mutual interests was difficult to pin down.", "external_links": ["http://www.cliickapp.com/", "http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/09/tinders-super-like-says-more-than-a-simple-right-swipe/"], "published": "2015-09-25T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:16:55.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
