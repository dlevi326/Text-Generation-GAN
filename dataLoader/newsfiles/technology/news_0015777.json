This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150908005967/en/ \nSpending on specialty pharmaceuticals is expected to hit 50% of drug costs for commercially insured lives by 2018, up from just 20% in 2009 1 . Within four years, industry estimates suggest that seven out of 10 of the top-selling drugs in the United States will be specialty drugs 2 . Over half of the specialty drugs in the pipeline are high-cost oral medications, which are increasingly developed as substitutes for other treatments, such as injectable drugs used in physician offices, outpatient settings, or infusion centers 3 . \nAmid this rapid industry growth, InterQual Specialty Rx Criteria play a critical role in providing payers and providers a fast and reliable way to determine the medically appropriate use of each new specialty drug. This helps reduce waste on ineffective or unnecessary treatments, and helps improve care quality. \n\"The growing number and cost of specialty drugs is challenging payers and providers alike,\" said Laura Coughlin, RN, BSN, MBA, vice president of clinical development at McKesson Health Solutions. \"Payers need to ensure medically appropriate utilization of healthcare resources, while providers need to keep pace with the latest medical evidence on these breakthrough treatments. With this latest update, McKesson continues to invest significant resources to help healthcare organizations react quickly and appropriately to medical advancements.\" \nNew to the criteria are Harvoni, Sovaldi, and Olysio, new oral drugs to treat Hepatitis C, a condition that attacks the liver and affects an estimated 3.2 million people in the United States . These drugs cost between $66,000 and $94,000 for a 12-week Hepatitis C regimen and $132,000 to $188,000 for a 24-week treatment plan. These oral agents are an alternative to the traditional one-year regimen of drug injections, previously the only option for those with HCV, at a cost of only $900/week but with a10% rate of adverse effects and a 9% rate of discontinuation 4 . \nInterQual Specialty Rx Non-Oncology Criteria gives payers and providers an objective, evidence-based resource that helps them make medically appropriate decisions regarding specialty drug use. Specialty drugs that help treat other conditions such as Crohn's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and 21 other conditions are also covered. \nEach drug added to McKesson's InterQual Specialty Rx Oncology Criteria, including the latest additions Afatinib (Gilotrif) and Vemurafanib (Zelboraf) , incorporates content from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Drugs and Biologics Compendium ® (NCCN), an authoritative reference for oncology coverage policy recognized by public and private insurers, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). McKesson clinical experts incorporate its recommendations for the off-label indications of a particular condition depending on the treatment setting. \nInterQual Specialty Rx Criteria is part of the InterQual 2015 product line , McKesson's flagship decision support solution.
