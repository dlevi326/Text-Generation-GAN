It plans to start assembling smartphones in India through contract manufacturing in three-four months and later expand into full-fledged manufacturing, Sharma said. \n\nPanasonic wants to emulate rival Samsung Electronics, which had more than 70% of its business in India from mobile phones. Panasonic India's smartphone business was Rs 1,800 crore, while the television and home appliances segment was the largest at Rs 4,000 crore in 2014-15. Annual revenue grew 20%. \"The mobile phone market is three times that of consumer electronics and will be the main growth-driver for Panasonic in India and other emerging markets,\" said Sharma. \n\n\"Panasonic's smartphone range will be expanded, will be feature driven and around 15% lower-priced than topline competitive brands.\" Panasonic had exited the smartphone business globally three years ago as part of a strategy to turn around the company. It continued to sell feature phones in Japan and some industry-customised handsets for professional users and subsequently, entered the Indian smartphone market in 2013 to accelerate growth. \n\nThe company recently launched smartphones in Sri Lanka and Nepal and will enter Dubai, Iran and Saudi Arabia next week and South Africa next month. \n\nIn India, Panasonic has garnered a 3%-value share of the smartphone market and is targeting to treble it by next year-end to be among the top four brands.
