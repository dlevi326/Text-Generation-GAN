Azure will also offer customers supercomputing-class performance, with the addition of the NVIDIA Tesla® Accelerated Computing Platform 's flagship Tesla K80 GPU accelerators, for the most computationally demanding data center and high performance computing (HPC) applications. \n\"Our vision is to deliver accelerated graphics and high performance computing to any connected device, regardless of location,\" said Jen-Hsun Huang, co-founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \"We are excited to collaborate with Microsoft Azure to give engineers, designers, content creators, researchers and other professionals the ability to visualize complex, data-intensive designs accurately from anywhere.\" \n\"As a leader in advanced visualization, NVIDIA GPUs were a clear choice for our new N-Series compute family,\" said Jason Zander, corporate vice president at Microsoft Azure. \"NVIDIA and Microsoft have a long history of enabling industry-wide innovation and we look forward to working with them to bring this revolutionary cloud experience to our customers.\" \nUnprecedented Virtualized Graphics Performance With NVIDIA GRID, enterprises can deliver graphics-intensive applications from companies such as Autodesk, Esri and others from the cloud to their users. Announced last month, NVIDIA GRID 2.0 provides the NVIDIA Quadro GPU driver support, features and performance that graphics-intensive applications require, as well as other enhancements including double the application performance of the previous generation of GRID GPUs and Linux OS support. \nSupercomputing in the Cloud The Tesla Accelerated Computing Platform is designed from the ground up for power-efficient, HPC, computational science, supercomputing, data analytics and deep learning applications. \nPowering some of the world's highest performance supercomputers, the Tesla platform delivers dramatically higher performance and energy efficiency than a CPU-only approach and unprecedented application throughput in the data center. \nBy deploying the Tesla K80 GPU accelerator in its N-Series virtual machines, Azure dramatically expands access to supercomputing-class performance, enabling enterprises worldwide to accelerate their most demanding workloads, without requiring them to invest in, build and maintain dedicated computing resources. \nTo Keep Current on NVIDIA GRID: Follow NVIDIA GRID on LinkedIn , Twitter , YouTube , the NVIDIA Blog and NVIDIA GRID Forums . \nAbout NVIDIA Since 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has pioneered the art and science of visual computing . The company's technologies are transforming a world of displays into a world of interactive discovery -- for everyone from gamers to scientists, and consumers to enterprise customers.
