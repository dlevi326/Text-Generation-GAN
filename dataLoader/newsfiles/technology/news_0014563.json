Aston Martin , Cadillac , Lincoln , and McLaren , among others, have said they won’t show new products there this year. Those that do will use it as the vehicle (pun intended) to debut their best work to date.\nThe 2017 Bentley Bentayga. Source: Bentley They’ll also use it to position new products for the rest of the year. Frankfurt falls before the domestic auto shows ( Los Angeles , Detroit , New York ) that begin in mid-November, allowing big names like Bentley and Rolls-Royce to announce news early, maintain any hype they generated over the summer, and preempt North American debuts from competitors.\nKings of Luxury Bentley and Rolls, in fact, lead the pack with arguably the most anticipated models of the year debuting there: the Bentley Bentayga and the Rolls-Royce Dawn . Each had a sneak peek for VIP press at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance but had not yet been shown live to the public.\nSource: Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. The 2017 Rolls-Royce Dawn.\nEach will be iconic in its own right. The Bentayga is the long-awaited W12 SUV that is the fastest, most powerful, and most luxurious SUV in the world. Bentayga will hit 600 horsepower and 663 foot-pounds of torque over its four-wheel-drive, 8-speed automatic transmission. It’ll go to 60 mph in 4 seconds and hit a top speed of 187 mph.\nThe Dawn is Rolls’s brand-new 2+2 V12 rag-top drophead convertible that fronts a massive 563 horsepower with the exquisite wood detailing of a million-dollar yacht. Rolls has yet to announce exact pricing, but expect it to hover over $300,000.\nThe 2017 Ferrari 488 Spider. Source: Ferrari SpA Ferrari , meanwhile, will show off the Spider version of its turbocharged 488 GTB . The open-top exotic will have the same perfected 661-hp, twin-turbocharged, mid-mounted V8 engine as the coupe version but with a retractable roof. The price tag will likely hit $275,000, roughly $30,000 more than the 488 GTB’s base price but about equal to the McLaren 650S Spider .\nLamborghini will offer a Huracan LP 610-4 Spyder. This is the successor to the successful Gallardo LP 560-4 Spyder. It’ll have a soft top, 610-hp V10 engine, and 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.\nSource: BMW The 2017 BMW 7 Series.\nChasing the Numbers Elsewhere, Audi , BMW , and Mercedes-Benz will use Frankfurt to debut multiple models integral to their plans to dominate luxury volumes for 2016.\nAudi will show the E-Tron Quattro Electric Concept and the European-Spec A4, most notably. (That E-Tron SUV will get a record-setting 310 miles on one charge, Audi says.)\nBMW will show the 7 Series, 3 Series, and X1, while sister brand Mini will show the all-new Mini Clubman.\nThe 2017 Porsche 911 Carrera. Source: Porsche Mercedes will show the S-Class Cabriolet, C63 Coupe, and C-Class Coupe; sister brand Smart will debut the 2017 Fortwo Cabrio. They’re each updates to already-existing models, meant to refresh and progress the brand.\nPorsche , similarly, will stick to its core by launching the 2017 911 Carrera. For the first time ever, the car adds rear-axle steering as an option for the Carrera S, significantly enhancing its agility and speed. It’ll also have new headlamps, 20 more horsepower, and improved efficiency over its predecessor. Porsche says it’ll launch next March.\nThe Infiniti Q30 Concept. Source: Infiniti At Infiniti , expect to see the new Q30, its first global concept. The car will look like an elevated hatchback and likely go up against things like the Audi A3, Mercedes CLA, and Lexus NX.\nLexus , on the other hand, will show the LX 570 SUV and various new versions of the GS, including the GS 450h hybrid.\nSUV Race Heats Up Jaguar ’s new F-Pace will likely outshine all of those midlevel-luxury entrants. This is the first-ever SUV for Jaguar and the brand’s major attempt at joining the luxury SUV market that is quickly becoming crowded with offerings from the likes of Aston Martin, Maserati, Lamborghini, Tesla, and Rolls-Royce.\nSource: Jaguar Land Rover The 2017 Jaguar F-Pace.\nNeedless to say, it will be the single most important model Jaguar launches next year, challenging even Bentley&apos;s Bentayga for the Frankfurt SUV spotlight. For now, at least, that may be enough.\nStay tuned for more coverage during the event itself. The show runs Sept. 17–27 in Frankfurt, Germany. Public hours are 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. beginning the 19th.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iqR6rKAubHdo/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iUimaV2swZn0/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/inxsvxuf6rmw/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ispqrK4cVeqQ/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iR0fmIaA0Dhw/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/imJSTCGlSlqs/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://www.iaa.de/en\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ihHMwX8T4qcQ/v1/460x260.jpg\\"], "published": "2015-09-10T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T09:13:38.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
