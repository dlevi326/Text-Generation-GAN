Bella Bond's body was found June 25.\nA composite image of the girl, dubbed Baby Doe during the investigation, had been viewed by millions as authorities tried to identify her. After Boston police received a tip, a search warrant was executed on Thursday at the apartment of her mother, Rachelle Bond.\nAmoroso says Bond told him her boyfriend, Michael McCarthy, fatally injured Bella, and that she died weeks before her body was found in a trash bag washed up on the beach. Amoroso said Bond told him that McCarthy kept reminding her afterward that Bella was a \"child of Satan\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:09:22.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
