One of the first to deploy the Illumina HiSeq X Ten sequencing platform, a system that produces up to 5 terabyte (TB) of data per day, Garvan is using five Panasas ActiveStor ® appliances with a storage capacity of 400TB to drive faster delivery of results to researchers around the world. \nTo run the Illumina system at full capacity, Garvan needed to make changes to the existing infrastructure, most notably, implementing parallel processing. Garvan opted for Panasas storage with the PanFS ® parallel file system to provide its researchers with a high-performance storage solution able to deliver the fast data access needed to support the rapid prototyping and evaluation of specific analyses required for genomic sequencing. The Illumina sequencers combined with Panasas high-performance storage have increased Garvan’s sequencing capacity to 50 genomes per day on average - a fiftyfold improvement. \n“Fundamental to our work is maintaining an extraordinary infrastructure that makes it all possible and Panasas is a key part of that,” said Dr. Warren Kaplan, chief of informatics at Garvan. “Panasas lives up to its promise of terrific performance with negligible maintenance and administration time. In addition, our sequencing data stays in the central repository throughout the analysis which makes for a more streamlined workflow, saving time and bandwidth.” \nActiveStor is a fully integrated solution consisting of hybrid storage hardware, file system and protocols, combined with triple parity protection. With ActiveStor, performance and data protection increase with scale to accelerate time-to-results for even the most demanding high-performance workloads. 8TB drive technology supports scalability to more than 20 petabytes (PB) and 200 gigabytes per second (GB/s), while RAID 6+ triple parity protection with per-file distributed software based on erasure codes provides a 150-fold increase in reliability over dual-parity approaches. Its enterprise-grade reliability and ease of installation and management further set ActiveStor apart. \n“Having Garvan choose Panasas storage to support their important research is truly a privilege,” said Geoffrey Noer, vice president of product management at Panasas, Inc. “Garvan needed a storage solution whose installation would not disrupt ongoing research, that could handle one of the most powerful sequencing platforms ever created, and that would boost the productivity of a research staff that grew from 10 to 80 people. We delivered a system that, once racked, was up and running on the same day, easily integrated into the Illumina HiSeq X Ten, and provided a workflow that increased performance and data throughput.” \nMore information on the Garvan Institute of Medical Research can be found at http://www.garvan.org.au .
