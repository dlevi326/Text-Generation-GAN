Alibaba said on Tuesday that it expected second-quarter gross merchandise volume – a key metric watched by investors – to be lower than initial estimates due to weaker consumer spending in China.\nAlibaba has been also focusing on other parts of its business such as its cloud arm called Aliyun and its other diversified investments include taxi app Uber's China rival, Didi Kuaidi . The e-commerce giant has also poured $4.63 billion into Chinese bricks-and-mortar electronics retailer Suning as it looks to link its online presence to physical stores.\nSport has been a big area of focus for Chinese Internet companies, particularly as U.S. and U.K. basketball and soccer leagues look to expand into Asia. Alibaba has recently struck deals with Spanish and German soccer teams Real Madrid and Bayern Munich to sell merchandise through its e-commerce site. Rival Tencent signed a deal at the beginning of the year that gave it the exclusive rights to stream National Basketball Association (NBA) games for users in China.\nAlibaba Sports group will be majority-owned by Alibaba Group with CEO Daniel Zhang also serving as chairman of the new business. The Alibaba Sports Group was created with Sina Corporation and Yunfeng Capital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T14:33:31.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
