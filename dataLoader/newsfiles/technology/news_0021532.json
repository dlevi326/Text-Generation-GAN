The company has introduced the new gen Moto 360 featuring two sizes including 46mm and 42mm, and the Moto 360 Sports that has GPS support and is available in the 42mm size. \nThe new Motorola Moto 360 features a refreshed case design with more lugs for improved fit. It looks identical to its predecessor though it does bring some design differences from the original model. The new wearable comes with tweaked physical button placement, and has more customization options via Moto Maker, which works similar to the Moto X range of smartphones. As expected, this time the company has also launched a slightly smaller, 42mm size, variant of the watch for smaller hands. \nThe new Moto 360 comes in two screen sizes, including 1.37-inch with 360 x 325 pixel resolution, and 263ppi, and a 1.56-inch variant with 360x330 pixel resolution and 233ppi. It is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor clocked at 1.2GHz, paired with Adreno 306 450MHz GPU. It has 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage. \nThe 42mm variant comes with 300mAh battery that can run up to 1.5 days of mixed use with Ambient off, while the 46mm model comes with 400mAh battery and can last up to 2 days with ambient off. Both the models support Bluetooth 4.0 LE and Wi-FI 802.11 b/g. \nOther features include sensors such as accelerometer, ambient light sensor, gyroscope, and vibration. There also is an optical heart rate monitor in the new gen smartwatch. \nThe Moto 360 Sports, as its name suggests, is a fitness-focused wearable device with built-in GPS support. This Android Wear smartwatch is loaded with an interesting set of features including a unibody plastic design that can absorb sweat, thanks to its IP67 rating that makes it dust and water proof. The wearable can play music without a smartphone, and features a hybrid display that offers clear views even under the sunlight. It is available in white, blacks and orange colour variants. \nAs for price and availability, the new Moto 360 has been priced starting from $299 (approximately Rs. 19,800), going up to $429 (approximately Rs. 28,400). The price depends on the size of case and type of band. The new gen Moto 360 smartwatch will go on pre-order on Wednesday in the US and will start shipping later this month. The global launch of the smartwatch is expected to happen soon after the US launch. \nAs far as Moto 360 Sport is concerned, the company has not announced pricing and availability details of the wearable.
