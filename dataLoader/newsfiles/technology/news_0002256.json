Judges will include professional game developers, event sponsors and a select group of young gamers. \nThe three highest scoring teams and the teams with the highest individual scores in each category will receive trophies and prizes such as licenses to game production software. \nThe team at the Learning Interactive Visualization Experience Lab created the game jam to encourage game developers to learn and have fun. \"Game Jams are a way for game designers, artists, programmers and enthusiasts to learn more about games and game production, explore new ideas or concepts, or just have a blast making games,\" said Andr√© Thomas, a lecturer in the Department of Visualization at Texas A&M, in a prepared statement. \nFurther information about this year's Texas A&M game jam can be found on the Chillennium site .
