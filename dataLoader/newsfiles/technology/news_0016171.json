So far the El Nino is the third strongest on record, behind 1997-98 and a weird one in 1987-88 that peaked early.\nMeteorologists said strong El Ninos usually dump heavy rains on southern California, but its four-year water deficit is too big to be erased in one wet winter.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
