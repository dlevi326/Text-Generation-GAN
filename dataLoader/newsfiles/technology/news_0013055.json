The baby was swimming with its mother, a 20-year-old orca named L91 that's part of the Puget Sound's L-pod.\nThe researchers were measuring the whales from the air when they spotted the pair near Sooke, British Columbia.\nThe mother and calf spent most of Monday \"fishing\" in Haro Strait, just west of San Juan Island, and were later joined by members of the J- and K-pods.\nResearchers say they hope this year's \"baby boom\" represents a turnaround in what has been a negative population trend in recent years.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:14:08.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
