This will showcase blogs, publications, YouTube feeds, and Google News alerts you want to showcase and make it easy for others to follow the same sources. You’ll get a personalized URL for your Shared Collections page.\n“Take that Shared Collections page and use it to collaborate with others or to show the world what feeds your mind. You can even customize it to fit your company’s identity or your personal brand,” Feedly says in a blog post .\nFeedly suggests businesses use Shared Collections for the following scenarios: help your organization all follow the same publications, blogs, YouTube feeds, and Google Alerts; lead your industry by curating and sharing a rich list of must-follow reads; help your teammates and peers find the best content sources to do their jobs; make it easy to promote your company or agency’s thought leadership by putting employee blogs/social media into one branded page; and organize your social media curation efforts by getting your team organized with the same sources.\nYou can find a tutorial on using the feature here .\nImage via Feedly", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHWlCYZhoFk", "http://blog.feedly.com/2015/09/01/tips-to-make-most-of-shared-collections/", "http://blog.feedly.com/2015/09/01/launching-shared-collections/"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:30:11.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
