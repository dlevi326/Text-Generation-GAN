The partnership provides Reltio users with the ability to cross-reference and create HCP lists across any number of attributes and criteria, provided by DMD, using simple point-and-click navigation within Reltio Cloud. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150930/272245 \n\"By making DMD's data and services accessible to Reltio Cloud customers, we are changing the way marketers can segment and target HCPs,\" said DMD President Roger Korman, Ph.D., a healthcare data management expert with more than three decades of experience in the field. \"We are saving marketing professionals time and money, while enabling stronger results.\" \nReduced in-person access to HCPs with an increased focus in multichannel marketing strategies demands accuracy of data used to create segmented customer targets. Many marketers are drawn to visualization tools for predictive analytics, but these tools are ineffective if users are operating on a foundation of unreliable data. Prior to Reltio Cloud, marketers' options were limited to heavyweight processes, like traditional master data management tools that require already-taxed IT resources, or outsourced one-time-only lists without repeatability or collaboration across other groups such as sales. \n\"There's a metamorphosis occurring in life sciences marketing. Marketing professionals who have been frustrated by the lack of trustworthiness and timeliness of their HCP data now have a way to bring together data previously cocooned in disparate applications and combine it with high quality data provided by DMD,\" said Reltio CEO Manish Sood. \"Multichannel marketing initiatives can now be executed with ease and confidence, knowing they have the best HCP email addresses available.\" \nDMD joins the growing number of life sciences industry data partners in the \" Delivered by Reltio \" program. Existing partners include DarkMatter2BD, LexisNexis Enclarity, LexisNexis HMS, and MedPro Systems. Reltio also provides access to numerous public data sources, such as NPESS, PubMed, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Open Payments transactions, through Reltio DaaS (Data-as-a-Service) built into every single Reltio data-driven application. \nReltio and DMD will both be exhibiting at ExL's Digital Pharma East conference in Philadelphia, PA, from September 30 to October 1. In conjunction with the event, Reltio will be releasing a white paper entitled \" How Data-driven Applications Will Transform Multichannel and Patient Centric Marketing .\" \nSocial Networks - follow Reltio on: -- Twitter: @Reltio -- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/reltio-inc -- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ReltioHub \nAbout Reltio \nReltio delivers reliable data, relevant insights and recommended actions so companies can be right faster.
