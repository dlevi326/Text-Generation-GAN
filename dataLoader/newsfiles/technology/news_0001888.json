This “moneyball” approach has been described as disruptive to the industry, changing how enterprises approach the outsourcing of application development work. With this name change, Catalyst is also branding its core big data technology, the Catalyst Talent Platform, for licensing by qualified clients as a hosted service, bringing this same disruptive technology directly to clients, helping them transform the way they make full-time engineering hires.\n“CIOs and technology organizations are constantly struggling to respond effectively to business demands for innovation,” said Catalyst DevWorks CEO, Michael Rosenbaum. “For nearly 15 years, Catalyst has been using our technology to assemble engineering teams, giving our clients a simple way of using our platform and disintermediating our technology from the customer. As we announce our name change, we are also announcing more broadly our second solution, one that provides clients with predictive analytics, supported by machine learning, for identifying individual engineers and engineering teams who are most likely to be exceptional performers in a client’s specific environment.”\nThrough both its engineering services with teams assembled by the technology and the direct licensing of the Catalyst Talent Platform, Catalyst is expanding the engineering talent pool, accelerating talent acquisition, dramatically increasing productivity, and giving technology leaders the ability to partner more effectively with a range of peers and other constituencies inside the enterprise.\n“The term DevWorks reflects our disruptive approach to assembling software engineering teams by applying predictive analytics to software engineers and engineering teams, giving us and our clients the ability to optimize for engineering and business outcomes,” said Rosenbaum. “Today, we reinforce our commitment to helping enterprises develop and deploy technology innovation.”\nAbout Catalyst DevWorks\nCatalyst DevWorks provides rapid response software engineering capabilities for innovation and product development, as well as a technology platform that enables the use of predictive analytics and machine learning for full time engineering hires. Catalyst is an innovator in applying big data to team assembly in order to ramp capacity rapidly and transform productivity and quality, delivering better results, faster, at costs equivalent to or less than traditional full time hiring or global outsourcing.
