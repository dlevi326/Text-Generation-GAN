The new tools are the result of years of continuous experimentation and close partnership between SpotMe and ESOT. “The focus for ESOT is always on the delegate, we try to interpret what he/she would like to see and experience at our event, and deliver something new each time. The Content Advisor will help us to ‘tailor-make’ a program for the next congress, based on participants’ interest. The ePoster ‘speed dating’ system is both an approach to gamification and a way to stimulate the interaction among the attendees.\"\nAnnalisa Ponchia, Executive Officer, ESOT\n\"We are taking a step further with the All-ESOT digital platform we first launched in Vienna, 2013. Our new built-in content system individualizes content based on delegates' interests, making for a more meaningful and fun conference.\"\nStefan Schneeberger, MD, MBA, Treasurer, ESOT\nMedical association congresses represent a challenging, data-rich environment. ESOT 2015 alone features over 1600 abstracts, 200 faculty and 1000 presenters, including 600 posters, which the delegates have to navigate over just four days (13–16 Sep). The Content Advisor analyzes a delegate's in-app interests and activities to recommend relevant content. It is a convenient launch pad for new users, prevents data overload and facilitates effortless and serendipitous discovery.\nThe ePoster Lounge brings an all-important networking element to congress poster presentations. Through the App, attendees can search through all of the ESOT 2015 posters and request a presentation with the author. Fifteen-minute slots are allocated for the requested presentations and a live display screen shows all immediate and upcoming presentation starting times.\n\"Our collaboration with ESOT has provided the crucial insights we need to develop new tools, improve our technology and deliver the transformative mobile event solutions we are so proud of.\"\nDaniel Lotyczuk, Programme Manager for Associations, SpotMe\nWith these latest updates, and more in the pipeline, SpotMe and its partners continue to transform the medical association congress mobile experience for both delegates and organizers.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvdG1lLmNvbS9hYm91dC8=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvdG1lLmNvbS9tZWRpY2FsLWFzc29jaWF0aW9ucy8=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lc290Lm9yZy8=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g/dj1fN1N5Ny1JdjZqRQ=="], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T10:59:27.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
