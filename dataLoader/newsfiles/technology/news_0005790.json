Submarines routinely travel under the Arctic icepack and sometimes surface at the Pole. \nThe Healy is 420-feet (128-meters) long and weighs 16,000 tons. Its 30,000-horsepower engine is capable of breaking over 10 feet (three meters) of ice. \nThe ship's crew and passengers comprised 145 people including scientists who are studying the geochemistry of the world's oceans. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T17:55:30.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
