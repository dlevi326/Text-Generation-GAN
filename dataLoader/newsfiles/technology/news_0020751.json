At their best, they pay dividends for decades and bounce around a bit less when the markets convulse, as they have over the last week. For years, AT&T was the textbook example. Procter & Gamble was another.\nBut it is rare to meet actual orphans with stock portfolios, let alone ones who have hung on to their investments for nearly half a century.\nAfter Barnaby Dinges lost his father at age 7 and his mother at 9, a stranger, Sanford Kovitz, volunteered to keep an eye on his money. A young father himself, Kovitz had heard about the situation and thought he could help.\nNearly 50 years later, the two are still at it, having shepherded Dinges’ portfolio through private school, college, parenthood, divorce and assorted hiccups and triumphs along the way. They bought here and sold there, but mostly they held, not just on to certain stocks but to an old-fashioned idea — that a very long-term relationship with an adviser looking out for your best interests can pay returns for both parties.\nTheir buddy act began in 1968. Dinges’ father, an ad man, had died two years earlier from leukemia; his mother, a fact-checker for Playboy magazine, died that year from cardiac arrest during surgery for an ulcer. Dinges and his older brother, Casey, had no living grandparents and no immediate family who could take them in.\nFor the first few weeks after their mother’s death, different adults came to their apartment to spend the night and keep an eye on the boys. Often, the brothers had never met them. “All these young women,” Barnaby recalled. “They could have been Playboy bunnies. I have no idea who they were.”\nFortunately, life insurance proceeds formed the bulk of an inheritance. Some of it (plus the boys’ Social Security checks) went to pay for living expenses and covering home renovations for the family that eventually took them in. But there was roughly $100,000, and someone needed to step in to try to make it last long enough to keep the boys at their private school and perhaps pay for college.\nKovitz was a lawyer and trust officer on LaSalle Street, the Wall Street of Chicago. He received a call from a fellow lawyer about the boys, and a meeting ensued.\nThis was the first time that Kovitz had pre-teenagers for clients, and he set about explaining things to them in plain English. “We set out to nurse these funds,” he said. “I knew we had to be careful, because there was a long way to go to get them to some kind of adulthood where they could fend for themselves.”\nSoon, the boys were learning about buying investments in blue-chip companies and holding them for a long time.\n“Let quality management of companies in different industries do the job for you,” Kovitz said, outlining the rest of the bullet points that he still puts to use. “If you don’t try to make your fortune overnight and are patient, my experience has been that you will do OK.”\nAs the pair near the 50th anniversary of their working relationship, Kovitz is slowing down a bit. He does not take on new clients and is making noises about handing over his current ones to his son and his firm within a year or two. “But if I’m healthy,” he said, “I may go a lot more years now.”\nWhich would be fine by Dinges, who feels grateful for having such steady financial counsel. “When I talk to friends, it’s always a one-off, where they found this specialist and did this thing,” he said. “But I’ve always felt like I got exactly what I ever needed out of a Sandy Kovitz conversation.”\nRon Lieber,\nThe New York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:01:06.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
