So, coming to a public forum and declaring your freedom and right to believe whatever you may choose to believe is great if it makes you happy. But, I hope it is not just empty reactionary self-defense. They issue on matters of belief, particularly with regards to god, is not so much whether you believe or not; but whether what you believe is true – do you have reasons to believe in god? If one believes something without some strong rational considerations of its truth then that cannot be rightly called a belief because the notion of belief implies truth. Think about it –it appears strange to believe something if you did not necessarily think it is true. To say that you believe in something implies that you think/feel it is true.\nI hope that our beliefs are not based merely on our feelings about things – I sincerely hope that they do not have a cognitive element. So, it is possible for someone to truly believe that a black mamba is not poisonous. To refer to this person as ‘truly believing’ it is to say that they are genuine in the activity of believing. This activity of truly believing reports something about the believer, the quality of their belief, that it is genuine; but it says nothing about the truth (scientific or empirical) about the black mamba and whether it is poisonous or not. If the mamba in question so happens to be venomous, not matter how genuine the belief, the venom will conduce to death in spite of one’s belief. Whilst we should value people who are genuine in their belief, we do however require another element to complete the puzzle.\nWe also require a person to believe truly. Here we envisage a causal relationship between belief and truth where some truth informs a person’s belief. It is not that a person first believes and then looks for the truth to support their belief; it is that the truth becomes a platform for a person to believe. We may have no reason to respect you as one that truly believes, but to acknowledge your belief; but, as a person who believes truly we may find ourselves forced to ask: but, why do you believe that God exists. And one plausible answer cannot be that you just find yourself believing – this will surely be a logical fallacy. So, anyone who is in the business of believing must patiently and fairly wait for the questions that seek some demonstration or evidence for one’s belief, If no such evidence may not be provided then we can simply say – ‘ you truly believe in X, but not a believer in X’.\nOne can here respond and argue that truth in some important way is independent of a mind. The fact that there is a tree falling in Soweto right now has nothing to do with whether I believe it or not – this truth is mind independent. The truth that there is a falling tree is true because it is the way the world is. So, my failure to give evidence for the existence of god does not mean that he does not exist.\nFair enough, but this argument works in a philosophy class; but it is not a defense for a believer in God. Suppose one in Port Elizabeth comes to believe that a tree is falling in Soweto and that belief so happens to be true. Would the act of asking such a person why does he believe that a tree is falling in Soweto be meaningful? I think it is. We would be asking for the content of what informs his belief i.e. in virtue of what is it true for him ? We will be asking whether he is justified in believing that a tree is falling in Soweto. If one cannot give reasons why they believe that a tree is falling in Soweto, it would amount to the position that he has no business in claiming to be a true believer because the falling of a tree is not true to him but true in the world. In other words, his belief is not directly informed by the truth itself (no causal relation between truth and belief) or it is not connected to the truth in an interesting way. Even if there was no tree that had not fallen he is no position to tell or distinguish such a possibility. We will discuss in the future a relationship between belief, truth and luck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:05:11.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
