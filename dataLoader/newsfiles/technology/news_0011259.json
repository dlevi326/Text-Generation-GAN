Cedexis’ video solution has been referred to by several early-adopter customers as the “Buffer Killer,” and indeed, that is what it does. On average, Cedexis video customers have experienced a 45% improvement in buffering; 18% improvement in video start-time; and a decrease in video failures of up to 44%. A study by TubeMogul states “4 out of 5 people will leave a video if it pauses to buffer.”\nCedexis customers, such as recently added ViewLift – the over-the-top (OTT) technology hub for SnagFilms, Funny for Free, and other popular OTT sites – take a best-of-breed approach to delivering video with high QoS for ever more demanding end users.\n“Video performance is key to user retention. We use Cedexis Openmix to ensure our users are directed to the best-performing infrastructure in real time, every time,” said Manik Bambha, Chief Digital Officer and CTO at ViewLift. “We’ve seen a 65% decrease in buffering incidents since deploying Cedexis Openmix. These QoS improvements deliver better quality to the end user, resulting in incredibly low viewer-abandonment rates.”\nPBS, another great customer, has this to say about their experience using Cedexis for their video deployment: \"For PBS Digital, having 100% uptime and great performing video is critical. We implemented Cedexis specifically to improve our Video Quality of Service and it’s been a great decision,” said Mike Norton, Senior Director of Technical Operations at PBS Digital.\nCritical to this solution is the real-time performance monitoring provided by the free Cedexis Radar community of 800+ enterprises and every major Cloud and CDN provider in the world. Collecting billions of Internet performance metrics a day provides a real-time map of where the Internet is humming along nicely, and where interconnections between ISPs and cloud service providers, who host and distribute the world’s content, are congested or disrupted.\nAs video encoding moves from 720p to 1080p and now 4K, the demands on Internet Service Providers, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Data Center/Cloud provider networks can become significant bottlenecks that interrupt the seamless delivery of high-resolution content. Cedexis customers have embraced a strategy of using multiple CDNs and/or cloud providers to avoid single points of failure or congestion. These strategies are commonly referred to as “Multi-CDN” or “Hybrid-CDN” architectures and bring together the best that each partner has to offer through real-time, data-driven, global traffic management between the public providers or private data centers.\n“With video representing two thirds of Internet traffic today and growing, it is clear that new strategies are needed to deliver the quality of experience end users have become used to from broadcast TV services. Delivering a world-class video experience over the shared Internet requires a depth of Internet performance visibility and real-time, data-driven traffic management that only Cedexis brings together,” said Robert Malnati, VP of Marketing & Business Development at Cedexis.\nCedexis customers can now easily benefit from the unique insight provided by the Cedexis Radar real-user Internet performance monitoring community, by having their video player client software – be it from a website, mobile app, smart TV or connected gaming console – “talk” directly to the Cedexis global platform. Alternatively, enterprises can connect their Content Management Systems (CMS) to Cedexis’ platform to make them aware of Internet traffic conditions and outages.\nCedexis’ expertise in Internet video delivery is being well recognized by leading industry associations in both the US and EU.\nStreaming Media 100 most influential OTT Video solution award Online Video Trophy NETINEO award Standards body participant of the Streaming Video Alliance\nLearn more about the Cedexis Buffer Killer solution for streaming OTT video .\nAbout Cedexis\nCedexis provides Web-scale, end-user-experience monitoring and real-time traffic routing across multiple clouds and networks.
