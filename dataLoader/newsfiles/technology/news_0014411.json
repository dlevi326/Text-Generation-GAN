The others named were Harvey Mudd in Claremont, CA , University of Maryland-College Park , and Bismark State College in North Dakota . \n\"We are excited to be viewed as an exemplar in such distinguished company,\" said Norbert J. Kubilus , Interim President amp; CEO. \" Coleman University has a terrific team of faculty and staff with a 'student first' attitude and a passion for preparing our graduates to be leaders in their careers and communities. This is terrific recognition of their dedication and very encouraging as we prepare for our regional accreditation visit in October.\" \nAccording to the White House, the College Scorecard is different from other college lists in that it includes how much graduates earn after attending the school as well as the average monthly loan payment for those who borrowed to pay for their education. It also breaks down how much the college will actually cost depending on the scholarships and grants available and the student's family income bracket. \nAbout Coleman University Coleman University is a private non-profit teaching university founded in 1963 and located in San Diego , California.
