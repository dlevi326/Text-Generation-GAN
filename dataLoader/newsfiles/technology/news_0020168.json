As jurors were filing out of the courtroom later, he told them: \"You probably won't sleep tonight.\"\nThe judge reminded Miller that the same jury will decide his sentence. He could get the death penalty. The sentencing proceedings were expected to begin on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T12:02:37.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
