Existing investors Accel Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and the Social + Capital Partnership also participated in the round. The new capital will be used to expand sales, marketing, customer success, engineering and research operations worldwide. The new round brings Netskope's total amount of funding raised to more than $130 million. \n\"This is a pivotal moment for the industry, and further validation that ensuring secure usage of cloud services is one of the single greatest concerns for CIOs and CISOs today,\" said Sanjay Beri, co-founder and CEO, Netskope. \"We founded Netskope on the premise that rapid development and adoption of cloud apps and services would bring about a new security conundrum for IT that simply couldn't be addressed by existing tools built for on-premises apps or generic websites. Instead, a new innovative solution that brought real-time actionable context and security to the world of cloud apps powered by APIs was clearly needed. The explosive growth we're experiencing is evidence that organizations need a solution that enables them to mitigate risk, prevent data loss, and govern usage in cloud apps beyond simply 'allowing' or 'blocking' the apps. We're delighted that Iconiq has joined our team, and this investment will fuel our continuing efforts to help our customers safely migrate to and leverage the cloud.\" \nIn the past year, Netskope has grown its customer base by 500%, resulting in over 600% increase in revenue.
