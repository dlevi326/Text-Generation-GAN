The Allied Telesis Secure Enterprise SDN Solution takes the underlying SDN technology built into many Allied Telesis products, and combines it with applications from partner vendors. This creates a comprehensive solution that can solve the challenges experienced by Enterprise organizations today. \nLast year, the Company was awarded for its innovative network management tool, Allied Telesis Management Framework™ (AMF). AMF is a framework, or architecture, that provides a simplified approach to network management. AMF automates many common network tasks, freeing up valuable IT resources and leading to an overall reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). \nThis year’s award-winning Secure Enterprise SDN Solution represents yet another commitment by Allied Telesis to delivering innovations that bring proven benefits to customers in the Enterprise networking sector. The Company is considerably ahead of other vendors in bringing a truly commercial SDN solution to the Enterprise market. \nThe competition jury was impressed by the capabilities of the Secure Enterprise SDN Solution, as well as the forward-looking business architecture that underlies it. They awarded it first place in the “Future IT” category, ahead of entries from other well-known international organizations, thus demonstrating the leadership Allied Telesis is taking when it comes to SDN. \nMr. Seiichiro Sato, Global Product Marketing Director at Allied Telesis, said, “Network management is an area where many organizations face challenges. Being awarded, not once but twice, for our technologies that assist with network management and orchestration, really highlights the fact that Allied Telesis is a genuine innovator and leader in this arena.” \nAllied Telesis is a member of the Open Network Foundation (ONF), a user-driven organization that is dedicated to the promotion and adoption of SDN via the development of open standards. \nFor further information about the Allied Telesis Secure Enterprise SDN Solution, or to learn more about how Allied Telesis can assist your organization, please visit alliedtelesis.com or contact your local Allied Telesis representative. \nAbout the iCMG Architecture Awards of Excellence \niCMG is a leading full-service Enterprise & IT Architecture firm, and a pioneer in its field.
