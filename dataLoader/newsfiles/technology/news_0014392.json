Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner and Secretary of Education Beth Purvis will be on hand to speak on the importance of math education for the state’s children as they officially open the Math Fair, for which Mayor Rahm Emanuel is serving as honorary chair.\n“The jobs of the 21st century require numeracy skills more than at any time in history. We need Illinois children to get excited and interested in math and science,” said Purvis. “The Math Fair will help students recognize the 'magic' in math and hopefully begin an interest in learning how to apply math skills in fun and interesting ways.” ( Read more .)\n“The City of Chicago is committed to providing our children with access to opportunities that will allow them to become lifelong learners, both inside and outside of the classroom,” said Mayor Emanuel. “The Math Fair will give thousands of children and their families across the city the chance to access fun activities that will keep our students engaged while they foster 21st century learning skills.”\n“We are thrilled to bring this innovative and inspiring event to Chicago to engage children and families in math,” said Phyllis Lockett, CEO of LEAP Innovations. “This fall, LEAP will pilot math innovations in schools across Chicago, reaching more than 1,200 students. We’re committed to making sure all students have access to the 21st century skills they need, and math is fundamental.”\nThe preview will feature the unveiling of the touring fair’s newest exhibit, South of the Sahara, which celebrates the mathematical developments of early African civilizations. The exhibit invites visitors to explore logarithmic weaving, fractal geometry and ancient uses of binary numbers while discovering how math permeated the Sub-Saharan cultures through arts, games, home design and weaving.\nThe Math Fair’s presenting sponsor, CME Foundation Group, is joined by sponsors IMC Financial Markets and the Chicago Sun-Times.\nWhen: Saturday, September 26, 2015\n Math Fair VIP Preview: 9 a.m.\n Ribbon cutting & remarks: 9:40 a.m.\n Math Fair open to the public: 10 a.m.-6 p.m.\nWhere: Navy Pier, Exhibit Hall B. | Media RSVP to cbyrd(at)mindresearch(dot)org for press credentials.\nWho: Confirmed speakers include:\nBruce Rauner, Illinois Governor Beth Purvis, Illinois Secretary of Education Phyllis Lockett, CEO of LEAP Innovations Matthew Peterson, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of MIND Research Institute\nAbout Leap Innovations\nLEAP Innovations is a Chicago-based nonprofit that bridges the gap between education and innovation for teachers and students from pre-K through college.
