Initial plans set the official presentation for November, but now proceedings have been expedited. \nChoosing an exhibition in its home country carries some symbolic value, as the German company was first introduced to the world at the 1923 International Automobile and Motorcycle Exhibition in Berlin. \nA second announcement from Horex will certainly come as a relief for the owners of the original VR6 Roadster and Classic models sold from 2012 until 2014. The company reports that as of early August the first spare part kits have been available to order. There are three different kits on offer so far (those interested should refer to Horex or its retailers’ network for more information). Parts that are not included in these kits will be dealt with as \"exceptional cases,\" giving highest priority to those customers whose motorcycles cannot operate without the missing spares. \nCustomers have been without comprehensive after sales service since December 2014, when the company filed for bankruptcy and laid off its staff. Thankfully things appear to be gradually returning to normal. \nStay tuned to Gizmag for the Horex VR6 world premiere and every other new model launch from the Frankfurt Motor Show in a couple of weeks’ time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T04:52:27.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
