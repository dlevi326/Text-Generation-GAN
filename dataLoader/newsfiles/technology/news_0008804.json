Under the terms of the offer, the Vista would acquire Solera in a transaction valued at approximately $6.5 billion . Pursuant to the deal, Solera stockholders would receive $55.85 in cash per share owned. The offer price represents a scant 12.9% premium based on the closing price of Solera stock on September 11, 2015 and Solera stock traded as high as $56.14 as recently as March 2015. Our investigation concerns whether the Solera board of directors is fulfilling its fiduciary duties, maximizing the value of the Company, disclosing all material benefits and costs, and obtaining full and fair consideration for Company stockholders.
