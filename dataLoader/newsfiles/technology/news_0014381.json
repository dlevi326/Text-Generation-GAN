New research from the University of Leeds says it may actually be good for your health. A study published Wednesday in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine , found no increased risk of mortality from longer sitting times in women who considered themselves moderately or very fidgety. \nThe team, co-led by Janet Cade, professor at the School of Food Science and Nutrition at the University of Leeds, reports that women who assessed themselves as very occasional fidgeters saw an increased risk of death from sitting for long periods. Specifically, the study found those who sat for more than seven hours a day saw a 30 percent increase in all-cause mortality risk if they were in the low fidgeting group. \nResearchers studied data from the University of Leeds UK Women’s Cohort Study, which gathered information on eating patterns of more than 35,000 women in the UK, aged 35 to 69. \nThe new study examined nearly 13,000 responses to a follow-up survey sent to the same women, which included questions about fidgeting, physical activity levels, and chronic disease. Researchers tracked mortality over an average of 12 years. \n“While further research is needed, the findings raise questions about whether the negative associations with fidgeting, such as rudeness or lack of concentration, should persist if such simple movements are beneficial for our health,” Cade said.
