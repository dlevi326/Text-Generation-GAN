(Photo: 9to5Mac)\n1 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE LOS ANGELES — Siri, do you want another device in the living room?\nThe voice-command feature from the iPhone, first introduced in 2011, is expected to join the Apple TV set-top entertainment box when the company unveils its latest and greatest Wednesday at a press event in San Francisco.\nVoice-activated searching for entertainment via Siri, along with a revamped remote control aimed at gamers are the key new features expected to entice consumers. Additionally, software developers will be urged to adapt and create apps for the TV, similar to iTunes, via Apple TV.\nThe revamped Apple TV, slightly larger and thicker, is expected to get a price boost to $175, from it’s current $69, according to Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray.\nLong described as a “hobby,” for Apple, the Apple TV set-top entertainment box launched in 2007 — the same year as that new device that went on to change the world — the iPhone.\nIPhone sales to date: over 700 million units.\nApple TV: 25 million.\nFor a company of Apple’s size, “25 million units sold in 8 years is a failure,” said Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey. “For anyone else, it would be a huge success.”\nThe Apple TV box has not been refreshed since 2012. And while Apple’s figure covers an 8 year span for sales, McQuivey said he believes Apple TV’s best years are behind it, as it’s been overtaken by more advanced boxes from Roku and Amazon.\nAn August study from Parks Associates put Roku in first place, with 34% market share for 2014, followed by Google’s Chromecast, Amazon and then Apple.\nUSA TODAY\nApple S iPhones through the years\nWhat Apple wanted to do, which would have changed the market, was to announce Wednesday a new mini-network offering of cutting the cord channels consumers could get with Apple TV in lieu of cable, McQuivey said.\n“They haven’t been able to lock down the rights,” he added. “Apple’s been trying since 2009.”\nApple invite (Photo: Apple)\nBeyond the gaming, and easier navigation with voice, analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies said the big potential with Apple TV is opening it up to the 300,000 software developers who make apps for the iPhone and iPad.\n“Apple TV will have a radical new user interface and radical new remote,” he said. “But now it becomes a platform.\"\nBajarin can imagine an app that brings in a 3-D model of a product after an ad has run on TV, or an entire new look to Facebook or instant messaging, for a 60-inch screen instead of a 4-5 inch one.\nAnd despite Siri being more of a joke for folks who laugh at things the computer got wrong, Munster still believes Siri and voice-activated communication has a big future — but down the road. Inputting text is “slow, and voice is a faster way to interact,” he said.\nSiri going mass market “won’t be overnight,” he added. “It’s more like five years away. But Siri and others like it will become the most common way we interact with devices.’\nReaders: when’s the last time you used Siri? Let’s chat about it on Twitter, where I’m @jeffersongraham .
