The output of solar panels and the capacity of storage batteries can be selected from 10 patterns of combinations. \nResponding to the increasing needs for self-consumption systems intended for small offices, this spring, the company commercialized \"Power Set Industrial.\" Solar panel output is limited to two patterns of units – 21kW and 33kW – to enhance the cost performance of systems. \n\"If the two types of units are combined, it will be possible to respond to the needs for more than 100kW,\" Gakumazawa said. \"They are more popular than we had expected because the product comes in two patterns and are simple.\" \nMeanwhile, the UK has introduced the RPS system, and, in the same manner as the US, construction plans of mega solar power plants are based on BOT. Based on this background, Solar Frontier Europe signed contracts for development and sale of solar power plants with a total output of up to 100MW in the UK, in collaboration with German renewable energy developer New Energy for the World (NEW). The solar power plants will incorporate panels manufactured by Solar Frontier. \nIn 2014, Solar Frontier and NEW jointly developed a 7.2MW mega solar power plant incorporating CIS-based solar panels in Banwell in the southeast of the UK (Fig. 5). According to Solar Frontier, the result was highly valued and led to the joint development of 100MW facilities.
