(AP Photo/NASA Goddard Space Flight Center)[/caption]One of the most tediously inevitable arguments that comes around when people start comparing and contrasting the humanities and sciences is the notion that science is too analytical to allow proper appreciation of art. That gaining analytical knowledge of how the universe functions in some way takes away from the beauty of the world.This is, of course, nonsense, and regularly refuted nonsense at that, perhaps most famously by physicist and bongo player Richard Feynman :\nI have a friend who’s an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don’t agree with very well. He’ll hold up a flower and say “look how beautiful it is,” and I’ll agree. Then he says “I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,” and I think that he’s kind of nutty. [...]I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it’s not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there’s also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don’t understand how it subtracts. Almost anybody who writes about science for a popular audience has had to do the \"scientists like pretty things, too\" piece, often several times. And yet, it's almost guaranteed that the next time somebody feels the need to mount a defense of \"the humanities\" or an attack on \"scientism,\" it will include yet another round of \"science is cold and analytical and can't match the warm beauty of [this particular work of art that I like] .\"I was thinking about this today for two reasons. One is that in the last week-and-a-bit, I've made two trips over to Massachusetts to look at art-- one to MassMoCA where we looked at contemporary art, the other to the Clark Art Institute to see the big Van Gogh show they were having. Having seen both in close succession, the Clark's collection of older stuff is very much more my thing.Interestingly, in the days between the two trips, I ran across this video from PBS defending conceptual art against the \"I could do that \" criticism:[youtubevid id=\"67EKAIY43kg\"]As I said on Twitter, I don't find this fully convincing, but it's way better than most defenses of this sort of thing. What I find really striking about this, though, is that it's the mirror image of the usual dumb anti-science argument. That is, it's an impassioned argument in favor of analytical analysis, claiming that you can't really appreciate more abstract pieces without digging deep into the details of how they work, in more or less the same way that scientists dig into the working of the natural world.The other reason I was thinking about this business is that I was looking through photos from our trip down to my parents' for Labor Day weekend. I took a bunch of photos of our seven-year-old daughter, known on the Internet as SteelyKid, playing on the playground, including a whole bunch of her trying to throw a lacrosse ball into a hoop, some of which I stitched together into a .gif:[caption id=\"attachment_636\" align=\"\" width=\"720\"] 5-frame .gif of SteelyKid throwing a ball at the playground. (Photos by Chad Orzel)[/caption]I took these (and a bunch of others just like them) with the rapid shutter sequence on my DSLR camera (hand-held, as you can tell by the inadvertent panning over the background) precisely because of the science content-- I saw her shooting this, and immediately thought \"Hey, physics!\" I appreciate this sequence of shots because there's something very pleasing about the parabolic arc of the ball, mirrored by the much smaller arc of her jump. To say nothing of the earnest anticipation of her stance as she looks to see if it will go in this time (it didn't, but she got several later ones in, after I put away the camera). since she's my kid, and super cute, I would happily argue for the aesthetic value of these shots all by themselves, but I would say that knowing the physics going on deepens that appreciation.This is also why I've been writing here and elsewhere about the exotic physics of everyday objects-- alarm clocks , light bulbs , pachinko machines . Quantum physics has an intimidating reputation and seems awfully far removed from everyday reality, but knowing a bit about it makes the world seem more wondrous, not less. In more or less the same way that knowing the backstory about a conceptual artist turns a couple of clocks hanging on the wall from a stunt into a piece of capital-A Art.So, you know, the next time this dumb argument comes around, I've got two responses ready. One is \"Explain how this conceptual stuff works again.\" The other is \"Hey, check out this cool physics video of my kid.\"[gallery2012]", "external_links": ["http://www.clarkart.edu/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbFM3rn4ldo", "http://www.massmoca.org/"], "published": "2015-09-10T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:03:56.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
