The all new lightweight, man-portable satellite terminal is 90 cm in diameter, and weighs only 20.6 kg. The QCT90 is available in configurations for both military and commercial markets, and is designed for single person carry and easy set-up. \nThis terminal is the newest addition to DataPath's popular line of modular and easy to deploy portable satellite communications terminals, which includes the CCT120 and CCT200. DataPath's modular portable satellite terminals come in a variety of configurations with certifications across a range of satellite fleets including Inmarsat GlobalXpress and the U.S. military's Wideband Global Satellite (WGS) network. \nIt is no secret that the way of the future for satellite communications terminals is smaller, lighter and quicker to connect. With the release of its QCT90, DataPath has reinvented the small quick deploy satellite terminal class. Constructed of military-grade carbon fiber and die cast magnesium, this sleek lightweight system was engineered for both ease-of-use and rugged field performance. \nWith only two separate parts and no loose cables, the QCT90 can snap together and be \"on the air\" in about 3 minutes from the time it comes out of the case or backpack. The system includes an integrated antenna, modem, and RF transmitter unit, which locks into the custom-built folding tripod. Then just unfold the antenna side panels and power the system on. It's just as simple to pack-up and go, when you need a quick exit. The terminal packs into an airline checkable case or a single backpack. \nAlthough built to be ultra-portable and easy to deploy, the QCT90 was also designed to be rugged and durable. Every detail has been carefully considered, from the ergonomics of the design, to the touch-screen driven interface, to custom-built electronic components that exceed military standards many ties over. Unlike many products in this class, the QCT90 is not a collection of off-the-shelf components, but a tightly engineered system, designed with the end-user operating experience in mind. \nRemote operations ranging from news gathering teams to military units, to first responders, to oilfield and mining operators have a new choice in quick and reliable satellite terminals for all of their communications needs. The tri-band terminal operates over X, Ku, and Ka frequencies and supports a wide range of the industry's most popular modems. High-performance electronics mean that the QCT90 can get the most out of today's new High Throughput Satellites (HTS), including transmitting HD Video, capturing real-time sensory data, and providing carrier-quality voice and data communications. The QCT90 enables satellite communications wherever the story, or the mission, takes you. \n\"Our customers operate in remote and challenging environments that simply demand a higher specification of quality and performance,\" said David Myers , President and CEO of DataPath. \"We are proud to bring the innovative QCT90 to market, the first new product engineered by DataPath since we re-launched as a privately owned company little over a year ago. The launch of the QCT90 is the first in a series of investments DataPath is making in a renewed line of class-leading products and solutions designed exclusively for the world's most challenging communications requirements.\" \nDataPath will have the QCT90 on display at IBC2015 in Hall 1, Booth F56.
