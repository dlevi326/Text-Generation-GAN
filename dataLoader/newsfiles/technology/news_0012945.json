However, the company remains the world’s leading shipping line as a result of its ‘superior cost structure’, according to the South China Morning Post. \nThe carrier is planning to invest around US$15 billion over the coming years. \nTan Hua Joo, Analyst at Consultancy Alphaliner, said that Maersk's success lies within its superior cost structure. \nHe said: “Market share gains are secondary, and in any case are easily earned if carriers are prepared to slash freight rates. \n\"Maersk's superior performance is largely due to their superior cost structure and that can be attributed to several key factors, including an expansive global network, control of key hub ports, economies of scale and size with the deployment of some of the most efficient ships in each trade lane they operate in.” \nVan Trooijen detailed that cost saving was hardly a simple exercise, adding: \"It is scrutinising the way you work. From the way your ship sails to how you contract terminal services, there is a whole array of decisions to be made, and eventually make cost saving a lifestyle. It has taken us years of work to make that culture systemic in the organisation.\" \nRobbert Van Trooijen, CEO of Maersk Line North-Asia, said: \"If you don't change the way you work, you won't be able to take full advantage of cheaper bunker fuel. There's no one single recipe on how to save costs. It's systemic behavioural change to address every single cost element in your organisation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T14:35:35.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
