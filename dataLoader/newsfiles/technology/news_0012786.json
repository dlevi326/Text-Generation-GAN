According to a new report however, Microsoft will be taking wraps off the said handsets on October 10. The launch month is also in line with a recent report . \nProlific tipster Evan Blass (aka @evleaks) claims Microsoft plans to launch the Window 10 Mobile-based Lumia 950 and the Lumia 950 XL on October 10. Blass further noted that both the handsets will sport polycarbonate shells instead of their rumoured metal bodies. \nAs for the leaked specifications, which have been reiterated by multiple sources over the past few months, the Lumia 950 sports a 5.2-inch QHD display and is powered by Snapdragon 808 processor coupled with 3GB of RAM and a 3,000mAH battery. The Lumia 950 XL, on the other hand, is said to equip a 5.7-inch QHD display, and is powered by a Snapdragon 810 chipset coupled with 3GB of RAM. Both the handsets are reportedly going to have a 21-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel selfie sensor. \nWhat Blass hasn't talked about is whether the company will also refresh its Surface lineup with rumoured new Surface tablet, and its wearable fitness tracker the Microsoft Band at the same event. Also it isn't clear whether the rumoured Surface Mobile exists and is ready for the global unveil yet. \nWith Microsoft significantly toning down on its Windows Phone efforts, the aforementioned handsets hold the future of the company's mobile operating system - Windows 10 Mobile.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:10:47.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
