That question has been reverberating around Silicon Valley for at least two years. But it is the wrong question. It also distracts from a more serious consideration, and one that has assumed new urgency with the China slowdown and global stock market wobble. \nThis “bubble or not” debate has created a false dichotomy. It implies that either the latest tech dreams are built on sand, or everything is fine and anyone suggesting otherwise is an alarmist. More US tech giants need to soften their image \nBut the real point is that Silicon Valley is experiencing a particularly powerful manifestation of one of its periodic booms. And, like all booms, the question is not whether this one will come to an end (they all do) but when the ensuing bust will come, and how big it will be. \nObsessive talk of a tech bubble is understandable. Even today, the shadow of the last bubble, which reached maximum inflation more than 15 years ago, still looms. However, the generalised condition of overvaluation that prevailed then is not being repeated now. As venture capital (VC) firm Andreessen Horowitz highlighted recently, valuations are not high by historical standards (at least, for public stocks). The whole market may be overpriced, but that is a different point. \nThat said, localised symptoms of bubbly behaviour are a characteristic of the manias that constantly sweep through the sector. An easing of social media hype has hurt the share price of LinkedIn (down 35 per cent from its peak) and Twitter (off 60 per cent). Silicon Valley’s memory is short when it comes to high-flyers that fall out of favour. Four years ago, Zynga and Groupon were the most hyped “unicorns” — or highly valued private companies — of their day. Now, as public stocks, they are both 83 per cent from their peak. \nStill, even if the same fate awaits some of today’s tech darlings, like Tesla to Netflix — along with a fair number of the latest unicorns — it need not point to the pricking of a larger bubble. \nMoney flooding into tech start-ups feeds a boom-and-bust cycle that has been a highly productive feature of the tech world. It drives an over-investment in new business ideas, accelerating the development of new markets as investors suspend their normal disbelief. \nPerhaps even more importantly, booms bring over-investment in new infrastructure that supports future innovation. A massive build-out of uneconomic broadband networks during the 1990s tech bubble left a trail of devastation in the communications industry. But it also laid the foundations for the Web 2.0 revival that followed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T00:19:07.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
