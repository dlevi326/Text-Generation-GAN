Body mass may be more nurture than nature November 1, 2013 \n(Medical Xpress)—The influence of genes on body mass index scores is substantially lower than previously thought, researchers at The University of Queensland have found. Study finds genetic link between height and IQ March 5, 2014 \nA team of researchers at Edinburgh University in Scotland has found a correlation between genes associated with height and those associated with intelligence. In their paper published in the journal Behavior Genetics, the ... Nature vs. nurture results in a draw, according to twins meta-study May 19, 2015 \nOne of the great tussles of science – whether our health is governed by nature or nurture – has been settled, and it is effectively a draw. Pregnant mothers influence fetal growth through genetics rather than maternal height August 18, 2015 \nTransmitted genes, rather than growth limitations caused by actual differences in maternal height, are the key means by which a mother's height influences her baby's birth weight and length, according to a new study published ...
