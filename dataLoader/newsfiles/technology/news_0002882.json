Based out of Bangalore, India, EkStep’s goal is to provide a learning tool that will be available to millions of children via smartphones and tablets, enabling them to learn in any environment. Leveraging their expertise in learning games and engaging play, Filament will create a game-based learning experience focused on teaching basic math concepts. The game will be playable on even the most affordable mobile technology in order to maximize the reach and accessibility of the game.\n“We approached Filament Games for this project because of their position as a global leader in game-based learning,” said Shankar Maruwada, Co-founder and CEO of EkStep. “We are confident that with their talented team of developers, artists, and designers, the EkStep platform will benefit from game content that is at once authentically entertaining and effectively educational.”\nThis partnership marks a major step towards creating a global marketplace for game-based learning. Projections from Ambient Insight estimate that global game-based learning revenues will expand with a CAGR of 18%, expanding to a $8.9 billion industry by 2017.\n“Partnering with a mission-driven organization like EkStep allows us to participate in an innovative, ground-breaking project that will demonstrate the unique and universal strengths of game-based learning,” says Dan White, Chief Product Officer and Co-founder of Filament Games. “Access to quality digital educational content is crucial for helping children master educational concepts and develop the technological aptitude needed to thrive in the 21st century.”\nAbout EkStep\nCo-founded by Nandan Nilekani, Rohini Nilekani and Shankar Maruwada in January, 2015, EkStep is funded by philanthropic capital from the Nilekanis. The mission was inspired by a question that Rohini, with her decades of experience in the education sector, asked – \"How can we use the latest advancements in learning sciences and digital technologies to help millions of young children personally experience the joy of learning? Can we use technology to help improve learning levels of young disadvantaged children?\" EkStep is an initiative of the Personalised Learning Platform Foundation, a not-for-profit company based in Bangalore, set up under Section 8 of the Indian Companies Act, 2013.\nAbout Filament Games\nFilament Games is a production studio that develops engaging teaching and learning games.
