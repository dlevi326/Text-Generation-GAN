Mr Wren?\nMr Bean wasn’t always going to be called Mr Bean.\n“We started with (Mr) Zucchini,” said Atkinson.\n“Or Mr Potato, or Mr Cauliflower or Mr Cabbage. And then we just thought, Bean. It’s short, it’s silly.\n“It was either that or the name of a bird, like Mr Wren. Birds and vegetables tend to be the funniest names.”\nMr Bean is basically a child:\n“Whenever we try to think of Mr Bean and how he would react in certain situations that we’re thinking of putting him in, I always imagine him as a nine-year-old boy,” said Atkinson.\n“They’re sort of anarchists at heart and I think that’s what Mr Bean is, he’s an anarchist.\n“He’ll obey the rules as long as they suit him.”\nI guess that also explains why his best friend is a teddy bear.\nA good time, not a long time:\nCan you believe there are actually only 14 episodes of Mr Bean ?\nThe TV series, which aired from 1990-1995, later inspired two films: 1997s Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Movie (which made $356 million worldwide) and 2007s Mr. Bean’s Holiday (which made $325 million worldwide).\nMr Bean’s car is a 1976 British Leyland Mini 1000, registration SLW 287R. True feelings:\nWhen people spot Rowan Atkinson in public, they tend to call him Mr Bean rather than his actual name, which annoys the actor a little as he’s not actually a huge fan of the character.\n“I do have a love/hate relationship with him in that I love playing him because he’s such an unpleasant, selfish, childish, ridiculous figure, but at the same time I don’t like him as a person.”\nThe last episode that never was:\nIn a 1993 interview, Atkinson revealed that he had an idea for the last episode of Mr Bean.\n“He sees this spaceship landing in a field and he stops the car,” said Atkinson.\n“He looks up and suddenly the door (lowers) and this bright light comes out of the spaceship and a Mr Bean walks out of the spaceship ... and then another Mr Bean and they all shake hands and then 25 more Mr Beans all come out of the spaceship and pat him on the back and say ‘very nice to see you’.\n“And then all the Mr Beans go up into the spaceship and the door goes up and that’s the end of Mr Bean.”\nUnfortunately, the idea never eventuated on screen.\nDon’t expect Mr Bean to return:\nHe made a brief cameo during the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012, but don’t expect Mr Bean to return to TV with fresh episodes.\n“He’s a character I’ve been playing for 20 or 30 years and I’m very happy to say goodbye to Mr Bean now,” Atkinson said.\n“I don’t think I’m going to play the character again because I just don’t want to see him getting old.”\nMr Bean looked a little bored during the opening ceremony.
