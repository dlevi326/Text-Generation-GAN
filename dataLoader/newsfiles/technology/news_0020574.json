Allen from the University of Virginia. \n\"In this study, it was a robust predictor of increased long-term physical health quality,\" he added. \nThe intense adolescent focus on forming and maintaining peer relationships may well result from an instinctive recognition that these relationships are linked to well being. \nPeer relationships provide some of the most emotionally intense experiences in adolescents' lives, and conformity to peer norms often occurs even when it brings significant costs to the individual, the researchers said. \n\"Cross-cultural research has found that an approach to social interactions that emphasises placing the desires of one's peers ahead of one's own goals - much as adolescents do when they conform to peer norms - is linked to reduced life stress,\" they noted. \nThe researchers recruited a diverse group of 171 seventh and eighth-graders and followed them from ages 13 through 27 years old. \nParticipants' health quality was then assessed annually at ages 25, 26, and 27 years old with questions about their overall health, anxiety and depression symptoms, and body mass index. \nResults indicated that both high quality close friendships and a drive to fit in with peers in adolescence were associated with better health at age 27. \nThe study was published in the Psychological Science journal.
