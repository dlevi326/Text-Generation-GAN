(AP) - Seismologists have downgraded the magnitude of a light earthquake that jolted the Big Bear Lake area of the San Bernardino Mountains in Southern California.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey says the quake that hit at 9:10 a.m. Wednesday measured as a magnitude-4.0, weaker than its preliminary estimate of 4.5.\nThe quake was centered 7 miles southeast of Big Bear Lake at a depth of about 7 miles. Big Bear Lake is a mountain recreation region about 100 miles east of Los Angeles.\nTiffany Swantek, a spokeswoman for the local San Bernardino County sheriff's station, says there have been no reports of damage. She says there was one sharp jolt.\nSeveral very small aftershocks have followed the larger earthquake.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:03:41.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
