They are experts in SCADA, PLC real-time systems, and retrofitting these technologies into existing systems. This led to the introduction of their INFINITE software platform for real-time control, data logging and archiving. They are known for their superb customer service and support worldwide. Universal introduced Neocortex for unlimited depalletizing , in 2010. Since then, the company has expanded Neocortex to include random bin picking applications. The platform, now on version 4.2, is the most advanced real-time artificial intelligence software for material handling applications in the world.\nArtificial Intelligence is required for to allow vision systems to handled large SKU counts with high variability. Universal Robotics VP, Hob Wubbena, points out: “When 3D vision doesn’t recognize a carton, box, incoming part, or raw goods, Neocortex determines the object and sends results to the robot to pick it.\nRobotic packaging systems on the market today make a tradeoff between flexibility and speed. This is not the case with DPPS’s packaging systems. Neocortex determines cartons by their attributes. As a result, whether the system is moving two types of cartons or two thousand different SKUs, it is equally fast.\nDPPS leveraged their INFINITE software platform and process control expertise to provide detailed control of the robot with real-time data collection on the process and SKUs going through the system to provide data into logistics software systems. This allows customers details not previously available. Edgar DePeuter, CEO, describes it: “Our team is able to incorporate our knowledge of process control automation with end-of-line robotic packaging systems to result in major breakthroughs in material handling. Our customary around-the-clock support and service anywhere in the world differentiates our value to logistics customers.”\nAbout Universal Robotics\nUniversal Robotics is a software engineering company that creates state-of-the-art artificial intelligence with multi-dimensional sensing and motion control to expand the reach of automation for a host of applications, making machines more flexible and providing learning from big data.
