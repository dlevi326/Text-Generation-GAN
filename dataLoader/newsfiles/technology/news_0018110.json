The Zadroga Act, named after a responder who died after working at ground zero, first became law in 2010 after a debate over the bill's cost.\nProponents of the law are seeking its permanent extension in part because some illnesses may not manifest until years later, after the statute of limitations for worker's compensation or certain state laws may have run out. House Republicans are supportive of the program but have opposed its permanent extension because they say they want the chance to periodically review it and make sure it is operating soundly.\nEarlier this summer, Dr. John Howard , the administrator of the World Trade Center Health Program, told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that extending the law would help clinicians treat victims, and allow administrators to better plan patient care.\n\"It's stressful to be told on a year-to-year basis that your care might be taken away,\" Howard said. \"From the administrative perspective, it's stressful because we have to constantly prepare for when this may end.\"\nSen. Kristen Gillibrand , D-N.Y., accompanied Stewart Wednesday as he lobbied for the bill.\n\"It's a moral obligation and I think people do understand that,\" she said. \"I am very optimistic that we can bring the entire Senate together to support this bill.\"\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., said Congress would extend the program, but did not provide details or whether it would be done permanently.\n___\nFollow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/MCJalonick", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/75/55/8641385/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://twitter.com/MCJalonick", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/75/55/8641386/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/75/55/8641386/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/75/55/8641385/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/75/55/8641384/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/75/55/8641382/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/75/55/8641382/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/75/55/8641384/7/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-16T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:48:17.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
