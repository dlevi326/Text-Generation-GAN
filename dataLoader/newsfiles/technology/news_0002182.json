According to the ICS, the global industry is already delivering carbon neutral growth, having reduced total CO 2 emissions by more than 10% since 2007, despite an increase in maritime trade. \nCO 2 emissions from international shipping now represent just 2.2% of the world’s total CO 2 emissions, compared to 2.8% in 2007 (UN IMO Green House Gas Study, 2014).\nPeter Hinchliffe, Secretary General of the ICS, said: “These are genuine reductions through fuel efficiency, without the need for complex virtual measures such as carbon offsets.\n“With bigger ships, better engines and smarter speed management, the industry is confident of a 50% CO 2 reduction by 2050 when the entire world fleet will comprise super fuel-efficient ships, many using clean fuels such as LNG.”\nShipping’s global regulator, the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) has already set a mandatory target whereby all ships built from 2025 (including those in developing nations) must be 30% more efficient than ships built in the 2000s. \nICS says that the IMO is the only place that can ensure that the entire world fleet will continue to deliver further CO 2 reductions, regardless of a ship’s flag, whilst respecting the United Nations Framework – Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) principle of “Common But Differentiated Responsibility.”\nPeter Hinchcliffe concluded: “The entire world fleet is about 20% more efficient than in 2005. With the support of the shipping industry, IMO has already achieved a great deal and is the only forum that can deliver further significant CO 2 reductions from international shipping.”\nFor all the latest on shipping, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T19:02:45.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
