Of course, since the iPhone 6 — and especially the iPhone 6 Plus — were a big change from the iPhone 5S, last year's teardown was a bit more intense. According to iFixit, the iPhone 6S' battery is indeed smaller than the one in iPhone 6, likely due to the new taptic engine, located below the battery. Though not exactly a secret anymore, it's also confirmed that the phone has 2GB of RAM. As far as repairability goes, the new iPhone is in line with the last year's model — it's relatively easy to remove the display and access the battery, provided you have the tools that can handle Apple's proprietary Pentalobe screws.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T22:19:19.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
