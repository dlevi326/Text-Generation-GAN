Twitter's an obvious choice if you’re looking to get control of your search results — it ranks well on its own and can be a powerful resource for increasing the engagement of your original content.\nBut there's a big difference between using Twitter like an average user and using Twitter like a pro to impact search results. First, you'll need to optimize your Twitter profile . Then use these 12 twitter tools to give you the jumpstart you need to take control of your online reputation:\n1. RightRelevance RightRelevance is one of my favorite resources for aggregating quality content all in one place. RR mines the web to consistently find and rank the most influential people and articles for any given topic. Once you’ve signed in via your Twitter account, simply add all your favorite topics to your feed (that column on the left) and then check them whenever you’re low on content.\nOnce you've clicked on a particular topic, you can view the ‘Influencers’ tab (across the top) to see that topic’s most influential users and find loads of people to follow in the industry. You can do it all easily right from the RightRelevance interface.\n2. BuzzSumo BuzzSumo is a data miner’s best friend. It shows you the most shared pieces of content for a given topic and a given timeframe. It teaches you which social networks and platforms you’ll want to target based on your industry and interests. And it's also a critical brainstorming tool because it shows you what your competitors and peers are doing. Use it to discover content, improve your content, and come up with brand new content altogether.\n3. RiteTag If you’re tweeting about ‘entrepreneurship,’ how do you know whether to use #entrepreneur #entrepreneurs #entrepreneurship or some other variant?\nRiteTag, that’s how. Simply enter a keyword and RiteTag will determine how many unique tweets per hour, retweets, potential hashtag views, etc. You can even view a historical timeline of that hashtag’s popularity over the last month.\nFrom my RiteTag search above, I can see that #entrepreneurs and #entrepreneurship are good but #entrepreneur is better by a long shot. Case closed. The RiteTag extension makes this even easier by integrating directly with Twitter, Buffer and Hootsuite but it only lasts for a 30-day free trial unless you’re willing to dish out a monthly fee.\n4. Buffer I used to go back and forth between Buffer and Swayy a lot. Buffer has quickly become one of my all-time favorite Twitter tools because of its amazingly easy queuing system. You set up as many posting times as you want throughout the week and your tweets will automatically fall into line when you add them to the queue. Just season with hashtags to taste.\nBut as good as Buffer is, it doesn't currently curate content based on your interests. Swayy had this on lock - its content suggestion engine got better and better the more you used it because it learns what types of content you like to share over time. But Swayy was recently bought out by SimilarWeb, and so they shut down at the end of July. That made my decision for me.\nThe good news is that Buffer has plenty of functionality that Swayy didn't. It lets you easily throw images into your queued tweets to increase engagement and even tells you what times are the best to tweet for maximum engagement. The downside, as with some of these other great apps, is that you must pay for increased functionality. Unless you want to make a monthly payment, you'll have to settle for scheduling 10 tweets at one time.\n5. Pablo Even if you don’t use Buffer, you should still use its younger brother Pablo. Pablo lets you create engaging social media images in under a minute. Upload a picture of your choice, pick a quick background option, enter a title, and you’ve got a custom image ready to go.\n6. Canva If you have a little more time to make an engaging social media image, then Canva is the way to go. Canva - which deserves a whole article to itself - lets you easily create stunning designs, images, infographics, and more. Their awesome templates and cookie-cutter social media sizes makes this process as easy as it can be.\n7. Hootsuite Hootsuite has become one of the standard tools for social media managers because it was early on the scene (2008) and its dashboard integrates with a whole range of social networks from Twitter and Facebook to LinkedIn and Google+. Heck, it even supports MySpace if you’re into that.\nI actually prefer Swayy and Buffer as pure scheduling tools but one thing I will say about Hootsuite is that it makes scheduling retweets a cinch. Simply install the Hootlet extension on your browser and you’re ready to start spacing out your retweets. All you have to do is click the little owl instead of the retweet button to throw retweets into your queue.\n8. Tweriod Tweriod helps you make the most of your tweets by analyzing your Twitter followers and letting you know the best times to tweet. It will tell you when you get the most exposure, when most of your followers are online, and when you received the most @replies. Use this simple tool before setting up your customized schedule to get the most out of your tweets.\n9. WhoUnfollowedMe One of the easiest ways to NOT get followers and quality engagement is to just follow people willy nilly and let your following/followers ratio get all out of whack. Think about it — if you follow 2000 people (the maximum Twitter will allow unless your ratio is healthy) but only have 100 people following you back, that’s a pretty sure sign that you’re a spammy user. Most users will steer clear.\nThat’s where WhoUnfollowedMe comes in. It helps you catch the people who once followed you but have since unfollowed you. You can quickly see who those users are and then seamlessly unfollow them back to keep your ratio clean and healthy. You can also use the tool as a great way to view the people who have followed you recently and decide who you’d like to follow back.\n10. Twitter Analytics Twitter analytics is a really easy and useful. Simply go to analytics.twitter.com to start tracking your account with Twitter analytics. Then you can check back at any time and see a 28 day summary of your Tweets, Impressions, Profile Visits, Mentions, and Follower Growth. You can compare this month’s numbers to last month’s and can see some great highlights like your Top Media Tweet, your Top Follower, and how many impressions your Top Tweet received.\n11. Followerwonk Moz’s Followerwonk tool does a lot of things, but my favorite is the analysis feature. Simply put, it helps you figure out when your followers are online and engaged. This is critical because it gives you a great sense of how you can be more efficient with the time you spend on Twitter. Tweet when your followers are active and lay off when they’re not.\n12. Crowdfire\nI've saved one of the best for last. Crowdfire, which I only discovered in the last few weeks, is a game-changer for managing your Twitter following. You can easily unfollow folks and even filter by the inactive followers to make smarter cutting decisions. Plus, you can keep track of your \"Fans,\" the term Crowdfire uses to talk about the folks that follow you that you don't follow back.\nMy favorite part is where you can follow people based on a particular keyword. I've been having a blast following people using hashtags like #ORM #SEO and #PersonalBranding. You can also use a Copy Followers feature, which allows you to pull up a list of followers for someone else's account and follow them. The function isn't wouldn't be noteworthy except that their user interface makes it a cinch to follow people with some insane rapid-fire clicking.\nThe sad part is that Crowdfire has a 100 person unfollow limit and a 25 person follow limit per day unless you ramp up to a paid plan starting at $9.99. But with these kinds of features, I'm seriously considering it.\nLet me know what some of your favorites are in the comments!\nThis article is an updated version of the original from ryanerskine.com", "external_links": ["http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e412e4b0be63c477b654/1434575893175/?format=1500w", "http://ryanerskine.com/blog/the-6-steps-to-optimizing-any-social-profile-for-stellar-search-results", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e3bbe4b0b59144909910/1434575804784/?format=1500w", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e3fbe4b0b8d5859f27b6/1434575872877/?format=1500w", "http://www.ryanerskine.com/ryanerskine-blog/the-6-steps-to-optimizing-any-social-profile-for-stellar-search-results", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e60ae4b06eb9aea904b1/1434576396782/?format=1500w", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e636e4b0304163aff5de/1434576438514/?format=1500w", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e3bbe4b0b59144909910/1434575804784/", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=19915597&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e911e4b01f59c2b11c25/1434577184767/Ryan+Erskine+FollowerWonk.png", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e67be4b0e4c2b1527ca0/1434576517503/", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e911e4b01f59c2b11c25/1434577184767/Ryan+Erskine+FollowerWonk.png?format=1500w", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e850e4b0a5db48a54763/1434576979036/", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e840e4b016439ee8ddc8/1434576962153/", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e833e4b016439ee8dd51/1434576961193/", "http://analytics.twitter.com/", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e85ae4b0cb5018f40098/1434576987771/?format=1500w", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e67be4b0e4c2b1527ca0/1434576517503/?format=1500w", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e833e4b016439ee8dd51/1434576961193/?format=1500w", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e60ae4b06eb9aea904b1/1434576396782/", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e636e4b0304163aff5de/1434576438514/", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e85ae4b0cb5018f40098/1434576987771/", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e850e4b0a5db48a54763/1434576979036/?format=1500w", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e412e4b0be63c477b654/1434575893175/", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e840e4b016439ee8ddc8/1434576962153/?format=1500w", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/538e7a53e4b0377ad0a3310d/t/5581e3fbe4b0b8d5859f27b6/1434575872877/"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T09:28:16.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
