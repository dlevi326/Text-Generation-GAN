Best-picture nominee “The Theory of Everything” had its premiere there, and Oscar winners “Slumdog Millionaire” and “The King’s Speech” were also shown in the Canadian city, where attendance has been growing.\nBut for distributors seeking the next Oscar winner, the pickings will be slimmer. Newer players including Netflix Inc., A24 and the Orchard have created more competition, snapping up theatrical and home-video rights to films screening in Toronto, including “Beasts of No Nation,” “Green Room” and the Jesse Eisenberg picture “Louder Than Bombs.” Online entrants like Netflix, which is expanding to original feature films from documentaries and TV, are influencing the festival business by purchasing worldwide rights earlier.\nThat’ll cut into the action at Toronto -- one of the most important film markets, alongside Cannes and Berlin. Movies shown at Toronto are typically made by independent filmmakers, using their own wherewithal or backed by investors. At festivals they meet with buyers, distributors who steer pictures through a run in theaters and then to DVDs and TV.\n“Netflix made a compelling offer and presentation,” said Jonathan King, executive vice president at Participant Media, one of the producers of “Beasts of No Nation.” “It was important to us that we get this story to the widest audience possible.”\nTypically, rights are sold by territory, with the U.S. the biggest, although some studios buy globally. Recently, Internet companies have entered the fray, often seeking worldwide rights for fresh material. That’s created pressure to find and obtain new projects earlier in the production cycle, before costly bidding wars break out. Netflix bought “Beasts of No Nation” in March, paying almost $12 million according to Variety. It plans to open the movie on Oct. 16, in theaters and online.\nIn December, Fox Searchlight bought the U.S. rights to “Demolition,” which stars Jake Gyllenhaal and opens the festival on Thursday. The 21st Century Fox Inc. unit also bought most worldwide rights to the documentary “He Named Me Malala,” which makes its international premiere in Toronto.\nAmazon.com Inc., which said in January it would begin producing feature films, will be in Toronto for the first time, where could seek either domestic or worldwide rights, depending on the film. It acquired Spike Lee’s “Chi-Raq” in July. The movie, which isn’t playing at the festival, will be released in December. A24, another newer player, bought U.S. rights to the Patrick Stewart thriller “Green Room” in August.\nCNN’s Sexton said she’s been trying to see films before the festivals to get ahead of the game. One picture still unsold is Michael Moore’s “Where to Invade Next.” While the director teased it on Periscope this summer, little about the movie has been released publicly.\n“Most of the high-end projects are pre-selling, and have distributors in place by the time they premiere at festivals,” said Micah Green, co-head of the film finance and sales group at Creative Artists Agency, one of the largest talent agencies.\nWhile 2015 is projected to be a record year at the box office, the odds of success aren’t necessarily growing for independent films. A few high-profile festival sales have fallen flat at the box office.\nChris Rock’s “Top Five,” which sold for $12 million last year -- believed to be the highest sale ever in Toronto -- generated only $25.4 million in global ticket sales, according to Box Office Mojo . The film will generate a net loss of $14.8 million for distributor Paramount Pictures, after revenue from ticket sales, digital downloads, DVDs and TV rights, estimates Wade Holden, an analyst with the researcher SNL Kagan. Katie Martin Kelley, a spokeswoman for the Viacom Inc.-owned film studio, declined to comment.\nSome acquisitions made at this year’s Sundance Film Festival also failed to ignite the box office when they were released this summer. “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” distributed by Fox Searchlight, and “Dope,” from Open Road Films, are unlikely to make a profit, Holden estimates. He cautioned that the two films’ hadn’t yet been released on home video or in some international markets.\n“It has always been true that a movie bought at a festival can fail at the box office, but there are also lots of films that do incredibly well,” said\nJamie Carmichael, president of film for Santa Monica, California based distributor Content Media, who will be in Toronto to sell rights to a Janis Joplin biopic. “Buyers are very attuned to the vagaries of the market.”\nOrganizers of the Toronto festival say they’ve seen no signs of a letup in interest. Featured films include “Maggie’s Plan,” with Greta Gerwig and Ethan Hawke, “The Family Fang,” directed by Jason Bateman, “Eye in the Sky,” with Helen Mirren, and “Into the Forest,” starring Ellen Page.\nThe number of industry delegates attending has increased by more than 20 percent increase over the last four years, with 4 percent growth in 2015, based on preliminary numbers. Overall attendance surged 57 percent in 2014 from 2013.\n“We have some strong sales titles in the festival lineup this year, and we’re looking forward to some brisk business in the marketplace,” said Kathleen Drumm, director of the festival’s industry office.\nNick Meyer, chief executive officer of sales and production company Sierra/Affinity, is one who is back. Last year, he was there drumming up deals for “Demolition,” directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, whose credits include “Dallas Buyers Club” and “Wild.” This time he’ll be selling new movies.\n“Toronto is a pretty special place,” Meyer said. “It’s been good for our business.”", "external_links": ["http://www.theorchard.com/about-us/history/\\", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=topfive.htm\\"], "published": "2015-09-10T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:24:15.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
