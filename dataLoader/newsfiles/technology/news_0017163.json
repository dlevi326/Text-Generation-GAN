We will not release watchOS 2 today but will shortly,\" an Apple spokeswoman said.\nShe declined additional comment on the nature of the bug.\nThe software delay for the Watch isn't expected to affect iOS 9.\nThe new software for the Watch is considered important because it will allow watch apps to run directly on the device. Currently, watch apps run on the iPhone and the information is relayed to the watch, causing performance lags.\nThis was a cause of frustration for many developers. By improving the performance of the apps, Apple was hoping to entice more developers to create apps for the device, which started shipping in April.\nWrite to Daisuke Wakabayashi at Daisuke.Wakabayashi@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"Apple, Inc.\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005\n 16, 2015 12:25 ET (16:25 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T03:18:02.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
