The first of these integrated solutions is a collaboration with Access Softek to offer DeepTarget Mobile within Access Softek's Mobile Finance Manager (MFM) solution.\nDeepTarget Mobile is featured in DeepTarget's 2015 OmniEngagement Cloud release, a comprehensive digital marketing communications platform based on DeepTarget's innovative technology foundation. It now allows financial institutions to extend their marketing campaigns to the mobile banking environment. Offering enhanced personalization capabilities, rule-based customer segmentation and targeting, and automated response and tracking tools, DeepTarget Mobile is powered by the same extensive marketing platform used by hundreds of financial institutions for superior targeted communications within online banking, email, and web marketing solutions.\nDesigned for easy integration, DeepTarget Mobile offers an effective and economical option to provide enhanced marketing capabilities within mobile banking environments such as within Access Softek's Mobile Finance Manager (MFM) solution.\nFinancial institutions using the combination of MFM and DeepTarget can now offer targeted ads with pinpoint precision in a way that's never been possible before. Banks and credit unions can deliver the right message to the right person at the right time and even at the right place. Picture an end user checking their balance at a car dealership and sees an ad for their institution's competitive loan rates. Targeted ads give financial institutions enhanced engagement with their customers and makes offers more relevant and therefore more effective.\nCalifornia-based Access Softek was the first vendor to offer a unified platform of mobile banking, online banking, and online lending. Its innovative digital banking software keeps over 400 credit unions and banks ahead of the technological curve with the features their customers want and the security that financial institutions need, while deploying this solution for its competitive advantages.\n\"The ability to integrate with DeepTarget's mobile marketing solution with its enhanced targeted marketing capabilities adds a great deal of value for the financial institutions who are deploying MFM,\" said Chris Doner, CEO of Access Softek. \"Access Softek is proud to be a leader in mobile banking technology, and we are pleased to be working with a team that is focused on providing innovative solutions to meet the marketing needs of our customers. DeepTarget's OmniEngagement Cloud platform will allow our mobile banking customers to quickly and easily extend marketing campaigns to our environment.\"\n\"We are excited to work with Access Softek to extend and enhance targeted marketing within one of the fastest-growing mobile banking solutions - one that is both simple and elegant at the same time. As technology partners, we look forward to collaborating to provide the most advanced marketing capabilities to our customers. Our company's intense focus remains on innovative marketing technology that can be deployed seamlessly by banks and credit unions through multiple digital channels,\" said Preetha Pulusani, Chairman and CEO, DeepTarget Inc.\nToday, people use mobile banking more often than they go into physical branches. The emerging trend is to use it more often than online banking and more frequently than phone communication into a call center. With mobile being such a frequent interaction point between a financial institution and its customers, it is can also turn into the most effective engagement and advertising channel.\nIt is an imperative today for financial institutions to ensure that they are an ongoing part of their users' decision-making processes. Alternative banking sources are everywhere. If the bank or credit union isn't at the right place at the right time, those others might be, both for that particular decision and in the larger industry competition between traditional and alternative banking. Multi-channel targeted advertising can effectively ensure that financial institutions make their case just in time - as their customers make those financial decisions and that will give them competitive advantages in this fiercely crowded space.\nThe DeepTarget-Access Softek solutions will also be offered to the market from other DeepTarget partners, including Member Driven Technologies, ShareOne, and Synergent.\nDemonstrations, Pricing, & Availability\nDeepTarget's OmniEngagement Cloud and DeepTarget Mobile are available for demonstration and purchase by contacting DeepTarget at sales@deeptarget.com , or by calling one of our online banking or service provider partners.
