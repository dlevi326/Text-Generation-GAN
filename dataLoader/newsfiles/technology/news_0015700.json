Even back then English was used as a secondary language of instruction for students who did not understand Afrikaans, and we had a number of Coloured and Black students even in those ' apartheid' days.\nTake into account that the Western Cape is predominantly Afrikaans speaking, (over 50% has Afrikaans as a home language) and has 2 other institutions (UWC and UCT) which almost exclusively teaches in English, and you have to ask if there is not a hidden agenda in this targeting of Stellenbosch.\nThe University of KZN gives some lectures in Zulu - a language I do not understand. So if I was to enrol at UKZN and then start protesting that I don't want to be taught in a language I don't understand, would it receive the same attention? My guess is not.\nIn my opinion this whole thing is a witch hunt, where one language is being targeted for destruction. The legacy of hatred is not conducive to building a non-racial future. Hate begets hate. If you hit students with a sjambok, do you really think he will forgive and forget in the spirit of UBUNTU?\nAfrikaans as a language has been tarnished as the language of the oppressor, the language of Apartheid. 40 years later, the hatred of the 74 Soweto riots are still echoing in the hearts of many black people. However, ask yourself – are you not doing exactly the same as what was done to you?\nThe Soweto riots was a protest against being forced to learn Afrikaans at school. Now you are trying to force Stellenbosch to stop teaching in Afrikaans – which is the home language of the majority of people in the region. For a lot of Afrikaans people, English is the language of the oppressor – many Afrikaners are still bitter about the Anglo Boer war.\nAnd the exclusion of the Afrikaner afterwards from business. Now you are trying to force Afrikaans speaking people to be taught in English – and you seem to be unaware of the irony?\nThose who fail to learn from history are bound to repeat it - Sir Winston Churchill spoke these words many years ago. Enforcing a language policy on people will result in hatred. We will be forced to go through the cycle of racism and hatred again and again, unless we compromise and give each other space.\nStellenbosch has always been a beacon of enlightened Afrikaner intellectualism. Do not radicalise it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T00:47:18.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
