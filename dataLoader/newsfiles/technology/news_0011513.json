The Form 2 also benefits from an automated resin refill system (open to resins you might want to experiment with) and a new print process; a sliding peel mechanism, wiper and heated resin tank which allows users to print large, solid parts with fine details. \nOther highlights include wireless printing with mobile alerts and remote monitoring, a 1-click print software update and a full-colour touchscreen display. \n“Through building the Form 1 and Form 1+ we’ve learned that professional engineers, designers and creators need access to powerful, easy­to use systems,” Max Lobovsky, Co-­founder of Formlabs, explained. “We believe that this is the ‘next wave’ of the 3D printing industry: high resolution output with a simple user experience packaged in a desktop footprint. In many ways, 3D printing technology is following a similar path to the desktop computer. It started with mainframes, was adopted by the hobbyist and then evolved into the powerful desktop machines everyone uses today. The Form 2 represents the next wave of 3D printing technology.” × Expand \nForm 2 3D printed parts. \nThe Form 2 is available to purchase now for $3,499 and includes Formlabs’ PreForm software, one litre of resin and a finish kit for post-processing. The machine will start shipping in November. \nVisitors to TCT Show + Personalize next week (30 th September – 1 st October, NEC, Birmingham) will get to see the Form 2 up close on stand D44. Formlabs’ co-founder Max Lobovsky will also give a keynote presentation on 1 st October at the TCT Show Conference, sharing his experiences at the cutting-edge of the business, technology and community of 3D printing and his hopes for future development.
