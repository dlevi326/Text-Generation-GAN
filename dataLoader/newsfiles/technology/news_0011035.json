We are ready to strengthen cooperation with the US side on this issue,\" he said. \n\nRice also said the United States would insist on maintaining freedom of navigation and commerce through busy sea lanes in disputed areas of the South China Sea. \n\nXi told the Wall Street Journal that China's development of facilities on the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea do not impact upon or target any other country, and \"should not be overinterpreted\". \n\nRice said Obama would be direct with Xi on those issues and disagreements over human rights at their meetings.
