The infection is treated with standard antibiotics, which also wipe out friendly bacteria that normally keep C. difficile under control.\nMerck said two Phase 3 studies, presented on Sunday at a medical meeting in San Diego, found 12 weeks of treatment with antibiotics and a one-time infusion of bezlotoxumab, designed to block the ability of a toxin to bind to cells, reduced to about 15 per cent the risk that C. difficile would recur. The studies found that the infection recurred in about 25 percent of patients treated with antibiotics and a placebo.\n\"We have therapies to treat the initial episode, but this infection comes back frequently — there is a 25 percent risk of recurrence after the first time, and that rises to 40 per cent or even 60 per cent after the second infection,\" said Nick Kartsonis, associate vice president in clinical research, infectious diseases at Merck.\nThe studies showed no benefit from a second experimental antibody, actoxumab, either alone or in combination with bezlotoxumab. Merck said the actoxumab arm was stopped for efficacy and safety reasons after an interim analysis.\nThe company said it plans to file before the end of the year for regulatory approval of bezlotoxumab, which it licensed from Massachusetts Biologic Laboratories and Medarex, now owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb.\nSide effects, including nausea, diarrhea and urinary tract infection, occurred at similar rates for patients in both the treatment and placebo arms of the trials.\nThe incidence of C. difficile infection has risen sharply over the last two decades and is now a leading cause of healthcare-acquired infections in community hospitals in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nOther companies are working on vaccines against C. difficile. Doctors are also treating patients with \"stool transplants,\" which involves inserting fecal material from a healthy person into the gut of someone with severe diarrhea in order to restore friendly bacteria.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:05:22.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
