Ironically, it was their article about this latest development which drew the greatest number of comments - they even recently published an article about the sheer volume of public outrage and tirades of fury and disgust.\nSo before we are all stifled on Friday, never to be heard from again since our profiles are fake anyway, allow me to share some of the insights I have learned from this channel over the past few years:\n* No matter what an article's angle was, or how good or even neutral the intention, some rocket scientist will inevitably introduce a racist angle, and the \"banter\" will spiral out of control. While the rest of us chuckle at these fewls.\n* If you dare disagree with someone else, no matter how valid your point of view, you could be branded a troll.\n* If you dare to post a controversial - and possibly truthful - observation, your comment could be deleted, never to be seen on this forum again.\n* Julius is entertaining and frustrating, nobody in their right mind wants him as president, but everyone can't wait to read about his latest escapades.\n* Nobody is permitted to air their honest views about Zuma - see earlier point.\n* Many people from outside the Western Cape believe that Zille and the DA are evil and will rant about it until they're blue in the face. While Capetonians enjoy their beautiful city and province.\n* If anyone speaks honestly and positively about overseas countries, it is inevitable that someone will tell them to either leave or go back there, as SA won't miss them.\n* Any article containing the words \"Pistorius\" or \"Dewani\" draws hundreds of comments, debate and patting-on-the-back, and very few views by legally qualified people.\n* Don't mess with our rhinos, lions or other animals. Ever. We love our animals. People... not so much.\n* We also love the children, which is also great.\n* It's acceptable to publish an \"article\" that is really just a collection of animated gifs. (Really?)\nThere's probably lots of things I've left out, so remind us all of your pet peeves or observations, before we lose our voices. Troll away!\n(Meanwhile, I'm wondering whether this guff gets published at all.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T14:05:06.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
