That won’t change because of the significance of the day.” \nPrince Charles and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, won’t be present at Balmoral Castle for the event due to their royal engagements. \nA recent report claimed that Kate and William would tour overseas next year and although the location is unknown, as any official statement in this regard has not been made yet, it has been rumored that the royal couple is set for a Caribbean tour.
