The company issued the following statement: \"We have discovered a bug in development of watchOS 2 that is taking a bit longer to fix than we expected. We will not release watchOS 2 today but will shortly.\"\nApple did not explain what the issue was or how soon the updated software would be made available.\nThe new software is supposed to deliver faster performance to your wrist and supply new watch face options, including the ability to use your own photos as the watch face. Apple also says there'll be more \"native\" apps for the watch that don't require you to use your phone.\nApple has refused to disclose sales figures for the Apple Watch but said that there are now 10,000 apps available for the company's high tech timepiece. The competition for the watch space has been heating up with new smart watches coming from Samsung, Motorola (Lenovo), LG and Huawei. And some Android Wear watches are now compatible with the iPhone thanks to recently announced software from Google.\nApple is still expected to deliver iOS 9 today, the latest mobile operating software for the iPhone and iPad.\nFollow Ed Baig on Twitter: @edbaig .\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Kg4B89 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Kg4B89&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/16/USATODAY/ExperienceWeekend/635779987190055121-apple-watch-pic.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1Kg4B89", "http://twitter.com/edbaig", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/71c863fa97f6025ba81b0ba461a34d5a38b89141/c=0-298-2400-2103&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/16/USATODAY/ExperienceWeekend/635779987190055121-apple-watch-pic.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c711c85d58e411988f13438d0dec93db9715f141/r=400x400/local/-/media/2015/09/16/USATODAY/ExperienceWeekend/635779987190055121-apple-watch-pic.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Kg4B89&text=Bug%20forces%20delay%20of%20Apple%20Watch%20software%20upgrade&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-09-16T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T01:05:44.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
