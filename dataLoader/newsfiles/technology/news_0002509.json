The grippers have force sensors to determine how strongly they are gripping, and a six-camera vision system with a positional accuracy of around 3mm. \nThe task was broken down into various sub tasks, one of which was inserting a dowel into a hole in a stick of wood – a task that most humans would find easy. \n(YouTube / CRI Group @ NTU) \nAs the video shows, the robot has to go through a pre-programmed sequence of motions to map out the shape of the surface and its edges, before pushing the dowel gently against the surface until it enters the hole. \nThe whole process essentially amounts to a system of trial-and-error, and takes significantly longer than an average human performing the same task. \nThe researchers said that, while tremendous progress has been made in 3D perception for robots in recent years, current 3D-vision systems are still not precise enough for fine assembly. \n(YouTube / CRI Group @ NTU) \nWhile this may come as a disappointment to anyone who has spent hours weeping over Ikea's cryptic picture instructions, those who are worried about the \"rise of the machines\" can rest assured that some tasks are still beyond the scope of artificial intelligence. \nThis is not the first time someone has attempted to build a robot capable of assembling Ikea furniture. In 2013, researchers from MIT demonstrated how a tag team of Kuka youBots could assemble an Ikea table.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:05:58.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
