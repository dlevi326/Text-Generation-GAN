Vince Caligiuri Share on twitter by John Stensholt A fledgling Melbourne sports GPS tracking technology business has attracted the backing of two BRW Rich List families.\nSports Performance Tracking, founded by 26-year-old amateur footballer William Strange, won the backing recently of investors Tony Gandel and Brady Scanlon.\nThe sons of Rich Listers John Gandel and Peter Scanlon, the pair injected almost $1 million into SPT to fund its expansion around Australia.\nStrange told The Australian Financial Review the investors would bring more rigour to the business.\n\"This definitely took a lot of discussions with them and they are some great people to talk to and learn from. They have been there before in businesses and will help us keep our focus.\"\nCatapult Sports International , another Australian GPS tracking company, has grown quickly by selling its tracking devices and related software to elite sports teams around the world, and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange late in 2014.\nSPT is pitching its business at what Strange calls the \"sub-elite\" level of amateur football or other sports clubs, as well as members of the public who want to track their exercise performances.\n\"The consumer market is such a big space â€“ there's 1.8 million people in that area in Australia alone,\" Strange said. \"So we see it as a massive opportunity. There are a lot of people who are passionate about sport, and we offer them something that could help them be the best they can possibly be.\"\n The SPT tracking devices, called GameTraka, do not provide live data and cannot be used indoors, but allow users to download information such as speed and distance covered.\nStrange said he had pitched the product deliberately at a level below and at a far lower price than Catapult, which sells its devices to AFL teams, NFL and NBA teams in the United States and soccer clubs in Europe.\nThe SPT units cost $299 each and Strange said he had sold about 750 units since starting the business in January. Most of those are with amateur clubs, though some sales have been to overseas teams. The Frankston Dolphins VFL team are among SPT's clients.\nStrange, an entrepreneur who established a men's underwear mail order business two years ago, also plays Australian rules football at an amateur level in Melbourne for Old Scotch.\n\"It means I have been able to test the product at every training session and match and ask the players what works and what feels comfortable and so on.\"\nHe hopes to attract the attention of more customers overseas, and potentially investors, when he travels to Finland in November, after winning the Slush Down Under start-up pitching competition earlier in 2015.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-09-20T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:04:12.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
