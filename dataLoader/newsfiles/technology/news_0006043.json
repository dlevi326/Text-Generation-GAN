Scott Stein/CNET\nGoogle Maps has found its way from the iPhone to Apple Watch, thanks to an update to Google's iOS map app released Tuesday.\nApple Watch compatibility was added to version 4.11.0 of the Web giant's iOS Maps app, offering owners of Apple's smartwatch the opportunity to look up directions from their wrists. The update also adds estimated times of arrival for trips made by bike, car, transit and walking, as well as the ability to call businesses and get directions from a list of places.\nUntil now, Apple Maps was the only option for Apple Watch owners who wanted directions from their wrist watch. In the three years since Cupertino, California-based Apple broke away from bundling Google Maps into iOS, its replacement, Apple Maps, has made improvements, but for many users of Apple's mobile operating system, Apple Maps was no match for Google Maps.\nThe Mountain View, California-based Google provided the maps function for iOS devices until the release of iOS 6 in fall 2012, when it was replaced by Apple's homegrown mapping solution. But the maps were found to be rife with embarrassing errors, leading Apple CEO Tim Cook to issue a rare public apology on the subject.\nApple retreated on claims that the app was the \"most powerful mapping service ever\" and even began promoting other maps apps in its App Store. In late 2012, Google Maps returned to the Apple's mobile platform in the form of a standalone app.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new functionality of Google Maps.\nThe app is available for free download from Apple's App Store.", "external_links": ["https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8", "http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/29/98cb55d3-d533-4661-8757-71ead042c37a/resize/570xauto/d28bb7ed11714f58e1bb6f2f2c69ae59/googlemapswatch.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T02:20:24.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
