Today, nine months later, we're looking at about 30pc to 35pc market share\", Mr Kalanick said. He did not specify whether that market was for all ride-hailing services including taxis, where Didi Kuaidi dominates, or just for private cars. \nUber also welcomed new regulations expected later this year governing ride-hailing services in China, Mr Kalanick said. \nHe also spoke of the importance of Uber's relationship with Baidu. \n\"We can get introductions to the city governments, the government officials that want to shepherd our kind of innovation and our kind of progress into their cities,\" he said. \n\"Progress is something we see the government be incredibly open to, whether it be about more jobs and less pollution, less congestion on the streets, better utilization of infrastructure, that kind of progress always has to be in harmony with stability and that is one of the big things that we partnered with the government on.\" \nMeanwhile, hundreds of cab drivers brought traffic to a crawl in Lisbon and other Portuguese cities as they held the latest in a string of protests worldwide against Uber. \nRecent months have seen a flurry of protests by drivers against the controversial smartphone-based ride service amid claims Uber provides unfair competition by flouting rules and restrictions regulating professional vehicles. \nUber launched in Lisbon a year ago but Antral - one of Portugal's main drivers' associations - earlier this year obtained a civil court ruling preventing the firm from operating nationwide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T05:24:47.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
