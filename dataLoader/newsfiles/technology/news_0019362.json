A big, big gun. Its a Sig Sauer P225/P6, Surefire A2 Aviator Flashlight Testosterone Special with a damn near 7 inch barrel. Its the same gun recomended by the Pope and used by his Swiss Guard.\nWhen I go to bed at night I put my gun next to me under my bed, just like Oscar Pistorius so if I hear a sound in the night I'm gonna be ready to blow anyone away who thinks hiding in a bathroom is gonna help him.\nI carry my gun every where. When I am on the move in the car or in the shopping mall I wear a Thunderwear concealed groin carry holster with a spare single-stack magazine. It bulges my groin very nicely and gives that extra confidince every gun lover needs when out in public. Groin carry works well. Just a bit harder for a quick draw when driving or sitting with the kids in McDonalds. With my gun in my groin I can feel the hard steels but it is sometimes hard to bend over but I do enjoy the envious looks from the weakling bleeding heart libtard men when they see me stroking my package with that special meaningful look in my eye.\nWhen I'm driving my bakkie and I cut someone off and he gets cross he'd better not try to pull me over to shout or swear cause the moment he gets out of the car I gonna shoot him in the face â€“ BANG! BANG! BANG!\nMy missus also always carries gun, a Baby Glock in a Flashbang bra holster. Man, when we go shopping we are checking out people who look skeef or for any crimnals trying to blow up an ATM or rob a cell phone store. Are they gonna get a skrik when my wife reaches into her bra and me fiddles with my pants and the lead starts flying. Yous better duck to be safe.\nWe teach or children to love guns and let them play with our guns . We remember them to take the bullets out first . We all feel so much better that our kids know how to use our guns proper.\nShooting up traffic signs is good practice but I like the gun range better. Me and my buddies practice lots of quick draws and learn a lot from YouTube videos on how to do it best. This video is especial good at showing how to draw your gun quick in a emergancy. I am a expert responsible gun owner .\nWe all need more guns everywhere. Lots of guns as that is gonna make us so much safer .\nI L V MY GUN!", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/XTGmTrQXrwg", "http://rawstory.com/2015/05/kentucky-deputy-accidentally-shoots-his-own-mom-after-bringing-gun-to-wedding/", "http://rawstory.com/2015/08/alabama-man-likely-shot-and-killed-by-two-year-old-son-police/", "http://rawstory.com/2015/06/here-are-11-myths-about-the-future-of-gun-control-debunked-after-the-charleston-shooting/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009L717LO", "http://www.thunderwear.com/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/18/woman-kills-self-adjusting-bra-holster/23640143/", "http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/bethlehem/index.ssf/2015/05/man_shoots_self_in_groin_in_gu.html", "http://rawstory.com/2015/05/kentucky-woman-shot-by-2-year-old-son-over-mothers-day-weekend/", "http://rawstory.com/2015/07/three-year-old-texas-boy-dies-after-accidentally-shooting-himself/", "https://us.glock.com/products/model/g26gen4", "http://washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/14/more-guns-more-crime-new-research-debunks-a-central-thesis-of-the-gun-rights-movement/"], "published": "2015-09-03T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T20:02:19.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
