They were killed under circumstances “that are not yet clear,” a statement from the ministry said.\nIn a post on his Twitter account, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto called on Egypt to launch a thorough investigation.\nThe attack came on the same day the Islamic State claimed to have clashed with the Egyptian military in the western desert, a vast, sparsely populated area on the border with Libya. In a statement circulated on jihadist forums on Sunday, the Islamic State posted pictures of militants commanding vehicle-mounted weapons over desert landscapes. The statement said the group battled Egyptian troops and had chased them out of the area.\nThe Western Desert is home to several large oases, which in the past drew both foreign and Egyptian visitors to the area. But Egypt’s tourism industry has plummeted in the years following the country’s pro-democracy uprising in 2011. In July 2014, militants killed more than 20 Egyptian soldiers in a sophisticated attack on a checkpoint near the Farafra oasis.\nTourism ministry spokeswoman Rasha al-Ayazi told Egypt’s state-run Middle East News Agency that the convoy did not obtain security clearance before entering the area.\nEgypt has seen a rise in attacks by Islamist militants on military and civilian targets since an army coup ousted the president and Islamist leader Mohamed Morsi from power in 2013.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@erinmcunningham"], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:09:46.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
