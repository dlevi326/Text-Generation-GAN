(Representative photo) RELATED LONDON: Increasing number of teenagers are spending their spare time on Facebook or surfing the internet rather than reading books, according to a new survey in UK. More than half (54%) of six to eight year-olds are frequent readers and read books for fun five to seven days a week, but less than a quarter of teens are frequent readers of books, the researchers found. Around 24% of 12 to 14-year-olds pick up a book this often, and this drops to just 17% in 15 to 17-year-olds. A child's enjoyment of reading also declines with age, with 80'% of those aged six to eight reporting they love or like reading, compared with 43% of 15 to 17-year-olds. They tend to spend more time playing games or logging on to the internet via tablets or smartphones, the study found. Parents see the value in reading aloud with nine in 10 saying they read books aloud at home before their child turns six primarily to encourage reading enjoyment and to foster development of language skills. About 77% of children up to five said they read aloud five to seven days a week.This declines to 37% among children aged six to eight.
