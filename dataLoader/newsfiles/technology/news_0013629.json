Simona Halep, of Romania, takes a break between games against Flavia Pennetta, of Italy, during a semifinal match at the U.S. Open tennis tournament, Friday, Sept. 11, 2015, in New York. \nNEW YORK (AP) - The Latest on the U.S. Open (all times local): \n8:15 p.m. \nLittle consolation for Serena Williams, surely, but the WTA announced hours after her loss in the U.S. Open semifinals that the 33-year-old American has clinched the year-end No. 1 ranking. \nIt will be Williams' fifth season finishing at No. 1. Only three other women have done it at least that many times: Steffi Graf (eight), Martina Navratilova (seven), Chris Evert (five). \nWilliams' current stint at No. 1 began in February 2013. \nShe is 53-3 this in 2015, 26-1 at major tournaments. Her bit to complete a calendar-year Grand Slam ended with a three-set loss to 43rd-ranked Roberta Vinci of Italy on Friday. \n___ \n6:50 p.m. \nTop-ranked Novak Djokovic crushed defending champ Marin Cilic in the U.S. Open semifinals. \nDjokovic improved to 14-0 against Cilic with a 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 victory in 85 minutes Friday. \nCilic has had an uneven season since his surprise win at Flushing Meadows last year, but he had played well in returning to the site of his only major title. That all changed against Djokovic. \nThe nine-time Grand Slam champion dropped just 11 points in the first set. Djokovic had only 16 winners, playing clean tennis while his opponent's mistakes piled up. \nCilic got 45 percent of his first serves in and lost 78 percent of his second-serve points. \nDjokovic will meet a Swiss opponent in Sunday's final: Roger Federer faces Stan Wawrinka in the second semi. \n___ \n4:55 p.m. \nLeander Paes and Martina Hingis have become the first mixed doubles team since 1969 to win three major titles in the same year. \nThey beat Americans Sam Querrey and Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-4, 3-6, 10-7 tiebreak in the U.S. Open final Friday. \nPaes and Hingis also won the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year. \nThe 42-year-old Paes became the winningest male mixed doubles player in the Open era with his ninth Grand Slam title. He also has won eight major men's doubles championships. \nHingis has now won a total of 19 Grand Slam trophies: five singles, 10 women's doubles and four mixed doubles. She has a chance to add another in the women's doubles final with Sania Mirza on Sunday. \nQuerrey and Mattek-Sands had never played together before and were a last-minute pairing when Mattek-Sands' regular partner, Mike Bryan, decided not to play mixed at the U.S. Open. \n___ \n4 p.m. \nRoberta Vinci's stunning upset of Serena Williams drew reactions from dignitaries on both sides of the Atlantic. \nAfter the American's bid for the first Grand Slam since 1988 ended, first lady Michelle Obama tweeted: \"So proud of you, @SerenaWilliams. What you did this year was amazing.\" \nWith Vinci set to face countrywoman Flavia Pennetta in an unlikely U.S. Open final, Italian Premier Matteo Renzi tweeted in Italian: \"Marvelous Flavia and Roberta!!!\" \n___ \n3:45 p.m. \nIf Serena Williams' U.S. Open loss to Roberta Vinci seemed inexplicable, one popular theory is circulating about it on social media. \nSee, rapper Drake was in the stands rooting on Williams, and even before Friday he had developed a reputation as bad luck for teams and athletes. Hang around Drake too long, the evidence is starting to mount, and stunning losses happen. Case in point: Kentucky basketball, whose undefeated season ended in - sound familiar? - the semifinals of the NCAA Tournament against Wisconsin. \nSoon after Williams' bid for the first Grand Slam since 1988 came to a halt in shocking fashion, the hashtags \"blamedrake\" and \"drakecurse\" started to trend on Twitter. \n___ \n3 p.m. \nRoberta Vinci has stunned Serena Williams to end her Grand Slam bid in one of the greatest upsets in tennis history. \nThe 43rd-ranked Italian won 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 in the U.S. Open semifinals Friday. \nVinci had never won a set off the 21-time major champion in four previous meetings and was in her first career Grand Slam semifinal at age 32. \nSo tense she was guiding in overheads, Williams became more and more frustrated by Vinci's defense and creative shot-making in the final two sets. She had won in three sets 11 times in majors this year in her pursuit of the first Grand Slam since Steffi Graf in 1988, but was unable to dig out of this hole. \n___ \n2:10 p.m. \nUnseeded Roberta Vinci has pushed Serena Williams to a third set in the U.S. Open semifinals. \nWith Williams two victories from completing the first Grand Slam since 1988, Vinci won a set off the 21-time major champion for the first time in five meetings. \nVinci, in her first Grand Slam semifinal, took the second set 6-4, saving a break point in the final game, after Williams won the first 6-2 on Friday. \nWilliams has won in three sets 11 times at the majors this year. \n___ \n12:20 p.m. \nFlavia Pennetta has reached her first Grand Slam final at age 33. \nThe Italian routed second-seeded Simona Halep 6-1, 6-3 at the U.S. Open on Friday. While Pennetta looked calm and moved freely, Halep, a decade her junior, seemed tense and drained. \nThe Romanian, who made last year's French Open final, had 23 unforced errors to 10 winners. \nPennetta trailed 3-1 in the second set before winning 15 straight points to move within a game of victory. She broke Halep's serve to clinch the win, burying her face in her hands in stunned joy after hitting her 23rd winner on match point. \nThe 26th-seeeded Pennetta faces Serena Williams or Roberta Vinci in Saturday's final.
