Along with the adoption of its new name and tagline, TechWell is simultaneously relaunching TechWell.com as its new corporate website. TechWell’s training division will continue to operate under the name SQE Training.\n“The software development and quality landscape has changed much in the past thirty years. When Software Quality Engineering (SQE) was founded in 1986, the name worked within the confines of the company’s focus at the time. As time has passed, our offerings have expanded to cover the entire software lifecycle, and our name has become less identifiable with what we do. Thus, it is time for a change, and TechWell better reflects our company vision as well as our suite of events and resources for software professionals,” said Wayne Middleton, CEO of TechWell Corporation.\nTechWell’s new tagline—Learn. Connect. Contribute.—embodies the products and services TechWell offers to the software and IT industries. Software developers, testers, and managers learn at TechWell conferences, in SQE Training classes, by reading Better Software magazine, and through online resources. They connect with peers and subject experts in TechWell’s web communities, during conferences, and at training events. They contribute their expertise and practical advice as authors, speakers, and community members.\nIn addition to the new company name, TechWell.com will become the new corporate website. Featuring a clean, modern design, TechWell.com will publish daily TechWell Insights, stories covering industry trends, upcoming events, and advice from its cadre of software practitioners and experts.\nTechWell will continue SQE’s long tradition of offering software professionals the best training, events, and resources via its family of events and communities: SQE Training, the STAR software testing conferences, Better Software conferences, Agile Dev conferences, DevOps conferences, Mobile Dev + Test conferences, IoT Dev + Test conferences, Better Software magazine, and the online communities StickyMinds, AgileConnection, and CMCrossroads.\nTechWell new name—same great products and people.\nFor more information, visit TechWell.com.\nAbout TechWell Corporation:\nTechWell Corporation has been a leader in the software industry for twenty-nine years, delivering a variety of software training, conferences, publications, consulting, and website communities.
