Rough Cut (no reporter narration).   \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) The United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V551 successfully launched the U.S. Navy's forth User Objective System (MUOS-4) satellite on Wednesday (September 2) morning from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The engine ignited and lift off was a success as Atlas Mission control reported live on the status of the launch and the location of the satellite even after it disappeared from site. The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) is the Navy's next-generation narrowband tactical satellite communications system, according to ULA website. The satellite is reportedly designed to use a combination of orbiting satellites and relay ground stations to significantly improve communications for U.S. forces on the move. The Navy says it expects that 'MUOS will provide new beyond-line-of-sight secure communications capabilities, with smartphone-like simultaneous voice, video and data - to connect military users almost anywhere around the globe.'  //www.reuters.com}/assets/iframe/yovideo?videoId=365469777\"></iframe> http://reut.rs/1EytwnW Atlas V launches Navy satellite into space 8:07am EDT - 00:54", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T16:15:59.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
