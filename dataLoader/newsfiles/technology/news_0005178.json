The ADB cut China's growth forecast for this year to 6.8% from 7.2%.\nA slowdown in the region's growth powerhouse is expected to hurt developing Asia \"directly through reduced trade and indirectly through lower commodity prices,\" the report's authors wrote. Striking a hopeful note, the bank said as a recovery in major industrial economies takes hold, downward pressure on China could ease.\nExpectations that India, the region's second-largest economy, would provide a bounce to developing Asia's growth as China retreats, have waned as planned reforms stay stuck in low gear.\n\"Unfortunately, India is not yet in a position to pick up the slack in demand from a moderating [China],\" the ADB report said.\nThe region's falling growth forecasts highlight the need to \"identify untapped resources in the region.\" Narrowing gender gaps in the region's labor markets could bolster growth. Bringing more women into the labor force could increase per capita income by 70% in roughly 60 years, the bank estimates.\nWrite to Anjani Trivedi at anjani.trivedi@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T08:47:09.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
