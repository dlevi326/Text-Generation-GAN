Prepare to take out your money to own this engineering marvel. \n- Advertisement - \nWe had earlier taken a look at the Xperia Z5 which is amazing, but this one is in a league of its own. This time around, Sony made the incredible shift from Full HD to 4K display that is starting to find its footing in the television arena. Is it just a gimmick or more than that? Let’s find out. \nWell for starters, we all know clearly enough that spills and splashes happen, but with a Xperia device, you don’t have to worry about anything. The Xperia Z5 Premium comes with the highest IP68 rating which means that you can trust the technology can handle dips in the bath or rinsing under the tap; and when the rain comes, you won't be running for cover. Just remember that all ports and covers must be firmly closed. To add a bit more protection, the scratch-resistant glass and oleophobic coating as an added measure. \nComing in at 154.4 x 75.8 x 7.8 mm (6.08 x 2.98 x 0.31 in) and weighs 180 g (6.35 oz), the Xperia Z5 Premium is pretty slim but of the average weight. There’s also a stunning mirror effect on the back which adds to its aesthetics value. It should also come with a fingerprint sensor for additional unlocking and verification techniques. Intuitively placed on the side of the phone, you can pick up and securely unlock your phone in a single movement. \nThe Xperia Z5 Premium, which is expected to be available in November 2015, will be sporting a 5.5-inch 4K IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with a whopping 2160 x 3840 pixels or ~806 ppi pixel density. Don’t think we have ever been exposed to this kind of high resolution. It takes a giant leap in display technology, adding more pixels that is 10x the pixels of a Full HD TV, and more than double of other smartphones. \nEven under the hood of the Xperia Z5 Premium is excellent. We found out that it will have the same hardware specs as the original which is the Qualcomm MSM8994 Snapdragon 810 chipset. Paired with an Octa-core processor comprising a Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2 GHz Cortex-A57 processor, Adreno 430 graphics and 3GB RAM. You should not face any difficulties in getting it to run any apps or games that are out there. - Advertisement - \nCamera-wise, it should have the same setup as the Xperia Z5 with its amazing 23 Megapixel primary camera with 5520 х 4140 pixels, phase detection autofocus, LED flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama. You can capture the world in incredible high-resolution 4K video. This means that your videos have four times the detail of Full HD. Add to that a host of Sony handy-cam technologies, including Steadyshot™ for stable videos, it will give you a seamless and flawless footage. \nAs far as storage is concerned, there will be 32GB internal storage awaits you and it should be able to cater for all of your high-resolution photos. If that’s not enough, you can add in a microSD slot up to a maximum of 200GB. With the amount of high-resolution photos and videos that you will be taking, expect it to fill up quite fast. \nAs far as battery goes, the Xperia Z5 Premium will have a non-removable Li-Ion 3430 mAh battery that practically can last you for two days. Watch more films, listen to more music, carry on chatting and stay out without a care. When you do need topping up, there’s the Quick Charger, which gives you hours of power in just 10 minutes of charging. \nIn terms of operating system, you don’t have to worry as it should be coming with the latest Android Lollipop 5.1.1. - Advertisement - \nThe Sony Xperia Z5 Premium takes an already amazing device and slap in a 4K display resolution, thus making it the world’s first 4K display smartphone. That alone is a huge bragging right. Coupled with the fact that it has amazing hardware, amazing camera, huge battery life, and a host of protection – you will be getting the best that money can buy. The only thing to worry about is whether you have that kind of money to spend on a smartphone. \nSony Xperia Z5 Premium is expected to be available in November 2015 although there’s no word on the pricing just yet. But judging by the fact that the Xperia Z5 will be available for ~$839 USD, this device may cost much more than that. It will be available in Chrome, Black and Gold.
