I demand the company's management to change it and not turn an app into a political tool.\"\nJerusalem police also responded to the report, telling Ynet that \"Police are acting together with Waze for the benefit of its users and to better direct them to their destination, with an emphasis on holidays and special events during which routes are closed,\" stressing that \"police officers are deployed throughout Jerusalem and especially in East Jerusalem in order to ensure safe travel on all of the city's routes.\"\nWaze is a popular Israeli navigation application that was bought by Google bought in 2013 in a deal worth over $1 billion.\nShare this post", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://nauca.com.ua/plugins/socbuttons-v14/", "http://platform.linkedin.com/in.js", "http://twitter.com/share?text=Waze%20Wants%20Users%20to%20Stay%20Away%20From%20PA%20Controlled%20Territory&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jewishvoiceny.com%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D12096%3Awaze-wants-users-to-stay-away-from-pa-controlled-territory%26catid%3D96%3Abusiness%26Itemid%3D279", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jewishvoiceny.com%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D12096%3Awaze-wants-users-to-stay-away-from-pa-controlled-territory%26catid%3D96%3Abusiness%26Itemid%3D279&title=Waze%20Wants%20Users%20to%20Stay%20Away%20From%20PA%20Controlled%20Territory", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?locale=en_US&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jewishvoiceny.com%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26amp%3Bview%3Darticle%26amp%3Bid%3D12096%26amp%3Bcatid%3D96%26amp%3BItemid%3D279&layout=button_count&show_faces=true&action=like&colorscheme=light&font=&height=20", "http://technorati.com/faves?add=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jewishvoiceny.com%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D12096%3Awaze-wants-users-to-stay-away-from-pa-controlled-territory%26catid%3D96%3Abusiness%26Itemid%3D279", "http://twitter.com/share", "http://digg.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jewishvoiceny.com%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D12096%3Awaze-wants-users-to-stay-away-from-pa-controlled-territory%26catid%3D96%3Abusiness%26Itemid%3D279&title=Waze%20Wants%20Users%20to%20Stay%20Away%20From%20PA%20Controlled%20Territory", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jewishvoiceny.com%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D12096%3Awaze-wants-users-to-stay-away-from-pa-controlled-territory%26catid%3D96%3Abusiness%26Itemid%3D279&t=Waze%20Wants%20Users%20to%20Stay%20Away%20From%20PA%20Controlled%20Territory", "http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jewishvoiceny.com%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D12096%3Awaze-wants-users-to-stay-away-from-pa-controlled-territory%26catid%3D96%3Abusiness%26Itemid%3D279&title=Waze%20Wants%20Users%20to%20Stay%20Away%20From%20PA%20Controlled%20Territory", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jewishvoiceny.com%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D12096%3Awaze-wants-users-to-stay-away-from-pa-controlled-territory%26catid%3D96%3Abusiness%26Itemid%3D279&title=Waze%20Wants%20Users%20to%20Stay%20Away%20From%20PA%20Controlled%20Territory", "http://www.google.com/bookmarks/mark?op=edit&bkmk=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jewishvoiceny.com%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D12096%3Awaze-wants-users-to-stay-away-from-pa-controlled-territory%26catid%3D96%3Abusiness%26Itemid%3D279"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:13:48.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
