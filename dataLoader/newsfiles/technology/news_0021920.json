Another two sources confirmed this.\nGrajewo shareholders approved the issue the issue of up to 40 million shares, aimed at Polish investors, in July.\nDeutsche Bank and BNP declined to comment.\n\"Much is already happening, they have already met with analysts. Everything will depend on how attractive the transaction will be,\" said a Warsaw-based banker, adding that Commerzbank and PKO BP were also involved.\nCommerzbank, which controls Poland's No.4 lender mBank , was not immediately available for comment.\nGrajewo, Pfleiderer and PKO all declined to comment.\nUnder the new ownership structure, Grajewo would be dominated by Polish investors, mainly investment and pension funds, effectively ending German control.\nSome investors are concerned about the timing, as Poland is due to hold general elections in late October that may bring a major change to the political scene.\nOpinion polls suggest voters are preparing to dump the centre-right Civic Platform government in office since 2007 and install the conservative Law and Justice party, which is sceptical about ceding more powers to the EU.\nOthers concerned about the transaction point to the fact that Grajewo's market value has fallen by almost a fourth to $320 million so far this year.\n\"Everyone is wondering whether this is just an option for the main shareholder to dump the company - and judging by the share price drop the market is not convinced,\" the investment banker said.
