Holden held the equivalent of a five-course gourmet spread, with fields of lilies and trilliums, plus rhododendrons and azaleas sprouting fat spring buds that tasted like candy to a hungry deer.\n\"We haven't had hostas or tulips here for decades,\" said Roger Gettig, Holden's director of horticulture and conservation. \"We're fencing them out so we don't have to shoot them.\"\nSo Monday afternoon, about 90 volunteers and Holden staffers convened for a Deer Drive designed to sweep out the remnants of a herd from inside the fence. The participants broke up into groups of about 10 or 15. Then they fanned out across the Holden fields and woodlands, making lots of noise, yelling and clapping their hands, as they tramped along in search of hidden deer.\nAfter about 15 minutes, a shout rang out from a nearby group: \"Woo hoo! A deer!\" A quick scan of the field revealed a leaping doe in full retreat, flashing its bright white tail as it disappeared toward the exit gate.\nDeer trails of beaten-down grass snaked through the meadows of goldenrod, ironweed and Joe Pye weed. The roundup crew did its best to avoid thorns of blackberry bushes and multiflora rose, but some couldn't avoid getting bloody arms and legs.\nAs a group tracked deer prints onto an island on Corning Lake, horticulturist Lori Gogolin's radio crackled to life.\n\"Someone saw a buck,\" she reported.\nThe spotter was Jeff Frischkorn, a writer for Ohio Outdoor News, who was driving along Sperry Road when he said he saw the buck trotting alongside his SUV, then run and leap out of one of the exits.\nA different group also saw a fawn flee the property, which brought the final tally of deer sightings to three -- which was less than expected, but a good result, nevertheless, said Chad Knisely, the natural areas manager who organized the Deer Drive.\nKnisely said he was pleased with the results as he was reasonably sure the core area of gardens was clear of deer before the gates were closed for the final time.\n\"This wouldn't have been possible without the volunteers,\" said Cait Anastis, editor of Holden's quarterly magazine, Leaves. \"We're just closing off the buffet.\"\nThe Holden people said they weren't worried about the other critters that reside in the arboretum, such as foxes, raccoons and coyotes, which can crawl through the holes in the fence.\nA black bear was seen last week pacing outside the fence, but they are able to easily climb over the fence if they decide to check out the gardens, Anastis said.\nThe $400,000 deer fence was a key component of Holden's $8.9 million New Leaf capital plan, which also includes the restoration of Corning Lake and Lotus Pond, and the construction of the soon-to-open Canopy Walk and Emergent Tower.\nThe permanent fence around the arboretum's perimeter was designed to replace the biannual erecting and tearing down of miles of temporary fencing around new trees and the park's gardens.\n\"What a difference that will make, obviating all those individual protective fences we have installed every winter,\" President and CEO Clement Hamilton wrote in the latest edition of Leaves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:16:30.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
