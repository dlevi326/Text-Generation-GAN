These engines are basically low-thrust propulsion systems with a long run time and because of this long runtime these are the best engines for spacecraft flight. These engines generate thrust by ionizing a propellant gas and then accelerating that gas through the engine using an electrostatic or electromagnetic field. There are a variety of ion engines that use different ionizing materials and different propulsion systems. Now a researcher from University of Sydney Dr. Patrick Neumann, claims to have created the world’s most efficient ion engine. Up until now, it was NASA’s HiPEP engine that held the record for ion drive performance. Dr. Neumann created the engine as part of his PhD thesis and is using the invention to form the basis of his new company Neumann Space. The Neumann drive uses a solid propellant and an electrical arc to vaporize the propellant into a cloud of ions, electrons and neutral vapor. This mixture is accelerated through an anode ring and then focused using a magnetic field. This combination pushes the gas mixture out in a contiguous pattern of short and light bursts.
