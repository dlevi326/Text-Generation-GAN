This is because Deutsche still has to resolve ongoing litigation and investigations and faces 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in outstanding fines and settlements, according to analysts' estimates.\nDeutsche ability to lighten its balance sheet through a sale of its 20 percent stake in Chinese brokerage Hua Xia ( 600015.SS ) is likely to have been hampered by extreme volatility in Asian markets.\nWhile sweeping change may be out of reach, Cryan will be able to shrink the bank from a global business to a regional one focusing on Europe, the United States and Asia.\nThat means Deutsche would be likely to keep its retail operations in Italy and Spain but sell operations in South America and Africa, certain operations in Asia, and others such as Russia.\nThe supervisory board is impatient for change. “I expect straight talk,” one member of the board told Reuters ahead of the meeting. Cryan was a member of the supervisory board before his appointment as CEO in July.\nWhile the supervisory board ultimately holds a veto over the bank’s strategy, the management board is charged with formulating it.\nA spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the meeting but said that details of the strategic plan were to be expected by the end of October.\n(Additional reporting by Andreas Kroener and Arno Schuetze.
