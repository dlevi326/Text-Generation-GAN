Key findings revealed that the large majority of respondents are aware of hyperconvergence, and more than half already have plans for deployment. The top two drivers for respondents’ planned adoption include “simplifying deployment and scaling” and “reducing operational complexity.” \nThe Springpath “VMworld 2015 Survey” found: More than 75 percent of respondents have some level of awareness of hyperconvergence. More than 50 percent of respondents already have plans to deploy hyperconvergence, with about 30 percent reporting immediate implementation within one year. Main drivers for deploying hyperconvergence included operational challenges, specifically simplifying deployment and scaling and reducing overall operational complexity (60 percent); virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) initiatives (26 percent); and hardware upgrades (20 percent). Additional reasons for deploying hyperconvergence were DevOps initiative, virtualization initiatives, new application deployment and others. \n“The survey results are a good indicator that hyperconvergence is already here and is taking the industry by storm, said Ashish Gupta, vice president of marketing at Springpath. “With disruptive technologies, the market usually witnesses general interest followed by long-term plans of at least two years to implement. With Springpath, however, half of our participants for this survey already have specific plans to deploy hyperconvergence, with 30 percent planning to do so within a year.” \nSpringpath’s hyperconvergence software dramatically lowers IT operational burden for variety of use cases including server virtualization, development and test environments, VDI, and remote offices and branch offices (ROBOs), while delivering a flexible and powerful hyperconverged solution.
