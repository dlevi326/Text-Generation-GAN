Edward Baran reports.   \nIt may look just like its electrical cousin but in fact this is a gas stove --- but it has no open flame. The \"gas-under-glass\" stove is made in a plant in south-west Poland, and has already found customers at home and abroad thanks to its efficiency, which inventors say is 50 per cent higher than traditional gas stoves. Its makers say this is achieved thanks to very effective burning of the gas inside the stove. (SOUNDBITE) Mieczyslaw Kaczmarczyk \"Inside there are highly effective, catalytic gas burners which burn the gas superbly. Their unique feature is that the combustion of gas occurs at a very high temperature, about 800 degrees (Celsius). Therefore the gas burns completely, it burns very accurately, and harmful gases such as carbon monoxide or nitrogen oxides are not produced.\" The company's engineers say emission levels for harmful substances from the combustion of gas can be 10 times lower than norms for open-flame gas stoves. Gas consumption is, they say, also reduced by up to 50 per cent. Initially, the stove was designed by a former engineer of the company for his wife, but the solution proved so effective that after several years of tests and research it was adopted for production. (SOUNDBITE) (Polish) JAKUB BIEL, SOLGAZ MARKETING MANAGER, SAYING: \"An important aspect here is safety because inside we have applied two kinds of security measures. The first is as in any ordinary gas stove and the second is an electronic protection against gas leaks which constantly checks if the gas is being extracted\" The stove can be used anywhere where supplying the current needed for an electric stove might be difficult, or in places that use gas as the main heating source.  //www.reuters.com}/assets/iframe/yovideo?videoId=365457308\"></iframe> http://reut.rs/1Evfe7t Flameless gas stoves more efficient and cleaner, say inventors 11:43am BST - 01:45", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:24:33.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
