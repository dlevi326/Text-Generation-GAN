The software then switches off again, enabling cars to drive more powerfully on the road while emitting as much as 40 times the legal pollution limit. VW said it was setting aside around 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) to cover the cost of fixing the cars.\nGerman Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said he was setting up a commission to determine whether the VW diesel vehicles were built and examined in a way that complied with German and European rules. The governments of France and South Korea also said they would investigate the Volkswagen vehicles.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
