Key survey findings: Forty-nine percent of respondents said they expect sales to grow four percent to 10 percent this year, while 17 percent of respondents expect sales to grow 11 percent or more. The biggest trend that will have an impact on sales this year for dealers is consumer demand, cited by 44 percent of respondents, followed by product affordability and product availability, each selected by 15 percent. \n“We remain optimistic about the remainder of 2015, as we expect a solid holiday shopping season and close to the year,” said Judith Toland, commercial leader for electronics and appliances at CSHPI. “Also, with continued improvement in the U.S. economy, the upcoming home appliance replacement cycle and continued expansion into furniture and bedding, our independent dealers remain poised for growth well into 2016.” \nCSHPI conducted the survey at three industry events in the third quarter of this year. In total, 296 electronics, appliances, and home furnishing dealers responded to the survey. \nCSHPI has supported the electronics, appliances and home furnishings industry with flexible inventory financing products for more than 60 years, recently updating its branding, logo and website – which now includes a learning center for retailers – to reflect its continued support for the industry.
