All refugee claimants lost coverage for medication, vision and dental care, and for prostheses necessary for amputated limbs. No refugee claimant ever received more health care coverage than Canadians receiving social assistance. This was all confirmed in the July, 2014, ruling of the Federal Court, which found the cuts unconstitutional and “cruel and unusual” treatment. The federal government still has not fully complied.\nMr. Harper’s conclusion that that policy is something both new and “existing and old-stock Canadians agree with” is unbecoming of any political leader and has no place in the national discourse about refugees.\nPhilip B. Berger, medical director, Inner City Health Program, St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto\nPaying tomorrow\nNDP Leader Thomas Mulcair repeatedly used a specious argument during The Globe debate to justify the cornerstone of his economic platform – his opposition to deficit spending. Deficits are undesirable even to finance new infrastructure, he argued, because they impose a financial burden on future generations.\nHe ignored a key fact: No matter how new infrastructure is financed, the primary beneficiaries will be future generations. Therefore, they should help pay for it. Deficit financing facilitates that, because, for example, $100 borrowed today to buy buses will be repaid by future riders.\nIronically, future generations will be harmed without deficit financing. If people today must pay the full cost, they won’t buy enough buses for future generations. They will oppose paying $100 today for buses because they will receive few benefits.\nThe key question is not whether deficit financing is desirable, but whether the future benefits of the buses will justify their $100 cost today.\nLee Soderstrom, retired economics professor, McGill University; Outremont, Que.\nNot mentioned\nIt’s interesting that Jeffrey Simpson pointed out that during the debate, none of the leaders addressed balancing the environment, resources and aboriginal land claims, or noted the digital revolution (Talking Points Make For An Easy Escape – Sept. 18).\nThe fourth leader (who should have been on stage but wasn’t) took full advantage of Twitter (i.e. the digital revolution) to answer the debate questions.\nAlthough The Globe excluded Elizabeth May, she was the most cogent of the four leaders. Her answers were intelligent and thoughtful, not just well-rehearsed “talking points.” She demonstrates the qualities that represent “leadership.”\nOf course, she didn’t have the opportunity to “interrupt” or “talk over” the other debaters, so we’ll never know how she “measured up.” Had she been present, her civility and intelligence would not only have impressed many voters, but brought some ignored issues to the fore.\nShame on The Globe for excluding her. Good for her, to have so cleverly found another way to be part of the debate. The Green sign is going on my lawn.\nClaudette Claereboudt, Regina\nThe Globe claims that the Canadian economy is the most important election issue. It is not.\nAll governments struggle to influence the economy, mostly to little effect. What we need a debate on is the parlous state of our democracy and its institutions, something politicians can actually do something about.\nRobert Neville, Fort Langley, B.C.\nThe winner is …\nAny question Justin Trudeau was asked resulted in the same three points as an answer for the entire debate. Thomas Mulcair was hardly any better. Stephen Harper, when given the chance, spoke as a knowledgeable, veteran politician who has the big picture in mind in a worrisome global upheaval.\nCanadians do not need any more of these “debates” unless they are actual debates and not just rude “face time.” Mr. Trudeau, who constantly interrupted the other leaders, needs to think about what he is saying, rather than spouting memorized lines, and stop being be so rude.\nJinny Slyfield, Ottawa\nJeffrey Simpson asserts that Stephen Harper looked “cool and competent” during the debate, that Thomas Mulcair “tried to look like a statesman” and that Justin Trudeau “was on some kind of speed.” I disagree: Of the three, only Mr. Trudeau showed enthusiasm and innovation. After years of deficit governance, Mr. Harper is clearly yesterday’s man and Mr. Mulcair is moving so far right, he’ll soon be a neocon.\nMr. Trudeau’s enthusiastic presentation of a bold, if risky, new direction has my vote.\nWillem Hart, Toronto\nWhile Justin Trudeau shouted like a schoolyard bully to drown out his opponents, and Thomas Mulcair was almost as bad, Stephen Harper kept his cool and allowed the others to make their points, even though they did not offer him the same consideration. When meeting with other heads of state while representing Canada, we need a leader with a cool head, excellent manners and statesmanship. I saw only one of those during The Globe debate.\nJudi Annan, Mississauga\nDid Stephen Harper, Thomas Mulcair, Justin Trudeau (or a Tweeting, excluded Elizabeth May) come out on top? Lost in this debate about the debate is that it should have been a slam-dunk for Mr. Harper. He chose the sponsors. He got home location, the format he wanted, the topic he wanted and the exposure he wanted. Every advantage possible! Where was the triumph that should have followed?\nGlenn Kletke, Kanata, Ont.\nSpeaking (of/to) cats\nMy cat and I hold long conversations each morning. We have lots to discuss as he is a Stephen Harper fan, and I am not (he won’t admit it, but it’s the hair). As you can tell, we are a house divided. Anyway, during our talks we discuss birds (Curb Your Feline, Preserve the Birds – Sept 18).\nCedar loves to hunt and not quite eat them, and is perennially shocked when I am not impressed. Through my persistent nagging, however, he’s been persuaded to leave the birds alone.\nOr almost: When in the garden, he sits under the robin’s nest, or the edge of the fence where birds take a break, and stares at them while snapping his jaws. He calls terrorizing them a concession, but I am working on him.\nKate Korycki, Toronto\n Topics: Stephen Harper Justin Trudeau Jeffrey Simpson Thomas Mulcair Federal Court Comments A A", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T17:54:01.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
