Telecommunications conglomerate PCCW bought a majority stake in mobile video-on-demand service Vuclip in March and is expanding the service into new markets, including Africa.\n“We’ve spent an enormous amount of money building the platform,” Marc Halbfinger, chief executive officer of PCCW Global, said at the presentation. “We have a very long time line on what success will be. We do intend to invest a great deal in this product.”\nOnTAPtv is specifically designed for smartphones and will receive data from U.K. provider AlwaysON Ltd., Servian said.\nCape Town-based Naspers started its ShowMax service in August, while Netflix is seeking to expand into as many as 200 markets, including Africa, by the end of next year.", "external_links": ["http://www.pccw.com/About+PCCW/Media+Center/Press+Releases/Detail?guid=489af63f2560c410VgnVCM1000006a8ba8c0____&language=en_US\\"], "published": "2015-09-16T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T14:07:31.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
