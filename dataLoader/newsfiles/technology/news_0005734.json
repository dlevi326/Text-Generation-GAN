The target means 10 to 12 percent of the 252,000 workers joining HP Enterprise will lose their jobs as part of the company's effort to reduce its expenses by $2 billion annually. \nRoughly 50,000 workers will remain at HP Inc., which become the new name for the company retaining the PC and printer operations. \nThe cuts expand upon austerity measures that HP has been pursuing for years to offset the damage caused by acquisitions that haven't panned out and a technological shift from PCs to mobile devices that reduced demand for many of the company's key products. \nHP has already jettisoned 55,000 jobs during past few years under CEO Meg Whitman , who will be the leader of spun-off HP Enterprise. In an illustration of how far HP has fallen, its job cuts are being made while many other technology companies better positioned to take advantage of the mobile evolution have been on hiring sprees. \nFor instance, Google's workforce has swelled by 25,000 employees, or 77 percent, during the past four years. \nHP's layoffs have been demoralizing blow to a company that provided a template for future Silicon Valley entrepreneurs when William Hewlett and David Packard founded it 76 years ago in a Palo Alto, California, garage. Hewlett and Packard later embraced an employee-friendly philosophy that became known as the \"HP Way.\" \nThings began to change at the outset of this century under former CEO Carly Fiorina , now a candidate for the Republican Party's nomination in the 2016 race for president. Fiorina engineered a $25 billion acquisition of PC maker Compaq that angered many shareholders, including heirs of the company's founders. She cut more than 30,000 jobs before she was fired a decade ago. \nFiorina's successor, Mark Hurd , also lowered expenses through much of his tenure and orchestrated an acquisition of technology consultants EDS that many analysts believe did more harm than good. Hurd stepped down in 2010 in a dispute over his expenses and his involvement with an HP contractor. \nDespite the upheaval, HP remains one of the world's biggest technology companies. HP Enterprise expects to have more than $50 billion in annual revenue. \nWhitman is touting the splintering of HP as a way to breathe new life into two companies that will be better suited to innovate in their own product areas and take care of their customers. \nHP Enterprise focuses primarily on businesses and government agencies, while the PC and printing divisions depend on the consumer market for a significant chunk of their revenue. \n\"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today,\" Whitman promised in a Tuesday statement.
