It was sent to me from a friend that was working in this area in DR Congo Beginning of snippet Now if you dont mind let me take you back a few years I was contracted to a company by the name of No 1 Contracting Company based in New York, building a road between Kikwi t and Tshikapa in Southern Congo close to the border with Northern Angola . Just as a point of interest : Kikwit is the town where Ebola was first diagnosed many years agoBoy did we pass trough that town with out touching sides Tshikapa on the other-end is the heart of major diamond fields (talk about \"blood diamonds!!\" this is/was it man) The road that we build there ran parallel to a power line with huge pillions for support. I inspected several of these pillions only to find that every bolt and nut and every strut on these pillions had a YSKOR stamp on them (Very Strange) YSKOR was the huge steel factory here in South Africa at the time. Ya it makes one think (me think USA Henry Kissinger and SA Pik Botha scooped up more than a slice of PIZZA there but more like PIZZA with a diamond studded anchovy filling. After fishing around I was told that this power line was built by USA ex-marines just after the Vietnam war and that these soldiers were part of a redundant group that the US government could not accommodate. I also found out that this power line was specially built to transport electricity between INGA [DRC] Hydroelectric facility in the Congo river straight into South Africa a distance of almost 3000 km. Imagine all the steel and conducting cable was used, -- I stood underneath that line and from the sound of it it was very much alive. This was done during the time of the huge civil war in Angola and a war where the South African military was heavily involved End of snippet Since this email, I was in that same area in DR Congo. It is very much true After my own little investigation the following came to light#1:An Italian consortium conducted a survey of this natural INGA power potential#2: They concluded that if brought to its full potential this INGA can deliver enough power to the WHOLE of EUROPE and have some change left Question Time :#1: How come the South African government cannot let our country benefit from this ??#2: Instead of blowing trillions on a nuclear power station with all the dangerous waste, rather take a fraction of that money and build a second line for support ??#3: How many jobs can be created in such a project ??#4: Many questions can be asked from this information,please just think it over ----\nAs a conclusion: INGA is a natural phenomena:It has a natural reservoir in the form of the Congo river basin that crosses the equator twice, therefore it never runs dry.The Congo river can be related to the Amazon in South Americas and pushes freshwater into the sea for several kilometers along the African West Coast\nCan this be investigated before it is toooo late\nI will help if need beContact:John De Bruinmobile:0729100035jaydebee3@gmail,com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T22:06:07.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
