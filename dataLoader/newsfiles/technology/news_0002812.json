Getty Police try and control migrants as they desperately try and board a train heading for Zagreb from Tovarnik station \nIt has already opened pages in countries including Cameroon and Ethiopia, inviting residents to leave their home and come to work in Europe. \nThe jobs on offer in Germany range from drivers positions to high end programmer roles which are likely to come with big pay packets. \nThe new website was set up by Rocket Internet, a huge tech firm known for its work in developing markets. \nOn the German Everjobs page, the firm wrote: \"It’s never easy finding a job, especially if you factor into the equation work permits and the stress of moving your entire family to a new country. \n\"Sometimes it can be overwhelming looking for job opportunities in your home country let alone a completely new one. Reuters Risky business: Refugees gamble with their lives in a bid to reach Europe \n\"We believe and fully encourage people to seek out and find their dream job – especially the refugees and asylum seekers in Germany. \n\"With this in mind, everjobs will be working with a wide variety of international corporations, national champions, local businesses and NGOs to provide as smooth a transition and stable a future as possible for the refugees in Germany.\" Poll loading …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T19:30:23.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
