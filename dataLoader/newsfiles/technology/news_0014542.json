We are grateful to Microsoft New Zealand for creating this opportunity and sharing our aspiration for Kiwi SMBs.”Andrew continues: “With SMBs representing over a third of our economy, support from corporates like Microsoft is essential for the growth of our country.”Businesses who wish to be considered for a scholarship need to complete and submit an application form by Friday 2 October. The recipient of each scholarship will be decided by an Icehouse and Microsoft Panel and announced individually.Scholarships are awarded for a specific workshop and cannot be transferred to another workshop unless permission is granted by The Icehouse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T07:22:13.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
