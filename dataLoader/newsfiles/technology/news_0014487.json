Related Content Philadelphia inmates are making a chair for the Pope By Octavio Blanco \nThe Pope's historic visit is closing roads, rerouting traffic, and forcing UPS and FedEx to suspend iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus delivery in parts of New York, Philadelphia, and Washington over the next few days. \nApple emailed affected customers on Tuesday, notifying them that deliveries may not arrive on time as a result. \nUPS, for example, said it was suspending pickup and delivery services in the 20008 and 20016 zip codes in Washington due to security restrictions. Service would be curtailed in certain other parts of D.C., UPS added. \n\"The majority of UPS customers will see no impact to service as a result of the Pope's visit,\" the company said in a statement on Wednesday. \nIn addition, UPS said service \"may be delayed\" in parts of Philadelphia on Wednesday and Thursday and parts of New York City on Thursday and Friday. \nFedEx says it will operate, but with caveats. \nThe company posted a spreadsheet of all its expected service delays, including offices that will be closed or have limited service. \nApple's next generation of iPhones will go on sale in stores on Friday. Pre-sales began about a week and a half ago, with most of the expected delivery dates falling on Friday. \nMacRumors first reported this story. \nEditor's Note: This article has been updated from an earlier version to include the latest information from UPS. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
