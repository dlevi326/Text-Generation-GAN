In the updated system, security and verifiability protocols have been customized by Scytl and Swiss Post to meet Swiss legal, security and verifiability requirements that will enable Swiss Cantons to implement online voting solutions with:\n End to end security: the industry leading security protocols ensure authentication, vote and voter privacy (ensuring individual vote contents are never known to the system), vote integrity and authenticity via digital certificates, encrypting votes on the voter’s device, cryptographic mixnets & secret sharing, voter digital signatures and immutable logs. Full verifiability: the sophisticated protocols and control components provide individual and universal verifiability ensuring voters and auditors alike can verify that votes have been cast-as-intended, recorded-as-cast and counted as-recorded and the audit of public source code.\nWith the launch of the partnership, Swiss Post will be the sole provider of Scytl’s end-to-end and fully verifiable platform in Switzerland. “We are thrilled to see Scytl’s 10 years’ experience in Switzerland going to the next level with Swiss Post. Working with Swiss Post – an organization globally reputed for its innovation and quality IT implementations – will prove a win-win for both our organizations, but most importantly for the citizens of all Swiss Cantons,” says Klaus Thalmann, General Manager for Europe at Scytl.\nAs recently announced, Neuchâtel will be the first canton to leverage the joint solution. The current online voting platform has been updated to comply with the updated Swiss Federal Chancellery requirements for full verifiability and will make it the most advanced online voting solution deployed in Switzerland, taking the canton one step closer to 100% potential citizen online channel leverage.\nAbout Scytl\nScytl is the global leader in secure election management, electronic voting and eGovernance solutions.
