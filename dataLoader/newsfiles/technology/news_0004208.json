Meet Bhanu Prakash, a 24-year-old (now former) hospital research assistant in Hyderabad, India, who on Friday will attempt to break the current world record of 1,449 selfies taken in just one hour, which is held by Arizona Cardinals star Patrick Peterson, reports Yahoo . Prakash says he was inspired by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson’s record-breaking 105 selfies in three minutes, and tells the Times of India that \"as soon as I wake up, I click a selfie.\" \"My work hours were 10am to 6pm and that wouldn't leave me much time for practice,\" says Prakash. Not the words every parent wants to hear their son say of quitting his job to photograph himself in rapid succession, but Prakash's parents are now supportive of his dream, reports UPI . Training involves hand and wrist exercises and, of course, trial runs; Prakash reports a personal record of 1,700 selfies in an hour, but says he ultimately hopes to hit 1,800.
