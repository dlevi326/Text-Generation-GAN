MP1 starts by binding to fatty molecules known as lipids entrenched on the outside of the cancer cell membranes. \nMP1 can blow gaping holes through this cell membrane once the binding procedure is complete. \nCoauthor Dr. Joao Neto from Sao Paolo State University told The Guardian, “Formed in only seconds, these large pores are big enough to allow critical molecules such as RNA and proteins to easily escape cells.” \nA series of lab tests had shown MP1 was able to inhibit bladder and prostate cancer cells along with various forms of drug-resistant leukemia. \nInterest in harnessing the poison from snakes, bees, and scorpions has grown because of the toxin’s ability to efficiently kill cancer cells. \nHowever, CNN notes these chemicals have also traditionally attacked healthy cells in a manner similar to chemotherapy. The key to creating a successful drug derived from this venom entails finding a way to successfully deliver the medication to cancer cells, while leaving the healthier counterparts unscathed. \nAlthough the lab tests suggested MP1 did not harm healthy cells, the researchers will continue their study of the molecule to gain more insight into its potential applications.
