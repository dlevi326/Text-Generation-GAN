Does it keeps itself current or will it get swept away? \n- Advertisement - \nSamsung and budget-friendly device seldom being put in a sentence together. But all that should change with the introduction of the Galaxy J2 sometime in November 2015. Coming with a host of other improvements as well, it is set to carve its name in the already crowded market space. \nWhat we know for now is that the Galaxy J2 will have a 136 x 69 x 8.3 mm (5.35 x 2.72 x 0.33 in) which is of the slim profile. As far as weight is concerned, there’s no official word yet but it should be lightweight as per its predecessor. The body is covered in metallic, and there’s a faux leather at its back. \nWhen the Galaxy J1 first hit the market earlier this year, it was packed with a 4.3-inch capacitive touchscreen that displays 480 x 800 pixels or ~217 ppi pixel density that is of average quality. Now with the Galaxy J2, it will have a 4.7-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with 540 x 960 pixels or ~234 ppi pixel density that makes for some pretty decent images. - Advertisement - Of course, it should have at least a High Definition resolution, but the Super AMOLED makes it stand out a little. And you don’t normally find that technology other than on a flagship smartphone from Samsung.\nThen we have the Exynos 3475 chipset, Quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 processor, Mali-T720 graphics and 1GB RAM under the hood of the Galaxy J2. Performance-wise, you can say that it should do just nicely for your daily needs. A little bit of browsing, a little bit of social media, a little bit of light gaming should not be an issue. - Advertisement - \nCamera-wise, the Galaxy J2 will have a 5 Megapixel primary camera and a 2 Megapixel secondary camera. You can put it to good use but don’t expect too high quality, though. Not recommended for someone who wants more out of it. \nOne of the major concerns for the Galaxy J1 back then, was it seriously small 4GB internal storage. Now with the Galaxy J2, at least it now has doubled the storage to 8GB and with the help of a microSD expansion slot; you can add in up to a maximum of 128GB. \nAs far as software is concerned, you should be getting a good deal with it coming with the latest Android Lollipop 5.1.1. Samsung is rather notorious for not issuing any updates to non-flagship devices, so it is great to know that Galaxy J2 will get the latest software right out of the box. \nIn terms of battery, there will be a Li-Ion 2000 mAh battery to supply enough juice to it. It should be able to power up for at least a day in between charging. \nWith 4G LTE and dual sim capability, it elevates its status by a lot more. That sounds great for a budget smartphone. The Galaxy J2 comes with a new feature called Ultra Data Saving Mode, which is powered by Opera Max and promises up to 50% data savings in video apps, 40% in social apps and up to 30% data savings when web browsing. It’s an essential feature for this device that has been developed for the express purpose of making 4G accessible and relevant for all customers. - Advertisement - \nThe Galaxy J2 brings with it heaps of improvement over the previous Galaxy J1. The fact that it uses Super AMOLED which is normally reserved for Samsung’s flagship and a metallic body with faux leather finish that is found on Galaxy Note 4. \nThe Samsung Galaxy J2 will be available in November 2015 for approximately $129 USD and will be available in black and white.
