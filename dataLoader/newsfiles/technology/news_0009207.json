And that's before allowing for trade-in value.\" \nThe iconic iPhone, which helped popularise the smartphone, launched on 29 June 2007. \nYet in less than nine years the smartphone has become an essential bit of kit for the 40 million UK adults who own one. \nAs you'd expect, usage intensity is higher for younger age groups. \nSome 80% of young people use their devices on public transport and 43% while eating at a restaurant. \nA fifth of 18 to 24 year-olds admit to checking their phones when crossing the road. \nThey also check their phones around 52 times each day, compared to 12 times a day for those aged over 55.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T10:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T11:04:01.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
