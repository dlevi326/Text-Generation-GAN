He says King Tut, who died at the age of 19, may have been rushed into an outer chamber of what was originally the tomb of Nefertiti.\nMoussa says Reeves, who has been in contact with the minister, arrives in Cairo Saturday.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-22T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:30:56.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
