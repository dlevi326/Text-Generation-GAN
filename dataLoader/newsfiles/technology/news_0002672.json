In July, UTC announced that the head of that business, Geraud Darnis, would retire from the company, effective in January.\nNow the new heads of the businesses will report directly to Hayes. The company named Philippe Delpech, who had been chief operating officer of intercontinental operations for BIS, as president of the Otis business.\nRobert McDonough was named president of the climate controls and security business, which includes brands such as Carrier air conditioners and Chubb security systems. McDonough had been serving as chief operating officer of the Americas for BIS.\nSince taking over in November, Hayes, who previously was UTC's chief financial officer, has shuffled many of the top management ranks.\n\"No other company we cover has had close to this degree of leadership 'transition', and arguably this move may mark a drawing to a close of this period of turmoil,\" Credit Suisse analyst Julian Mitchell said in a research note.
