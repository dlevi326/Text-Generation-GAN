(TAIEX stock code: 2311, NYSE: ASX ) (the \" Company \" or \" ASE \") announced today that the Company's public tender offer for Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd (\" SPIL \") shares (the \" Tender Offer \") is conducted in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations. The Company reiterates that it seeks to explore avenues of cooperation with SPIL but otherwise intends its investment in SPIL to be a pure financial investment. ASE will not intervene in SPIL's operations and therefore could not possibly affect the rights and interests of SPIL's employees through this Tender Offer. Moreover, throughout our long-term operations in the industry, our Company has nurtured talents and created numerous employment opportunities for Taiwan . In the past ten years, the number of ASE employees in Taiwan increased from 25,274 to 35,686 as of this year. We have always viewed our employees as the Company's greatest asset. As such, we strive to create a favorable work environment and conditions for our employees to fulfill our social responsibility. ASE also believes that the government's relevant ministry (e.g. the Bureau of Labor Funds) will uphold their professionalism and objective stance as they strive to achieve the greatest rights and benefits for our country's labor force. We hope that all sectors of society will respect their own decision.
