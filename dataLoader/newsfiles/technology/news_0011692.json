He then worked as VW's head product strategist until 2010 when he was asked to lead Porsche.\nUnder his leadership, Porsche has expanded and expects to increase sales to 200,000 vehicles this year, hitting a long-held target three years early.\n(Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach in Stuttgart and Andreas Cremer in Berlin; Writing by Keith Weir ; Editing by Giles Elgood )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T19:43:17.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
