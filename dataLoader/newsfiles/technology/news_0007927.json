WIPO Re:Search’s aim is to advance product development through greater collaboration while making concrete contributions to strengthen the foundations of healthcare in developing countries. \n\"Takeda's participation in the consortium demonstrates our commitment to supporting better access to medicines for people around the world, including those in emerging markets and developing counties,\" said Isabel Torres, Director, Access to Medicines, Takeda. \"We will continue our efforts to contribute to global health through WIPO Re:Search, together with a number of other Access to Medicines programs such as the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund.\" \nWIPO Re:Search was established in 2011 by the World Intellectual Property Organization (“WIPO”) in collaboration with BIO Ventures for Global Health (“BVGH”) and with the active participation of leading pharmaceutical companies and other renowned public sector research organizations. Through a public database managed by WIPO, members of the consortium, including the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), provide their intellectual property assets and resources such as compounds, expertise, know-how, etc., under royalty-free licenses. Non-profit organizations and other qualified research institutions will gain access to these assets for the research and development of new drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. By sharing assets and relevant information via the database, the consortium promotes research to develop innovative treatments for patients. \nBased on the needs of WIPO Re:Search members, Takeda and BVGH are currently working together to evaluate and determine potential assets and future contributions from Takeda to the consortium. \nAbout WIPO Re:Search \nOne of the world’s great global health challenges is to overcome the impact of neglected tropical diseases, malaria and TB. WIPO Re:Search aims to stimulate more R&D for new and better treatment options for those suffering from these diseases. \nWIPO Re:Search provides access to the intellectual property (IP) of certain pharmaceutical compounds, technologies, know-how and data for R&D activities around neglected tropical diseases, TB, and malaria. By providing a searchable, public database of available IP assets and resources, WIPO Re:Search facilitates new partnerships to support organizations that conduct research for the treatments of neglected tropical diseases. Ultimately, this aims to improve the lives of those most in need. \nFinancial supporters of WIPO Re:Search’s activities come from a range of multinational pharmaceutical companies, including Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, plus the governments of Australia and Japan. \nAbout Takeda \nLocated in Osaka, Japan, Takeda is a research-based global company with its main focus on pharmaceuticals.
