He did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Christian Science Monitor.\nRecommended: On Pinterest? Follow the Monitor now! The financial watchdog began studying mobile banking services in June 2014. Noting that 90 percent of American consumers own a cellphone, a bureau spokeswoman said it was focusing primarily on whether mobile payment services could improve access to banking for low-income consumers who rely on services like check cashing or payday loans instead of a traditional bank branch. She declined to comment on whether the bureau would be considered a \"service provider\" and directly under its jurisdiction.\nBut here's how it would work, according to Professor Levitin: Apple Pay does not currently transmit funds directly, (as competing services like PayPal do), which means it is not a “covered person” regulated by the bureau, he notes. But, because the mobile wallet service can transfer funds from a credit card, and the card issuers are regulated, Apple likely qualifies as a “service provider,” a secondary category of institutions under the authority of the financial watchdog.\nWhile Levitin writes that it’s possible that Apple and the CFPB could disagree with his interpretation of the law to include mobile wallet services, the moment represents a watershed, he says. “If my reading is correct, Apple just walked into the very different world of being a regulated entity,” he adds.\nThe bureau would also look at privacy concerns around the massive amounts of data collected through such services, the CFPB said in a statement . Moira Vahey, the bureau spokeswoman, noted that the agency had filed an enforcement action against PayPal in May, alleging that the company had illegally signed consumers up for its online credit product without their consent.\nOutside the US, some banking giants have said they feel regulators will increasingly look at whether tech companies’ software should be regulated further, particularly because of concerns about how customers’ data may be used.\n“The richness of financial data is why many tech companies want to get into payment services, and you're all going to have to make choices at some point on how much of your payment flow information you want to share,” Flint, the HSBC executive said on Thursday, according to Reuters.\nFurther regulation would clarify where the responsibility would fall if a customer’s mobile banking information were to be misused or hacked, he said, noting that in order to avoid the burden of regulation, tech companies offering mobile payments could consider partnering with banks directly.\nIt's difficult to tell if Levitin's predictions about further regulation will actually come true. Ms. Vahey, the consumer bureau spokeswoman, declined to discuss whether the agency would pursue further enforcement actions against mobile banking services.\n\"We will continue to closely monitor developments in the mobile payments space, so that we can identify any emerging consumer protection issues,\" the CFPB said in a statement when Apple Pay launched in October 2014. \"The Bureau’s role is not to choose market winners and losers, but to protect consumers and to make sure that companies offering consumer financial products or services play by the same rules...Rules that apply to plastic card payments also apply to payments with a phone.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2491727,00.asp", "http://www.thestreet.com/story/13170673/1/alibabas-alipay-is-winning-the-mobile-payments-game-in-china.html", "http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-against-paypal-for-illegally-signing-up-consumers-for-unwanted-online-credit/", "https://www.pinterest.com/csmonitor/", "http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/cfpb-launches-inquiry-into-mobile-financial-services/", "http://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2014/09/apple-pay-and-the-cfpb.html", "http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201406_cfpb_request-for-information_mobile.pdf", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/18/banking-tech-hsbc-idUSL5N11O0SF20150918"], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T23:41:23.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
