Magazine on its 34th annual Inc. 500|5000, an exclusive ranking of the nation’s fastest growing private companies.\nDALLAS, TEXAS\nSynerzip, an Agile product development partner for venture funded software companies, announced that it is ranked for the 5th consecutive year by Inc. Magazine on its 34th annual Inc. 500|5000, an exclusive ranking of the nation’s fastest growing private companies. This list represents the most comprehensive look at the most important segment of the economy—America’s independent entrepreneurs.\n\"The story of this year’s Inc. 5000 is the story of great leadership. In an incredibly competitive business landscape, it takes something extraordinary to take your company to the top,” says Inc. President and Editor-In-Chief Eric Schurenberg. “You have to remember that the average company on the Inc. 5000 grew nearly six-fold since 2012. Business owners don’t achieve that kind of success by accident.\"\n\"It is an incredible honor to be named to the Inc. 500|5000 list for the 5th consecutive year,\" said Hemant Elhence, Synerzip Co-Founder and CEO. \"With our consistent focus on helping venture backed companies accelerate their product roadmap in a capital efficient manner, Synerzip has experienced substantial growth. This honor not only recognizes the need our market has for high-quality, cutting edge software talent, but validates the success of a dual shore model of Agile software development.\"\n“While nurturing entrepreneurial and learning culture at Synerzip, we have been practicing Lean Startup principles and continuously investing in cutting edge technologies to serve our clients,” Elhence continues. “Our recent growth is driven by mobile and responsive front-end development, MicroServices based API servers for backend and our DevOps practice.”\n“Synerzip helps its clients take their Agile development process to the next level by implementing continuous delivery and DevOps,” says Co-Founder and CTO Vinayak Joglekar. “This facilitates early market feedback and accelerated build-measure-learn cycle. This gives a definite competitive advantage to Synerzip's clients like Mercatus.”\nHaresh Patel, CEO of Mercatus, said “Synerzip's deep understanding of scalable deployment on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform has enabled Mercatus to scale operations quickly and has dramatically improved our response to client demands.” Mercatus offers an end-to-end SaaS software solution for some the world’s largest energy producers. “Based in Silicon Valley, Mercatus, Inc.’s leading Energy Investment Management software is used by top energy producers to streamline operations and gain pricing power in the highly competitive energy industry.”\nSharing his technology vision, Synerzip CTO Joglekar added, “Lately, Synerzip has been focusing on natural language processing, creating retail focus analytics platform on machine learning and much more interactive tools which can recognize human mood—tracking expressions and providing visual assistance with game technology like Unity. In the world of analytics and Big Data, Apache Spark has been the primary focus the last two years, with emphasis on machine learning.”\nSynerzip’s expertise in domains like Office Productivity space continues. Elhence says, “We have helped companies like QuickOffice (acquired by Google in 2012) and CloudOn (acquired by Dropbox in 2015) to build their Office Productivity platforms, and are now working with Prezi. Our domain expertise has also expanded to other industries including EdTech, FinTech, HealthCare and Energy.”\nThe annual Inc. 5000 event honoring all the companies on the list will be held from October 21 through 23, 2015 in Orlando.
