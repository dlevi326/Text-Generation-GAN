This bandwidth upgrade release allows for an optional expansion from 120 gigabits per second (Gb/s) to 240Gb/s or 360Gb/s in a compact one rack unit appliance. The DQM10 began shipping in May of 2015, and the new field upgradable feature allows for a pay as you grow solution, enabling data center, service provider, and enterprise network engineers the flexibility needed for economical scalability. \n\"Forecasting bandwidth needs is complicated and a simple miscalculation could be costly when deploying a network,\" says Chad Lamb, Director of Engineering for XKL. \"The DQM10 upgrade is a cost-effective solution for quickly increasing bandwidth capacity without incurring large capital expenditures at initial deployment. Furthermore, the optional upgrade does not require additional costs when purchasing the base system. The customer decides if the upgrade is needed at a later time, not XKL.\" \nThe DQM10 supports Ethernet (10GbE, 40GbE, and 100GbE), SONET (OC48, OC192) and Fiber Channel (2, 4, and 8Gb/s) client-side interfaces, and like all XKL products, accommodates high capacity data center interconnects. What's more, all of XKL products are designed for network IT staff familiar with a router-like command line interface. With years of R&D in each product, deployment can be achieved in under an hour, and in many instances occurs in about 10 minutes. All XKL products integrate with existing management tools and scripts. \nFor more information on XKL and its product line, please visit www.xkl.com . \nAbout XKL: A privately owned research and engineering company, XKL LLC provides DWDM appliances and optical networking systems for robust enterprise deployment, service providers, and cloud migration.
