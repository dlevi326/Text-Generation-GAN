The multi-million-dollar project provides a flexible and secure system that also allows quicker final­isation of results.\nStudents are able to select an exam time and location that suits them.\n“For example, if they live in Melbourne or Sydney and they are travelling to Singapore or on holidays somewhere they can sit the exam pretty much anywhere in the world within an exam window of two weeks or a 16-day block,” Mr Thomason said.\nCPA Australia no longer has to wait for completed exams to come back by mail or courier. In the past, CPA Australia had two or three days of marking, with up to 450 academics and senior members coming in to one location to mark papers.\n“We are now able to send those papers out to people to mark them online.’’\nPearson VUE Australia & South East Asia vice-president Adrian Evans said part of the process involves the development of exam questions for CPA Australia.\n“That goes through a measurement process to make sure that they are fair and equitable across all forms of the exam that are delivered and it’s an ongoing process,” he said.\nIn semester one 2014, CPA Australia converted just under 20 per cent of candidates to computer-based tests. In first semester 2016, it will have close to 92 per cent of students sitting computer-based tests.\n“The biggest issue for us over the last three semesters was getting our candidates on board, we’re pretty comfortable we have got them on board,’’ Mr Thomason said.\nCPA Australia is now working with Pearson VUE to have more gamification and interactivity in the question types. It also sees automated marking of short answer questions as the next stage towards the end of 21016.\n“You could conceive of a situation where a student sits the exam and gets the result before they leave the exam centre,’’ Mr Thomason said.\nCase Study: CPA Australia\nPROBLEM: Needed to move 60,000 paper-based exams held annually in 80 countries to computer-based testing.\nPROCESS: Pearson VUE worked closely with CPA Australia to introduce a computer-based testing system.\nRESULT: Provides a flexible and secure system that allows quicker finalisation of results.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:33:47.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
