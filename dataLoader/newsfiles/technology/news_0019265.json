I think that is an absurd way of looking at this climate emergency,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation after the Marshall Islands' plan was submitted.\nKiran Sura of the Climate and Development Knowledge Network, who leads a programme to help developing nations prepare their U.N. climate plans, said the Marshall Islands' strategy had multiple benefits.\n\"It's about energy security, as well as reducing the impacts of climate change, and ensuring they are leading by example,\" she told journalists.\nFINANCIAL FREEDOM\nDymphna van der Lans, CEO of the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI), which is working with around a dozen Caribbean and East African island nations to develop and roll out renewable energy strategies, said there was both a moral and economic imperative for such states to transition away from costly diesel imports.\nAccording to the CCI, the price of energy for some island nations has reached almost 500 percent of the U.S. average - the Seychelles spends around 8 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on energy, for example, while the figure for the Bahamas tops 13 percent.\n\"For us to work with them to remove their dependency on expensive diesel imports is incredibly important,\" Van der Lans said, because the money saved can then be used to strengthen communities and key industries such as fishing and tourism.\nThe CCI has worked with partners, including the Rocky Mountain Institute-Carbon War Room and the International Renewable Energy Agency, to help governments devise and find funding for renewable energy projects, including a 24 megawatt (MW) wind farm in Jamaica and a 1.3 MW rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) project in the Seychelles.\nThe Clinton Foundation has also signed initial agreements with many Pacific island nations, with the aim of providing free financial, technical and policy support for adopting greener energy sources, drawing on what it has learned elsewhere.\nLeslie Hayes-Labruto, CCI's director of resilient communities, said some island nations with small populations lack the data and expertise needed to develop projects that will meet investors' requirements.\nIt is also hard to attract high-quality developers to islands that can only offer low dollar-value projects, so there is a need to increase demand, bundle projects together, and show they are ready for the market to finance, she added.\nVan der Lans said international development banks in particular have earmarked large sums to fund renewable energy in developing countries, yet the money is not being drawn down fast enough due to a lack of suitable projects. The CCI hopes to change that.\n\"If finance is secure, ground-breaking will happen,\" Van der Lans added.\nSECURE SUPPLY\nColin McCormick, a research fellow in energy technology innovation at the World Resources Institute, said small island nations needed technical expertise as well as capital.\nHis team is looking at examples of developed island communities that are blazing a trail with 100 percent renewable energy supplies, such as El Hierro, one of the Spanish Canary Islands, and Kodiak Island in Alaska - both of which combine wind and hydro power.\nHe is also keeping a close eye on Hawaii, which announced in June it plans to transition its grid to 100 percent renewables by 2045.\nMcCormick said Hawaii's experience of integrating different renewable energy sources, from solar to geothermal, would yield valuable technical lessons in how to make grids based on that kind of model run smoothly.\nFor smaller, more remote island communities like the Polynesian territory of Tokelau, grid power supply is not a cost-effective solution, and energy needs can be better met using solar PV combined with battery storage.\nYet while the right renewable energy solution may vary according to geography, population size and other factors, it is a win-win for island nations to become less dependent on expensive petroleum imports that can easily be disrupted by events beyond their control, McCormick said.\n\"Investment in renewables is as much an energy security investment as it is an economic investment,\" he said.
