The IRS did not indicate which way it would rule, leaving a question over a deal that is central to the $27bn value of Yahoo itself. \nThe IRS went on to issue a public notice this month that it was “concerned” about deals that fit the pattern that Yahoo was planning and was considering issuing new guidance on such deals. \nUS companies have been able to spin off significant shareholdings and other assets free of tax provided they place them in a new company along with ongoing operations. \nHowever, the IRS also signalled that any change in its guidance about the tax status of spin-offs would not apply retroactively, easing some of the worries among Yahoo investors. \nThe mixed signals from US tax authorities left Yahoo facing a number of options, none of which would has been as good for shareholders as a clean, tax-free spin-off. \nIt said on Monday it would continue with the original plan even in the absence of confirmation from the IRS, as long as it received a legal opinion about the tax-free nature of the deal, with the transaction due to take place in the final quarter of this year.
