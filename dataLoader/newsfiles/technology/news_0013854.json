Along with a huge new iPad Pro, Apple on Wednesday announced that its upgraded iPhone 6 models—the 6 S and the 6 S Plus—will have the same sized screens as their counterparts announced last year.\nAnd though iPhone purists may still bemoan trend toward larger screens, Apple already knows these things will sell . “iPhone 6 is the most popular iPhone ever,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said onstage Wednesday. “These are the most popular phones in the world.”\nBigger screens are more than a business move , though. They also tell us what a phone actually is in 2015. To Apple, a phone is a pocketbook-held proxy for the watch it hopes you're glancing at on your wrist.

But it’s more than that.", "external_links": ["http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-rings-up-big-holiday-sales-thanks-to-larger-screen-iphone-6/", "http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-iphone-6-sales-back-up-demand-for-bigger-phones/"], "published": "2015-09-10T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T01:03:33.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
