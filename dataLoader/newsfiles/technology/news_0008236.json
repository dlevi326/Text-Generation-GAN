This new product makes it possible to track more people than ever before, enabling eye-tracking research to be more cost efficient while providing faster results. \nEye tracking is a powerful method for understanding human behavior. The use of this technology is rapidly growing across many fields in academic and commercial research. For example, a wide variety of psychology studies rely on eye tracking – researchers use this methodology to examine how infants develop language and social abilities and to discover consumer responses to different marketing messages. It is also an established tool in user experience research to better understand how people interact with websites, which can improve usability and conversion rates. \nTobii Pro is now introducing the Tobii Pro X3-120 ( http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-tracking-research/global/products/hardware/tobiipro-x3-120/ ), a new eye tracker for screen-based studies, powered by the latest advancements in eye-tracking technology. Unprecedented tracking robustness allows researchers to work efficiently with a wide cross-section of the population and in real-world environments outside of the lab. \n“Eye tracking is invaluable in our research to gain deep insights into information acquisition and preference formation in marketing communication and consumer decision-making processes,” said Rik Pieters, Professor of Marketing, School of Economics and Management at Tilburg University, the Netherlands. \"The new Tobii Pro X3-120 tracks more people than any other system we’ve seen to date. With this extremely robust and highly-mobile solution, we can study more consumers more efficiently and get more data of high quality. This is a major step forward.” \n“A growing number of researchers need reliable data collected in the easiest possible way,” said Tom Englund, president of Tobii Pro. “We provide eye-tracking systems that beat the inherent challenges of tracking people of different ethnicities, ages, or with corrective lenses. Our new technology works in any location, such as peoples’ homes, clinics, schools, or malls, which helps researchers reduce the time and cost of studies, while gaining deeper insights. With the new Tobii Pro X3-120, we take a big step forward in enabling eye tracking as a standard method in a range of research fields.” \nTobii Pro ( http://www.tobiipro.com/ ), part of the Tobii Group, is the leading provider of eye-tracking research solutions and services designed to deepen the understanding of human behavior. Through eye-tracking insights, we enable business and science professionals to drive change and further their research.
