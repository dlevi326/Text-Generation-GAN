He wasn’t inspecting a trap, or peering through binoculars. He wasn’t even flicking through photographs captured by a camera-trap. He was, instead, looking at the rabbit’s DNA.\nWhich he had pulled out of a leech.\nThere are some 700 species of leech and many of them suck the blood of mammals. In doing so, they achieve with ease what scientists find difficult: They sneak through thick, tropical rainforest and collect DNA samples from rare and elusive species. By collecting these mini-vampires in turn, and sequencing the DNA in their bodies, scientists can get a cheap and surprisingly comprehensive snapshot of a jungle’s fauna.\nThe idea behind this unorthodox census technique started with Mads Bertelsen, a vet from Copenhagen Zoo. Bertelsen was doing fieldwork in Malaysia when he saw a leech fastened to the side of a tapir, and thought: Hmmm . He approached Gilbert with his crazy idea, and the duo tried to test it .", "external_links": ["http://geogenetics.ku.dk/research_groups/gilbert_groups/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annamite_striped_rabbit", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212002096"], "published": "2015-09-11T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T15:52:49.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
