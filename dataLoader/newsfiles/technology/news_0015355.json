UniPixel, Inc. (NASDAQ: UNXL), a provider of Performance Engineered Films™ to the touchscreen and flexible electronics markets, today announced shipment of touch screen sensor engineering samples to be assembled into touch panels by a new touch panel integration partner that will be delivered to a prospective new Asia -based Tier 1 PC OEM customer for evaluation in a new 13.3\" notebook PC.\nThe engineering samples feature UniPixel's XTouch touch sensor technology with its new hybrid-metal plating process and Diamond Guard resin coating. The hybrid-metal plating further improves the visual appearance of the XTouch sensors, and is expected to further enhance robustness of the sensor under extreme environmental stress conditions. Diamond Guard adds a protective coating to the sensor that makes it easier for the touch panel integrator to handle XTouch without damage during the touch panel assembly process and eliminates need for an extra film layer to be added by the touch panel integrator for robustness. This improves material handling by the touch panel integrator and reduces overall manufacturing costs.\nMr. Jeff Hawthorne , president and chief executive officer of UniPixel, said, \"We continue to execute on our technology roadmap that enables our strategy to expand the number of leading manufacturers that are actively considering UniPixel technology for new product offerings. While we recognize that we will not win all of the projects for which our products are being evaluated, we know that leading PC OEMs are becoming more aware of our differentiated touch screen technology. The more our products are considered, the better the chances that we will win our fair share of these competitive opportunities.\"\nUniPixel's XTouch sensors support features such as narrow borders, curved touch surfaces and even edgeless touchscreens while achieving improved linearity, reliability and thinner sensor stacks. As an alternative to traditional touch sensors, XTouch provides the ability to turn unique touch-based concepts into functional designs at lower total system costs.\nAbout UniPixel\nUniPixel, Inc. (NASDAQ: UNXL) develops and markets Performance Engineered Films for the touch screen and flexible electronics markets. The company's roll-to-roll electronics manufacturing process patterns fine line conductive elements on thin films. The company markets its technologies for touch panel sensor, cover glass replacement, and protective cover film applications under the XTouch™ and Diamond Guard™ brands.
