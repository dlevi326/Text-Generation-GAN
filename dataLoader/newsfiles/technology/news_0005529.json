FMCSA is the only winner in the \"Driving Digital Government\" federal category. The award recognizes outstanding agency and department websites and projects at the application and infrastructure level for all levels of government. \nLaunched in 2010 to improve highway safety, PSP provides trucking and bus companies secure, instant access to commercial drivers' safety history records for pre-hire screening purposes. FMCSA partners with NIC ( News - Alert ) Federal to manage all aspects of PSP, including communications, outreach, website development, and user support. NIC provides all PSP service delivery at no cost to the federal government using a unique self-funded contract model. \n\"NIC is pleased to partner with FMCSA on delivering PSP records to employers. We congratulate the agency on receiving this prestigious award,\" said Laura Fredrickson, NIC Federal's General Manager. \"We will continue to deliver this valuable program in alignment with the agency's mission to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities involving large trucks and buses.\" \nFMCSA launched PSP in 2010 as an electronic alternative to requesting federal Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) safety data. Prior toPSP, the carrier industry could only access this data using time- and labor-intensive Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Since the implementation of the program, related FOIA requests have decreased significantly and program enrollment continues to grow. \nAccording to a study released by FMCSA in 2013, PSP positively impacts the safety of America's roadways. The study shows that carriers using PSP have, on average, decreased crash rates by 8 percent, and driver out-of-service (OOS) rates by 17 percent. It is estimated that in the 12 months studied, the carrier group using PSP prevented 863 crashes and more than 3,500 driver OOS incidents. A summary of the study can be found at: https://www.psp.fmcsa.dot.gov/psp/Documents/PSP-Safety-Impact-analysis-brief.pdf . \nAbout NIC Federal \nHeadquartered in Arlington, VA, NIC Federal, LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of NIC USA, delivers secure, user-friendly, and cost-effective information technology and digital solutions to the U.S. federal government.
