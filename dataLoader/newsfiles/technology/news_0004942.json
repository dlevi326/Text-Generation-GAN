With the new system, NiteHawk's Wylie facility is the only urgent care center in Texas to better provide patients with low dose, high quality imaging, while also increasing access to quality urgent care designed specifically to meet the needs of children. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150924/270566 \n\"At NiteHawk Pediatric Urgent Care, our mission is to provide world class after-hours care to pediatric patients in our kid-friendly environment with our highly skilled team,\" stated Dr. Ben Olsson, Medical Director, NiteHawk. \"Viztek's precision x-ray equipment allows us to focus on getting our patients the right diagnosis accurately and fast. Parents can be confident and rest easy that they are getting the best possible care from NiteHawk with the first Viztek DR imaging system at a Texas urgent care center that is specifically tailored to meet the needs of pediatric patients.\" \nIn the United States, there are approximately 9,000 urgent care centers, but less than 3 percent are pediatric focused. NiteHawk is a state-of-the-art pediatric facility providing medical care - for children up to age 21-when most pediatrician offices are closed. The facility provides various services, including imaging exams for strains, sprains, and fractures, respiratory issues, and gastroenterology problems, as well as other urgent care exams. \n\"Families in Wylie and the surrounding communities now have access to high quality, reliable after-hours pediatric urgent care, that in many cases, can save them a significant amount of time without having to travel far for quality care,\" stated Keyur Sathe, President and Chief Executive Officer of NiteHawk. Adopting Viztek's Pediatric Imaging Package was an important, yet easy decision for NiteHawk to make, combining low dose capabilities with fast, quality imaging to reassure parents seeking medical assistance for their children. Sathe further stated, \"We are very proud of the fact that NiteHawk's Wylie location is the first and only facility in Texas with advanced DR technology from Viztek and believe it is a very important part of the high quality care that NiteHawk has become known for. Looking ahead, we hope to open five to seven facilities across the Dallas-Fort Worth area in the coming years and eventually even more across the nation, in continued partnership with Viztek.\" \nViztek's Straight Arm DR solution provides superior imaging quality and can be used for various exams while helping to provide the lowest dose to children and peace of mind to their parents. During the exam, the system alerts the technologist to take necessary steps to reduce dose to the patient, while the cesium iodide (CsI) detector enables unsurpassed image quality. The solution includes Viztek's unique Pediatric Imaging Package that is dose conscious and works to align with the goals and recommendations of the American College of Radiology's (ACR's) Image Gently initiative. \nFor more information, call 800-366-5343 or visit Viztek.net . \nAbout Viztek \nViztek is a leading provider of complete digital software and hardware imaging solutions, backed by comprehensive training and support for the hospital, imaging center, telemedicine and private practice markets.
