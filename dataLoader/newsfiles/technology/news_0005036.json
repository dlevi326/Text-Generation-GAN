It now actually wants to be Uber, or at least Uber XL. Daimler, maker of Mercedes, is reportedly considering launching an on-demand limo service using driverless cars. The plan, confirmed by CEO Dieter Zetsche at a Mercedes-Benz event on the eve of the Frankfurt auto show. Fleets of autonomous vehicles would serve people who don’t want to own a car but still desire “premium transportation services,” like limousines. Zetsche did not say where the service would first run. Daimler already runs car-sharing service car2go, similar to Zipcar, which lets users find parked rental cars nearby. Daimler has already prototyped an autonomous sedan, and truck. They also own a high-definition mapping service, HERE, and a taxi service not dissimilar to Uber, called MyTaxi, which allows customers to hail a cab on their smartphones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T09:22:44.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
