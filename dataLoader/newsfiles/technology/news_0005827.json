To enable WMUC's entire team of broadcasters covering 13 sports, Rabble created new Station pages, enabling organizations, universities and other groups to create a unified, polished presence on Rabble's web and mobile-based alternative broadcast platform. \nVisit Rabble on the web at http://www.Rabble.tv \nRabble is a free live-television social network that allows users to create and listen to audio tied to live sports and television events. Rabble enables everyone from passionate sports fans and reality-show junkies to college radio teams to deliver expert and witty commentary to listeners. The platform is a first of its kind alternative to traditional broadcasts, pushing broadcast commentary beyond the tired and cliched announcing crews and hosts. \nWMUC Sports is the University of Maryland's student-run all sports radio station. WMUC broadcasts 13 sports live on location and hosts over 20 talk shows each week. Rabble gives the staff of 75 student broadcasters a way to have their broadcasts heard around the world in real-time, and allows listeners to interact with the student broadcasters during games. \nVisit the WMUC station page on the web at https://Rabble.tv/station/wmuc/profile \n\"Before Rabble we tried Internet streams that did not have the reach, functionality and interactive nature we needed,\" said Emily Olsen, online director at WMUC sports. \"Rabble gives us a polished presence that puts us on a level playing field with the big dogs. At WMUC we are proud to cover all sports including volleyball and women's field hockey, providing an outlet for families and friends to hear games that bigger networks would not cover.\" \nRabble allows sports fans to hear friends, experts and like-minded fans call the action for their teams, while interacting with them on live interactive message boards during a television broadcast. Rabble also displays real-time game data to supplement broadcast pages and game feeds. \n\"Since our launch this year, Rabblers have created over 1,800 unique broadcasts and over 3,500 hours of unique, fan-driven commentary for those who are not satisfied with the status quo of national broadcasters,\" said co-founder Ryan Tyrrell. \"We are honored to provide the talented team at WMUC with a way to broadcast their coverage to fans, friends and families around the world, and we look forward to speaking with more student broadcasters around the country about Rabble.\" \nRabble.TV launched earlier this year with a mission to provide a platform to enable live, alternative audio commentary over live television events. Since the initial launch, programs ranging from major playoff sporting events to primetime reality shows to presidential debates have been enhanced by refreshing, engaging, and humorous real-time audio commentary, providing listeners with a new range of options to the often boring and predictable sound emanating from their televisions. \nAbout Rabble.TV \nRabble is a community driven, social audio platform that allows anyone to broadcast and discuss their insights and opinions about live sports and television - in real-time.
