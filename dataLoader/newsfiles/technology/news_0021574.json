RELATED NEW DELHI: Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group has agreed to invest Rs 430 crore to Rs 460 crore ($65 million-$70 million) in refurbished goods retailer Greendust, according to two people aware of the developments. The investment — the second in quick succession for Foxconn weeks after it backed online marketplace Snapdeal — is part of a larger funding round of about $100 million where a number of US hedge funds are expected to also participate, said the people cited above. Delhi-based Reverse Logistics, which owns and operates Greendust — estimated to be worth about $240 million to $250 million ahead of this investment deal — is also in late-stage discussions with hedge funds Falcon Edge Capital and Meru Capital for potential investments. Hitendra Chaturvedi, founder and chief executive of Reverse Logistics, confirmed that his company was in talks with Foxconn, but said the deal was yet to be finalized. \"We are in discussions, (but) it may be a bit early to report all that you have documented,\" he said. Foxconn and Falcon Edge Capital did not respond to email queries. In July 2014, ET was the first to report that Reverse Logistics had begun discussions to raise its new round of funding, a process that saw a host of strategic and financial investors engage in discussions that now appear to be heading for fruition. So far, Reverse Logistics had raised about Rs 180 crore in funding from its existing backers, which include Vertex Ventures (the venture capital arm of Singapore's Temasek) and Lightbox Ventures. ET could not ascertain whether Vertex Ventures and Lightbox Ventures are participating in the latest round. They are not expected to exit their positions in the company. Founded in 2008, by IIT-Roorkee graduate and former Microsoft executive Hitendra Chaturvedi, Reverse Logistics refurbishes damaged or defective electronic products and sells them on the Greendust portal as well as through offline stores. The company counts a number of the country's largest consumer electronics companies and e-commerce majors among its clientele, including Samsung, Amazon.com, LG and Philips, to source defective or returned products. Foxconn's investment in Reverse Logistics is the latest in a series of announcements relating to its ambitious plans for India. Apart from investing in Snapdeal, Foxconn along with Japan's telecom and internet group SoftBank and Bharti Enterprises, has pledged to invest about $20 billion in the country's green energy sector over the next decade, through a newly-formed joint venture, SBG Cleantech. In June, over a dozen high-profile Indian startups met Wen-Hsin (Vincent) Tong, chairman and director of investments at FIH Mobile, an investment arm of Foxconn, at the New Delhi office of Snapdeal. Falcon Edge Capital and Meru Capital also led a $25-million funding round in Mumbai-based mobile point-of-sale payment services provider Mswipe Technologies. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Softbank,Greendust,Foxconn Technology,Foxconn,Amazon.com Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T13:55:24.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
