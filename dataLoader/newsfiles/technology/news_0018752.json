But the Pope also blasted the thirty-seven-year-old economic embargo levied on Cuba by the United States, referring to it as “unjust” and partly responsible for Cuba’s “material and moral poverty.” It remains to be seen whether the Pope's impassioned pleas will have any impact on American foreign policy toward Cuba.\nWith Pope Francis preparing to make visits to Cuba and the U.S., it seems like a safe bet that, despite some major diplomatic progress , these very same issues will be part of the pontiff’s dialogue. His predecessor, Pope Benedict, spoke of similar themes during his 2012 visit to Cuba.", "external_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/28/world/americas/cuba-pope-visit/"], "published": "2015-09-11T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T21:29:34.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
