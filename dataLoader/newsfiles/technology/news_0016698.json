We believe that our exhibition at this year's show will exceed our current customer's expectations and attract a host of new ones.\" \nThe excitement and infectious energy surrounding the AGS brand is best summarized as \"contagious\", which was aptly selected as the Company's G2E booth theme this year. Over the past 12 months, AGS has embarked on an ambitious transformation to expand its product library, broaden its global footprint, and establish itself as a serious player in the gaming industry. In June, AGS bolstered the depth and breadth of its slot portfolio and entered the online gaming market with the acquisitions of Cadillac Jack and the RocketPlay branded social gaming suite, respectively. In just one year since its inception, AGS' table products division has accumulated more than 20 table game titles, completed acquisitions for table bonusing technology and card shuffler patents, and grown its table games footprint to over 700 units. \nGiven such extraordinary events this year, customers visiting AGS at G2E will immediately notice significant changes from last year; AGS' product lineup will clearly highlight new product categories, more innovative offerings, and more comprehensive solutions for every part of the gaming floor. \nSlots AGS' newest cabinet, the ICON , is a highlight of the booth and should not be missed. Showcasing the Company's most innovative video content, ICON is the ultimate interpretation of cabinet design that goes beyond function and performance. ICON redefines style with its immersive sensory experience, seamless integration of light and sound, and stunning visual effects. Two new themes Golden Wins and Tiger! Tiger! are significant \"must-see\" games that will be front and center in the AGS booth this year. \nAn Asian-themed Class III game, Golden Wins is the first title to be introduced on the Da Ji Da Li Multi Linked Progressive featuring the PowerXStream pay mechanic, which is also a key feature of the high-performing titles FireWolf and Legend of the White Buffalo . Golden Wins tests the limits of volatility and is targeted at players who aren't afraid to bet big to win big. \nTiger! Tiger! , as the name would suggest, is a tiger-themed game for the Class III markets featuring a combination of strong graphics and appealing game math for core gamblers. This 4x5 reel, 50 pay line game has a dynamic Streaming Stacks feature where multiple large stacks of symbols are dynamically inserted from spin to spin. Players will enjoy the free spin rounds where the dynamic Streaming Stacks feature is enhanced by only offering the wild and three major bonus symbols, which can lead to huge wins. \nThe adventures of Peter & Wendy will continue at G2E with Peter & Wendy Hook's Revenge , which features vibrant illustrations, a custom-themed facade and PowerXStream , plus Reflex Wilds , Power Blocks, and Turbo Boost progressives. Every twist and turn of the game will have players \"hooked.\" \nFeaturing two monstrous fire-breathing dragons, Gold Dragon Red Dragon is sure to heat up AGS' booth at G2E and has been off to a really strong start since its release in early 2015. This game introduces the Company's Fierce Factor feature, which combines higher wagers with proven game mechanics, allowing players to bet big and win big. \nLast, but certainly not least, it wouldn't be G2E without an appearance from AGS' famous Big Red cabinet featuring the popular title Colossal Diamonds , which recently made its debut on The Strip at Caesars Palace and Paris Las Vegas. The company has enjoyed much success from this flagship product and considers it a true game changer. This three-reel, single-pay line behemoth performs equivalent to six average cabinets and continues to be a massive hit wherever it has been placed. \nTable Products Making its G2E debut for AGS will be Bonus Spin Blackjack . This is a one-of-a-kind blackjack side bet where players have two ways to win: 1) if there is an Ace in the first two cards, players are paid even money or 2) if a blackjack is dealt, the player will press a button which spins a virtual wheel to win various amounts of money or a unique prize. AGS will showcase the Count's Kustoms version of the game at G2E, which is based on the popular History Channel show, Counting Cars, and offers players the chance to win a custom car, truck, or motorcycle. The Company recently acquired the Bonus Spin technology and plans to offer other entertainment-themed brands of Bonus Spin Blackjack in the future. \nThe fastest growing poker derivative in the U.S., High Card Flush , will be a highlight of the booth. In this exciting game, players are dealt seven cards and compete against the dealer to create the longest flush possible (ex. a seven-card flush beats a six-card flush). High Card Flush offers two optional bonus wagers with big payouts. The Flush Bonus wager is paid when players have at least four suited cards in their hand, while the Straight Flush Bonus wager is paid when a player has at least a three-card straight flush in their hand. The appeal of High Card Flush is that it is easy to learn and play for beginners, but also provides excitement and volatility for experienced gamers. \nInternally developed and a new offering in the hold'em poker-style category, River Hold'em will make its debut at G2E. Both the dealer and players receive two hole cards and share five community cards to make the best five-card poker hand possible. Players begin by making an ante bet, then have an option to make a 1x \"before flop\" bet or fold after they receive their first two cards. After the three-card flop, players may make a 1x \"after flop\" bet or fold. Finally, the player may make a bet of 1x or 2x their ante after the turn and river cards or fold. Two optional side bets \"Player Trips\" and \"Dealer Trips\" win if the player, dealer, or both have a three-of-a-kind or better. \nEarlier this week, AGS announced that it had acquired two proven table game titles Buster Blackjack and Double Draw Poker - which serve as another example of the Company's commitment to expand and diversify its content library to become the preferred supplier for table products. \nAGS is excited to showcase its award-winning roulette utility device, appropriately dubbed The Tornado , which enhances player interaction by allowing the player to control the spin of the roulette ball - something never before seen on the casino floor. When a player presses the button on the remote ball activation device, a signal is sent to a control unit which releases the ball into the roulette wheel through a chute. The necessary hardware can easily and quickly be installed over any traditional 32\" roulette wheel. Since there is no need for the dealer to manually introduce the ball to the roulette wheel, human error is eliminated and a truly perfect and secure spin is guaranteed every time. This also allows the dealer to spend more time interacting with players and to keep an eye on the table. \nInteractive The Company's newest product category AGS Interactive- was launched following the acquisition of RocketPlay and adds mobile and social gaming to AGS' product mix. \nThe popularity of mobile platforms offering exciting game content, which can be played in a brick-and-mortar casino, continues to grow and AGS aims to capitalize on this trend. AGS Interactive is currently integrating some of the Company's proven slot content onto its flagship product, Lucky Play Casino. Featured titles include Royal Reels , So Hot , Double the Devil , Monkey in the Bank , Going Gnome , and more. \nRecently launched in September for iOS devices, Vegas Fever is the Company's newest app and will feature exciting new content with more complex math models, including FireWolf and Legend of the White Buffalo . \nG2E 2015 is a highly anticipated event for AGS as the Company aims to show customers and competitors that it is one of gaming's most exciting and promising stories and for good reason. \nAbout AGS AGS is a full-service designer and manufacturer of gaming products for the casino floor. The Company's roots are in the Class II, Native American market, and it has recently expanded its product lines to include top performing slot games for the Class III commercial marketplace as well as specialty table game products and mobile games.
