Apple has made a habit out of the models like the iPhone 6s being just different enough from their predecessors to be worthy of a new launch, while having enough in common that they don’t rate an entirely new model number. \nAmong the new features already reported about when it comes to the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus is that these models will include the Force Touch screen, which will allow the phone to be able to tell the difference between a light tap and a longer finger press. Zee News reports that this little feature will allow you to set different functions in the phone depending on how you touch it. A smarter Siri is also expected to be launched alongside the new iPhone 6s, though that particular feature will likely also be coming along with the iPad Pro and iOS 9. We will likely also get an announcement on when we can expect the new operating system that will be installed in all newer Apple products. As a general rule, the new OS is rolled out just a week or two after this kind of announcement event. \nThere had been rumors that the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus would be the first generation of devices that would not include the ability to have 16GB models. The International Business Times has apparently debunked those rumors by getting its hands on a wrapper for the devices clearly showing 16GB of storage. The website also featured a screenshot of a teaser image that shows the new models getting a brand new color for its outer shell. It wasn’t that long ago that Gold and Silver were the talk of the town. Now it appears there is going to be the option to get a “Rose Gold” colored iPhone 6s. \nFor those who are less interested in what the device looks like and more interested in what kind of performance you can expect, there are tidbits for you too. Rumors suggest the phone is going to move away from the standard 1GB of RAM and double in size for this new generation. The camera for these models is supposed to be souped up as well. Finally, the last little nugget surrounding the iPhone 6s is that leaked pictures of the boxes suggest that animated wallpapers are a reality as well. \n[Photo courtesy Spigen]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:03:30.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
