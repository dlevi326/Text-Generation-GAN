In short, they didn’t much care (nor track) where the money came from, leaving great opportunity for money laundering.\n“Caesars knew its customers well enough to entice them to cross the world to gamble and to cater to their every need,” said Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of FinCEN, in the statement. “But, when it came to watching out for illicit activity, it allowed a blind spot in its compliance program. Every business wants to impress its customers, but that cannot come at the risk of introducing illicit money into the U.S. financial system.”", "external_links": ["http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/nr/html/20150908.html", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/caesars-palace-fined-for-lax-money-laundering-controls/", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-fines-caesars-8-million-over-money-laundering-controls-1441721034"], "published": "2015-09-09T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:38:54.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
