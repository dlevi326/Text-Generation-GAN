It is the largest global annual event of its kind and attracts attendees from over 110 countries.\n“As the leading airline on the African continent we are pleased to be partnering with KZN Tourism as the official carrier of delegates attending this high profile, international gathering, an honour which further serves as testimony to SAA’s premier standing in the global aviation industry,” said Sylvain Bosc, SAA Chief Commercial Officer.\nWorld Routes 2015 takes place in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal from 19 – 22 September. In attendance will be up to 2,500 total delegates including 230 airlines, almost 700 airports, 150 tourism authorities from 115 countries, including high profile individuals such as tourism and transport ministers, chief executives of airlines, airports and tourism marketing organisations, as well as experts and media practitioners in these allied business disciplines.\nMichael Mabuyakhulu, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Minister of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, said: “As the province, the country and the African continent, we are ready to deliver the best World Routes Summit, as the first ever to be held on the African continent. There could be no better coincidence than this one where the country marks its 21 st anniversary since embracing democracy and that KZN will be celebrating the 21 st World Routes.\n“This is a good time for the world to sample the province’s diverse market offerings such as investment options and tourism attractions. Delegates will be able to see how KZN developed and built an aerotropolis, the Dube Trade Port, with King Shaka International Airport as an anchor facility, into an aviation inspired industrial hub.\n“We are not only providing world class facilities for intercontinental passenger travel for tourists and business visitors, but the province is a gateway to international trade through its advanced sea-ports in Durban and Richards Bay,” said Mabuyakhulu.\nSource:- South African Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T18:13:08.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
