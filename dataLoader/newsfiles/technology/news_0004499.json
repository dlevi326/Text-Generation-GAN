The Autism Society will leverage its partnerships and over 100 local affiliates, as well as other national partners who provide services to the autism community, to inspire the nation to give in support of those affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). “The prevalence of Autism has nearly doubled since 2004, driving higher associated costs and a truly urgent need for our programs that assist families impacted by the disorder,” said Michael R. Leaver, Director of Development. “Working with the Kimbia team, platform and best practices approach will ensure that we engage seamlessly across all of our stakeholders while providing a simple, secure donation process.”\nThe Autism Society chose to host a giving day because of the model’s proven ability to reach across communities, channels and segments to unite supporters, partners and donors. The organization also cited the opportunity to raise significant new dollars, recruit new donors and increase awareness of their cause as reasons for organizing a giving day event.\nThrough the Kimbia platform, each partnering organization will get a personalized giving day portal on The Big Give for Autism website, and will be provided with the tools needed to engage the community to build awareness and excitement around the event. All funds will be routed directly to each partnering organization, and matching and incentive funds and prizes will be offered to encourage donors to give, multiplying the impact to their local community.\nKimbia, the crowdfunding and giving day industry leader, will develop the giving day website, marketing materials and toolkits, social media calls to action and an email/offline campaign for constituents at the national level. “The Autism Society has the perfect structure to do an event like this,” said Amy Zumbahlen, The Big Give for Autism Project Manager at Kimbia. “We love to see friendly competition help an organization grow brand awareness locally and nationally.”\nThe Big Give for Autism website will accept donations for 24 hours on Thursday, September 17, 2015 starting at 12:00 AM EDT.
