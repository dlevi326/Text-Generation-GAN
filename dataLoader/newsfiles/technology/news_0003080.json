With Swrve, savvy marketers are now able to increase response rates and user engagement levels to build lasting brand loyalty. \n“In-app user experience, especially in a category like dating, is critical on an individual level at different points in every user's journey,” said Sumesh Menon, CEO and co-founder of Woo. “Swrve is a powerful tool that helps us segment users and engage them when it’s most relevant. Their focus on new, innovative features also makes the process increasingly efficient and effective. The easy visual interface aids quick identification and decision-making, along with their responsive support team that handholds customers through the entire process.” \nPersonalization \nPersonalizing the app based an individual user’s preferences and behaviors will be a key competitive advantage for companies in the next 18 months. Generic blast messages are ineffective and can damage a brand’s relationship with their customers. Swrve Integrated Personalization enables marketers to build the most truly effective and targeted messages possible on mobile platforms today. App engagement campaigns can be targeted based on personal information, past behavior, stage in the user lifecycle, past or present physical location, and language. Inclusive of this functionality is the ability to A/B test messages for the best response rate and refer to specific items that they have previously viewed or may be interested in. \nConversations \nConversations is an in-app communication tool unique to Swrve. Conversations offer the digital marketer the ability to send videos, surveys, and an array of other rich messaging experiences to app users - all designed to engage users in a natural, almost conversation-like manner as they spend time in the app. As users engage, customized messages are triggered in real-time by the user’s response. Swrve Conversations allow marketers to further refine the in-app brand and customer experience to closely resemble real-world interactions with in-store personnel or a trusted personal shopper. \nWith Swrve, marketers can reimagine true mobile engagement by delivering a superior customer experience that fundamentally up-levels mobile engagement metrics and ultimately delivers better results. Swrve is the only solution on the market today that provides brands with this level of personalization and marketing sophistication. \nLocalization \nSwrve enables marketers to set up and send campaigns in multiple languages simultaneously. For marketers in organizations that serve customers with different language preferences, this is not only an incredible time-saver and productivity advantage, but most importantly, it empowers brands to enhance the overall mobile customer experience by delivering timely and relevant notifications in the customer’s language of choice. No other marketing engagement tool on the market today offers this kind of rich, single-button push capability along with an aggregate reporting view across all language variants. \n“Just like in the online environment, 'one size fits all' is no longer good enough when it comes to mobile customer engagement. When brands plan to build meaningful relationships with consumers, they need to be where consumers are, at the moment when they are engaged - which is in the mobile app,” said Christopher S. Dean, CEO of Swrve. “With Swrve’s Integrated Personalization, marketers now have a powerful new way to engage individual mobile users with rich contextually relevant messages, quite possibly the most crucial and successful component for a brand’s future in the mobile age.” \nUse Cases for Swrve Integrated Personalization: Brick and mortar brands should also be on mobile. Send a push campaign to users entering a store to direct them to a promotion on a specific item they had previously browsed on the retailer's mobile app or online. Global brands need to reach customers across languages. Deliver a push notification to new users in their native language - setup multi-language campaigns on one screen - to increase the retention rate of those trying the app for the first few times. Send consumers messages at the optimal time based on predictive learning. Engage users with a 're-engagement' push campaign delivered to each individual at the time when they are most likely to engage with the message, promoting content they are likely to be interested in based on their past behavior. Banks need to engage in two-way customer conversations on mobile. By delivering individualized messages to customers in the event of potential fraud or other key account activities, banks can save significant sums when compared with the alternative of text messaging and phone calls. \nAdditional Resources: Why Personalization Matters on Mobile \nAbout Swrve \nSwrve’s Mobile Engagement Platform empowers digital marketers to create the ideal mobile customer experience.
