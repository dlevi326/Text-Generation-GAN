It will replace a serif typeface that Google has been using in its logo for more than 16 years. The “e” in the company’s name will remain slightly tilted to reflect Google’s sometimes off-kilter thinking. \nAlthough this will be the sixth time that Google has changed its logo since Larry Page and Sergey Brin formed the company, this marks the most-noticeable redesign since it dropped an exclamation point that appeared after its name until May 1999. \n“I am sure this is going to upset a lot of people because everyone freaks out when a company like this makes a shift like this,” said Wally Krantz, executive creative director at brand consultants Landor. Krantz, though, applauded the change because he believes it gives the company a “fresh” look. \nGoogle is donning the different look as it embarks on a new era. \nThe Mountain View, Calif., company is pouring so much money into so many far-flung projects that have little or no connection to its main business of online search and advertising that it’s getting ready to place everything under the Alphabet umbrella. \nUnder this setup, Google will retain search, YouTube and most of the biggest divisions while smaller operations such as Nest home appliances, life sciences, drone deliveries and venture capital investments will operate as individual companies. All will be overseen by Alphabet, whose CEO will be Google co-founder Page.
