But detractors call it an abrogation of the transitional justice process and an amnesty for corrupt officials and businesspeople with ties to the regime of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who was deposed after the 2010-2011 uprising in Tunisia.\n\"This law is an economic necessity [because] Tunisia is going through an economic crisis,\" Mongi Harbaoui, a member of parliament from Essebsi's political party, Nidaa Tounes, told Al Jazeera.\nBut Samia Abbou, a member of parliament from the opposition Congress for the Republic Party (CRP), disagreed: \"Transitional justice would have led to a democratic transition. This could lead to the return of dictatorship.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T16:05:14.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
