With all the focus on Windows 10 (for the record, this story is written using it and it is a joy), you would be forgiven for thinking that Microsoft doesn’t think much further than the development of its own operating system. But you’d be wrong to think that. Redmond, it appears, has actually launched its own version of Linux. Send no money now But this product is not like Canonical’s Ubuntu or [entity display=\"Red Hat\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"red-hat\" ticker=\"RHT\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/3568\"]Red Hat[/entity]’s Fedora i.e. you won’t be installing this on your laptops any time soon. This product is not available in your local store... so send no money now; this product is specifically intended for cloud datacenters. This product is Azure Cloud Switch (ACS) and an end user downloadable .ISO file for installation is not around the corner.\nAccording to the fabulously named Kamala Subramaniam at Microsoft, “The Azure Cloud Switch (ACS) is our foray into building our own software for running network devices like switches. It is a cross-platform modular operating system for datacenter networking built on Linux. ACS allows us to debug, fix and test software bugs much faster. It also allows us the flexibility to scale down the software and develop features that are required for our datacenter and our networking needs.” What is a network ‘switch’ anyway? In networking, a switch is a device that quite literally ‘switches’ the path of data from what can be multiple input ports to a specified output port so that the information can reach its intended destination. Previously hardware with embedded software intelligence, switches are increasingly thought of as software in the new world of ‘software-defined’ computing.Microsoft faced a challenge when building out its Azure cloud because network switches are typically built with their own software baked inside -- and the firm had difficulty always being able to integrate that software with the systems found inside its Azure cloud.We know that Microsoft has not only embraced Linux very publicly in recent times, it used to run Hotmail on FreeBSD , a UNIX-like system similar to the Linux operating system -- it was used to run the front-end web servers that handled login. This was back in 1997, so why Ballmer made his Linux comments in 2001 is a tale untold. Will this replace Windows? So will Azure Cloud Switch (ACS) technology start migrating towards the desktop and eventually represent an alternative to Windows itself? Ah, that would be a no, right there.Although ACS is built around the Open Compute Project's Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI) and ACS is being contributed to the Open Compute Project, this product is very much for internal use only. Microsoft philanthropy or selfishness? Is Microsoft developing ACS because it is committed to Linux, open standards, open systems and open networking? Yes, it is. Is Microsoft developing ACS because it believes in the true value of open source and Linux? Yes, it is. Is Microsoft developing ACS because it wants wants Linux users to get more support when using Microsoft Azure Cloud so it can sell more instances and services in order to make more money? Yes, obviously, it is.", "external_links": ["https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb496985.aspx", "http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/author/kasubra/"], "published": "2015-09-22T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T19:59:56.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
