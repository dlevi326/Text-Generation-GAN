Discounting the effects of fluctuating exchange rates, the growth was 3.1 per cent.\nFor the first half of the year, Universal, the largest music company in the world, had $US255 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, up 11.5 per cent from the same period last year, or 5 per cent on a \"constant currency\" basis. For its second quarter alone, Universal had $US1.4 billion in revenue and $US139 million in earnings.\nStreaming jump The results, Vivendi said, were helped by a 34 per cent jump in subscription and streaming services during the first half of the year, which \"more than offset the decline in both digital download and physical sales.\" For the first half of 2015, Vivendi said, download sales were down 5 per cent.\nThat was a shift from Universal's results in 2014, when the company said that streaming had experienced \"significant growth\" but did not contribute enough revenue to make up for a drop in download sales. As Vivendi executives noted in a conference call with investors, the second-quarter results did not reflect the arrival of Apple Music, which started on June 30 and is available free for 90 days.\nWhile the recording industry's revenues have remained relatively flat in recent years, analysts have begun to warm to the idea that streaming may lead the way to growth. Marcus Diebel, an analyst at JPMorgan, recently upgraded Vivendi's stock, saying that the growth of streaming had led the music business to \"an inflection point\" and predicting growing revenues for the next three years.\nVivendi, which also owns the Canal Plus television and film group, among other media and technology assets, reported $US2.9 billion in revenue for the second quarter, up 9 per cent from last year. For the first half of 2015, it had $US5.7 billion in revenue, up 8.3 per cent.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:20:43.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
