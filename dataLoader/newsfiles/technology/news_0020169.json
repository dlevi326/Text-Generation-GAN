The agreement includes the delivery of end-to-end demand-driven supply chain solutions to One Network and Synoptima clients and prospects throughout the Asia Pacific Region. Supply chains in Asia are becoming more and more complex as companies realize the need to spread their production bases across multiple countries while expanding distribution efforts into emerging markets. As a result, new and innovative supply chains are required. Companies are increasingly seeking to achieve seamless collaboration across suppliers, manufacturers, service providers, distribution channels, and consumers.\nTogether, Synoptima and One Network have the foresight to help companies in the Asia Pacific region reach that goal.\n“One Network and Synoptima partnership combines leading-edge cloud technologies with some of the world’s top experts in supply chain engineering, transformation management, logistics, and transportation services”, said Dom Rego, Synoptima Advisory Board Member. “As we continue the expansion of our revolutionary end-to-end supply chain management Services, together with One Network we can now offer leading solutions that manage demand, supply, and logistics processes as a community of collaboration trading partners focused on satisfying the end-customer”.\nTraditional Logistics companies are challenged to manage lean levels of inventory and switch sourcing easily from country to country as stocks are depleted, or speed up and slow down cargo that is already in transit. Futhermore the ability to drive that same flexibility at the manufacturing or the market distribution side is hardly available. Synoptima with its Integrative Logistics Services changes that paradigm dramatically and offers customers unforeseen levels of flexibility while improving effectiveness and lowering logistics costs in the process.\n“Synoptima’s innovative and holistic supply chain management approach coupled with its superior engineering and regional expertise is the perfect complement to our consumer-driven approach. Both companies are at the forefront of the next evolution of logistics in both services and technology” said Bruce Jacquemard, One Network EVP of Sales and Marketing.\nAbout One Network Enterprises\nOne Network offers a unique approach to supply chain management and other multi-party problems.
