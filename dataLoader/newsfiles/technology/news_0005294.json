The videos, which are being rolled out on news feeds from today, are made by a special set of cameras used to record all angles of a scene simultaneously.\nWhen the video is played on Facebook, the viewer can choose which angle they want to view it from by dragging the video with a computer cursor or by dragging it with your finger on phones or tablets.\nYouTube launched 360-degree videos in March\nPointing a mobile phone or a tablet in different directions will also change the angle of the video, making it feel more immersive.\nAlso among those using the new video type are Discovery, GoPro, VICE, Disney and NBC's Saturday Night Live. The 360-degree version of Star Wars: The Force Awakens will allow viewers to feel like they are in the Star Wars universe, Facebook says.\nFacebook bought Oculus VR last year\nThe videos are to be rolled out on the web and Android \"soon\" and for iOS \"in the coming months\", Facebook added.\nFacebook bought Oculus VR for $2bn (Â£1.3bn) in 2014 and has long-term ambitions to host and create virtual reality content.\nIt's going head-to-head with Facebook which rolled out its own 360-degree videos in March.\nMeanwhile Kolor, which makes 360-degree video software owned by GoPro, makes its own player for mobiles and desktops.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T17:09:58.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
