The regulator said it is targeting the end of the month for finalisation of the application.\nHowever, some of ODM’s founding shareholders are opposing the transfer, citing an outstanding court case relating to the value of the shares they were forced to sell as part of a business rescue process.\nODM, which launched the country’s second pay-TV service, TopTV, in 2010, applied for business rescue in November 2012 as it was battling to raise funds for the company. In 2013 shareholders agreed to sell shares to StarTimes, which promised to invest millions into the company.\nFirst National Media Investment Holdings (FNMIH) has called on the regulator not to transfer the network licence until the shares dispute is resolved.\nRed Gold, another shareholder partly owned by Kopano ke Matla Investment, wants an independent audit of the company to determine whether StarTimes has invested part or all of the $100m as initially agreed.\nIn a letter to Icasa, FNMIH states that in October 2013 it entered into an agreement with the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) whereby the IDC would acquire all shareholder shares in FNMIH at a \"fair market value to be determined by an independent auditor\".\n\"To date the sale of shares of the shareholders in FNMIH to the IDC has not been concluded. The shareholders of FNMIH still remain rightful holders of these shares until the transaction contemplated with the IDC has been concluded,\" it said.\nFNMIH has independently placed a conservative valuation of R2.2bn for ODM.\nKopano ke Matla, an investment arm of Cosatu, states in a letter that in October 2013 the company was made to understand that ODM shares were worthless and that its loans worth R200m to ODM, through Red Gold, were written off in the business rescue process and sold to StarTimes at 2.25c. This was in exchange for the recapitalisation of ODM by StarTimes for $100m, \"which would bring immediate solvency to ODM and enable the IDC to recoup its investment\".\nKopano ke Matla is requesting an explanation for the undervaluation of Red Gold’s shareholding in ODM and \"why it was seemingly sold to what appears to be connected parties, in other words staff members and companies connected to IDC board members, at this price\".\nEddie Mbalo, former CEO of ODM and now a director in the company, said FNMIH and Red Gold were no longer shareholders in ODM. They had a funding agreement with the IDC, which led to it exercising its rights on the shares owned by the two shareholders when ODM filed for business rescue.\n\"That has nothing to do with ODM,\" he said.\nMr Mbalo said it was impossible to place a value on the company that was near liquidation.\nMr Mbalo said StarTimes could not capitalise until the business rescue was finalised. He said StarTimes wanted the transfer of the network licence for its \"own security\" to provide network connectivity to ODM and any other broadcaster into the future.\nMr Mbalo’s Diduscan is also a shareholder in ODM — shares that disgruntled minority shareholders claim he and other new shareholders in ODM received for free. He denied this, saying they had paid the nominal value for the shares.\nSince 2012, when the company filed for business rescue, its subscribers are said to have dropped to 80,000 from 150,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:21:27.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
