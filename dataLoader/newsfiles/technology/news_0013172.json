A spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for statistical clarification. \n“This survey data provides a powerful way for agency leaders to be able to think about, and evaluate, their engagement programs and office cultures,” said OPM Acting Director Beth Cobert. \nNASA topped both the engagement and satisfaction indices for large agencies, with 78 and 76 percent positive responses, respectively. \nThe Homeland Security Department registered low marks across the board, with 39 percent of DHS respondents saying they were satisfied with their organization and 38 percent saying their “leaders lead.” \nSmaller agencies tended to score higher than large agencies on employee engagement, with an overall 67 percent score for small agencies compared with a government-wide 64 percent. \nFifty percent of the feds contacted about FEVS gave responses to the survey, OPM noted. OPM plans to release the full FEVS data in October. About the Author \nZach Noble is a staff writer covering cloud, big data and workforce issues.
