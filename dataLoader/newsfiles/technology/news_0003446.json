Service would be curtailed in certain other parts of D.C., UPS added. \n\"The majority of UPS customers will see no impact to service as a result of the Pope's visit,\" the company said in a statement on Wednesday. \nIn addition, UPS said service \"may be delayed\" in parts of Philadelphia on Wednesday and Thursday and parts of New York City on Thursday and Friday. \nFedEx says it will operate, but with caveats. \nThe company posted a spreadsheet of all its expected service delays, including offices that will be closed or have limited service. \nApple's next generation of iPhones will go on sale in stores on Friday. Pre-sales began about a week and a half ago, with most of the expected delivery dates falling on Friday. \nMacRumors first reported this story. \nEditor's Note: This article has been updated from an earlier version to include the latest information from UPS. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
