This auction is critical because it's expected to be one of the last times the government will be selling low-frequency radio licenses, or the airwaves that help carriers provide lower-cost service to suburban and rural markets while improving in-building coverage.\nAT&T and Verizon, the largest wireless companies in the country, already control more than 70 percent of this type of wireless spectrum. The FCC's auction is expected to give smaller players, like Sprint and T-Mobile, access to larger quantities of this valuable asset.\nThe Overland Park, Kansas, wireless carrier has been plagued by a series of poor business decisions dating back to its ill-fated 2005 acquisition of Nextel, which haunted the company for years. Many in the industry question whether Sprint's latest move may be more of the same. While service has improved, the company has a long way to go in convincing consumers that its network is worth a second look.\nThat's why Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure believes it's important for Sprint to focus on its network and the assets it already owns instead of spending billions of dollars to acquire new spectrum that it probably wouldn't be able to use for another four years.\n\"Sprint's focus and overarching imperative must be on improving its network and market position in the immediate term so we can remain a powerful force in fostering competition, consumer benefits and innovation in the wireless broadband world,\" Claure said in a statement. \"Sprint has the spectrum it needs to deploy its network architecture of the future.\"\nT-Mobile CEO John Legere, however, said Sprint is making a huge mistake by missing the opportunity to buy low-band spectrum, especially since the FCC has agreed to set aside a portion for smaller carriers. Legere is hopeful that without Sprint, there will be more spectrum for T-Mobile to buy.\nScreenshot CNET/Marguerite Reardon\nSprint's plan Wireless spectrum is the lifeblood of the wireless industry, the airwaves used to carry voice calls, text messages and Facebook uploads from smartphones to devices across the Internet. Sprint already owns more spectrum than any other nationwide carrier. The trouble is that most of this spectrum, which it acquired in 2013 from its acquisition of Clearwire, is at higher frequencies. This means Sprint must install more cell towers to cover the same geography than it would using low-frequency spectrum.\nThe good news for Sprint is that it also owns other spectrum assets. Through its acquisition of Nextel, Sprint owns some low-frequency spectrum. After nearly a decade of working to resolve its interference issues, the company is deploying this spectrum for its 4G LTE wireless service.\nMeanwhile, Sprint is also using new technologies to maximize the performance on its higher-frequency spectrum, significantly increasing the speed and capacity of links that use these airwaves. As a result, the reliability of its phone calls and text messages has improved, according to testing firm RootMetrics .\nIt's a safer bet, but whether it will be enough to keep Sprint competitive in the long run is unclear. Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics, said that in spite of Sprint's past failures, it has a good chance.\n\"When you're sitting on two times more spectrum than anyone else,\" he said, \"why not spend your money on improving your network rather than getting more of what you already own?\"\nNo surprise Sprint's decision to sit out the auction surprised no one, said an FCC official. The company has stated publicly several times over the past six months that it may not participate in the auction. A company spokesman said that it was a business decision based on the state of the company's current assets.\nThe other three major wireless carriers intend to participate in the auction, which has likely eased anxiety at the FCC, since it needs strong carrier participation for a successful auction.\nGiven that Sprint hasn't participated in an FCC wireless spectrum auction in more than a decade, officials aren't worried about the effect its absence will have on the auction. The agency still managed to rake in record-breaking revenue in 2008, the last time TV broadcast spectrum was auctioned off. An auction of a separate range of spectrum, which ended in January, raised $45 billion.\nAnother factor for Sprint is its financial state. The company burned through $2.2 billion in cash in the second calendar quarter of 2015. Meanwhile, all of the big four competitors in wireless have been engaged in a price war that has forced Sprint to slash prices. In August, Sprint lost its position as the third largest carrier to T-Mobile. Even though Sprint made no mention of its financial difficulties in its press release, it was unlikely to participate in the auction without a cash infusion from its parent, Japanese carrier Softbank.", "external_links": ["http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/10/07/de4e9ff3-f407-4fe7-af2b-b52920d0aac2/resize/570xauto/fccea6adfb4e82a6469c0d39832aaf0b/sprintburlingameinnovationcenter610x406.jpg", "http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/29/2f3d0e75-01c5-479a-bb81-24645d71009e/resize/970x546/0f5dfb49847764f5b47b673d90c4e6c9/screen-shot-2015-09-29-at-2-15-57-am.png"], "published": "2015-09-29T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:10:12.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
