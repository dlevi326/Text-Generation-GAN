It seemed likely to happen after Hawaii County Prosecutor Mitch Roth supported the idea.\nRoth had said it would only be used for about 20 people charged with obstruction in April. There have been subsequent arrests in the battle to build the telescope on Mauna Kea, a mountain many Native Hawaiians consider sacred.\n\"Hooponopono was first raised several months ago, when the legal landscape was different,\" Wisch's statement said. \"There are now are cases related to Mauna Kea pending in multiple courts in multiple jurisdictions, enforcement actions have been taken and challenged, and additional individuals and groups with no connection to the defendants who first requested hooponopono have asked to engage in a dialogue regarding stewardship of the mountain.\"\nRoth couldn't immediately be reached for comment on the state's decision.\nA total of 31 people were arrested in April when protesters blocked workers from accessing the construction site near Mauna Kea's summit for the planned $1.4 billion Thirty Meter Telescope. Roth's office later moved to dismiss trespassing charges for 10 defendants.\nRoth said hooponopono was being considered only for the remaining 21 people charged with obstructing. A few of them told prosecutors they preferred to proceed with a trial, he said. It wasn't being considered for 12 people who are charged in a second round of arrests.\nAfter that, 15 people were arrested for violating an emergency rule created to stop protesters from camping on the mountain.\nConstruction remains stalled amid the protests.\nHooponopono has been used in other court matters.\nIn 2006, a federal judge in Honolulu let Hawaiian groups and the state's largest museum use hooponopono in a dispute over a cache of priceless artifacts. It has been used in family court cases such as custody disputes, said Malcolm Naea Chun, a Native Hawaiian culture scholar.\n———\nFollow Jennifer Sinco Kelleher at http://www.twitter.com/JenHapa .\n0 Shares Email Star Comments Hawaii Refuses Culture-Based Mediation for Telescope Arrests   Pilgrims   \nSupermoon Lunar Eclipse: How to Take the Best Photos \" \nPope   Nasdaq Center Aims to Build Relationships With Startups Judge:   \n  \" \n11  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T17:06:38.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
