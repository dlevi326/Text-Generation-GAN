The car goes on sale early next year and the mirror will be offered at extra cost.\nAt the flip of a switch, the full display mirror converts into a video display that provides a panoramic view behind the vehicle.\nCalled the Gentex Full Display Mirror, it incorporates a rear camera and software that transforms a prosaic piece of hardware into a platform for more advanced safety technology, marketing director Craig Piersma said.\nPiersma said BMW would be the next automaker after GM to use the Gentex mirror, but declined to specify on which model. BMW declined to comment.\nWhile relatively young tech-focused suppliers such as Mobileye NV have become investor favorites as the auto industry ramps up development of advanced driver assistance systems - the building blocks for future self-driving cars - Gentex has quietly been turning out 30 million rear-view mirrors a year.\nFounded in 1974, Gentex is one of the world's largest suppliers of auto-dimming automotive mirrors, but it also has steadily beefed up its capability as an electronics manufacturer, expanding its expertise in cameras and displays.\nAmong its products is the camera-based SmartBeam system that automatically switches headlamps from high to low beam. It also provides collision and lane departure warnings and vehicle and pedestrian detection.\nGentex will focus its technology development around the rear-view mirror. \"We don't compete with Mobileye,\" Piersma said. He said Gentex works with vehicle manufacturers and other suppliers to tailor its mirrors and displays for specific vehicles.\n(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Grant McCool )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T21:35:24.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
