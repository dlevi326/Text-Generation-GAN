The new prices will be especially lucrative for newer phones like the iPhone 5, 5S, 6, and 6 Plus, urging those who own these devices to act quickly.\nAs proven from previous new product launches, this is the best time period to sell an older iPhone model - as the trade-in value for old devices will drop dramatically once Apple’s new iPhone becomes available. The company recently adjusted their prices to give consumers the best prices for their used devices, outbidding other online trade-in opportunities and carrier services. ePelican.com provides offers that are good for 30 days, meaning a customer has 30 days to actually send their device in once they have placed an order.\nePelican.com makes it easy to sell your iPhone before the launch, by letting users sell their devices from the comfort of their home instead of going to meet someone or waiting in line at a retail store. The first step is to get an offer from ePelican.com by selecting which device they are willing to sell. The company will then ship a complimentary box and include a free shipping label to send the product in. Once the device is received and inspected, users are paid via PayPal or check.\nThe amounts offered are dependant upon the condition of the phone as well as the amount of storage space the device contains. The carrier that the seller contracts service through will also determine the value of the old iPhone. Newer iPhones like the iPhone 5S, can warrant as much as $200. Meanwhile, owners of the the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus can sell their devices for between $415 and $460, with no strings attached. The company has also given an outlet to those looking to salvage some money out of a broken iPhone . A broken iPhone 6 will net the seller about $135, while a broken conditioned iPhone 6 Plus can sell for $155.\nConsumers should be made aware that those considering an upgrade will receive a much higher payout for their old iPhone if they sell it prior to the release of the new one, with offer prices going down once a newer iPhone hits the market. With ePelican, this transaction can be done safely and swiftly.\nAbout ePelican:\nePelican.com is an onilne service that allows consumers to easily sell and recycle their used smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches for cash. ePelican.com provides a safe, convenient way to trade-in unwanted iPhones, iPad’s and other mobile devices by offering free packaging shipping, and data removal.
