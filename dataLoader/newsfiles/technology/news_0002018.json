As the protected spherical device soared over the heads of those attending the first-ever WBT Open Innovation Forum on Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), viewers watched the design provide safe, protected flight and the ability to land, roll and return to flight — perfect for the needs of industrial facility inspections, first responders and others. \nNow, the second annual forum is planned for Sept. 28-29, again in Stillwater’s Wes Watkins Center and again with an unmanned aerial demonstration. Only this time, the commercially available product dubbed ATLAS™ will be flown, productized and marketed through Cowboy Technologies’ spinout company, Unmanned Cowboys. \nThe Open Innovation Forum was designed to benefit products and ideas like ATLAS™, bringing together developers, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, government officials and experts to help the industry grow — especially here in Oklahoma. \n“Oklahoma State University and Unmanned Cowboys are focused on solutions that meet the industry’s need for safe, protected flight of unmanned aerial systems that provide real value for customers,” Daniel Will, executive director of Cowboy Technologies, said. \nThe WBT Open Innovation Forum on UAS will kick off the evening of Sept. 28, followed by a day-long program on Sept. 29 featuring international and national industry experts, leaders and venture capitalists for a look at where the rapidly evolving unmanned aerial industry is today and where it’s going tomorrow. \nResearch institutions and startups will be seeking partnerships to license, sell and develop their innovations; and, industry leaders will give insight into how communities are building development hubs, the mindset of capital investors and the state of public policy and regulations. \nNetworking opportunities will be central in an evening kick-off event Sept. 28, followed by a similar evening to conclude the event on Sept. 29. \nFeatured presenters for the Sept. 29 day-long agenda include: Stephen McKeever, Oklahoma’s secretary of science and technology as well as the former vice president for research and technology transfer at Oklahoma State.
