He topped 99 percent of competitors at the Ivy fund, where he worked from 2006 to 2013.\nThe manager has triumphed by digging through the junk pile for bargains, especially bonds and loans rated around CCC, the riskiest end of the high-yield market. Krug said rating companies frequently consign bonds to that category based on faulty analysis, which creates opportunity for managers who do their homework.\n“Lower-rated debt has massively underperformed this year, yet we’ve managed to outperform,” said Krug in an interview from Mission Woods, Kansas. “There is a tremendous amount of inefficiency in that market.”\nHigh-yield bonds rated CCC and lower lost 3.8 percent this year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index, compared with a gain of 0.3 percent for a broad index of speculative-grade bonds.\nBankruptcy Risk Krug’s fund, which has returned 3.4 percent this year, had 49 percent of its money in bonds rated CCC or lower as of June 30. The average high-yield fund had 11 percent, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at S&P Capital IQ.\nBryan Krug&apos;s Artisan high-yield fund has outperformed its rivals since inception in March 2014.\nNot everyone sees opportunity at the low end of the junk-bond market. Margie Patel, who manages $1.4 billion in stocks and high-yield bonds for Wells Fargo Asset Management, said CCC rated bonds face significant risks following the dive in commodities’ markets. CCC, the third tier of speculative-grade debt, means it is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, according to Standard & Poor’s.\n“We will see bankruptcies in energy and metals and in some cases the recovery rates will be low,” said Patel, who prefers debt in the BB-range.\nUnder Krug, 38, Ivy High Income grew from less than $100 million in assets to $9 billion. He joined Milwaukee-based Artisan in December 2013, attracted by the chance to build his own team and possibly manage money outside of mutual funds.\n’Better Talents’ Justin Hopkins, a fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors in San Antonio, Texas, invested with Krug at Ivy and then followed him to Artisan.\n“Bryan is one of the better talents I have run across,” said Hopkins, whose firm manages $11 billion. “His performance is consistent and he is someone who can preserve capital.”\nKrug has employed the same strategy at both funds. He tries to find mispriced securities from companies with the potential to improve their finances, either through cutting debt or boosting earnings.\nHe bought a CCC rated loan from Websense Inc., a cybersecurity company owned by a private equity firm, in the first quarter of 2015. Bond raters such as Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s tend to look skeptically upon software firms, said Krug, because their value rests on intellectual property rather than the assets they own.\nTakeover Benefit The rating companies \"have a hard time wrapping their heads around intellectual property,” he said. “They focus on the risk to the technology. In the case of Websense we saw a leading-edge business with growth potential.”\nIn April, Raytheon Co., a defense contractor, acquired Websense for $1.9 billion. Krug said the bonds were purchased for “meaningfully” more than he paid for them.\nHe benefited from another takeover in July when Beacon Roofing Supply Inc. acquired one of his holdings, Roofing Supply Inc. Its bonds were in the CCC category, said Krug, because the company was losing money as a result of an expansion program.\n“The market saw the losses as bad news, we saw them as good news,” he said.\nEnergy Bets Thanks to the acquisition, Roofing Supply’s 10 percent bonds that mature in 2020 gained 15 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nMichael Adler, a spokesman for Moody’s, and John Piecuch, a spokesman for Standard & Poor’s, declined to comment on Krug’s critique of rating companies.\nHistorically, Krug has shied away from energy producers, a decision that helped his fund outperform in the second half of 2014 when the price of oil fell roughly 50 percent to just over $53 a barrel.\nThis year, even as oil has fallen further, he has ramped up his energy holdings, concentrating on companies in the exploration and production business. High-yield energy bonds declined 7.4 percent this year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.\n“Energy has gotten destroyed,” said Krug.\nBuying Callon Still, he has found value in loans and bonds of energy producers that can service their debt in today’s low-price environment. If oil and gas prices rise over time as he expects, the investments will pay off.\nKrug owns a loan from Callon Petroleum Co., based in Natchez, Mississippi. In his second-quarter letter to investors, he called Callon “one of our highest conviction energy holdings.” The loan was one of the fund’s 10 largest positions as of Aug. 31, according to Artisan’s website.\n“It is impossible to predict the timing of commodity prices, but now is the time to invest because there is opportunity,” said Krug.\nIt’s also not a bad time to buy high-yield bonds in general, he said. Nervous investors have pushed up yields, creating additional bargains.\n“We can find investments,” said Krug. “I’m not too worried.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T07:44:35.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
