The newly launched e-commerce store provides a platform for purchasing agents, industrial engineers, and maintenance technicians to configure, price, and purchase conveyors online.\nThe new online conveyor pricing tool makes it convenient to create a Quote: and review it with supervisors. If tasked with sourcing several Quote: s, it can be time consuming to call and explain the project to multiple companies. With Bastian Solutions’ conveyor pricing tool, manufacturers can configure the conveyor, complete with all options, and then print or share the Quote: as needed. All the information needed is immediate.\n“As e-commerce sales continue to rise, more and more of the growth is coming from industrial products and business services,” explained Greg Conner, Regional Director at Bastian Solutions. “In response, we wanted to re-design and improve our online equipment store so it was more than just a place to buy.”\nThe goal of Bastian Solutions’ redesign was simple – to create a platform that allows end users the ability to move beyond the conventional, and often times very slow, sales process. Users can expect faster, easier procurement of conveyor 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nTo learn more, go to: http://ow.ly/Qt7LI\nAbout Bastian Solutions\nBastian Solutions (http://ow.ly/LaOTe), a global material handling systems integrator and expert in e-commerce fulfillment automation is an innovator in the fields of material handling automation, goods-to-person systems, wearable AR technology, supply chain software, and robotics.
