It is regularly observed every quarter of a century, but Francis has called a special one running from December 8 to November 20 2016.\n\"I am thinking especially of all the women who have resorted to abortion. I am well aware of the pressures that have led them to this decision. I know that it is an existential and moral tragedy,\" the pontiff said in a public letter.\n\"I have decided that during the Jubilee Year all priests will have the faculty to absolve from the sin of abortion all who have committed it and who ask forgiveness with heartfelt penance,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:08:30.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
