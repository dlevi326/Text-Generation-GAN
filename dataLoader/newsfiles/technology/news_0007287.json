From September through November, fans will be on the hunt for this elusive beast, and are encouraged to collect additional cans, either standard orange hunting cans or those featuring white antlers, to stack atop the Great White Stone to build a legendary mount. \nThe initial plan to launch the limited edition cans was for Keystone Light and Testa to create a standard commercial together. Upon further deliberation though, Keystone Light has opted to release a behind the scenes look at the hilariousness that ensued as a direct result of working with the eccentric Ojai taxidermist. \n\"Our partnership with Chuck Testa started out of a desire to create a pretty simple commercial,\" says Franco Davis, the fictitious director of this fictitious Keystone Light commercial. \"While that did not go even remotely according to plan, what we got was still something pretty special...I suppose.\" \nFootage of the puzzling, yet charming faux-effort can be seen here: \nhttps://youtu.be/-WTi4qhJ4pY \nTesta first rose to internet stardom after launching his own Official Ojai Valley Taxidermy TV Commercial on YouTube in 2011. \n\"I'm so excited to be working with Keystone Light,\" says Testa. \"The commercial shoot went great. Not the biggest fan of the director Franco, and neither were the animals, but I think we got something real special for Keystone Light.\" \nTesta encourages viewers to participate in \"The Hunt for The Great White Stone,\" by heading to their local store to \"bag a legend.\" Fans can build as large and creative of a mount as possible utilizing orange and white antler cans atop a Great White Stone and post it to the Keystone Light Facebook page for all to see! \nFor more information on joining in \"The Hunt for the Great White Stone,\" tips from Chuck Testa on bagging a legend or to share images of your legendary mount for a chance at Keystone Light prizes, visit: Facebook.com/KeystoneLight \nFor more information on Chuck Testa and Ojai Valley Taxidermy please visit: Ojaitaxidermy.com \nAbout MillerCoors Built on a foundation of great beer brands and nearly 300 years of brewing heritage, MillerCoors continues the commitment of its founders to brew the highest quality beers.

Intrigued by a do it yourself bird mounting kit ordered from the back of a magazine, Chuck Testa's initial curiosity became a hobby and continues on. Knowing the Taxidermy business was the right fit and willing to throw caution to the wind, Ojai Valley Taxidermy opened its doors full time in 1987. Housed in the beautiful Ojai Valley of Southern California, Taxidermy is a most unusual business for the area more known for exclusive artists, entertainers and millionaires. Chucks warm and friendly personality, coupled with his attention to customer service has allowed him to enjoy a successful and interesting existence in a career that he is truly passionate about. Whilst working exclusively with non-living trophies, Chuck is a true animal lover and shares his home with a variety of furred and feathered friends, including 6 dogs and 2 chickens. As a small shop, Chuck depends on a select group of craftsmen to provide subcontracting and support.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:48:22.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
