In a technical evaluation from the Mobile Device UX group at Strategy Analytics ( www.strategyanalytics.com ) where the battery performance of flagship smartphones from Apple, HTC, Huawei, LG, Google, Nokia/Microsoft, Samsung, and Sony was benchmarked, SA found that the smartphones with the largest battery capacities did not provide the longest battery life â€“ i.e. bigger did not mean better. In testing designed around the profile of a 'typical' smartphone user, the battery of the Apple iPhone 6 Plus lasted on average longer than competitor flagship smartphones, despite not having the highest capacity. Importantly, Strategy Analytics evaluated all devices concurrently, using the same setup and test protocol; testing was repeated to measure average performance.\nClick here for the report: http://bit.ly/1i7KboI \nChirag Upadhyay , report author and Analyst commented, \"As the test results demonstrate, simply having the largest battery capacity does not automatically mean having the longest battery life. It is important for smartphone manufacturers to optimize the performance of a device to give the longest possible battery life, in order to improve user satisfaction.\" \nPaul Brown , Director, Mobile Device UX, added \"Ways in which smartphone manufacturers can help manage consumer's battery expectations, include a battery saver mode to provide greater control for consumers whose battery may be getting low, without the option of immediately charging it; and fast charging, to enable the process to be completed much more quickly.\"\nAbout Strategy Analytics \nStrategy Analytics, Inc. provides the competitive edge with advisory services, consulting and actionable market intelligence for emerging technology, mobile and wireless, digital consumer and automotive electronics companies.
