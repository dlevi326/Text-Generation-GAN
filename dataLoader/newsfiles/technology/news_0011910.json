Yes I do!\nDo I enjoy aggressive sports? No, not really. In my books I do place Rugby and Boxing in the list of aggressive sports. Why? Winning the “games” in those sports does include a fairly high level of bodily aggression between the players which is being tolerated by the rules.\nOn reading the above news clip describing a player who proudly ignores advice from his doctor not to participate in a game of rugby relatively shortly after a neck operation. The game being an important game for classification in a world cup final Rugby.\nHaving watched sufficient rugby games in the past, I have seen enough attacks in the game which include potential harm to the bodies including the neck.\nI have also met many men with permanent injuries to their bodies and -on questioning- admitting that these were rugby injuries. I do admit that other sports also produce injured players but most rules in these games do not allow -and certainly not encourage- direct attacks to the body of an opponent. It seems acceptable that the Rugby game produces permanent injuries.\nMy serious comment of disapproval goes to the comment of the coach. He refers to a “passionate commitment” of which he wants to see more from his players. We all appreciate that the selective players give their utmost for the Nation but we should not require that they risk their life or their future against medical advice. And I am not wanting to go into the financial consequences of a player who will be damaged for life. I do not have a glimmer of insight in those matters in the sports world.\nI do find the comment from the coach for the player's decision by no means acceptable in stretching a less responsible decision as an good example to be followed by his other players.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:16:08.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
