Here's are key takeaways from PM's speech at Digital India event in Silicon Valley:\n\n* Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are the new neighbourhoods of our new world.\n\n* If Facebook were a country, it would be the third most populous one and the most connected.\n\n* Google today has made teachers less awe-inspiring and grandparents more idle.\n\n* Twitter has turned everyone into a reporter.\n\n* The traffic lights that need to work the best are on Cisco routers.\n\n* The status that now matters is not whether you are awake or asleep, but whether you are online or offline.\n\n* The most fundamental debate for our youth is the choice between Android, iOS or Windows.\n\n* In India, a mother in a distant hill village has a better chance to save her new born infant. A child in a remote village has better access to education.\n\n* The pace at which people are taking to digital technology defies our stereotypes of age, education, language and income.\n\n* There may be still some who see the digital economy as the tool of the rich, educated and the privileged. But, ask the taxi driver or the corner vendor in India what he has gained from his cell phone, and the debate gets settled.\n\n* I see technology as a means to empower and as a tool that bridges the distance between hope and opportunity. Social media is reducing social barriers. It connects people on the strength of human values, not identities.\n\n* Technology is forcing governments to deal with massive volume of data and generate responses, not in 24 hours but in 24 minutes.\n\n* We want to free our citizens from the burden of excessive paper documents in every office. We want paperless transactions. We will set up a digital locker for every citizen to store personal documents that can be shared across departments.\n\n* We must bridge the digital divide and promote digital literacy in the same way that we seek to ensure general literacy. We must ensure that technology is accessible, affordable, and adds value.\n\n* We want our 1.25 billion citizens to be digitally connected. We already have broadband usage across India go up by 63% last year.\n\n* We have launched an aggressive expansion of the National Optical Fibre Network that will take broadband to our 600,000 villages. We will connect all schools and colleges with broadband. Building I-ways are as important as highways.\n\n* We want to ensure that free Wi-Fi is not only there in airport lounges, but also on our railway platforms. Teaming up with Google, we will cover 500 railway stations in a short time.\n\n* We are also setting up Common Service Centres in villages and towns. We will also use information technology to build smart cities.\n\n* We want to turn our villages into smart economic hubs and connect our farmers better to markets and makes them less vulnerable to the whims of weather.\n\n* Much of India that we dream of is yet to be built. So, we have the opportunity to shape its path now. And, we have the talent, enterprise and skills to succeed.
