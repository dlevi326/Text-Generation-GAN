Look no further than Vanity Fair's latest New Establishment list. Related Content Surge soda returns to store shelves \nThe magazine's cover features 31-year-old Mark Zuckerberg: The Facebook founder snagged the top spot on Vanity Fair's 21st annual ranking of the most powerful people in business and media. \nThe list is broken up into two categories: \"Disrupters,\" which ranks 50 people who are shaping the way we interact, work, play and consume, and the \"Powers That Be,\" which includes 25 visionaries in business and entertainment who have used their influence to impact cultural change \nThis year, tech founders and funders monopolize the 75 slots. It's further evidence of tech's impact, according to Vanity Fair writer Andrew Ross Sorkin. The economy, he writes, is increasingly centered on \"information, technology and entertainment in one form or another.\" \nOn the Disrupters list, \"you are likely to find people who were in grade school when the New Establishment began publication,\" Sorkin wrote. \"A few were in their cribs.\" \nThe Powers That Be list, on the other hand, includes \"many of whom earned their renown after decades of hard work and striving,\" Sorkin wrote. \nBut it's 25-year-old Taylor Swift -- who made headlines this summer for prompting policy change at Apple -- who leads that ranking. \nZuckerberg is the youngest person to ever top the New Establishment list. \n\"The $240 billion company he scratched out of his dorm room at Harvard is apparently just his first step toward world domination in the realm of social networking,\" wrote Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter. \nZuckerberg -- who was number five last year -- made major strides this year demonstrating Facebook's potential outside the social networking space. That includes partnering with major news organizations like The New York Times and exploring virtual reality integration in users' newsfeed. \nNewbies to the list include CEOs of tech \"unicorns\" -- privately-held companies valued at $1 billion or more -- like Slack's Stewart Butterfield and Theranos' Elizabeth Holmes. It also includes venture capitalists like Y Combinator CEO Sam Altman and Lowercase Capital's Chris Sacca. \nThere are a few controversial CEOs on the list as well, including Jeff Bezos, who came under fire last month for Amazon's work culture, and Jessica Alba, whose Honest Company was sued this month for allegedly mislabeling products. \nThe list -- which is crunched and crafted by Vanity Fair reporters -- is dominated by men, and includes just 17 women. \nThat includes CNNMoney's Upstart30 list's Meredith Perry, comedian Amy Schumer, as well as Kim Kardashian and Beyonce (who both shared their rankings with their male counterparts, Kanye and Jay Z). \nTop 10 \"Disrupters\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:01:16.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
