PinPoint 2.0 addresses the post acute care regulatory changes that go into effect Oct. 1, among other enhancements. \nMeridian's PinPoint(TM) software package enables hospital executives to identify best practices and more effectively manage the cost of a patient's treatment. Healthcare providers particularly like the automated email alerts for key indicators to improve outcomes. \nPinPoint(TM) 2.0 addresses the regulatory changes in the LTAC sector going into effect Oct. 1, 2015. It allows operators of all sizes to better deal with the different patient management programs required for success under the new regulations. Additionally, Meridian incorporated massive enhancements to its existing platform that enable its users significant reporting flexibility while eliminating reporting sprawl (a growing problem in healthcare provider C-suites). \n\"We are excited to release PinPoint 2.0. Our team has been working diligently to incorporate these enhancements since late last year,\" said Meridian CEO Chris LeBlanc. \nSome of the enhancements include quick search features, advanced filtering options, multi-hospital comparisons and speed. Clients will continue to benefit from the ability to compare physician performance, identify wasteful spending, track costs down to the line item detail, project patient profitability and provide cost benefit analysis of potential or existing patients. \nMeridian continues to be the leader in reporting analytics and process improvement applications for the health care sector. \n\"I believe that we are the first and only software provider to market with tools that help providers manage the new regulatory environment in the LTAC sector. As a SaaS provider we are able to adapt more quickly than others to the ever-changing healthcare landscape, which permits us to be extremely supportive of our clients. PinPoint 2.0 is a testament to those facts,\" LeBlanc said. \nMeridian continues to grow its client base in the healthcare sector. Last year, Meridian saw significant growth in its client base and continues to be the leader in the post-acute care sector. \nMeridian Healthcare Intelligence is a privately-held, Dallas-based SaaS company specializing in hospital financial, clinical reporting, process improvement, and marketing systems.
