Disappointingly, i found that the aisle by the tills was as chock-a-block with chocolates, fudge, doughnuts etc. as it always was.\nPolite staff (in my experience, they’re generally among the best) told me that when the news was announced, it was news to them too. They were not only unprepared but were unsure if it was, in fact, going to happen. Woolworth’s Facebook page shows that customers are confused, countrywide, by checkout areas being ‘decorated’ the same as before. The response from Woolworths is that they were starting with the big stores before the small and that they “don’t have a timeline yet”.\nChanging items in an aisle is no simple affair as shelf space is normally sold to companies wanting their products there. Woolworths is an interesting case as many products are their own and space, at least in Knysna, is limited (if anything, the shop became too crowded this year, as if the customer has to view what’s on offer if they’re to safely negotiate their shopping path).\nThat a big, successful chain issued a BIG statement without an idea at implementation supports claims that their health kick was a knee-jerk response to Pick ‘n Pay , its biggest opponent in the food game, having increased its sales by 12% with its Stickeez toy campaign (for only R3600 worth of groceries, you can get “R12” worth of plastic toys – \"oh, yay\", i mean \"oh, no\"... but, sadly, it works), i.e. whilst Pick ‘n Pay terrorises shopping parents with silly toys that have no benefit to consumer saving or family health, Woolworths decided to head in the opposite route with the removal, or rather intended removal, of teeth decaying, parent-irritating sweets that do not make standing in a queue quicker.\nAs consumers, we don’t have to take sides in a marketing battle if there's eventual benefit to us. But it helps if we encourage the healthier side. If Woolworths proceeds with their intent, it will be a positive, especially since they have more sweets at the tills than anyone else. Will stores such as Shoprite and Checkers, where customers are more likely to be less educated about health, copy the example so that the benefit affects more than the wealthy minority. Will the marketing ploy be transcended so that there’s better shopping for all?\nQuestion #1: Do you care whether or not sweets are removed?\nQuestion #2: What would like to see in the checkout aisle?\nNB: The pleasant tellers at Knysna’s Woolworths are better than sweets", "external_links": ["http://www.capetalk.co.za/articles/4936/timing-of-woolworths-announcement-on-sweets-at-checkout-aisles-strategic"], "published": "2015-09-03T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T10:47:37.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
