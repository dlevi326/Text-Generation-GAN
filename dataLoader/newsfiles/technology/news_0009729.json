Major telecom operators, the Indian Air Force and a multitude of Government offices use Cisco based routers, so this has raised significant concern for the officials.Cisco obviously had some clarification to give on the matter. A company spokesperson said \"These attacks do not exploit vulnerabilities, but instead use compromised credentials or physical access to install malware on network devices. We've shared guidance on how customers can harden their network and prevent, detect and remediate this type of attack.\"\"The impact of finding this implant on your network is severe and most likely indicates the presence of other footholds or compromised systems. This backdoor provides ample capability for the attacker to propagate and compromise other hosts and critical data using this as a very stealthy beachhead,\" the company further added.The security firm FireEye however said that this issue could be more serious than it seems right now. They suggested that the routers in question undergo further analysis to figure out any other exploits that might be present.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T05:04:57.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
