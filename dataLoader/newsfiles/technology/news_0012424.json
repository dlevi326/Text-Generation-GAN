These enhancements follow extensive customer trials of the pre-production system across Europe and North America over the spring and summer. All British AUDS team - Blighter Surveillance Systems, Chess Dynamics and Enterprise Control Systems - adds new capability to production version of counter UAV/drone system following extensive government sponsored spring/summer trials New features include a fourth inhibitor band, an optical disruptor and additional modularity for ease of deployment; AUDS is designed to detect, track, classify and disrupt the growing threat of malicious UAVs at ranges of up to 8km/5 miles Fully featured production version of AUDS to be unveiled at the DSEI Show, the world's leading defence and security event, at the ExCeL Centre, London, 15 to 18 September 2015 \nThe AUDS system, developed by Blighter Surveillance Systems, Chess Dynamics and Enterprise Control Systems, is designed to combat the growing threat of malicious micro, mini and larger unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones. The system can detect a drone five miles (8km) away using electronic scanning radar, track it using infrared and daylight cameras and specialist software before disrupting the flight using an inhibitor to block the radio signals that control it. \nGraham Beall, managing director, Chess Dynamics, said: \"Countering drones is now a global issue and an increasing concern for the military, government and homeland security forces across every continent. It's expected that unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) will be used increasingly for malicious purposes as they can carry cameras, weapons, toxic chemicals and explosives and are being used increasingly for terrorism, espionage and smuggling purposes. \n\"Our system has been developed to address this urgent operational requirement and has been successful in government sponsored counter-UAV trials, detecting and disrupting a variety of fixed and rotary wing drones in under 15 seconds. The new capabilities further enhances the system's suitability for countering rogue or malicious unmanned aircraft systems (C-UAS).\" \nAccording to the AUDS team, the speed with which new features have been added to the system since the launch in May, demonstrates both the agility and flexibility of the trio of specialist companies. The quad band inhibitor enables the AUDS operator to disrupt the different licensed telemetry bands of commercial drones no matter where in the world they are designed and licensed for use. For example, both the 433 and 915 MHz frequencies commonly used by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) can be disrupted as can the 2.4 GHz control band and the global satellite (GNSS) bands. \nThe new optical disruptor is yet another tool available to the AUDS operator. This feature can be utilised for both pointing at a drone for identification purposes and disrupting the automatic gain control settings in the drone's camera system such that the operator loses visibility. The optical disruptor can also provide a very precise identification of known UAV launch activity to any ground forces. \nCommenting on the new features, Colin Bullock, CEO, Enterprise Control Systems, said: \"Carefully controlled disruption of these command links - and the use of the optical disruptor - significantly impairs the operator's ability to control the drone and forms a key part of the spectrum of techniques used by the AUDS system to mitigate the malicious use of drones.\" \nOther improvements in the production version of the AUDS system include a new positioner for the camera. And, following a whole series of trials in a variety of different terrains, the team has modularised the system to reduce the single lift weight down to 25kg. All the different elements - radar, cameras, and RF inhibitor - now clip together to form a complete system. \nMark Radford, CEO, Blighter Surveillance Systems, added: \"We have so far carried out over 150 hours of live testing in government organised trials operating against more than 200 flown sorties of group 1 UAVs. Feedback from our own team and from customers was for a greater level of modularity to speed deployment and to minimise the need for multi person set-up teams. This has now been implemented in the production version - yet another example of our team's fleet footedness.\" \nThe Anti-UAV Defence System (AUDS) integrates the Blighter A400 Series Ku band electronic scanning air security radar, Chess Dynamics' stabilised electro-optic director, infrared and daylight cameras and target tracking software, and a directional radio frequency (RF) inhibitor from Enterprise Control Systems to detect, track, classify, disrupt and neutralise UAVs at ranges of up to 8km. The AUDS system is even effective against so-called Group 1 micro UAVs at ranges of up to 2km and Group 1 mini UAVs at ranges of several kms. \nThe AUDS system is designed for countering drones or remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) in remote border sites or urban areas. It can be operated from fixed locations and from mobile platforms. It has been developed and manufactured in the UK using British technology and a production version is available now at COTS prices starting at less than Â£800k. \nThe fully featured production version of AUDS will be unveiled at the DSEI Show, the world's leading defence and security event, taking place at the ExCeL Centre, London, 15 to 18 September 2015.
