They were discovered in a shallow grave, filled with quicklime. As no formal records were available, after 99 years, the only way to be sure that they were the remains of Thomas Kent was to conduct scientific DNA analysis. \nThe analysis involved the State Pathologist's Office, the National Forensic Coordination Office at the Garda Technical Bureau, Forensic Science Ireland and scientists from University College Dublin. \nTo conduct the analysis, the scientists matched DNA from the remains against blood samples from close living relatives. According to the scientists, the process would have costs an exorbitant amount of time and money a decade ago, but recent advances in next-generation ancient DNA sequencing have brought the testing within much closer reach. \nThe scientific team was lead by Dr Jens Carlsson from the UCD Earth Institute and DNA sequencing was conducted in the PINHASI-ERC ancient DNA laboratory. \nAn Taoiseach, Enda Kenny offered a State funeral to the Kent family earlier this year.
