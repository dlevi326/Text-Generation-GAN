Jessica Hromas Share on twitter by David Ramli Telstra global enterprises and services group executive Brendon Riley says its partnership in Indonesia is running ahead of schedule with tens of millions of dollars of contracts expected to land within the next 12 months.\nTelstra and Telkom Indonesia formed a joint-venture partnership named TelkomTelstra in August 2014 to combine the Australian carrier's advanced enterprise services like cloud computing with the latter's understanding of the local market.\nThe success of the partnership is vital for Telstra's strategy of extracting vital profit growth in the Asian region. Its new chief executive Andy Penn has repeatedly stated that he prefers to form joint ventures with local players to take advantage of Asia's rising middle class.\nMr Riley said the partnership was progressing ahead of expectations with around 200 local staff already trained and over $10 million invested by both sides over the past nine months.\n\"That's a joint amount,\" he said. \"It's a little bit ahead of schedule and the [local] team is really embracing it.\n\"We're talking tens of millions of dollars [in sales over the next 12 months] and hundreds of millions is part of the longer term goal.\"\nTelkomTelstra has already signed up electronics manufacturer Schneider Electric as its first customer. The global firm will buy services for its 30 locations across Indonesia.\nBoth sides will now work to launch more advanced services over the next 6 months while working out of a new service and demonstration centre launched on Wednesday.\n Telstra is expected to ramp up its Asian strategy under Mr Penn thanks to his extensive experiences in doing business throughout the continent. He led the company's international wing whilst chief financial officer under the previous CEO David Thodey.\nMr Thodey had already said he had an aspiration to get one-third of Telstra's profits and revenue to come from overseas \"by some period out to 2020 and beyond\" as local profit growth begins to dry up.\nBut while Telstra made $26.6 billion in revenue during financial year 2015, just $1.38 billion of that was made from its international operations.\nThis means Telstra is likely to make substantial investments and acquisitions throughout Asia in the coming 24 months. It has already confirmed joint venture discussions to launch a new mobile network in the Philippines with local food giant San Miguel in a move that would likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars.", "external_links": ["http://www.telkomtelstra.co.id/en/", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/telstra-in-talks-to-invest-hundreds-of-millions-in-philippines-mobile-carrier-20150828-gj9peo.html"], "published": "2015-09-18T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:20:04.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
