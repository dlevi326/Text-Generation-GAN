Edwina Pickles by David Ramli The NBN will launch services that use the Coalition's preferred fibre-to-the-node technology from September 21 with test users getting close to 100 megabits per second, according to NBN chief executive Bill Morrow.\nMr Morrow made the comments at the 2015 Astra Conference in Sydney on Wednesday afternoon during a speech to promote the internet technologies and speeds being built by NBN.\nFibre to the node is controversial because it relies on ageing copper phone line networks, which critics claim is too degraded for reliable high-speed internet services. But Mr Morrow said new upgrades would breath life into them.\nAround 38 per cent of Australian homes and businesses will get the technology when the NBN is completed in 2020.\n\"We're looking at 50Mbps for most of the premises connected to this network,\" he said. \"It has the potential to get up to 500Mbps even 1Gbps speeds on short copper distances.\n\"We will launch by the end of the month our fibre to the node services.\"\nTest customers on 100Mbps Mr Morrow said the majority of FTTN customers would be less than 400 metres away from the nodes that determine their broadband speeds. He added that test customers were currently getting around 100Mbps in downloads.\n \"If you are beyond 700 metres, you will be down to 25 Mbps,\" he said.\nHe cited Akamai research to claim that vast majority of people in countries were not using broadband connections with speeds of over 25Mbps.\n\"This cry for data, this cry for speed is not in practice what people are actually buying or using,\" he said. \"Let's be careful about using our own money to overbuild something when it is not yet needed.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:20:34.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
