While typing my post I got the idea of how can we make it better and added that to my reply. So often we complain and most of the time its justified. This time however my focus has changed., We as citizen of this country should stop complaining, dust ourselves off and pick up the tolls we needs to make things better ourselves. I say we take pride in our country and try to find innovative solutions to the every day problems we face. We can either make things better in our country and/or make money for ourselves just by being pro-active and by not being lazy. Traffic problems:- Lets approach our employers and perhaps make arrangements to work flexi hours of possible. Loadshedding:- Lets get out of the house more on weekends instead of sitting in front of the TV. :- Make more food over a fire instead of using the stove and microwave. Fuel price:- Lets do more carpooling and save on fuel costs. There are so many cars on the highway with just one driver heading in similar or the same direction. Crime:- Create neighbourhood watch patrols in your area and get to know your neighbours at the same time. We don't care for each other anymore. This will mean that the men become protectors of their \"tribe\" in the community and deter criminals. Also you can then drive out the nigerian drug lords who try to take over in this country. This will also mean you don't pay extra money to ADT and CHUBB patrolling. Unemployment:- Do the jobs you don't want to do, start at the bottom and work your way up. Washing dishes, cleaning toilets, washing cars, sell fruit and veggies or whatever it takes to make that money and make a start. Some people are too proud and won't do those jobs but would rather be unemployed and stand at a traffic light with a cardboard sign.\nMany of these are just suggestions and can be improved upon and some aren't realistic but they are ideas. Let us take our country back and be proud of who we are. Let's fight for what we have and keep it in our hands. Many people are out there giving back and solving problem and they are to be commended. There are not nearly enough people out there trying to make things better. Our government is not going to do anything and if we wait on them, we'll be waiting till the next Ice Age or till the dinosaurs roam the earth again.\nJust my two cents worth. I hope this inspires at least one person.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T22:05:14.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
