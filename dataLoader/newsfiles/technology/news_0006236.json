Indeed, the company described Jibe as “a leading provider of RCS services.” \nJibe will continue to help carriers deploy RCS to their users, but as part of Google. The two will work with the broader wireless industry (including mobile operators, device makers, and the rest of the Android ecosystem) to “create an even better messaging experience on Android.” \nHere is how Google explains why implement RCS is necessary: \nSMS carrier messaging is used by billions of people every day and enables people to reach anyone around the world, regardless of their device, carrier, app or location.
