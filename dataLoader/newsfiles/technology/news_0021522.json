The company is preparing to spin off its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd to investors and is also looking at cashing in its stake in Yahoo Japan Corp. \nMayer, 40, was pregnant when she joined Yahoo as CEO in July 2012 and gave birth to a baby boy in September that year. She worked from home after the birth and came back to the office just two weeks later. \nHer comments at the time that she did not plan to take extended maternity leave stoked a debate about whether her example would help or hurt the cause of women in the workplace. (http://reut.rs/1PI2jjh) \nSince taking the helm, Mayer has sought to boost morale at the nearly two-decade-old Internet company, eliminating bureaucracy and introducing perks such as free food. \n(Reporting by Supriya Kurane in Bengaluru; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T10:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:30:47.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
