This BPA represents both a new procurement approach from GSA, as well as a new channel to drive agile delivery throughout GSA and, eventually, the entire Federal government. As part of the emerging marketplace for agile delivery services, GSA is leading a new type of rapid procurement that focuses on a company's ability to build and deliver next generation applications using agile methods.\n\"This BPA could be a game changer for government from a cost, innovation and time to market perspective,\" said Adam Horvath, Managing Director, Public Sector. \"Acumen Solutions has been building mobile and browser-based apps using Agile for years and we have seen first-hand how this approach drives faster ROI, while also reducing risk. We're excited to join GSA and others to deliver agile Government.\"\nOn June 17, 2015, the GSA released the highly anticipated Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the Agile Delivery Services Blanket Purchase Agreement (Agile Delivery BPA). Acumen Solutions, along with almost one hundred other vendors, participated in this unique two-week procurement process, which focused on building a working adaptive/responsive prototype application to demonstrate its agile development practices, code quality, and pricing for agile labor categories. Acumen Solutions was one of 16 awardees under this BPA process, and one of only six large businesses to receive an award.\nGSAâ€™s 18F team is comprised of top-notch designers, developers, and product specialists focused on enabling agencies to rapidly deploy tools and services that are easy to operate, cost-efficient, and reusable. 18F was created in March 2014, with a mission to simplify the government's digital services and is involved in collaborative programs throughout government that promote agile methods, open source technology, and adaptive and responsive applications to better service citizens.\nAbout Acumen Solutions\nAcumen Solutions drives excellence - not only in our performance, but also in the results we deliver for our clients.
