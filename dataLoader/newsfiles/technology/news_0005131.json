This edition will include the productivity tools that help field reps organize on-site visits, document their activity and report to management - allowing them to work more efficiently and deliver greater results.   Field reps face myriad challenges today, many still working with outdated spreadsheets or even clipboards and paper, while trying to deliver top customer service in an effective way. With the mobile workforce increasingly coming from a demographic that grew up on digital, having an application that leverages technology to streamline workflow can be extremely impactful. Consumerization of standard business technologies is changing the way many organizations approach day-to-day tasks, and mobile workforces can get the most value from solutions with highly-intuitive user interfaces.  \nRepsly provides team managers with real-time visibility into the field, and streamlines organization and reporting  for field reps so they can focus on delivering strong customer service.

Specific features include: \nClient Information Management : organize client information in a personalized way with an unlimited number of customizable fields, and classify clients using tags and statuses Visit Scheduling : manage schedules and document visits, and access summary reports by client to assess visit productivity Mobile Forms : completely customize forms for collecting any kind of data about clients, including photos, signatures and structured and free-form data, and share that data with managers, clients and co-workers Photo Capture : share, tag and analyze pictures from site visits while capturing other relevant data including time, date and GPS location Reporting : generate summary reports to share data collected, and analyze how effectively time was spent \"We're excited to offer Repsly to individual reps who want to be better organized and more efficient while in the field.
