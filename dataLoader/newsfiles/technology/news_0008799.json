I own a home entertainment system and my remote control went on the blink. I have been trying to talk via the telephone tothem and the amount of e-mails I sent is incredible.I am simply trying to obtain a spare remote by purchasing it from them. Of course this went on from January, but I think that their so called agents, and they themselves cannot read and to top it all do not care a damn. I would like to ask anybody who is considering to buy any Samsung product to urgently reconsider the purchase lest you be stuck with the same problem.Service delivery from Telkom is also non-existent. Telkom in their wisdom has decided to close their office in Welkom leaving the second largest city in the Free State in the unenviable position that one has nowhere to go to resolve any problem. Their stupid 10210 number is a collossal waste of time. Of course it does not matter that Welkom has a population of about a million people.Yes, I do love my country, but when purely idiotic decisions like this is taken by Telkom, I go bananas. The reason- If i want anything from Telkom, I now have to travel about a hundred and fifty kilometres to get to Bloemfontein instead of four kilometres to the CBD in Welkom.I think that Telkom had to practise to become this ignorant, nobody can possibly be born this ignorant.
