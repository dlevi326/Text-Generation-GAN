Allowing users to capture authentic, spontaneous moments through videos and photos, Clip 2’s small size, lightweight body, sleek product design and mounting options make it the most wearable video camera. Seamlessly incorporated into everyday social occasions, Clip 2 is hands-free without distracting heavy mounts or equipment and content is easily shared and viewed through the Narrative App, Facebook, Instagram and other social sites. With video added, Clip 2 offers a first of its kind experience where friends, family and colleagues can automatically capture moments as they happen without the worry of missing a memory because a camera is not readily available. Whether it’s the surprise of seeing your baby’s first step, spending time with friends at a concert or an impromptu picnic in Paris, users can record that special instance without missing out on the experience.\n“Some of the best memories are spontaneous and Clip 2 now offers a way to effortlessly capture videos and photos as they happen. Clip 2 is your solution to take those authentic photos and video that may not have otherwise been shot, providing more funny, sentimental and unscripted memories versus those usually seen using a point-and-shoot camera,” says Martin Kallstrom, CEO of Narrative. “Compared to other small wearable cameras currently on the market, the Clip 2 is a third of the size, at a lower price point, and captures beautiful content.”\nTaking video on Clip 2 is intuitive. By default, a double-tap on the Clip 2 triggers the video camera to take a 10-second clip. To provide users with different options of how to shoot video, the Narrative app on your smartphone will act as a remote. Easily change the recording length in the app to be longer or shorter than the default, or choose to stop the recording manually by double tapping again. Alternatively, users can start and stop the video recording through the Narrative app for a more hands-on control.\nNarrative Clip 2 key features include:\nFull HD 1080p Video capability: Allows users to record video by double tapping the device or manually through the Narrative app on your smartphone\nA 86-degree lens: Captures beautiful 8 megapixel photos and improved light sensitivity for low-light settings\nWireless connectivity with WiFi and Bluetooth: For easy and instant access to photos\nGPS: Remember the places you visited with location data\nBattery: 30 hours of battery life during continuous time lapse capture gives you plenty of time between charges; multiple days of battery life in standby\nMemory: Capture two full days of photos with the built in 8GB memory\nWater-resistant and durable without a case, for everyday use in most environments\nThe Clip 2 will be available in Piano Black, Arctic White and Narrative Red with a range of accessories and retails at $199. All Clip 2 units will be shipped with the video feature enabled no matter when they were ordered. Pre-orders are open at http://getnarrative.com and shipping begins in September 2015.\nAbout Narrative\nNarrative is a Swedish company with a vision of giving everyone the ability to capture and share moments that matter.
