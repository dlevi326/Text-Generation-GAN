The securities watchdog has penalised brokerage firms for allowing unregulated margin lending to run rampant. It has also issued a spate of warnings to retail and institutional investors for illegal trading such as stock price manipulation.\nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange fell 2 per cent to 3038.14 yesterday, down 41 per cent from its peak in mid-June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:06:20.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
