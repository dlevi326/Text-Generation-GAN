This secure and free service will also let users track the progress of an emergency message from verification through delivery. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20090108/RedCrossLOGO \n\"On a consistent basis, more than 110,000 military families reach out to the American Red Cross for emergency assistance each year,\" said Koby J. Langley, senior vice president of Service to the Armed Forces, American Red Cross. That's approximately 300 military families per day. This new online tool, designed for today's military family, offers a better and more efficient way to serve our military community during their time of need.\" \nA military member or a member of their family needing to initiate an emergency message can go to redcross.org/HeroCareNetwork or call 877-272-7337. After a message is started online, a highly-trained emergency communication specialist will begin the emergency verification process required to deliver it to the military member's command. During the verification process, the requester will receive status updates. \n\"It's important to remember that people can always speak to a Red Cross worker at anytime during the process,\" said Langley. \"Regardless of how families initiate an emergency message, military members can depend on the Red Cross to relay urgent messages to service members serving anywhere in the world.\" \nFor more information regarding Red Cross Service to the Armed Forces visit redcross.org/military . \nAbout the American Red Cross: The American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides emotional support to victims of disasters; supplies about 40 percent of the nation's blood; teaches skills that save lives; provides international humanitarian aid; and supports military members and their families.
