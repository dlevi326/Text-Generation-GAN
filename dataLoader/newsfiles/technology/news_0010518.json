Source: Supplied\nMelbourne-based Readify has completed its second acquisition in 12 months with the technology services company picking up data modelling, analytics and visualisation outfit Huegin Consulting.\nIt’s a move Readify managing director Graeme Strange says is the next step in his plan to make the company a holistic innovation house.\n“We want to be the organisation that powers the next TaskRabbit or Airbnb,” Mr Strange said.\nReadify’s emphasis was on what he classified as the “holy trinity” of the digital economy: great software, beautiful design and meaningful data.\n“Software is useless unless it’s so beautiful and intuitive that people want to use it. Collecting data is pointless unless we can make sense of it and use it to change your world,” he said.\n“Technology is no longer about system administrators and business analysts, and technology companies that continue to behave like yesterday’s service providers will be gone in five years.”\nMr Strange is sanguine that thinking on the role of Australian technology companies as drivers of economic growth needs to change, and that means making some tough decisions.\n“I look at our industry and see a lot of relatively large system integrators that do a reasonable job of selling products to other organisations, and that needs to change,” he said.\nAccording to Mr Strange, technology companies have to take ownership of this transformation rather than see it as a pure transaction.\n“The conversation we need to have as an industry is what role do we play in helping a non-technology organisation to change and take advantage of technology,” Mr Strange told The Australian.\nAs an IT consultancy, Readify embodied that sentiment and Mr Strange said combining the value propositions of good software, beautiful design and meaningful data had to become the prevailing paradigm.\n“This requires a lot of intelligent people working together to solve business problems and that’s the end of the IT market that I am really excited about.”\nThe Huegin acquisition is a good example of that approach, with the company’s 15-strong team including experts in engineering, mathematics, analytics and data science.\nWhile the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Readify said it was furnished by an earlier $7 million capital raising, which also funded a partnership with brand design agency Folk late last year.\nSo far Readify’s model of helping its clients solve more complex problems and make informed business decisions is drawing praise. The company won four awards at Microsoft’s Annual Partner Awards, and took out the gong of Microsoft’s global partner of the year.\nWhile an ASX-listing might be on the cards, Mr Strange said he was in no rush: “We have some big plans over the next couple of years so getting access to the capital markets would be nice, but there are also some people who have really been supportive of the business and it would be nice to pay them back.”", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/21/1227537/595698-3001efce-6014-11e5-a6d2-70fbf074004f.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-22T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:54:33.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
