The existing supply chain management application didn’t scale well to keep up with business demands, wasn’t web or mobile-enabled and required servers and a VPN in every site. “Time was critical to this company,” said John Rhodes, CTO. “While some companies consider a complete rewrite or replacement of the existing application, the management was reluctant to spend the time and money to convert and didn’t feel that the risk was acceptable.”\nIn four months, the team of CM First developers and only 1-2 developers from the IT department had web-enabled the entire application and installed it in production. CM First’s SAP Crystal Reports integration made a critical difference in deployment. Shortly after, the quick uptake of the web version made it clear that a mobile app would be necessary.\n“With the high supply chain volumes, having the mobile option integrated made the company the right partner for customers; the company provided the exact tool needed for their supply chain management and control,” said the company’s business intelligence manager.\nLegacy applications can hold a company back from competing in the marketplace. CM First has quick and affordable solutions that can transform a business.
