Chungwa was exempted from a fine because it was the first to alert the Commission to the existence of two CRT cartels.\nHowever, the court ruled that the Commission had miscalculated the appropriate fines for Panasonic and MTPD, a joint venture between Panasonic and Toshiba, and that it had not proven that Toshiba was involved in the television CRT cartel at all.\nAccordingly, it cut the fine for Panasonic to 128.9 million euros from 157.5 million euros, for Panasonic and MTPD to 7.5 million euros from 7.9 million euros and for Panasonic, MTPD and Toshiba jointly to 82.8 million euros from 86.7 million euros.\nFor Toshiba alone it cancelled a fine of 28 million euros.
