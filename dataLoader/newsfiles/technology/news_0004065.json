Businesses in the UK spend billions every year protecting their physical properties and yet their network security often relies on outdated technology and staff who are using the same password for work as for their Facebook. Neglecting your network security is the same as leaving the front door open, you are inviting intruders. Change your passwords regularly \nThe greatest liability for a business network is the number of individuals who access it on a daily basis. Every username and password is a potential access point and any half decent hacker could exploit even basic user access to seize control. Changing passwords might seem simple but any simple action to stall intruders is surely worth the time. Don’t use the same password for everything \nPasswords requirements are getting more and more complex and so they get more and more difficult to remember. We’ve all been guilty of reusing a password because we remember by repetition. The problem is that one server won’t be as secure as another. Using the same password for work as for Gmail means an intruder only needs to find out one to get access to everything. Vary your passwords and no, this doesn’t mean just adding a 1 to the end, make them distinctive and completely different. Check your firewall doesn’t have open ports \nAn open port is a gaping hole into your network. In very rare cases certain programs or devices need an open port to operate but the majority of these are computer games and consoles. In a business there shouldn’t be any need for open ports and your IT techs can advise you on making sure this part of your network is as secure as possible. Use long passwords \nThe longer and girth-ier you can make your password the better. The minimum for most passwords is 6 or 8 characters so that’s what a hacking machine will try first. The longer you make your password the longer it will take for it to be cracked meaning the server security has longer to determine whether it’s an actual hack. Even minutes can make all the difference between satisfaction and disappointment. Recommended for You Webcast: Fishing with Spears: All About Account-Based Marketing Use passwords with special characters \nLet’s get into some numbers. A password with a minimum of 8 characters using only A-Z and including capitals has 52^8 possible combinations or just about 53.5 trillion. That sounds incredible and unbreakable but it isn’t. Computers can try thousands of possibilities every second and computers don’t need to sleep. Add a special character into your password, ‘@’ for example, and the possibilities go up to 722 trillion. Numbers don’t lie. Use strong encryption on your wireless network \nWireless networks are the technology equivalent of writing a note on a paper aeroplane and throwing it across the office. It broadcasts the data out into the world for a receiver to pick up and without encryption you’ve got to hope that no one else is out there spoofing that receiver. Don’t use your business name for your wireless network \nAdvertising works. Advertising your network doesn’t. Knowing specifically which network belongs to which organisation allows an intruder that extra edge when trying to break in. Any knowledge you can deny to an intruder is worthwhile. Never use default passwords on your devices \nThis one should be obvious but I’ll admit my home wireless still uses the same ‘out of the box’ password it came with 5 years ago. It’s even printed on a stick underneath. Network security isn’t just about hackers and viruses. An unscrupulous visitor with a laptop takes note of the password under your router then takes a seat outside. With access to your broadband he can sit there downloading all the pirated material he wants and you are liable for it. Have good quality, regularly updated antivirus \nMost people know that there aren’t really Russian brides waiting to marry UK men and the blue pills are probably sweets. Something to remember for the future, Nigeria only had a monarchy for three years in the 60’s and that was the Queen. Prince Charles is the closest thing to an actual Nigerian prince. Unfortunately someone will click on those links or open that attachment and all hell breaks loose. Free antivirus won’t be able to stop every attack so get a paid for setup and keep it updated regularly. Make regular off-site, encrypted backups \nYou have health & safety and fire extinguishers to prevent fires but you also have insurance because there’s no 100% guarantee that a fire won’t happen. Backups are your insurance for your network. If the worst happens, or if you ignore all of the tips above, then at least get your IT techs to set up secure offsite backups. It can make the difference between getting running the same day or closing your doors forever.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T23:02:07.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
