Out of the 7 contaminants investigated, diesel particulate matter is known to be the most relevant to cancer risk â€” such contaminants are released into the air primarily as a result of truck and bus operation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:54:43.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
