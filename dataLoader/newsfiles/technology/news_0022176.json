Previously it had been by invitation only.\n\"This has been very popular with our customers,\" said Peter Larsen, vice president, Amazon Devices. \"You never have to run out of your most-used items.\"\nThe Dash button is small electronic device about the size of a pack of gum. Each is labeled with the name of the product it orders.\nUsers press the button and the device sends a message to their Amazon Prime account, automatically ordering another box of whatever's almost out.\nUSA TODAY\nAmazon's Dash button--Not an April Fools' joke\nThe buttons mount using an adhesive strip on the back or a plastic clip.\nThe idea is that customers will put them up next to items they frequently run out of; in the laundry room for Tide, in the bathroom for Cottonelle toilet paper.\nWith the broader roll-out, Amazon is now charging customers $4.99 for each button — but giving a credit of $4.99 the first time the customer orders using the service.\n\"So it's effectively free,\" said Larsen.\nHe keeps a Dash button by his desk to order Gatorade to stock his office fridge, as well as one for Orbit gum \"which I was always running out of.\"\nDash buttons are now available for 29 different brands that include more than 500 products.\nThey include Ice Breakers mints, Orbit gum, Greenies Dental Chews, Hefty trash bags, Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day products, Ziploc bags, Depend underwear, Finish dish washing detergent, Digestive Advantage probiotic supplements, Dixie products and Optimum Nutrition whey protein.\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Elizabeth Weise on Twitter: @eweise.\n78 CONNECT 74 TWEET 7 LINKEDIN 11 //usat.ly/1EyS3sX TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EyS3sX&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/138b57d6ab01ef3f59f055319ceb730511fd284c/c=153-0-444-291/local/-/media/2015/03/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/635634306202073546-Screen-Shot-2015-03-31-at-5.30.08-PM.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=dash+buttons&tag=googhydr-20&index=digital-text&hvadid=81658184724&hvpos=1t1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5897723867767979827&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=c&ref=pd_sl_1vqxme96uq_b", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6dc16b5d9ef4ee68416f9afcda22d5dc7313fa5d/c=0-124-1000-876&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767878231872050-db-hefty.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767878231872050-db-hefty.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1EyS3sX", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EyS3sX&text=Amazon%20expands%20instant-order%20Dash%20button%20program&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-09-02T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:57:21.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
