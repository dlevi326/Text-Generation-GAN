There was so much work to be done. We had so many problems around the world,\" Clinton said. \"I didn't really stop and think what kind of email system will there be?\"\nBut Clinton did not apologize for her decision when asked directly, \"Are you sorry?\" Instead, she again said she wishes she had \"made a different choice\" and that she takes responsibility for the decision to use a private email account and server based at her home in suburban New York.\nShe added it was a choice that should not raise questions about her judgment.\n\"I am very confident that by the time this campaign has run its course, people will know that what I've been saying is accurate,\" Clinton said, adding: \"They may disagree, as I now disagree, with the choice that I made. But the facts that I have put forth have remained the same.\"\nClinton's interview comes as current and former aides are testifying before a congressional panel investigating the deadly 2012 Benghazi attacks, This committee has also delved into Clinton's email practices at the State Department. She is scheduled to testify publicly before the panel next month.\nClinton in August handed over to the FBI her private server, which she used to send, receive and store emails during her four years as secretary of state. Clinton has said she set up her own system instead of using a State Department account for the convenience of using a single Blackberry device.\nIn the interview, Clinton said, as she has in the past, that she \"should have had two accounts, one for personal and one for work-related.\"\nThousands of pages of her emails publicly released in recent months have shown that Clinton received messages that were later determined to contain classified information, including some that contained material regarding the production and dissemination of U.S. intelligence.\nBut Clinton reiterated in the interview that she did not \"send or receive any material marked classified. We dealt with classified material on a totally different system. I dealt with it in person.\"\n___\nFollow Ken Thomas on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kthomasdc\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kthomasdc"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:26:05.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
