Apple has not released any sales figures so far. \nAndroid and Android Wear, the operating system from Google, is expected to grab a 17.4 percent market share with 4.1 million units selling this year, according to IDC. \nSmart wristwear, including watches and bands that are capable of running third-party applications, is a key growth driver, according to IDC. \nThis includes the Apple Watch, Motorola's Moto 360, Samsung's Gear S-series, and Pebble's Time. \n\"We are at a stage now where more vendors are getting into this segment, setting the stage for more selection and ultimately more volumes,\" said IDC's Ramon Llamas.
