For example if one would consume a fried frog, another person would consider them as delusional and that they have lost their minds. All this becomes quite fascinating as to know that there are certain countries that don’t find any of these out of order. Take for instance China, they tend to have braai frogs, octopuses, slaughter dogs, the list goes on. Their society is welcoming and quite laid back about the whole idea.\nThe question is who decides what we consume, is it the producers of certain food items or do we follow norms of society. These are the questions that have no answer to. A very interesting question would be, haven’t you thought of having to consume chicken is considered absurd in other countries. Chickens could be made pets and they would become quite glorified by other societies, but then again who decides what we consume?\nOne thing we are sure about is that if you would find your neighbours slaughtering their dogs and cats, the SPCA would be the first people to be contacted with regards to that matter. Your neighbours can actually defend themselves by saying they’re\nKorean or Chinese, with all that being said you can never be against of what they consume or not consume at all. Who is this person that makes up all these ‘decisions’ for us? Who knows, what if I’d actually enjoy having a plate of just fried frogs with a bit of spiders on the sides. Food is food. Have it the way you like it.\nI ran a short survey around campus the other day, trying to find out what people think of other country’s cuisines. A number of the students said ‘some countries have rather ridiculous food’, there you have it. You decide, what’s your take?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:17:49.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
