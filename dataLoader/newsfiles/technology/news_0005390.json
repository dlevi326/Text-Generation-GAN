Board members are making two of the charging stations available for public use. \nThe stations are located in Libertyville and Waukegan. Drivers may use the stations for up to two hours at a time. \nDeputy County Administrator Amy McEwan says offering the service will cost the county less than $350 per year. \nMcEwan says the idea of the pilot program is to get a sense of how many people might use the program and how it will work. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T11:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:05:03.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
