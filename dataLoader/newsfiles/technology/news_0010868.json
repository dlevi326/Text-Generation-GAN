(AP) â€” A new iPhone for $1 a month?\nThat's what Sprint is charging for the iPhone 6s. The larger Plus version goes for $5 a month. T-Mobile, meanwhile, will charge $5 a month for the iPhone 6s and $9 for the Plus.\nThe catch: You must have last year's iPhone 6 or 6 Plus and trade that in. You lose whatever you've already paid for that device. In addition, these offers are for leases, so you have to turn the new phone in once your lease ends, or pay more to keep it.\nAt Sprint, customers who trade in an iPhone 5s can get the iPhone 6s for $10 a month, while those trading in other smartphones will pay $15 a month. Without a trade-in, T-Mobile charges $20 and Sprint $22.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
