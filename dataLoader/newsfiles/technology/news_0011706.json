Leading global supplier of additive manufacturing systems for 3D printed metals and 3D printed electronics, Optomec , will feature its hybrid manufacturing and functional electronics printing technologies at the TCT Show + Personalize this week. \nOptomec hybrid manufacturing solutions are based on its LENS technology for 3D printed metals. In a recent project with America Makes , Optomec packaged LENS technology into a modular Print Engine, which can be integrated with other metal working platforms such as CNC mills, lathes, robots, custom gantries, or table system. This approach enables customers to leverage existing machine tool assets to cost-effectively adopt metal additive manufacturing technology. \nOptomec’s other primary technology for 3D printed electronics is proven for manufacturing conformal electronic circuitry and components onto 3D structures. Aerosol Jet utilises an innovative aerodynamic focusing technique to collimate a dense mist of material-laden micro droplets into a tightly controlled beam to print features as small as 10 microns or as large as several millimetres in a single pass. A wide assortment of materials can be printed with the Aerosol Jet system, including conductive nano-particle inks, polymers and epoxies, along with dielectrics, ceramics, and bio-active materials. Aerosol Jet systems are currently in use for high volume, 24X7 production of consumer electronic devices. \nThis year’s TCT Show + Personalize will take place on September 30 – October 1 at the National Exhibition Centre (NEC) in Birmingham, UK. Optomec will be located in Stand H27 where Tom McDonald, Optomec’s Program Manager for the America Makes LENS Print Engine project, will be available in the Optomec booth to answer specific application questions.
