Meredith O'Shea Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Visas for entrepreneurs and monetary support for local university students wanting to start their own businesses are the cornerstones of Labor's innovation policies.\nUp to 2000 foreign university graduates and 2000 entrepreneurs wanting to start their own business would be able to come to Australia under the new Start-up Entrepreneurial Visas.\nTo access the visas, entrepreneurs would need to show they had access to around $200,000 of capital. The visas would be valid for up to three years, after which time recipients could apply for an extension or permanent residency if all requirements had been met.\nThe graduates would be granted a visa for one year initially and this would be able to be extended if their business idea progressed significantly.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten said Australia could be in the top 10 per cent of countries globally when it comes to start-ups, if the right policies are implemented.\n\"There's a lot more value to be created here if we're imaginative, if we're bold and if we're willing to back our best and brightest,\" he said.\n\"We will all be better off if we can win the competition with the rest of the world for the brain race.\"\nSupport for students Labor also announced on Thursday a $5.5 million policy to support Australian university students who want to start their own business by creating a HELP loan of about $10,000 to fund a start-up year for graduates who want to participate in an accelerator program.\nWell known start-up supporter and Labor MP Ed Husic said the party was willing to work with the Coalition to implement these ideas.\n\"Innovation doesn't wait for elections,\" he said.\nOther initiatives announced included an Innovation Investment Partnership to bring together venture capital, superannuation funds and start-up stakeholders and $5 million over two years to support start-ups compete for government tenders.\nBoth sides of politics have highlighted the importance of innovation and supporting new businesses in recent days, with new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull mentioning the importance of being an agile, creative nation in his speech after winning the leadership ballot last week.\nVentureCrowd chief executive Rob Nankivell said the proposed financial help for graduates was a good idea but there needed to be wider-ranging measures to boost the ecosystem.\n\"We need to see a range of support mechanisms from the government, in particular for investors of all sizes ... so the tax system can encourage participation in this section.\"\nResponding to Labor's announcement, Coalition Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Christopher Pyne, said innovation needed to be more than a \"political buzzword\".\n\"While Labor appears to have a sudden, new-found desire to promote innovation in Australia, a better start would be for them to support the China free trade agreement,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-09-24T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:17:34.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
