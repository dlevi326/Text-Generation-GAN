This S Series collection features four variations on a classic pink hue: blush , bubblegum , hot pink , and white with pink face. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150924/270579 \nThe multi-hue Pink collection is the first of three Fall releases for the S Series line. The Cool White and Heathered collections debuted at the Spring 2016 New York Fashion Week presentations of Nicholas K and Harbison respectively. \nCasio will release the Pink S-Series watches globally to retail this September, and the new collection will embrace many of the great features associated with G-SHOCK. They are all equipped with an auto LED light with afterglow, 5 daily alarms, an hourly time signal, 1/1000 second stopwatch, countdown timer, 48-city world time with 29 time zones and are shock resistant, magnetic resistant and water resistant to 200M. \nThe S Series line was designed to bring the G-SHOCK brand into the contemporary fashion space for the female consumer who loves G-SHOCK watches, but feels they may be too large for her wrist. G-SHOCK continues to offer brilliant technical innovations through S-Series but now extends itself into presenting watches as a sporty fashion accessory. \nThe S Series collections are available at Nordstroms, Macy's and select department stores, as well as G-SHOCK Soho NYC store , and online at www.gshock.com/s_series . Price point for the Pink collection is $130.00. \nAbout G-SHOCK CASIO's shock-resistant G-SHOCK watch is synonymous with toughness, born from the developer Mr. Ibe's dream of 'creating a watch that never breaks'. Over 200 handmade samples were created and tested to destruction until finally in 1983 the first, now iconic G-SHOCK hit the streets of Japan and began to establish itself as 'the toughest watch of all time'. Each watch encompasses the 7 elements; electric shock resistance, gravity resistance, low temperature resistance, vibration resistance, water resistance, shock resistance and toughness. The watch is packed with Casio innovations and technologies to prevent it from suffering direct shock; this includes internal components protected with urethane and suspended timekeeping modules inside the watch structure. Since its launch, G-SHOCK has continued to evolve, continuing to support on Mr. Ibe's mantra \"never, never give up\". \nAbout Casio America, Inc.
