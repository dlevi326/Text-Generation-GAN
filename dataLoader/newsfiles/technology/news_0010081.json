Small and micro caps have been feeling the crunch for a while, with investors clamouring to find more ‘stable’ forms of investment. However, there have been some SP success stories that are bucking the trend and luckily some of them are legitimate offerings gaining long-awaited traction. Unfortunately there are some that seem to be running the ragged edge of propriety with some less-than scrupulous promoters drawing in naïve investors looking to cash in on the 10-bagger dream.\nOne such possible scenario is Keek ( TSX: V.KEK , Forum ). This provider of social-based video clip sharing services has been on a valuation tear since August 14, 2015, climbing a good 369% from $0.26 to $1.22. The only news in recent memory is the announcement that the company had closed the first tranche of a non-brokered private placement expected to raise up to $1.15 million in gross proceeds. Tucked into this release was another announcement that the company had also entered into a technology platform license agreement with Personas.com, a company seeking to build the world’s first social commerce network.\nThe licensing agreement commits Personas to pay Keek a fee equal to 10% of its gross revenue through the use of Keek’s platform. This could be accretive to the company’s bottom line, but Personas’ business plan has yet to prove out, so any speculation as to what kind of cash flow this deal is going to create is purely academic. Now, Keek has also put itself out there by creating a Keek app for Facebook’s Messenger. The company’s SP took a definitive jump on the announcement as the move would help Keek expand its market reach significantly, that is if Messenger users decided to put their app into use. Keep in mind as well that Keek wasn’t necessarily part of a 'select few' developing Messenger-specific apps, in fact they currently sit in a group of 46 developers who have made apps to fit into Zuckerburg’s bid for world domination.\nOkay, market reach has been increased but Keek, within its own space, remains a relatively unknown player. I think the company is on the right track by licensing out its platform and who knows, if Personas hits pay dirt with its ‘vision’, Keek will be set up with some much-needed revenue, but as of February of this year, the company was operating $20.0 million in the red.\nIn the end, Keek failed to monetize on its original plan and as such has failed to perform as expected. It is in the midst of re-inventing itself with the appointment of an interim CEO, current CTO Dimi Paun, replacing Alexandra Cameron, the resignation of CMO, Lin Dai, and the addition of William Lavin, President of Terrific Corporation, Vincent C. McLeod, a founder of Navaho Networks, and Ahmed Khan, President and CEO of Fairview Capital, to the company’s Board. Investors are feeling positive and speculating that Khan will help bring in the money to get Keek back into the swing of things, but at this point, Keek, is anything but long term. Keek is a day-trader playground right now; it may very well level out to a lucrative long prospect, but unless you’re willing to trade on the hour, I would wait for some solid news before handing my hard-earned money to some disingenuous promoter. This is of course my opinion. As always, please do your own due diligence.\nTags: TECHNOLOGY INTERNET CONTENT &AMP; INFORMATION", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T23:50:03.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
