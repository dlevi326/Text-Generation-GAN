This unique collaboration among Aetna, HHC and VCA will help make health care more affordable and enhance access to safe, quality care. \nThe plans will be marketed under the name Aetna Whole Health - Hartford HealthCare & Value Care Alliance. \nConnecticut residents who choose the plans will pay lower out-of-pocket costs for receiving care from within these two health care organizations. They also will benefit from the improved flow of information between HHC and VCA hospitals and physicians. Patients with chronic or complex conditions requiring closer care coordination will receive particular attention. \nThe new ACO network will feature more than 3,500 physicians; 39 urgent care and emergency room locations; and 13 hospitals, providing access throughout Connecticut. \n\"This is great news for Aetna's present and future members in Connecticut,\" said Mark Santos, president of Aetna's New England operations. \"We built this product to be a highly competitive solution for businesses and for individuals looking for quality coverage, affordable rates and strong value for their health care dollar. It emphasizes featured care providers from two top systems. They will work with us to deliver high-quality care at a competitive price.\" \nThe product announcement follows ACO network contracts signed by Aetna in recent months with each of the two health care organizations. \n\"We have been working over the past two years to improve patient outcomes through more effective care coordination and management, which ultimately reduces health care costs,\" said Dr. James Cardon, CEO of Integrated Care Partners and chief clinical integration officer for HHC. \"This agreement is one more advance in our shift from fee-for-service care, where physicians are paid for the number of things they do, to value-based care, where physicians and other providers are paid for the quality of care they deliver. This can only benefit the patients we serve.\" \nIntegrated Care Partners (ICP), a physician-led clinical integration organization of HHC-affiliated physicians, will play a key role in improving how patient care is delivered. The arrangement will involve HHC's 2,000 ICP providers, who will work closely with Aetna to coordinate health care services and demonstrate high-quality medical care. \n\"The VCA's collaboration with Aetna and Hartford HealthCare to create innovative, high-value health plan offerings is a logical extension of our members' efforts to increase both the quality and efficiency of care provided,\" said Patrick Charmel, chairman of the VCA and president and CEO of Griffin Hospital. \"VCA hospitals share a commitment to inform and engage consumers - those who receive and pay for care - while providing a better patient experience at lower cost. We are plesed to join Aetna and HHC as we collectively lead the transformation of Connecticut's health care delivery system to a more consumer-focused and value-based model.\" \nThe VCA comprises seven member hospitals and nearly 1,800 affiliated physicians in Fairfield, Litchfield, Middlesex, New Haven and New London counties. Six of the hospitals will be participating in the new product agreement. \nThey are: St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport; and The Western Connecticut Health Network (Danbury Hospital, New Milford Hospital and Norwalk Hospital). \nThe VCA network covers a broad geography across the state, offering access through its hospital members and their affiliated physician offices and urgent care centers. Additionally, the VCA offers multiple options for patients seeking behavioral health care, outpatient diagnostic, outpatient radiology/mammography, wound care, ambulatory surgery and occupational medicine services. \nHartford HealthCare includes: Hartford Hospital in Hartford, The Hospital of Central Connecticut, with campuses at Bradley Memorial in Southington and New Britain General in New Britain, MidState Medical Center in Meriden, The William H.
