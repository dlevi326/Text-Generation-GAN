That says it all about this high-style, high-tech, highly personal device,'' he said. \nSony's PlayStation 4 was named Gaming Product of the Year. \nThe PS4 beat console rival the Xbox One, as well as virtual reality headsets Oculus Rift Crescent Bay and Samsung Gear VR. \nGames reviewer Gav Murphy, who reviews his pick of some of the best PS4 games on this week's Swipe, says the console deserves the award over its main rival. \n''If you look at the Xbox One, I don't really know what that's trying to be as a piece of tech,'' he said.

I think that’s why people are going to PS4,'' he explained. \nAugmented and virtual reality are two of this year's hot topics in tech, and two awards reflected the subjects' dominance. \nMicrosoft's holographic headset Hololens won Design Innovation and the Outstanding Achievement prize went to Palmer Luckey, the inventor of Oculus Rift. \nThe 22-year-old built the first Oculus prototype when he was just 16. \nThe company was acquired by Facebook for $2bn (£1.3bn) in March 2014 , but Palmer remains involved in the headset's development.

You can see what happened when we tried some of them out in this weekend's episode of Swipe. \n:: You can watch Swipe's T3 Awards special on Sky News Online, mobile and iPad apps, Apple TV, our YouTube Channel and our Catch Up service from Friday afternoon.
