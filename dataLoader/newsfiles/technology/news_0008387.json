The pad is currently idle after its last space mission in 2005, but was previously the launching point for the Mariner missions, Pioneer 10, Surveyor 1, and numerous other civilian and military missions. \nIn addition, Blue Origin will move into facilities at Exploration Park at the Kennedy Space Center, where the company's BE-4 engine will undergo acceptance testing before being installed in the first United Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket. The facility will also be used for manufacturing the reusable Blue Origin boosters as a way of simplifying the logistics for the Kent, Washington-based company. \nBlue Origin carried out its first rocket launch earlier this year outside Van Horn, West Texas. The company aims to eventually fly rockets capable of carrying a manned capsule into space before returning to Earth for a booster landing and refurbishment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T03:13:21.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
