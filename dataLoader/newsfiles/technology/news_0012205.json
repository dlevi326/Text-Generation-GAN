Credit: Robert Boston \nThree antibiotics that, individually, are not effective against a drug-resistant staph infection can kill the deadly pathogen when combined as a trio, according to new research. \nThe researchers, at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, have killed the bug—methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)—in test tubes and laboratory mice, and believe the same three-drug strategy may work in people. \n\"MRSA infections kill 11,000 people each year in the United States, and the pathogen is considered one of the world's worst drug-resistant microbes,\" said principal investigator Gautam Dantas, PhD, an associate professor of pathology and immunology. \"Using the drug combination to treat people has the potential to begin quickly because all three antibiotics are approved by the FDA.\" \nThe study is published online Sept. 14 in the journal Nature Chemical Biology . \nThe three drugs—meropenem, piperacillin and tazobactam—are from a class of antibiotics called beta-lactams that has not been effective against MRSA for decades. \nWorking with collaborators in the microbiology laboratory at Barnes-Jewish Hospital? in St. Louis, Dantas' team tested and genetically analyzed 73 different variants of the MRSA microbe to represent a range of hospital-acquired and community-acquired forms of the pathogen. The researchers treated the various MRSA bugs with the three-drug combination and found that the treatments worked in every case. \nThen, in experiments conducted by collaborators at the University of Notre Dame, the team found that the drug combination cured MRSA-infected mice and was as effective against the pathogen as one of the strongest antibiotics on the market. Clumps of MRSA bacteria magnified more than 2,300 times by an electron microscope.
