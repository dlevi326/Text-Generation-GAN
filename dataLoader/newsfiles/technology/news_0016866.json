The United States on Tuesday urged China to release a dozen human rights activists and religious figures who it said were detained before a planned meeting with a visiting US diplomat.\nInternational religious freedom envoy David Saperstein said the activists -- including respected human rights lawyer Zhang Kai, pastors and other Christian figures -- were held during his August 20-28 trip to China. \n\"These detentions fit into the disturbing pattern of state intimidation of public interest lawyers, Internet activists, journalists, religious leaders,\" Saperstein told reporters. \n\"They clearly underscore the precariousness of religious life in China.\" \nThe United States has escalated warnings to China on the thorny issue of human rights and religious freedom that could overshadow talks between President Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama during the Chinese leader's state visit later this month. \nSaperstein said that Zhang, who he described as a defender of religious rights, had gathered together the group for a meeting with the envoy but that they were all detained the night before it was due to happen. \nOther people who he did manage to see were later detained too, he added. \n\"It is a source of great concern to us and we are calling on the government to immediately release all these human rights activists and religious leaders.\" \nThe Communist Party keeps tight control over religion for fear it could challenge its grip on power, requiring believers to worship in places approved by the state and under government supervision. \nAnd since Xi came to power in 2013, the government has taken a harder line towards civil and religious society. \nMore than 200 lawyers and activists, including Zhang, were questioned or detained in July as part of a sweeping nationwide crackdown, according to rights groups. \nIn the eastern province of Zhejiang, authorities have stepped up a long-running campaign to remove church crosses, and several Catholic and Protestant churches have been destroyed. \nThe American Catholics who will meet Pope Francis on his US visit later this month are widely accepting of non-traditional families, according to a Pew survey out Wednesday. \nWhile 90 percent of US Catholics said that a household headed by a married mother and father -- traditionally supported by the Catholic Church -- is ideal for raising children, large majorities see single, unmarried and divorced parents as acceptable. \nSixty-six percent said that gay parents can do an acceptable job of raising children, including forty-three percent who considered the arrangement as good as any other. \nA large majority -- 83 percent -- saw as acceptable for children to be raised by parents who are living together but not married, including 48 percent who considered it just as good as any other arrangement. \nRoughly four in 10 US Catholics (38 percent) said it is acceptable or just as good as any other arrangement for single parents to raise children, with 31 percent saying the same about divorced parents. \nThe results, found in a Pew survey of 5,122 adults conducted May 5-June 7, also found that 86 percent saw it as acceptable for a man and a woman to live together as a couple outside of marriage. \nAmong those, 55 percent considered that lifestyle as good as any other. \nAbout 70 percent said that a married husband and wife who choose not to have children have a lifestyle that is as good as any other. \nLess than half of US Catholics saw homosexuality, cohabitation with a romantic partner outside marriage and contraception as sins -- 44 percent, 33 percent and 17 percent respectively. \nAnd 76 percent said that the Catholic Church should allow the use of contraceptives, and 46 percent supported the Church changing its views to recognize gay marriages. \nThe Church has traditionally frowned upon any family arrangement outside of a male-female marriage with children. \nPositions however harden among the roughly 40 percent of US Catholics who say they attend Mass weekly. \nAmong this group, only 34 percent say it is as acceptable and as good as other options for a gay couple to raise children. That compares to 49 percent of Catholics who attend Mass less than once a week. \n- Soft on climate change - \nFrancis will have a hard time convincing his US flock about the need to fight against climate change. \nLess than a third -- 29 percent -- say that working to counter climate change is essential to their Catholic identity, while 62 percent see helping the poor as key. \nForty-one percent say that spending money on luxuries without helping out the poor is sinful, but only 23 percent say it is sinful to use energy with no concern for its impact on the environment. \nThe survey, which included 1,016 self-identified Catholics, has a 3.5 percent margin of error for Catholics, and a 1.6 percent margin of error for the full sample. \nFrancis has a tight schedule during his September 22-28 US visit, which features stops in New York, Washington and Philadelphia. \nBefore flying back to Rome, Francis will visit the Vatican-sponsored World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:15:03.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
