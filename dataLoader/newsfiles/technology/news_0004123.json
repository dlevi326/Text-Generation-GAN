Instead of playing a crucial role as the vanguard party, the SACP has been nothing but a hub for factional politicking.\nIts independence needs to be questioned. Chris Hani once cautioned the communists when he said: “The party in this country can only be strong if it spends time on building and consolidating itself as an independent entity”\nBut it is obsessed with the internal petty politics of the African National Congress (ANC) rather than shaping its policies and ideologies.\nThe party has not taken a strong stance on the neo-liberal plan implemented by President Jacob Zuma’s administration, the National Development Plan.\nWhen Thabo Mbeki was president, the party critiques the implementation of Gear and labeled its proponents the ‘1996 Class Project”\nSo what is going on within the SACP? Has it lost its backbone or what is the problem to have this laissez faire attitude being blasé and in the process losing its identity.\nA vacuum has resulted, and the fact that the SACP has lost its moral compass it would be safe to say that the only serious and best alternative to all those that so diligently believed in them would be the Bolsheviks Party of South Africa, that has a moral compass, direction, leadership and all the necessary experience to lead the people of this country to a better life for all.\nSo this is an open invitation to all those disillusioned SACP members to now put shoulder to the wheel, your voice and the power of your vote behind the only real tangible alternative that can take your quest into the future the BPSA!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T20:06:26.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
