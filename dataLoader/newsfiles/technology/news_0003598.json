Cargo security at ports is essential for ensuring that containers are not damaged or stolen.\nBelow is a list of the top six risks associated with cargo containers.\n \n \nUnreliable Carriers \nOn the one hand, unreliable carriers can be a risk to the safe transportation of containers. However, carrier reliability has improved in recent months, with Maersk Line topping the list for the most reliable shipping line. \nPoorly designed packaging \nTheft \nWithout the correct security precautions, ports can be liable to unauthorised access and therefore the theft of cargo containers. According to Jean-Philippe Deby, Business Development Director at Genetec, ports must consider using perimeter detection with video surveillance and access control to avoid such risks. \nTo read a Technical Paper on the importance of video surveillance at ports, click here \nWarehousing \nHandling \nCargo can be at risk if operators of a particular piece of equipment are not trained correctly, as was the case in late 2014, when a forklift toppled over after making a risky container lift.\nTo read a Technical Paper on the second part on how to effectively handle containers from megaships, click here \nShipping Lane Disruptions \nDisruptions can occur in a variety of ways. The most common, it seems, is through collisions, as was the case along the Suez Canal, where two container ships collided while making their regular calls.\nTo read a Technical Paper on navigation simulation for megaship handling, click here \nTo read Risk and Insurance's original article on cargo risks, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T19:03:38.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
