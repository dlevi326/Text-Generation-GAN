When did “thirsty” become such a good burn? Why are we so weird about work, and about wanting, and about working hard to get the things we want?\nYou could say a lot about Mindy Kaling’s new memoir Why Not Me?— that it is, like its predecessor , extremely charming; that it offers a collegial mix of sincerity and sarcasm and self-deprecation and self-affirmation; that there’s a good chance it will make you love Kaling or at least want to chat with her over cocktails with “fizz” in their names—but maybe the main thing to say is this: The book is, at its core, a defense of work . It is a defense of striving, and wanting, and thirsting. It takes all the glib protestations of Hollywood doublespeak (“I woke up like this,” “omg I basically only eat fried chicken,” “they’re real,” etc.), and says to them: No. You are lying. You worked for what you got. You struggled, somehow, for it. Just own that.", "external_links": ["http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780307886279"], "published": "2015-09-16T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:25:06.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
