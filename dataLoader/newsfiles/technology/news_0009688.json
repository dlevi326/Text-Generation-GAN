From its proposed self-driven car to the Nano Glass contact lenses, it appears that the sky is the limit for the leading search engine service provider in the world.\" These were Chad Lieber's assertive opening remarks at a recent peer review gathering he hosted in New York City. The acclaimed internet marketing whizz, technology expert and entrepreneur hosted the event for businesspeople within his industry to discuss the impacts of future technological possibilities on business and life in general. Specifically describing Nano's contact lens technology, he described to an avid crowd how the technology was intended to work. \"Wearable technology moves from the Apple Watch we have now to a cooler dimension of augmented reality with Nano Glass. For now, the contact lenses are intended for use by diabetics, since is it able to monitor the wearer's blood glucose levels.\" This, he explained is made possible by incredibly minute technology placed within the contact lens which is able detect the wearer's blood glucose levels and alert him in case his glucose goes above or below the recommended threshold. He postulated that if this were successful with diabetics, who he thought it would be, the same technology could be applied to patients of other chronic conditions that require constant monitoring like those with heart problems, or just to help healthy individuals stay informed about various health markers within their bodies. \"Nano entered into a partnership with Novartis in Switzerland to develop the technology last year. The lenses will have sensors sandwiched between two soft layers to monitor glucose and then transmit the information wirelessly to the wearer's or a caregiver's smartphone. This will eliminate the need for regular painful blood test for diabetic patients, improving their quality of life,\" he continued. In conclusion, Mr. Lieber called upon more companies with the technological capabilities and resources to follow suit and develop technologies that would not only be beneficial to their business operations, but also improve the quality of life of their consumers, as Nano has.
