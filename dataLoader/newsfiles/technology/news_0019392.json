The Bastian Solutions conveyor configurator is a great tool which can help utilize high level estimations based on historical prorated pricing. Bastian Solutions encourages clients (that are not ready to engage their team directly) to utilize the conveyor configurator. This tool allows customers to design and price systems. As the project gains steam, the Bastian Solutions team is ready to jump in and help.\n“As e-commerce sales continue to rise, more and more of the growth is coming from industrial products and business services,” explained Greg Conner, Regional Director at Bastian Solutions. “In response, we wanted to re-design and improve our online equipment store so it was more than just a place to buy.”\nThe goal of Bastian Solutions’ redesign was simple – to create a platform that allows end users the ability to move beyond the conventional, and often times very slow, sales process. Users can expect faster, easier procurement of conveyor 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nTo learn more, go to: http://ow.ly/Qt7LI\nAbout Bastian Solutions\nBastian Solutions (http://ow.ly/LaOTe), a global material handling systems integrator and expert in e-commerce fulfillment automation is an innovator in the fields of material handling automation, goods-to-person systems, wearable AR technology, supply chain software, and robotics.
