Website users can now interact with the Bravissimo customer service team using live video, where the customer can see the consultant on the screen, ask questions and see the product range close up. Early results have shown that video assisted support is converting 3 times more sales than unassisted browsing. \nBravissimo puts its customers at the heart of the business and decided that its customers needed to feel the same way about their online experience as they would feel about the service and experience they receive in store. A service-driven project to evaluate text-based web chat services soon developed into a project to offer video chat. \n“When we saw the video chat solution from Vee24, we realised that this could be so much more than a standard web chat service. Web chat is great, but it’s a bit like real-time email and doesn’t really get across the personality of the Bravissimo brand. Video chat enables us to engage with customers in a very personal and direct way – very much like the way we’d interact with customers in store,” comments Lisa Gardner Customer Service & Fulfilment Centre Operations Manager, Bravissimo. \nBravissimo is using the Vee24 solution in its contact centre, where employees are trained to interact with customers via live video. Customers can either select the Live Chat option from the website, or can respond to a ‘nudge’ from the Bravissimo team that encourages customers who may need help to connect. \nCustomers are in complete control of the interaction and can choose to interact in a number of ways – from standard text chat using a keyboard, through to one way video, where only the consultant can be seen, to two-way video where both parties can see each other. Consultants can help with product queries, co-browse the website and find products for the customer, help with the checkout process and hold products to the camera so that customers can see the fabric and the fastenings. \nEarly results have been excellent: Assisted conversions (12.9 percent) are 3 times higher than non-assisted conversions (4.1 percent) Net promoter scores, based on a post-call survey, are extremely high at 90+ Acceptance of ‘nudges’ is twice as high as average acceptance rates across the Vee24 customer base. Customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive \nBra-fitting service via live video \nOne example of video assistance in practice is in the bra-fitting service offered by Bravissimo. Customers can seek advice via web chat, or can choose a voice to voice engagement so the consultant can talk them through how to ensure the right fit. Many customers also take the option to turn on their own webcam and allow the consultant to check their fitting via video link. \nThe bra fitting service ensures that the customer receives a fitting service very much like the one they would receive in store, but from the comfort of their own home. \n“We knew immediately that we could build a great relationship with the team at Vee24 and have felt extremely well supported through the early weeks of being live. Nothing’s too much trouble and tweaks to the system are handled quickly and often completed in minutes rather than days,” says Lisa Gardner. \n“We’re delighted to be working with Bravissimo, and have been as thrilled as they are to see such great results after only a few weeks live. Purchasing lingerie and swimwear is a personal shopping experience and it’s great to see that live video assistance is enabling Bravissimo to offer a very similar, personal experience to the one they offer so successfully in store,” comments Phil Adams, Client Success Director, Vee 24. \nEditors Notes \nA selection of comments from Bravissimo customers using video assistance. \n“Love this service. Great for those of us who cannot get to your shops easily. Thank you.” \n“Excellent, really helped with the sale, would definitely recommend it to others. Thanks” \n“This was by far the best experience I ever had on a chat.... Perfect!!!!” \n“This online assistance is absolutely brilliant.” \n“What a great service. Feel like I just visited the future!” \n“Excellent service!!! Particularly like how the operator can show me the various bras on my screen - will definitely use this again” \nAbout Vee24 \nVee24 is the live video assistance solution trusted by the world’s leading consumer-facing brands.
