Great Portland Estates announced it had pre-let all of the office space in its development at Rathbone Square to the social media giant.\nRobert Cookson, Facebook's real estate boss, said “The move to our new offices at One Rathbone Square highlights our commitment to invest and grow our talented teams of people based in London.\n\"This is a fantastic opportunity to occupy a high quality new development in the heart of the West End. The location has excellent amenities and connectivity, with the very best the city has to offer right on the doorstep including Crossrail once it is established.”\nFacebook will pay nearly £17m a year in rent to occupy the more than 227,000 sq. ft of office space - but as part of the deal will pay no rent for the first 30 months of the tenancy. \nThe length of the tenancy is set at 15 years, and will commence once the site is completed, which is scheduled for February 2017.\nAccording to industry averages, an office of this size has the potential to house around 2,000 staff, depending on worker density.\nFacebook housed just over 200 employees at its Brock Street offices last year.\nGreat Portland Estates acquired the Rathbone Square site from Royal Mail Group in September 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T13:34:35.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
