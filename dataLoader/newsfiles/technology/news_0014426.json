To innovate is to make changes in something established, especially by introducing new methods, ideas, or products. To any merchant, innovation can be as simple as introducing a hotly anticipated product line. To the pure-play e-commerce retailer, innovation can mean opening a physical store. To the mega national omni-channel retailer, innovation can mean extending order management and CRM applications to store associate’s mobile devices to mirror the customer’s rich online experience. \nInnovation is in the eye of the beholder, accessible by all, and its continuum is infinite. \nWhen we distill our early 2016 tech spending survey results down to mid-market and larger multichannel merchants, we see a very clear story unfolding. The story’s protagonist is omni-channel. Its antagonists are legacy systems. Its heroes are inventory visibility, order management, cloud, and store-level digital transformation. The plot to this choose-your-own adventure novel is quickly building. \nPlease log in or register below to read the full article. Like what you are reading?
