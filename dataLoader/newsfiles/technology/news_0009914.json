We can think about two years,\" she said. \n\"If you go there now, you will already see important change. If you go there in another two years and it (the recovery) continues at the same pace as of now, it will be very visibly a new place,\" Wahlstrom said. \nShe credited local towns for diversifying their economies and for efforts to rebuild their infrastructure. \nWhole towns were destroyed by Haiyan with the government forced to provide survivors with temporary shelters which were criticised for being unsafe and poorly built. \nBut Wahlstrom said she had seen a lot of permanent housing being constructed with many people ready to move in. \nThe Philippines is one of the world's most disaster-prone countries, at risk from earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and an average 20 typhoons yearly. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:25:04.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
