But how many lives, realistically, will be saved?\nBy the end of this century, there’s good reason to believe that tens of millions of traffic fatalities will be prevented around the world.\nThis is not merely theoretical. There’s already some precedent for change of this magnitude in the realms of car culture and automotive safety. In 1970, about 60,000 people died in traffic accidents in the United States. A dramatic shift toward safety —including required seat belts and ubiquitous airbags—helped vastly improve a person’s chance of surviving the American roadways in the decades that followed. By 2013, 32,719 people died in traffic crashes, a historic low.\nResearchers estimate that driverless cars could, by midcentury, reduce traffic fatalities by up to 90 percent. Which means that, using the number of fatalities in 2013 as a baseline, self-driving cars could save 29,447 lives a year. In the United States alone, that's nearly 300,000 fatalities prevented over the course of a decade, and 1.5 million lives saved in a half-century. For context: Anti-smoking efforts saved 8 million lives in the United States over a 50-year period.", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/07/anti-smoking-efforts-saved-lives/4355227/"], "published": "2015-09-29T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T19:46:02.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
