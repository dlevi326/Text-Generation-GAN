The project that ECS built on Inductive Automation’s Ignition software helped a customer manage materials used as ingredients in a complex batch manufacturing process. \nThe other 2015 Discover Gallery Finalists demonstrate the competency and creativity of the Ignition community. “ECS is very proud and humbled to have been selected for this award. I am personally proud to be associated with all of the creative technical folks who work with me at ECS, including Erik Gross, our technical lead on this project,” said Timothy S. Matheny, P.E., ECS Solutions’ President \n“Your project was an exceptional and innovative use of the Ignition software. It’s always a thrill to see how our customers are using our software and we were amazed at the quality of your work,” said Steven Galea, Inductive Automation \nECS’ application helps its customer receive pallet quantities of product minor ingredients into one of two kit building areas. The vendor packages are broken down and measured into the required batch recipe quantities and individually bar coded. Whole and measured packages of multiple ingredients are packed into a kit which is then labeled for inventory and later addition to a wet batch. Raw ingredient remainders can be labeled and returned to the warehouse via the warehouse management system. ECS’ application works with the customer Enterprise Resource Planning system for real time tracking of all vendor lot codes into the end product lots. The solution manages approximately 250 ingredients including nine classes of allergens. \nECS Solutions, Inc. is a control system integrator providing quality Total Process Automation solutions to process manufacturers. ECS’ S88 Builder solution sets the standard for batch process control with its agility, flexibility and ergonomic, process-focused, operator interface. \nIgnition by Inductive Automation is a software platform with a variety of HMI / SCADA and manufacturing execution systems (MES) modules that can be mixed and matched to meet the needs of industrial organizations. Ignition is used to create custom HMI, SCADA, and MES applications in industries such as food, beverage, oil, gas, packaging, pharmaceutical, and water/waste water", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T01:35:16.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
