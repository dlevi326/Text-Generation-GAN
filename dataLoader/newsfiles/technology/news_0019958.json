The co-designed platform will leverage GLOBALFOUNDRIES’ production-proven expertise in advanced silicon RF technologies and QEOS’ next-generation design environment and IP to expand the mmWave wireless technology offerings to enable gigabit interactivity everywhere—from centimeters to hundreds of meters—at a cost of less than $500 per link.\nDemonstrations of a 77GHz CMOS Design Library and an adaptive 60GHz CMOS link for gigabit wireless outdoor connectivity can be seen during European Microwave Week, to be held September 6 – 11, 2015 in Paris, France.\nThe available mmW IP includes:\n Low-power Bits In/Out architecture BIST/BIOS for digital die sort Beam Steering Integrated Transceiver Frequency Synthesizer Co-designed System in Package with Antenna\n“MmW technology is a key pillar for next-generation wireless markets including IoT, 5G and automotive,” said Ted Letavic, department leader of strategic applications and product segments at GLOBALFOUNDRIES. “Our expanded partnership with QEOS enables our customers to address the challenging requirements for adaptive next-generation gigabit wireless sensing and connectivity, and lays the foundation for accelerating market adoption of mmW products and solutions in high-growth markets.”\n“We are honored to partner with one of the world’s leading advanced silicon manufacturers to create the industry’s first mmW CMOS platform. We look forward to supporting our customers in the rapidly growing mmWave markets,” said Ara Chakrabarti, Chief Operating Officer of QEOS, Inc.\n\"GLOBALFOUNDRIES’ and QEOS' partnership is a key milestone for enabling the next generation of low-power mmWave CMOS,” said Rob Shaddock, Chief Technology Officer of TE Connectivity. “TE Connectivity has been watching the developments in this field closely, and we believe that this is going to have a major impact across the connectivity and sensing markets.”\nAs part of the GLOBALSOLUTIONS partnership, QEOS 45/40nm based mmWave CMOS IP will be available in two forms. Basic block level IP will be available from GLOBALFOUNDRIES, while more complex subsystem IP will be licensable directly from QEOS. QEOS will provide support and design services for all IP.\nAbout GLOBALFOUNDRIES\nGLOBALFOUNDRIES is the world’s first full-service semiconductor foundry with a truly global footprint. Launched in March 2009, the company has quickly achieved scale as one of the largest foundries in the world, providing a unique combination of advanced technology and manufacturing to more than 250 customers. With operations in Singapore, Germany and the United States, GLOBALFOUNDRIES is the only foundry that offers the flexibility and security of manufacturing centers spanning three continents. The company’s 300mm fabs and 200mm fabs provide the full range of process technologies from mainstream to the leading edge. This global manufacturing footprint is supported by major facilities for research, development and design enablement located near hubs of semiconductor activity in the United States, Europe and Asia. GLOBALFOUNDRIES is owned by the Mubadala Development Company.
