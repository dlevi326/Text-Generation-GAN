That’s why Android Wear offers countless design choices, so you can find the watch that fits your style. Want a round watch with a more classic look? Feel like a new watch band? How about changing things up every day with watch faces from artists and designers? With Android Wear you can do all of that. And now, Android Wear watches work with iPhones.” \nFor now, Android Wear for iOS just works with the LG Watch Urbane, but all future Android Wear watches, including models from Huawei, Asus, and Motorola, will support iOS. \nImages via Google", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T06:55:03.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
