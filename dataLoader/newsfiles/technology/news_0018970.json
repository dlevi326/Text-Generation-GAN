Humans can’t drive as efficiently as computers.\nThat would be appear to be the explanation for yet another rear-end collision suffered by a Google autonomous car last month, as reported by the company this week in its ongoing monthly updates on its six-year-old program.\nOther news in the blog post included the announcement that a few of Google’s pod-like prototypes will soon be joining the company’s gizmo-strapped Lexus SUVs for extensive testing on the on the streets of Austin, Texas. The bulk of Google’s testing has been on going near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.\nAmong the challenges facing Google’s new Texas-based fleet are dealing with an abundance of deer and processing information from horizontal road signs. So far, Google has tested its autonomous cars for more than a million miles, in an effort to pack its database with as many real-world driving situations as possible.\nUSA TODAY\nGoogle self-driving car hit hard in yet another rear-end crash\nHitting the streets has meant getting hit. Google’s self-driving cars have been in 16 accidents to date, 12 of them rear-end collisions and all them the fault of human motorists, according to data the company provided to the California Department of Motor Vehicles.\nThe latest took place on Aug. 20. A self-driving Lexus was approaching a Mountain View crosswalk without a stoplight when it detected a pedestrian stepping into the road. The autonomous vehicle immediately began braking, but the onboard safety driver decided to intervene and brake more firmly.\nIn Austin, Google's Lexus self-driving SUVs will have to be on high alert for deer. (Photo: Google)\nAs the car stopped, it was hit from behind by a motorist who was busy changing lanes at the same time. Typically, such accidents are deemed the fault of the person doing the colliding, as he or she should have allowed for more of a gap between the vehicles.\nWhat's interesting is that in the report, program lead Chris Urmson notes that after analyzing the accident data afterward engineers determined that while Google’s human driver followed protocol by taking control in an emergency situation, had the car been left to brake on its own it would have done so less violently and edged up closer to the sidewalk.\nUSA TODAY\nExclusive: Inside Google's new self-driving car\n“In other words, our software might have created some extra margin in a situation where fractions of inches and seconds mattered,” Urmson writes. “(Software) could do the math on many complicated factors all at once … and make an extremely nuanced braking calculation. … We’re putting this down as an officially interesting moment in self-driving car history.”\nThe August report also mentions that Google engineers are still working on how to tell self-driving cars where to go once a passenger is seated inside the two-person prototype. “People are already carrying their phones, so it would make sense to take advantage of that,” writes Urmson.\nAs for when Google’s fleet might hit the roads for real, the post reiterates (nervous Dad) Urmson’s determination to make sure his 11-year-old son doesn’t need to get a driver’s license. He’s 11 now – so in about four years, prepare for the pod invasion.\n8 CONNECT 36 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1Ez8425 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/79eec98484817fa9b827d581f082b279c1577f92/c=70-0-1171-828&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767925120624617-pod.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b9f9c7167e81d486c554b705ba31a65a1b1ba45/c=84-0-3985-2933&r=x383&c=540x380/local/-/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767925177096979-lexus-aust.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a040fb53a72bceab9dc8bdbc00446d50dd55f0d/r=300/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/03/29906170001_4114910753001_video-still-for-video-4114784739001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767925120624617-pod.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Ez8425&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1Ez8425", "http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//selfdrivingcar/files/reports/report-0815.pdf", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Ez8425&text=Google%20self-driving%20car%20hit%20again%2C%20so%20heads%20up%20Austin%20drivers&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767925177096979-lexus-aust.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f57ff21b10ea5b3a0838ca28dce08acf8cc54813/c=0-28-1024-607&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/07/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635726614829827229-googx.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-02T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:47:27.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
