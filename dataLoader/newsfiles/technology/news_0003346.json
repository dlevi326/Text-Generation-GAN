I am not going to have a breakdown over material things, but I am sick inside over my little kitties.\" \nShe fed her cats on the porch of her home before leaving. Facebook posts by workers who stayed behind at a local water company to fill tanks needed to supply fire hydrants showed that Noble's street was a total loss. \nMany worried about their homes turned to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for pictures, video and information. \n\"I am in shock; I can't believe we have to start over,\" said Noble, who has two young sons. \n\"We didn't have much, and we are starting back with nothing.\" \nThe things she will miss most were those holding irreplacable memories, like a Teddy bear from her father's boyhood, and family photos. \n\"Every photo I ever had of my children is gone,\" Noble said. \"I am going to be asking friends and family to send me any pictures they have to re-create our life.\" \n- Looting fear - \nLocal officials on Monday told evacuees at that it was likely to be a while before they could get back into the burn zones to check on their homes, or what is left of them. \n\"Our fear now is looting,\" Gomes said as she looked out across a tent village set up on the fairgrounds. \n\"My house is standing, but who is breaking into my home and taking everything I have?\" \nLake County Sheriff Brian Martin said some people had been caught stealing property from evacuated homes and deputies are patrolling for looters. \nGomes felt fortunate that her home was spared. And owners of Hall winery in St. Helena, where she works, offered to supply employees with food and stays at nice hotels. \nOne of her co-workers defended his home with water from a hose, saving the house while neighbors lost theirs, she said. \nEven some of the firefighters battling the blazes lost their own homes to the fierce, fast conflagration. \n\"In all honesty, I haven't had time to think about the house,\" said Robert Taylor, a 24-year-old firefighter whose own home was destroyed. \n\"I am still in the help-others mode. If I can prevent this happening to other people then I will. I am still in structure defense. I'm afraid that if I slowed down and thought about the loss, it would eat me up.\" .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:25:44.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
