Supported by ESET Remote Administrator 6 ®, the product provides a secure email experience with malware protection, spam filtering and thorough e-mail scanning. \n\"The 2015 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report showed that e-mail phishing links and attachments are the top two attack vectors, with nearly 23 percent of email recipients opening phishing messages and nearly 11 percent clicking on attachments*,\" said Jan Balaz, product manager at ESET. \"ESET Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange Server keeps company communications protected and minimizes the effects of unsolicited messages on staff productivity.\" \nNew features of ESET Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange Server simplifies administration and delivers improved security functionality for IT admins. To make it easier for company administrators to more efficiently manage company mail flow, ESET introduced Local Quarantine Management. This tool blocks what it finds as malicious, but gives the mail recipient an option to access messages as needed. If a legitimate message is blocked, individuals can retrieve the email quickly, allowing workflow to continue uninterrupted. \nAdditionally, Local On-Demand Scan decreases required server resources by allowing admins to choose which specific databases and mailboxes to scan. The solution also allows easy access to relevant logs of server activity, so that troubleshooting is one click away. \nThe new layers of protection featured in ESET Mail Security 6 for Microsoft Exchange Server shield both the host server and the endpoints receiving mail from evolving threats. Additional features include: -- Advanced Memory Scanner - Strengthens protection against heavily obfuscated and/or encrypted malware -- Exploit Blocker - Fortifies often-exploited applications, such as web browsers, PDF readers, email clients or MS Office components -- Anti-Phishing - Scans the content of e-mail messages for links or scripts that might mislead users or trick them into visiting malicious websites \nOptional snapshot independence Another notable benefit of ESET Mail Security 6 for Microsoft Exchange Server is that it facilitates easy email recovery, by allowing IT administrators to define alternative paths for storing signature and program modules. This flexibility minimizes the gap in coverage and shortens the time it takes to update to the desired snapshot. The product also allows easy access to relevant logs of server activity, so that troubleshooting is one click away. \nFind more information about the next generation of ESET Mail Security 6 for Microsoft exchange at http://www.eset.com/us/products/email-security-microsoft-exchange/ \n*Verizon 2015 Data Breach Investigations Report. http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2015/ \nAbout ESET Since 1987, ESET® has been developing record award-winning security software that now helps over 100 million users Enjoy Safer Technology®.
