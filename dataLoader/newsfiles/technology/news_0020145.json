One of our big problems is that we’ve got smart people and they invent really amazing stuff, but it never percolates through to the business community or the entrepreneurship community.\n“There’s no exchange between that community and the universities about ‘what next’.”\nMs Gillard said Australia’s educators needed to better communicate the benefits of studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics, to stay on par with competitors.\n“Those skills are such a great enabler in our age of big data and technology. If your workforce falls behind in those skills, then you leave your economy behind,” she said.\nDucere, Latin for “to lead’’, ­offers online business and management courses to students worldwide and counts former CIA director-general David ­Petraeus, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Visy executive Jeanne Pratt and fellow former PM John Howard among its global faculty.\nMs Gillard was appointed chancellor in February.\n“I think entrepreneurship and higher education have collided,” Ms Gillard said. “The university world is being disrupted, and there’s also a change in skills ­acquisition. Schooling hasn’t felt all of that change yet, and we’re too reliant on the same models of education that were there when I was in school, and when my parents were in school.”\nThe former PM said the penny had finally dropped in Canberra about technology-driven disruption, saying that Australia’s political class “generally understands how disrupted our world now is”.\n“Maybe they don’t have as clear a focus as we would like of those opportunities, but they do sense there are opportunities,” she said.\nDespite recent reports highlighting the threat of automation, Ms Gillard said non-repetitive manual work was safe for now.\n“Routine non-manual work, so stock market reports, reading resumes and all of that will be done by machines quite soon,” she said. “But non-repetitive, manual work, so hairdressing and caring for the elderly, will be safe.\n“You’ll have to be inquiry based, in multidisciplinary teams on that edge we refer to as entrepreneurship.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T06:33:19.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
