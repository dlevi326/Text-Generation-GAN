U.S. stocks tumble again on China declines; Dow down 400 points 1 / 1 gallery_overlay_close|article-gallery-6478533|article-gallery-6478533|0 \nInvestors got another case of the jitters Tuesday, sending U.S. stocks back into correction territory. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 400 points or 2.5 percent in mid-morning trading. The decline put the average back down more than 10 percent from its May 19 closing high, marking a correction. \nTraders attributed the selloff to reports in China showing further declines in its factory sector and exports, raising fears of a hard landing. Stocks in Asia sold off overnight. Japan’s Nikkei index fell nearly 4 percent and the Shanghai composite lost 1.3 percent. The selling carried over into European markets, where losses were in the 2 to 3 percent range heading into their close. \nIn the United States, economic reports were mixed. The Institute for Supply Management reported that its manufacturing purchasing managers index dropped to 51.1 in August from 52.7 in July. A reading above 50 suggests the economy is still expanding, but the August number was lower than expected and indicates that the strong dollar, falling energy prices and slowing growth in China are causing U.S. factories to expand at a slower rate. \nOn the bright side, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending rose 0.7 percent in July to its highest level since 2008. Spending rose 2.1 percent for single-family homes, 4.7 percent for factories and 2.1 percent for power plants. \nMost likely, Tuesday’s selloff was simply a continuation of the volatility investors saw last week, which spooked investors when the Dow lost more than 1,000 in the opening minutes of trading on Monday. Although it recovered some of those losses, the cause of the mini-crash remains unknown and worrisome. \n“Last week, I detected lots of concern among our institutional accounts that while bear markets are caused by recessions, a flash crash could cause a recession in the global economy that is already looking frail and fragile,” Wall Street economist Ed Yardeni said in a report Tuesday. He added that he and his team “don’t share that concern at this time.” \nThe main economic event this week is Friday’s report on August employment and the impact it will have on the Federal Reserve’s decision whether or not to raise its short-term interest rate at its open market committee meeting Sept. 16 and 17. “We wouldn’t rule out a melt-up after the next FOMC meeting. That could happen if the Fed does nothing. Or it might happen if the Fed hikes by (0.25 percentage point) and Fed Chair Janet Yellen downplays it at her press conference on September 17,” Yardeni wrote. \nKathleen Pender is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
