They were found dead on Tuesday at their adult daughter’s apartment across town in Sparks after a two-hour standoff that ended when a SWAT team burst through the door to find their bodies.\nAbout seven hours earlier, Debra Constantino’s roommate, James Anderson, was found dead in his Reno home, Sparks police Lt Rocky Triplett said. That’s when they determined Debra Constantino was missing and that she and her husband had a history of domestic violence and were in the process of getting divorced.\nOfficers encountered gunfire when they arrived at the apartment near Sparks High School at about 11am but didn’t return fire, Triplett said.\nNegotiators made contact with Mark Constantino almost immediately and last talked to him about 1.15pm, he said. A short time later they heard a single gunshot and the SWAT team rushed in.\n The manner of death has yet to be determined pending the completion of the autopsies, Triplett said on Friday.\nWashoe District Court records show Debra Constantino obtained a restraining order that was served on her estranged husband last week, and the two were scheduled to appear in court in December regarding their pending divorce.\nPeople who knew them gave mixed accounts of their relationship.\nJanice Oberding said she became friends with the Constantinos while teaching a class on ghost hunting and spirituality at the Truckee Meadows Community College in 2012. She said she was shocked to learn of the killings.\n“We drifted apart and our friendship ended,” Oberding told the Reno Gazette-Journal. “But I know at one point she loved him very, very much and he loved her.”\nRebecca Evans, 72, of Reno, said she worked as Debra Constantino’s life coach and spiritual guide for three years. She said she didn’t believe they had any domestic issues early on but problems later progressed.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T12:53:35.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
