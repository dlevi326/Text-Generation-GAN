With more than twenty years of experience in the insurance industry and an extensive aviation background, Kat's depth of knowledge will allow insurance companies to improve claims response, risk assessment, and post-catastrophe triage. \n\"Drones have the potential to revolutionize the insurance industry,\" said Measure CEO Brandon Torres Declet. \"Kat's skill set includes expertise in the latest aviation technology and an ability to navigate all aspects of the insurance industry. With her leadership, Measure will help insurance companies realize the benefit of incorporating drones in their operations.\" \nAs noted in a recent study sponsored by the American Red Cross, which included participation by major insurance companies, drones allow insurers to identify properties and infrastructure that have been flooded or are in the path of rising waters; risk managers to utilize aerial data to better understand the factors leading to property damage and make recommendations for mitigating losses; and collect data in support of the claims process. A review of the study and the impact on the insurance industry can be found here . \n\"Kat is the rare individual who combines deep detailed knowledge with practical expertise and great people skills,\" said Dr. Robin Murphy, Director of the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue. \"Kat uses her knowledge to help apply UAVs to new situations, anticipate safety and general operational problems, and adapt in real-time to new ways of using UAVs with civilian aircraft. She doesn't blindly follow rules and isn't overawed by the excitement of new technology. Kat has a solid approach to moving the ball forward on UAVs.\" \nPrior to joining Measure, Kat was an Innovation Advisor for USAA where she led the research and development program for drones, developed and implemented strategic initiatives for the company, and was the listed inventor on several patents. As a FAA rated pilot, Kat flew a variety of fixed wing aircraft, coordinated relationships with air traffic control, and managed flight training for United States Air Force officers. She has served as an insurance claims arbitrator and manager, providing her with a unique perspective on the value of drone use for the insurance industry. \nAbout Measure: \nMeasure is the world's leading Drone as a Service® company with Federal Aviation Administration approval to fly more than 300 different types of drones for a broad range of commercial applications.
