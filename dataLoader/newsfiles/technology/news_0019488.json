Picture: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Source: Getty Images\nThe iPhone 6 still holds the number one position on the list of top selling models, even though many Apple fans traditionally hold off on buying a new iPhone in the lead up to the release of the new model this month.\nThe good news for Samsung is that it has four phones in the top 10, although last year’s Galaxy S5 still remains a bigger seller than this year’s Galaxy S6.\nOn a global level, Android OS continued to show market share losses in China, Japan and in Europe’s big five markets of Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, although it picked up 1.7 percentage points in the United States.\nThe switch from operating systems showed the same pattern. Across Europe, 27 per cent of smartphone buyers traded in an Android phone for an iPhone, while in the US it was just 9 per cent making the switch.\nApple and Samsung remain the two power players in the smartphone wars. In the US, nine out of 10 smartphones sold for the quarter were either an Apple or Samsung.\nOriginally published as Aussies ditching Android for Apple Increase Text Size Decrease Text Size Print Email Share Add to Digg Add to del.icio.us Add to Facebook Add to Kwoff Add to Myspace Add to Newsvine What are these?
