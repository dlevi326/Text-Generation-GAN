The project is in the advanced development stage and construction is expected to commence in early 2016. Based upon its initial assessment, IC Power expects that the total cost of completing the AIE plant (including the consideration for the acquisition of AIE and the construction cost of the power station) will be approximately $200 million. The AIE plant is expected to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2018. -- Project pipeline: IC Power is currently assessing various projects in Israel and various Latin American countries, such as Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua. These potential projects range in size from small-scale power facilities (e.g., less than 40 MW) to large-scale power facilities (e.g., approximately 550 MW) and utilize different fuels and technologies, including natural gas, hydroelectric, wind, and stranded gas. IC Power is also considering acquiring companies and assets in power generation and related businesses (e.g., transmission and distribution companies or assets). There is no guarantee that IC Power will proceed with any of the above-mentioned projects. \nDecisions by the PUAE (Israel's Power Regulator) \nIn August 2015, Israel's Public Utilities Authority (the PUAE) published a decision that independent power producers (\"IPPs\") in Israel would be obligated to pay system management service charges, retroactively from June 1, 2013. According to the PUAE decision, the amount of system management service charges that would be payable by OPC from the effective date to June 2015 is approximately NIS 152 million (approximately $40 million), not including interest rate and linkage costs. IC Power is considering the implications of this decision and may contest it. This decision has resulted in a revision in certain provisions that had been taken by OPC, and has resulted in adjustments to IC Power's income statement. Specifically, IC Power's cost of sales were adjusted downwards by $46 million and $6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 and the three months ended March 31, 2015, respectively, resulting in a corresponding upward adjustment in IC Power's Adjusted EBITDA in those periods; there was no adjustment to Kenon's financials during those periods, but Kenon recognized a $52 million gain ($31 million for Kenon's shareholders after tax effect) in the three months ended June 30, 2015 in connection with its revision of this provision in its financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2015. For more information, see Appendix B. \nIn August 2015, the PUAE also published a notice for a hearing regarding tariff updates effective from September 9, 2015. Such tariffs reflect a decline in the generation component tariff from NIS 300.9 per MWh and NIS 301.5 per MWh to a single tariff of NIS 260.2 per MWh. OPC uses privately negotiated rates to sell electricity to customers under its PPAs, but such rates are expressed as a discount to the generation component included within the PUAE rate, so a decline in PUAE rates will result in a corresponding decline in OPC's rates and, accordingly, its revenues. OPC's main cost of sales is gas, and prices for the gas it consumes under its supply agreement with the Tamar Group are indexed in part to the PUAE generation component tariff and NIS/USD exchange rate. However, the supply agreement also contains a floor price and, as a result of previous declines in the PUAE generation component tariff, OPC will soon begin to pay the floor price, so the decline in the tariff will result in a greater decline in OPC's margins. \nQoros \nCar Sales \nIn the three months ended June 30, 2015, Qoros sold approximately 3,256 vehicles as compared to 2,488 vehicles sold in the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 1,671 vehicles in the three months ended June 30, 2014, representing an increase of 31% and 95%, respectively. \nIn the six months ended June 30, 2015, Qoros sold 5,744 vehicles as compared to 2,561 vehicles sold in the six months ended June 30, 2014. \nIn July 2015, Qoros sold 1,230 cars. \nDealerships \nAs of June 30, 2015, there were 81 Qoros dealerships (70 of which were operational), 12 additional dealerships under construction, and twenty three signed Memorandums of Understanding with respect to the development of 23 additional dealerships. \nQoros Brand Day \nOn August 19, 2015 Qoros held a Qoros Brand Day in its Changshu plant with approximately 120 media personnel, 100 car owners and Key Opinion Leaders, and 33 dealers in attendance. The Qoros Brand Day event served as the kick-off for a series of Qoros marketing campaigns focusing on its brand positioning and product line updates. \nQoros also launched the new 2016 model year versions of the Qoros 3 Sedan, the Qoros 3 Hatch and the Qoros 3 City SUV. Two additional trims are also being offered for each of the Qoros 3 Sudan and the Qoros 3 Hatch, which has extended Qoros' pricing range to the RMB100,000 entry price. \nAwards \nIn April 2015, the Qoros 3 Sedan was awarded a 5 plus star safety rating in the China - New Car Assessment Program (C-NCAP)'s 2015 crash test, and received the highest score ever in its 9-year history. \nIn July 2015, Qoros received a Connected Service Award at the 2015 China Auto Customer Care Award in recognition of the QorosQloud. Qoros was the only Chinese brand among the eight brands which received a 2015 China Auto Customer Care Award in July. \nShareholder Investments in Qoros and Guarantees of Qoros Bank Debt \nIn Q2 2015, Kenon and Chery each provided a RMB400 million ($64 million) shareholder loan to Qoros. \nAlso in Q2 2015, Kenon provided a back-to-back guarantee to Chery for RMB175 million ($28 million), plus up to RMB30 million of related fees, in connection with Qoros' drawdown of RMB350m ($56 million) under a long-term loan, which drawdown is guaranteed by Chery. \nVoluntarily Recall of Certain Vehicle Models \nIn July 2015, Qoros voluntarily recalled 6,736 vehicles as a result of information derived from frontal impact crash tests of new Qoros models under development, which suggested that certain Qoros vehicles already in production and in the market may have had safety belt pre-tensioner system crimping assembly process issues. Regarding customer safety as an absolute priority, Qoros decided to recall all vehicles within the scope of impact and to replace the front safety belt pre-tensioner free of charge, to eliminate any risk. As of the date of this release, Qoros has not received any field incidences or customer complaints related to this defect across any of its vehicles in the market. \nChina Vehicle Market Conditions \nThe overall passenger vehicle market in China continued to grow in the first half of 2015 with a 7% YoY growth rate and 8.97 million units sold during this period. The first quarter of 2015 experienced an 11% YoY growth rate, and the second quarter of 2015 experienced a 3% YoY growth rate. This growth was unevenly distributed by segment; sales in the C Sedan and Hatch segments decreased by 10% and 34% YoY, respectively, while sales in the SUV segment increased by 43% YoY. Some auto manufacturers are offering significant price reductions, discounts, and/or rebates, to stimulate purchases of their vehicles. In addition, as sales are generally lower during the summer, Qoros expects such price reductions to continue, and potentially escalate, during the third quarter of 2015. \nAdditionally, the Shanghai Composite Index has declined by more than 30% percent since mid-June and this decline in China's stock market could further impact negatively consumption rates and the purchase of costly items, such as vehicles, throughout China. In light of current financial market and economic conditions in China, which could affect vehicle sales industry-wide in China, Qoros may find it challenging to so increase sales, and may even experience a decline in sales. \nQoros is evaluating appropriate measures to address the above market conditions. Qoros is also seeking to optimize its cost structure, and may undertake cost-cutting measures, including workforce optimizations, the downsizing of various departments and other measures to align its operations with its business plan. \nInvestors' Conference Call \nKenon's management will host a conference call for investors and analysts on September 8, 2015.

According to the PUAE decision, the amount of system management service charges that would be payable by OPC from the effective date to June 2015 is approximately NIS 152 million (approximately $40 million), not including interest rate and linkage costs. IC Power is considering the implications of this decision and may contest it. \nIC Power's financial statements as of December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 initially authorized for issuance included provisions by OPC for system management service charges and diesel surcharges in the aggregate amount of $70 million as of December 31, 2014 and $79 million as of March 31, 2015. In IC Power's opinion, due to the PUAE decision, it is more likely than not that OPC will not be charged more than the amount that was indicated in the PUAE decision. Therefore, OPC revised the provisions, such that the revised balance of the provision as of December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 was $27 million and $31 million, respectively. Because IC Power reapproved its financial statements in connection with its filing of a registration statement with the SEC, this revision resulted in adjustments to IC Power's income statement (a $46 million and $6 million downward adjustment in cost of sales, and all line items below cost of sales in 2014 and Q1 2015, respectively, which resulted in a corresponding upward adjustment in IC Power's Adjusted EBITDA during those periods) and in its statement of financial position as of the end of 2014 and Q1 2015; for 2014, the provisions were taken over the full year, but the adjustment was only made in Q4 2014. \nIn accordance with IFRS, Kenon revised its provisions as of June 30, 2015, such that the revised balance of the provision as of such date in Kenon's financial statements was $38 million, resulting in a gain of $52 million in Q2 2015 ($31 million to Kenon's shareholders after tax effect). Kenon was not required to revise its financial statements as of December 31, 2014 or March 31, 2015, as Kenon's financial statements for these periods were already approved at the time of the PUAE's August 2015 decision. Accordingly, income statement figures in IC Power's financials for 2014 and Q1 and Q2 2015 differ from those attributable to IC Power in Kenon's financials for those periods. \nAppendix C \nIC Power's Non-IFRS Financial Measures \nThis press release, including the financial tables, presents Adjusted EBITDA, net debt and net financial liabilities, which are financial metrics considered to be \"non-IFRS financial measures.\" Non-IFRS financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, IFRS financial measures. The tables also present the IFRS financial measures, which are most comparable to the non-IFRS financial measures as well as reconciliation between the non-IFRS financial measures and the most comparable IFRS financial measures. The non-IFRS financial information presented herein should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for operating income, net income or per share data prepared in accordance with IFRS. \nIC Power defines \"Adjusted EBITDA\" as for each period for each entity as net income, excluding net income from discontinued operations, net of tax (excluding dividends received from discontinued operations), before depreciation and amortization, finance expenses, net, income tax expense and asset write-off, and excluding share in income from associates, and negative goodwill. Adjusted EBITDA is not recognized under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles as measures of financial performance and should not be considered as a substitute for net income or loss, cash flow from operations or other measures of operating performance or liquidity determined in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent funds available for dividends or other discretionary uses because those funds may be required for debt service, capital expenditures, working capital and other commitments and contingencies. Adjusted EBITDA presents limitations that impair its use as a measure of our profitability since it does not take into consideration certain costs and expenses that result from our business that could have a significant effect on our net income, such as financial expenses, taxes, depreciation, capital expenses and other related charges. \nSet forth below is a reconciliation of IC Power's net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, and therefore this presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. \nSix Months Ended June 30, Three Months Year Ended December 31, Ended June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 2014 ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- (in USD million) 43 79 21 16 268 Net income for the period Depreciation and amortization(1) 58 51 29 28 108 Financing expenses, net 53 67 32 45 119 Income tax expense 21 31 8 14 51 Asset write-off - - - - 35 Share in income of associated companies - (2) - (1) (2) Recognized negative goodwill - (51) 2 - (27) 2 (71)(2) Net income from discontinued operations, net of tax, excluding dividends received from discontinued operations(3) - (7) - (1) (113) --- --- --- --- ---- Adjusted EBITDA 175 168 90 74 395 === === === === === \n1.
