Motion control is essential in robotics and Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools even though it is more complex when compared to its use in specialized machines such as General Motion Control (GMC). GMC is a subfield of motion control in which the position and velocity of machines are controlled using a servo, electric motor, or linear actuator. GMC is hardware-independent, which allows the use of different drive systems with different kinematics and is easily upgradable. The CNC machine is a numerically controlled machine with the added feature of an onboard computer which is referred to as the Machine Control Unit (MCU). The MCU generates, stores, and processes CNC programs and also contains the machine motion controller in the form of a software program. The rapid growth of the automotive industry has increased the demand for machine tools such as laser-cutting machines, machining centers, milling machines, drilling machines, lathes, shearing machines, and stamping & forging machines. The increase in the number of machine tools is driving the growth of the market for CNC products. The growth of the automation market along with ease of use and integration of components with motion control systems are some of the major factors driving the growth of the motion control market. However, the high manufacturing cost and complexity of a motion control machine are some of the factors restraining the growth of motion control market. Designing machines that are compact, less expensive, and reliable is a crucial challenge pertaining to this market. APAC accounts for the highest share of ~41% of the motion control market. The studied market in the European and North American regions is also estimated to grow at a decent rate during the projected years. The key players in the this market include Siemens AG (Germany), Schneider Electric SE (France), Parker Hannifin Corporation (U.S.), ABB Ltd. (Switzerland), Yaskawa Electric Corporation (Japan), Moog Inc. (U.S.), Altra Industrial motion Corporation (U.S.), Bosh Rexroth (Germany, and Dover Motion (U.S.). The report provides a detailed view of the motion control market which has been segmented based on technology, component, application, and geography. It also presents detailed market segmentation, with qualitative and quantitative analysis of the segmentation. All the numbers in terms of the volume and revenue, at every level of the report, have been estimated from 2014 to 2020.
