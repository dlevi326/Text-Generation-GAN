(ARC) announced today that it has released an updated version of FareSight®, a web-based tool for corporate air travel optimization. This latest version includes more than 15 enhancements based on feedback from the corporate travel industry and current FareSight customers.\nFareSight accesses current and historic ARC data directly related to a corporate travel manager’s particular organization, or a travel management company’s client, and provides analysis of their air travel patterns and spending. With this information, adjustments can be made to travel policies to promote cost savings and understand travelers’ preferences based on actual travel. FareSight also compares a company’s average ticket price for any origin and destination with the overall market, as well as against a corporate subset, and can be used as a resource when negotiating corporate fares with air carriers.\nEnhancements to FareSight include\nThe ability to drill down to passenger-level details for each O&D within FareSight instead of conducting time-consuming manual research. This feature will aid in quickly identifying patterns around single or groups of travelers using information such as name, advance purchase date and class of service. Improved benchmarking with the addition of one-way and complex trips filters to all dashboards, in addition to round-trips, along with the ability to view data by departure date. A completely new look and feel providing an enriched user experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:58:27.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
