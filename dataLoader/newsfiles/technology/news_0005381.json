CooperVision (CVI) revenue rose 10 percent to $385.5 million. CooperSurgical (CSI) revenue fell 8 percent to $76.2 million.Commenting on the results, Robert S. Weiss, Cooper's president and chief executive officer said, \"I am pleased to report another strong quarter. CooperVision gained significant market share and we made a lot of progress with our family of daily silicone hydrogel products. The remainder of the year looks solid and we should enter fiscal 2016 with strong momentum.\"Gross margin was 59 percent compared with 65 percent in last year's third quarter. Gross margin was negatively impacted primarily by currency and integration and facility start-up costs, offset in part by favorable product mix led by its Biofinity extended wear contact lenses, Cooper Companies said. Excluding integration and facility start-up costs, gross margin was 62 percent versus 65 percent last year.Operating margin was 11 percent compared with 22 percent in last year's third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower gross margins, litigation settlement costs and increased amortization arising from its acquisition of Sauflon Pharmaceuticals . On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin was 23 percent vs. 25 percent last year.Depreciation was $41.4 million, up 61 percent from last year's third quarter due primarily to $10.8 million of accelerated depreciation related to the Sauflon acquisition. Amortization was $12.5 million, up 85 percent from last year's third quarter primarily due to the Sauflon acquisition.Total debt decreased $39.8 million from April 30, 2015, to $1,307.9 million, primarily due to operational cash flow generation and subsequent debt pay down. Interest expense increased to $4.7 million compared with $1.5 million in last year's third quarter primarily due to higher debt and interest rates associated with the acquisition of Sauflon.Cash provided by operations $96.0 million and capital expenditures $66.4 million resulted in free cash flow of $29.6 million. Excluding integration costs of $12.9 million and the litigation settlement charge of $17.0 million, adjusted free cash flow was $59.5 million.The CooperVision (CVI) division generated $385.5 million in revenue, up 10 percent from last year's third quarter, up 7 percent pro forma, up 8 percent pro forma excluding contact lens solutions.Gross margin 58 percent compared with 65 percent in last year's third quarter. Gross margin was negatively impacted primarily by currency and integration and facility start-up costs, offset in part by favorable product mix led by Biofinity. Excluding integration and facility start-up costs, gross margin was 62 percent versus 65 percent last year.In July 2015, CooperVision made a one-time lump sum payment to JJVC (Johnson & Johnson) of $17.0 million to settle their existing patent disputes and agree on a combination of cross-licenses and reciprocal covenants not to sue on current core products, including all silicone hydrogel lenses. This settlement was worldwide in scope with no royalty obligation for either party. Neither party admitted any liability as part of the settlement.
