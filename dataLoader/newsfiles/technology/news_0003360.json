Wasn't peaceful negotiation one of the nation's proudest achievements and for which it has received International recognition and praise?\nDemocracy brought hope to many along with a say in their future but with it came an obligation to defend it, NOT destroy it!Crime, corruption and incompetence must be fought with all the means at the Government's disposal, failure to do so will lead to irreparable damage to the infrastructure, fabric of society and ultimately to anarchy!\nOur constitution and freedom are at stake, to say nothing of the job losses and economic damage caused by such destruction.It is not too late, but the poor, the unemployed, the victims of crime and the nation itself cannot afford, and should not tolerate, leaders who 'fiddle while Rome burns!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:06:05.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
