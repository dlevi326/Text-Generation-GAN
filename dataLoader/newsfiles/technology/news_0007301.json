Of the eight names submitted, six were African males, one African female and one white female. Twelve candidates, all of whom were named, were initially interviewed by the panel.\nThe four current IEC commissioners are all black men.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:05:20.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
