Others opted to delay non essential car and truck repairs as long as possible with different devices and contraptions.\" Cars are a way to define ones lifestyle, says Cattya Bella, Director of Product Development for World Patent Marketing. Swanky cars mean that a man has made a name for himself. It is not just the body of the car that we see, but also the wheels. We all know that rims are not that dirt cheap, in fact they are even costly; that is why having a protective accessory for car parts is an absolute must to any car enthusiast. Our newest automobile invention, Rim-A-Tatch does just that. The Rim-A-Tatch is a protective car accessory that will help prevent dents, paint sprays, and other forms of damage for your set of wheels rims. This automobile invention is fitted with a rim hook that covers the rims keeping them in good condition, especially after a cleaning or painting job. It has been designed with a circular shape to complement all types and sizes of rims. This automobile invention will help decrease the vehicle expenses of any owner that may be caused by frequent damage to the car's rims. This is easy to use, stylish and timeless, as well as convenient and lightweight, says Vladimir P., inventor of the Rim-A-Tatch. This automobile invention will help car owners protect their vehicle's rims. It will also decrease their car expenses because of needed rim replacements. It will also be a breakthrough automobile invention for car detailing and automobile shops that does cleaning and paint jobs. It covers the rims well, thus reducing the frequency of rim damage and increasing client satisfaction. Rex Roth, a car owner from Cincinnati, OH, has this to say about the Rim-A-Tatch: This automobile invention is a great way to protect your wheels. It certainly helps vehicle owners like myself steer clear of unnecessary expenses and keep your wheels looking new. Rim replacements will certainly be less frequent with this on hand. The Rim-A-Tatch not only is a protective car accessory, it also helps keep the car rims look new and clean.
