Another advantage is the processing of the contacts outside of the connector and later latching during the assembly process. \nMale and female gold turned contacts are sold separately and accept wires between 22 and 20 AWG. Assembly of the contacts use conventional crimp tools and crimp machines. A synthetic slider is also included in the female cable connector in assistance with holding the contacts during assembly. \nThese connectors are available in A- and B-coding and are shielded with an iris spring. The A-coded connectors also have a non-shielded version available. When fully mated all connections are rated IP67 for protection from ingress of liquids and debris. Rated at 4 amps per contact and 250 volts, these connectors are designed for cable diameters ranging from 4-6 mm and 5-8 mm. \nAbout Binder-USA \nBinder-USA, LP is a subsidiary of Franz Binder GmbH & Co., a German-based designer and manufacturer of circular connectors and cordsets for use in industrial environments including factory automation, process control, and medical technology applications.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T01:27:07.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
