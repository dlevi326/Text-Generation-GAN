The city of Berlin decided to remove it in 1991, a year after the unification of Germany.\nIt was cut into about 130 pieces and buried in the woods, a symbol of the burial of the German Democratic Republic of East Germany.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:57:23.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
