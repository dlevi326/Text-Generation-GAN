The new drivers make the Presto SQL query engine more enterprise-ready by unlocking a world of business intelligence and analytic applications . The drivers provide the connection and implementation protocol for transferring the query and result between the application and database. Teradata announced a committed roadmap for open source contributions and the first-ever commercial support for Presto in [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTkzZDNjdWRHVnlZV1JoZEdFdVkyOXRMMDVsZDNNdFVtVnNaV0Z6WlhNdk1qQXhOUzlVWlhKaFpHRjBZUzFNWVhWdVkyaGxjeTFHYVhKemRDMUZiblJsY25CeWFYTmxMVk4xY0hCdmNuUXRabTl5TFZCeVpYTjBieTgvVEdGdVoxUjVjR1U5TVRBek15Wk1ZVzVuVTJWc1pXTjBQWFJ5ZFdWY0lpQnlaV3c5WENKdWIyWnZiR3h2ZDF3aUlIUmhjbWRsZEQxY0lsOWliR0Z1YTF3aVBrcDFibVVnYjJZZ01qQXhOVHd2WVQ0PXw=]]. Teradata advanced the development of the new drivers based on overwhelming feedback from the growing open source Presto community. \"Presto is a key technology in the Netflix big data platform. One big challenge has been the absence of enterprise grade ODBC and JDBC drivers. We think it's great that Teradata has decided to accelerate their plans and deliver this feature this year,\" said Kurt Brown , director, Data Platform, Netflix. \"The new ODBC and JDBC drivers will make Presto even more valuable to organizations seeking to be a data-driven business,\" said Oliver Ratzesberger , president, Teradata Labs. \"Teradata is committed to listening and contributing to the open source community and addressing their priorities to advance the enterprise readiness of Presto.\" The new drivers will enable Presto to more effectively utilize organizations' analytic environments to run interactive analytical queries at scale, and leverage existing SQL business intelligence and visualization tools. By leveraging the familiar ODBC and JDBC interfaces, organizations will also be able to easily develop business intelligence applications in the data lake. The goal is to increase adoption beyond the world-class Silicon Valley companies that are already using the platform. The introduction of these new drivers to the Presto open source platform will help: Organizations to rapidly develop applications that leverage the most flexible and scalable SQL on Hadoop solution Business intelligence vendors to certify their tools with Presto, enabling familiar and mature access tools for interactive workloads in the data lake Expand the Presto community by addressing the need for enterprise-grade access The enterprise-class Presto drivers were originally slated for mid-2016. However, the global launch for the ODBC driver will now be in fourth quarter of 2015, and the JDBC driver will be released in the first quarter of 2016 at [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTkzZDNjdWRHVnlZV1JoZEdFdVkyOXRMM0J5WlhOMGIxd2lJSEpsYkQxY0ltNXZabTlzYkc5M1hDSWdkR0Z5WjJWMFBWd2lYMkpzWVc1clhDSStkM2QzTG5SbGNtRmtZWFJoTG1OdmJTOXdjbVZ6ZEc4OEwyRSt8]].
