Now, a new 2016 public launch version has been announced. It retains its pod-like look and offers a variety of features and options. \nThe Jet Capsule was conceived as a personal watercraft or a water taxi. The launch version comprises a full carbon body and photochromic windows. There's a rooftop sundeck for passengers to relax on, while inside there are driver controls with views of rear and underwater cameras, air conditioning, a heater, seating, tables and a toilet. \nIn addition to keeping the distinctive shape of the prototype, the new Jet Capsule is pretty much the same size, at 7.6 m (24.9 ft) long, 3.5 m (11.5 ft) wide and 2.3 m (7.5 ft) tall. Lazzarini says these dimensions make the craft twice as wide as others with a comparable length. \nCustomers can choose from a selection of engine configurations, with petrol and diesel engines available in either a single or dual setup. Total power outputs range from 370 hp (276 kW) up to 600 hp (447 kW) and, from those options, the maximum achievable speed is 38 knots (44 mph or 71 km/h). With a maximum load of 12 passengers and one pilot, the cruising speed is 32 knots (37 mph or 51 km/h). \nThe new Jet Capsule is available to order now at a cost of US$150,000. Orders are expected to be fulfilled five months after being made. \nThe video below shows the 2016 Jet Capsule in action.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:28:26.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
