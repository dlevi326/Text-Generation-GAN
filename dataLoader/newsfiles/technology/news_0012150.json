Next year's Mexican Grand Prix will be held in November at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez. \n“The network has been added by an innovative pay-TV platform,” said Javier Villanueva, executive director, Canal F1 Latin America . \n“Totalplay is betting on being the only channel exclusively covering Formula One in Latin America, with all the events live broadcast.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T10:59:15.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
