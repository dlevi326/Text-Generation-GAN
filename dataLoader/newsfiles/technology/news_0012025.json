Landline texting is a convenient tool that lets Trumpia users both send and receive text messages through their existing landline business phone number. This lets users operate all their communications through a single number, and eliminates the need to use their personal mobile phones. This most recent update enables users to also send and receive picture messages through the same landline number. Like texts, inbound MMS messages would be sent to their Trumpia inbox, while outbound MMS messages would appear on the recipient’s phone as though it was texted to them from the user’s business number.\n“This new update significantly expands the customer service you can provide,” said Trumpia’s CEO, Ken Rhie. “Restaurants could send mouth-watering images of their daily specials, and retail stores could send attention-grabbing picture invites to a sales event, rather than simple text.”\nAbout Trumpia\nTrumpia is the leading mobile messaging & multi-channel marketing automation software platform and is committed to helping businesses grow and stay well-connected with their audience.
