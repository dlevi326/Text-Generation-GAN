The braai. The social coming together of mates to have a good time in the sun with a cold beverage of choice; just enjoying life while the boerewors sizzles over the hot braai stand. The braai is served and eaten, the beers are finished, we all go home, and that is that. Heritage Day Braai Day in South Africa. A day spent just like every last Saturday of the month.\nIt is unfortunate that many of us have been brainwashed by the whole Braai Day concept. The South African calendar notes 24 September as Heritage Day: the day in which South Africans across the spectrum celebrate their cultural diversity. We wouldn't be labelled as the 'Rainbow Nation' without diversity.\nWith that in mind, why is it that we do not properly embrace Heritage Day for what it stands for, just like June 16 is celebrated by emphasizing the importance of the youth, and not as some gimmick to get people to buy braai stands and enjoy a public holiday as they would every other Saturday? Celebrating the entire braai concept completely misses the point of 24 September: the true diversity is ignored.\nHaving 11 official languages in a country means that diversity is in an abundance. Embrace your culture. Do not use marketing gimmicks as an excuse. Wear traditional clothing, speak your home language the whole day, learn something new about a culture from people of other cultures, anything that embraces cultural diversity.\n365 days in a year, and only 1 that gives us a proper platform to truly celebrate our diversity. Use it well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:04:10.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
