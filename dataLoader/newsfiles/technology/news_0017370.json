Orbitox has leant on Siri and Google Now's speech recognition architecture and has built in a series of voice commands that will be localised to regions with support in a number of countries following launch.\nIf you feel like having BB-8 zip around the house but aren't in the mood to actually control the droid yourself, the Patrol feature gives BB-8 a mind of it's own.\nAccording to Orbotix's COO Jim Booth, \"there is actually a surprising amount of sensors in the droid that all work together to allow BB-8 a level of autonomous travelling.\"\nWith gyroscopes, near-object sensors and operational commands, BB-8 draws on your smartphone's smarts to run a robot algorithm autonomously.\nInterestingly all of the sensors will display data in gauges so you can see the readings of each of BB-8's components and get a feel for how the droid navigates the world.\nInitially this will run a pre-installed patrol program, but Booth stated that he would like to open up the automated program to customisation in the future for Sphero's many robotics fans.\nJust you reconsider playing that message for him!\nThough we have covered some interesting applications of the latest smartphone tech already, the devs behind BB-8 have actually integrated something even more interesting into the messaging section of the app: Augmented Reality.\nOne of the most important functions of the droids in the Star Wars films is their ability to surreptitiously deliver important messages between Jedis.\nThough this feature is generally dedicated to the non speaking R2-D2, it seems that BB-8 has the capacity to deliver Holographic messages too.\nThe message section of the app will use your smartphone's front camera to record a number of video messages that are then stored locally within the smartphone app as holograms.\nThen, after selecting one of your video recordings for playback, the screen will flip to display the field of view from your smartphone's rear camera and will begin playing the audio of your hologram.\nIf you wish to see the video simply point your smartphone at the droid and a blue hologram will be projected within the 3D space on your smartphone's screen, as though it was emanating from BB-8 itself.\nLet the wookie win BB-8 is the size of a small orange and the smooth round body and tiny magnetic head aren't ideal for plugging a traditional charging cable into, so the droid comes with its own wireless induction charging cradle.\nThree hours of charging will give you a full hour of play-time, but even in the cradle BB-8 will be beeping, squeaking and bopping it's head around as though it's eager to get out and roll around.\nBB-8's decoration was surprisingly difficult for Orbitox, though printing on a flat surface is reasonably easy, the team actually had to develop a novel method to print onto a ball and Booth said that \"it took us about 80 hits to get the decoration right.\"\nEarly Verdict The holographic AR messaging, automatic robotic mode and the cute mannerisms of BB-8 make our first impression of this little droid an overwhelmingly good one, which will appeal to dedicated Star Wars fans, robotics enthusiasts, kids and techies alike.\nWhile we're yet to see just how influential this little droid is in the upcoming Episode VII film, the release of this toy means that we can indulge our imaginations in a galaxy far, far away while we wait.\nThe Sphero BB-8 will be available globally from September 4, with Australia being the first to get their hands on the droid at 12:01am for AU$249.99.\nUS and UK fans will be able to pick up the device for US$150 and £130 respectively.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/gadgets/bb8/BB81-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn2.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/gadgets/bb8/BB84-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/gadgets/bb8/BB83-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/gadgets/bb8/BB86-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn1.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/gadgets/bb8/BB82-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/gadgets/bb8/BB81-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/gadgets/bb8/BB83-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/gadgets/bb8/BB86-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn1.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/gadgets/bb8/BB82-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn0.beta.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg", "http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/gadgets/bb8/BB87-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn2.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/gadgets/bb8/BB84-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/gadgets/bb8/BB87-650-80.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-03T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:16:12.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
