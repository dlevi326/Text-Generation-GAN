Wowza is committed to meeting the needs of developers by providing flexible options to build custom workflows, solutions and value-added products, and availability of the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API further highlights the company's continued support for the developer community and organizations who build solutions on Wowza technology. \nEquipped with the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API, developers can configure, manage and monitor custom integrations to bring live video and audio streaming capabilities to more organizations. \n\"Using the REST API enables us to easily manage Wowza Streaming Engine software via the Qumu platform. This gives Qumu's customers greater control over their users' experience, including configuration and branding, while leveraging the extensive capabilities of Wowza Streaming Engine to power the customized solution,\" says Vern Hanzlik, president of Qumu . \"The flexibility of the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API allows Qumu to continually deliver unique, customer-centric solutions that set us apart in the market.\" \nIn addition to the REST API, developers can continue to interact with Wowza Streaming Engine using its native Java API. This extensive API is a key component of Wowza Streaming Engine, allowing developers to implement custom modules in Java that dynamically link to servers at runtime, rather than using server-side scripting. With the ability to extend servers' streaming capabilities through the Java API, developers have full access to the video and audio stream at the packet level as it enters and exits a server. These capabilities enable deep integration with other media servers, billing systems, log analysis services, content and asset management solutions, phone systems, calling systems, video surveillance systems, and more, increasing the ways in which live video and audio streaming benefit users. \n\"Video streaming has the power to transform industries, and customizations and integrations from our developer community further expand upon the value of streaming,\" said Charlie Good , CTO and co-founder of Wowza Media Systems. \"We're dedicated to investing in our developer community, and the availability of our REST API for Wowza Streaming Engine, along with our existing Java API, enable our developers to keep innovating.\" \nThe general public release of the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API will be available in October.
