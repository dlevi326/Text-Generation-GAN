Fonon’ family of industrial-grade LaserTower™ Systems are optimized for each customer based on the unique requirements of their application. They are the most flexible 3D Laser-based marking and engraving systems in the industry as each system can be configured with either a Fiber or CO2 laser with wattage options from 10W to 100W.\nLate last year, the FDA mandated a requirement that medical facilities provide UDI traceability of high-risk medical devices as part of their reporting process related to patient death. Approximately 50,000 serious adverse events directly related to medical devices are reported to the FDA each year, including up to 3,000 deaths. By utilizing FDA compliant marking systems like those produced by Fonon, patient-safety advocates forecast reductions in medical errors, improvements in product registries and more effective fast-track medical product recalls.\nMedical device manufacturers and medical facilities must implement UDI coding on all Class III (high-risk) devices by September 2015 with a seven year rollout plan for the rest of the medical device industry.\nFonon’s family of LaserTower™ UDI Marking Systems address all possible UDI medical device production operations from stand-alone desktop models to large-volume throughput systems that can easily be integrated into existing production lines. In addition, Fonon is the only company to offer a portable Fiber Laser Hand-Held UDI marking system for applications that are too large to fit into conventional processing chambers.\nFonon’s LaserTower™ Marking Systems are designed to support all UDI-required medical device materials including highly reflective metals. Aluminum, Stainless-Steel, Nickel and Titanium are examples of highly reflective metals that require the end-user to adjust the barcode scanning angle to avoid specular reflection in order to detect the UDI marking. By adjusting the angle of incidence in the range of 5 degrees to 30 degrees, the barcode scanner receives an optimum irregular reflection resulting in positive detection of the 2D matrix code. A 2D Camera Barcode Scanner is also highly recommended as this system can hold and provide much more data than standard barcode readers and allows optimum reading of UDI marks on highly-reflective metals.\nFor more information, please visit www.fonon.us\n–END–\nAbout Fonon\nFonon is the industry leader in developing high-tech fiber and CO₂ laser systems for marking, cutting, 3D Printing and 3D engraving and Zero Width Laser Cutting Technologies™ applications.
