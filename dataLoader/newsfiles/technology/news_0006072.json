And while Simon had hoped they would be generating sufficient revenue to ensure they weren’t reliant on donations or government funding, increased financial constraints meant it’s taken longer than expected to reach that goal.\nThey are now behind on rent and need to raise $7000 immediately or face eviction. But shutting down the project is not something Simon is willing to accept.\n“The turn around in these youth is truly inspiring to me and to see this opportunity closed due to lack of funds is something I just can’t let happen,” he said.\nIf the charity can raise the $7000, Simon believes it will reach its financial goals within a matter of weeks.\nBlue House in Ross St Parramatta.

The charity raised $700 but still has a long way to go to insure it can continue to provide services.\n“We have a gang leader who ran a group of 30 plus individuals in the Parramatta area who has now turned his back on the gang to get his life on track,” said Simon.\n“This has had a flow on effect with more members of the gang now coming to The Blue House voluntarily to get involved despite the threat of physical violence towards them.”\nIt’s experiences like this that give Simon faith the project will continue.\n“12 Ross Street, Parramatta is just the beginning,” he said. “Through the development of social enterprises we will be able to replicate or expand businesses into neighbouring areas. The future is bright and we [will] never lose hope.”\nIf you’d like to help The Blue House stay open, you can donate via phone at (02) 8872 6697 or head to their coffee shop, bookstore or car wash at 12 Ross St, Parramatta.\nFor more details head to the Blue House Project Facebook page\nBlue House in Ross St Parramatta is facing eviction.
