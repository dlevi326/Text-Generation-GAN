That was before Jane McGonigal delivered her TED talk to explain how gaming can make a better world. Now we can game happier in the knowledge that ‘gamification’ as a behavioural discipline fills us with positive energy to compete, be the best and win -- and yes, blast a few Tomb Raider moments out too.The games industry is of course a serious business and from a software application development perspective we can see many parallels with enterprise software i.e. the same code repositories, change management systems and project tools (and more besides) are used for both ‘serious’ and ‘fun’ software development. From games... into enterprise With the above propositions in mind it is worth considering what [entity display=\"Microsoft\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"microsoft\" ticker=\"MSFT\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/2854\"]Microsoft[/entity] is doing with relation to the gaming space. The firm this month delivered a closer integration with its own component-based development tools suite Visual Studio and the Unity game engine.\nTECH NOTE: A ‘game engine’ is a collection of software components (a software ‘framework’, if you like) that look after tasks and features that are common among many games. Using a game engine means game programmers can ‘abstract’ themselves above core functions like graphics rendering, graphics/shape physics, sound, user input channels and even areas like gaming collision detection and artificial intelligence. The idea is to use the game engine to drive to the vehicle of the game and concentrate on creativity and playability instead. Microsoft’s developer lead S. Somasegar has already explained that the Unity gaming engine can be co-installed alongside Visual Studio Community edition on Windows along with the plug-ins required for Windows development. This month's news sees the firm tighten up its technical bolts to the Unity 5.2 version.Starting with Unity 5.2, Unity’s installer on Windows will offer to install by default the free Visual Studio Community 2015 and the Visual Studio 2015 Tools for Unity. This should help developers use Visual Studio to write and debug Unity games.Somasegar has previously noted that Microsoft has engineered its core programming suite to work alongside the premier independent gaming engine providers: Unity Technologies, [entity display=\"Epic\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"epic\" natural_id=\"fred/company/102560\"]Epic[/entity] Games (the Unreal engine) and Chukong Technologies (the Cocos engine). “I am excited to join forces with these game engines in targeting today’s most popular devices and platforms for both 2D and 3D gaming. Together, we will be working to deliver the best possible game development experiences to users of these engines from within the Visual Studio IDE, further unlocking game developer creativity and productivity,” said Microsoft developer division VP Somasegar. Games to enterprise parallels Looking at Unity from a slightly wider perspective it’s easy to see how close its Unity Analytics tool (which works to assess how well a game is performing when it executes and runs) is to the type of analytics functions we highlight when we talk about enterprise software. Further, the Unity Multiplayer function is dedicated to making network games function -- once again, the distance from networked games to connected social enterprise applications is not so far.Now you can game away in peace knowing that your last run on Call Of Duty is helping to fuel an industry also working to produce better enterprise software and keep the world running - right?", "external_links": ["http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world?language=en"], "published": "2015-09-10T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T17:23:24.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
