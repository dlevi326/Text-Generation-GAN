It’s not very pleasant, but that’s a good thing; it means our noses can detect a gas leak, even a small one. You’ve probably heard that gas is odourless and what you smell is an additive, but have you ever wondered what they put in? Well read on… The answer is methanethiol, also known as methyl mercaptan or just plain mercaptan. It has the dubious distinction of being among the world’s most malodorous substances, and our noses can detect it in concentrations as low as one part in a million. Where does it come from? Well if you are reading this while you’re eating, you might want to stop and come back later. You’re actually making the stuff! It’s a waste product of normal metabolism and is one of the chemicals responsible for bad breath, and smelly farts. According to Wikipedia, asparagus is a particular good source of mercaptan, which manifests itself as “asparagus pee” but not everyone is able to smell it. “The ability to produce methanethiol in urine after eating asparagus was once thought to be a genetic trait,” it says. “More recent research suggests that the peculiar odour is in fact produced by all humans after consuming asparagus, while the ability to detect it is in fact the genetic trait.” Mercaptan can also be produced in beer when fermentation goes awry. According to a company that specialises in sensory taster management and sensory training; Flavoractiv , mercaptan is “formed by yeast during fermentation [and] is present in many beers as part of their natural sulphur component. It can also be imparted by yeast autolysis (or cell death) during beer maturation.” So that professional beer tasters can recognise the presence of mercaptan, FlavorActiv offers the stuff in capsule form and recommends that “all beer sensory panelists are trained in mercaptan as it’s a common off flavour in beer.” In high concentrations mercaptan is also highly toxic. In November 2014 10 tonnes of the stuff leaked from DuPont chemical plant in Texas, killing four workers and injuring 15 others. The company was subsequently fined, a mere $99,000 USD. And if you’re bothered by the stink of mercaptan, from whatever source, the delightfully named deodorant “Mercaptan Assassin” should solve your problem. Its manufacturers say “This incredible citrus formula has been used for years to solve the most challenging odour problems. We’ve added an odour-killing ingredient to this natural product so it eliminates even more odours – especially mercaptan odours.” Might be a good idea to keep a bottle handy next time you’re eating asparagus!
