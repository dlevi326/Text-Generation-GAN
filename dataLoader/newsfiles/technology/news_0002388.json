WSJ Live 10 Sep 2015 Technology Change is here ... The tech giant announced an update to its Apple TV set-top box. Picture: Stephen Lam/ Getty/AFP Source: AFP \nWHEN the first iPhone came out, there was no such thing as an app store. Now we can say the same thing, with the same tone of amazement and despair, about Apple TV. \nFamously, Apple has considered Apple TV a hobby for several years — although it is a hobby that has added more than $1 billion to the bottom line. Bet your stamp collection can’t do that. \nBut now Apple is serious about TV. It’s not just serious about what TV is now, it’s serious about what TV will be in the future. \nA few years ago, rumours were rife that Apple would release a smart TV. Now it’s done that, kind of. \nRELATED: Apple’s big launch day Much needed makeover ... The new Apple TV box doesn’t look much different but it is full of new features. Picture: AP/Eric Risberg Source: AP \nIt never got around to making actual television sets, and there are a lot of reasons why. Apple is best when it’s playing in a market in which it can bring the best product. \nWhere Apple wants to rule the TV world is not in making the sets but in making the set-top boxes. Forget the screen, the Apple TV is where the smarts are at. \nIf there is one Apple product that has been in great need of a makeover it has been the Apple TV. For years, it has remained mainly unchanged. \nFIRST REVIEW: Apple’s new iPad \nThis new Apple TV presents little new in terms of first appearances. The old version was a little black box. This version is a black box that isn’t quite so little. \nWhere it changes is in the features. The first change comes with Siri, Apple’s digital assistant that Apple launched on the world with the iPhone 4S. \nSince then Siri has improved her skills. And she’s been around. Now she’s in your iPhone, your iPad, your Watch and your new Apple TV. \nThere are two microphones in the new remote (and we’ll get to more on that shortly) and Siri picks up your voice commands easily. You don’t need to say “hey Siri” to get her attention with Apple TV, you just need to hit the Siri button on the remote. Experience ... People walk through booths to experience the new Apple TV system. Picture: AP/Eric Risberg Source: AP \nYou can ask Siri to find a show, and it will look across your services, such as iTunes and Netflix. \nYou can ask Siri to recommend shows for a particular genre — in my demo, the Apple instructor got Siri to recommend funny movies in the eighties. \nAnd you can get Siri to dig a little deeper, by finding episodes that have particular guest stars (so long, presumably, as those guest stars are mentioned in the episode summary), or movies with a good Rotten Tomatoes rating or to display the actors in the show you’re watching. \nIf Siri is one way to navigate your TV, the other way is just as cool. \nThe Apple TV remote you might be familiar with has been held up as an example of classic Apple design, with a simplicity in form that screams minimalism in a loud voice. \nThe existing Apple TV remote is definitely simple. But it’s also limited. \nThink of it in these terms: finding a show to watch with the old Apple TV remote was like texting with a 1990s mobile phone that had three letters for every key. Using the new remote is like texting with an iPhone 6. \nThe new remote has a touch pad on the top that you can swipe, although the speed of your swipe takes some getting used to and even the Apple demonstrator in one demo we watched swiped too far and found himself suddenly, and unexpectedly, demonstrating the new screen savers. iPhone 6S, iPad Pro, Apple TV First Look 1:59 \nWSJs Joanna Stern takes two minutes to show you all the new products Apple unveiled in its two-hour keynote on Wednesday. WSJ Live 10 Sep 2015 News/USA \nAside from the Siri button, the remote has volume control and some clever features inside it. One thing you won’t need to do with this remote is point it at your telly. This has Bluetooth 4.0 to connect it to your Apple TV box, rather than an infrared connection. \nSo you can point it in any direction and it will still work. \nThe battery in the remote is said to last three months and recharges through a Lightning connection, just like your iPhone and iPad. \nInside the remote are movement sensors which means you will be able to swing or twist the remote to navigate as you play games. \nAnd that leads to the question of games. With the revamped Apple TV, Nintendo should be looking over its shoulder. \nIn the presentation in the Bill Graham auditorium in San Francisco today, Australian app developers showed off the iOS hit game Crossy Road when played on an Apple TV, both in single playing mode and in multiplying mode. Bill Graham Civic Auditorium ... Apple CEO Tim Cook introduces the New Apple TV. Picture: Stephen Lam/ Getty/AFP Source: AFP \nHow easy is it to move an iOS app onto the TV app store? Apple says the two platforms are 95 per cent the same, and the app developer we asked was only allowed to cite a clearly rehearsed line from Apple that sounded wonderful but provided zip in terms of real meaning. \nWe also tried out Zova, the Australian-made fitness app. Pair the Apple Watch to your Apple TV and as you do the aerobics routines of Zova you can see your heart rate increase with the activity. \nWhat does playing an iOS app on Apple TV bring more than a big screen? It brings a big screen experience and that is a big change. \nA quick hands-on with Apple TV in the media crush after an Apple event is one way of experiencing a product. To get the full experience it takes time — and in this case it takes the app store to come out with a full range of apps. \nHow successful will iOS games be on the Apple TV? How much will Siri listening to my every thoughts change my TV viewing experience? How successful will Apple be in their rather bold, and somewhat boastful plan to “bring innovation back to television”? \nThe only way to answer that is with time, and spending that time experiencing the Apple TV box. \nI haven’t fallen in love with the new Apple TV at first site. But if this was The Bachelor , I’m ready to go on a home visit. \nMeet a smarter Apple TV with a better remote, better Siri and an app store. It feels like this is the start of a beautiful friendship. \n*Rod Chester travelled to San Francisco as a guest of Apple", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T05:05:52.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
