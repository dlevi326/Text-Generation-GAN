He has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.\nModi is the first Indian leader to visit the U.S. West Coast in more than 30 years. His trip follows one by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who met with several tech leaders in Seattle earlier this week.\nThe Indian leader has said he sees the digital economy as crucial to bringing more growth and tech jobs to India.\nModi boasts an average 87 percent approval rating in India and he has more than 30 million \"likes\" on Facebook and 15 million Twitter followers, making him the second-most followed world leader after U.S. President Barack Obama.\nOn Saturday, he was scheduled to attend a dinner with 350 business leaders to discuss the world economy and its impact on India.\nSatya Nadella, Sundar Pichai and Shantanu Narayen, the Indian-born CEOs of Microsoft Corp, Google and Adobe Systems Inc, respectively, were among those due to moderate a panel discussion before Modi delivers a speech at the dinner.\nModi is also expected to meet with Apple CEO Tim Cook and visit Tesla headquarters. On Sunday, he was to visit Facebook and Google headquarters before appearing at an event at the San Jose Convention Center.\n(Reporting By Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Tom Brown)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-09-26T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T13:28:08.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
