First, it allows you to move entries up and down to change their order which the old editor lacked completely. This meant that you had to use copy, delete and paste previously to move variables around. \nSecond, you may use buttons to add, edit or delete information, and third, you may use the browse button to add a new folder this way directly. \nThe edit text button displayed in the interface opens the old Environment Variables editor so that users who prefer it can still make use of it. \nClosing Words \nThe new Environment Variables editor improves the handling of user and system variables significantly. While it may not matter much or at all to casual users, it will make the editing more pleasant for users who come into contact with it regularly.
