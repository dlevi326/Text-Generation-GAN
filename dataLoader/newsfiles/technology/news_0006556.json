Unreleased films, scripts, and internal company emails were leaked. The FBI linked the crime to North Korea in light of the film The Interview starring Seth Rogen and James Franco seeming to be at the front of the hackers' concerns. \nAt least 10 former employees of Sony sued them in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. A hearing on whether it would progress to a class-action suit was scheduled for September 14. These lawsuits accused Sony of not protecting the employees' data, as their personal, financial, and medical information was posted online. \nFormer director of technology Lionel Felix cited in his complaint previous incidents of the Sony servers being hacked, including an incident in 2011 that breached PlayStation Network accounts. There was also a security audit conducted earlier this year that found the company had faults in its electronic security procedures. \nOther former Sony employees were critical of the company's response to the hacking, believing that the company put a greater emphasis on protecting its public image rather than being sure the employees and their personal information were protected. \nUp to 50,000 current and former Sony employees were being included in the potential class-action suit. The attorneys for the employees said on Wednesday that a settlement was reached, although the terms and how many people will be covered under it has not been announced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T09:39:26.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
