ETCIO | 22 September 2015, 11:11 AM IST By Ashwani Mishra Growing adoption of cloud in Internet of Things (IoT) services and shifting focus over industrial IoT (IIoT), rising market of M2M communication and increasing trend of wearable technology applications are among the major factors that are driving IoT market in India, according to TechSci Research. The report predicts that IoT market in India is projected to grow at a CAGR of more than 28 percent during 2015 - 2020. This growth in the market is anticipated on account of ongoing technological developments in IoT technology for providing better connectivity and coverage as well as real-time monitoring and tracking of services and systems across diverse industry verticals to reduce operational and manpower costs. Moreover, various government projects such as smart cities, smart transportation, smart grids, etc., are also expected to further propel use of IoT technology in the country over the next five years. \"The Indian government has launched International IoT Research Collaboration Scheme (IIRC), which aims to attract private investments in IoT related R&D. Furthermore, various Indian companies are increasing their focus and partnering with other companies for developing new IoT and M2M solutions,\" said Karan Chechi, Research Director with TechSci Research. As per the findings, various companies across India have realized that they can use data to optimize costs, deliver better services, and boost revenues. In 2014, consumer electronics dominated the India IoT market, followed by automotive and transportation and BFSI sectors. \"Our key initiatives will be around further compressing product development time, introducing M2M and IoT in manufacturing for automation, process control and traceability,\" said T G Dhandapani, CIO, TVS Motors in a recent interview with ETCIO.com. According to Sukamal Banerjee, (Engineering and R&D services) and Head (IoT Business), HCL Technologies, \" the intersection of employees, data and technology enabled intelligent machines is creating fundamental shifts in enterprise business models, leading to not only increased productivity and efficiency but also opening a plethora of new revenue opportunities for companies.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T10:37:43.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
