An open house starts 5:30 p.m., followed by the formal meeting at 6 p.m.\nThe second hearing is in Morgan City on Wednesday (Sept. 16). It's in the Morgan City Municipal Auditorium, 728 Myrtle St. , with the doors opening at 5:30 p.m. and the meeting starting 6 p.m.\nThe Louisiana projects include:\n$14.2 million for planning and design of a freshwater diversion from the Mississippi River into Maurepas Swamp. $9.3 million for continuation of a long-term study of how best to manage water and sediment resources of the lower Mississippi. $8.7 million for filling in old oil exploration canals located in the Barataria Unit of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve. $7.3 million for construction of a beach, dune and back marsh restoration project on West Grand Terre Island. $5.2 million for planning and design of a ridge and marsh restoration along Bayou Dularge in Terrebonne Parish. $4.3 million for planning and design for the restoration of the Golden Triangle wetlands adjacent to the new Lake Borgne surge barrier. $3.2 million for planning and design of a \"living shoreline\" of oyster reefs along the southern edge of the Biloxi Marshes. As required by the federal Restore Act , the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council oversees the trust fund of Clear Water Act fines. The 10-member council is made up of five federal agency designees, and one designee from each of the five Gulf Coast states.\nThe seven proposed Louisiana projects would be paid for through the Restore Act's share of a $1 billion Clean Water Act fine that Transocean agreed to pay in a 2013 settlement of civil and criminal charges stemming from the blowout.\nMost of the seven projects would just be planning and design projects, and Justin Ehrenwerth, executive director of the council, made clear last month that just because the council has suggested they receive planning funds does not guarantee they will receive implementation funds in the future.\nIn terms of the seven Louisiana projects, five of them are called for in the state's Master Plan for coastal restoration and protection. The other two projects were proposed by federal council members and directly benefit coastal Louisiana.\nEach of them will be directed by either Louisiana, Louisiana and the Army Corps of Engineers, or by one of the federal agencies that are members of the council.\nThe draft for public review here and the public can comment on it through Sept. 28, 2015, either in person at the hearings; online here ; by mail to Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, Attention: Draft FPL Comments, Hale Boggs Federal Building, 500 Poydras Street, Suite 1117, New Orleans, LA 70130; or by email to draftfplcomments@restorethegulf.gov .\nThe $14.9 million Maurepas Swamp project would be built near Garyville in St. John the Baptist Parish. It would develop construction-ready plans and an adaptive management plan for a diversion designed to deliver up to 2,000 cubic feet per second of river water to the swamp to reduce salinity levels and promote regrowth of bald cypress and tupelo.\nThe $9.3 million river management study would continue a Corps and state study to develop a science-based management strategy for how to remove sediment from the river through diversions without hurting navigation.\nThe six-month canal backfilling project, to be conducted by the Department of the Interior, calls for the $8.73 million to be spent to reclaim 16.5 miles of old exploration and production canals in the Jean Lafitte Park's Barataria Unit, with the hope that the wetland restoration efforts would help protect nearby hurricane levees built after Hurricane Katrina. The spoil berms along the canals would be degraded and open water areas would be partially filled with soil and vegetative material.\nThe proposed West Grand Terre beach nourishment project is similar to a series of barrier island restoration projects undertaken by the state and the Corps, and would include $7.26 million for the planning needed to restore 12,700 feet of dune and beach covering 235 acres, another 66 acres of back-barrier marsh and a rock revetment.\nThe $5.2 million Bayou Dularge project would pay for engineering and design work, and would be developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service on behalf of the federally recognized Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana. The council study outlining the projects hinted that it might fit into a project proposed to reintroduce Atchafalaya River water into the Bayou Penchant basin in Terrebonne Parish.\nThe Golden Triangle wetlands project would use $4.4 million to complete planning for restoration of about 600 acres of marsh in the area surrounding the new Lake Borgne surge barrier on the lake's northwestern corner.\nThe $3.2 million Biloxi Marshes living shoreline project would pay for engineering and design necessary to produce construction-ready plans and an adaptive management plan for oyster reefs. The reefs would act as a breakwater along the southern edge of the Biloxi Marshes off the shoreline of Eloi Bay and Eloi Point near the mouth of Bayou la Loutre in St. Bernard Parish.\nIn the council's announcement last month describing its draft funding priority list, it recommended spending $137 million of the $241 million available in the council bucket from Transocean fines on Gulf Coast restoration projects and on projects aimed at natural resources. The rest of the money recommended for projects last month would go to:\nGulf-wide projects - $21.2 million Mississippi - $20.7 million Florida - $16.1 million Texas - $13.4 million Alabama $12.7 million The council is expected to reserve another $43.6 million of the Transocean money for future projects, subject to further council review, and then the state also plans to keep $40 million to fund council operations through 2023. A remaining $18.2 million is expected to be held in reserve for contingencies.\nNOLA.com | The Times-Picayune reporter Mark Schleifstein contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/maps/place/Homer+L.+Hitt+Alumni+Center,+2000+Lakeshore+Dr,+New+Orleans,+LA+70148/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8620a92fd736a7cb:0xf664bdaa5002f1d7?sa=X&ved=0CB4Q8gEwAGoVChMIgICiz-f2xwIVR82ACh1v5gBz", "https://www.google.com/maps/place/Morgan+City+Municipal+Audtrm/@29.6948396,-91.1875771,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x3845c73a6de537e1?sa=X&ved=0CG0Q_BIwCmoVChMIgM_c2Of2xwIVj_2ACh0Fvg1p", "https://parkplanning.nps.gov/commentForm.cfm?documentID=67759", "https://www.restorethegulf.gov/about-us", "https://www.restorethegulf.gov/our-work/draft-initial-funded-priorities-list-draft-fpl"], "published": "2015-09-14T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T15:07:49.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
