In contrast, between 1982 and 1997, 93 mercy petitions were rejected while only seven were commuted.\nBetween 1997 and 2007, K R Narayanan and A P J Abdul Kalam put the brakes on the disposal of mercy petitions. Narayanan did not decide any mercy petition, while Kalam acted only twice, resulting in one rejection.\nPratibha Patil rejected five mercy petitions, and commuted 34 death sentences, while current President Pranab Mukherjee has thus far rejected 31 of the 33 mercy petitions decided by him.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:09:35.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
