The agency, which is Britain's national body against organized crime and cybercrime, said Tuesday that the attack aimed to make the website inaccessible to visitors. It said it did not result in a security breach, and did not affect its operational capability. It said the attack is at worst a \"temporary inconvenience to users of our website.\" The attack came days after the body announced six teenagers were arrested on suspicion of launching cyberattacks using \"Lizard Stresser,\" a tool made by a group that previously targeted Sony PlayStation and Xbox gaming services. All six suspects, aged 15 to 18, were released on bail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T13:58:09.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
