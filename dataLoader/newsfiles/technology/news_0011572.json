This news follows the company’s major initiative with technology firm Navis, where it introduced its ‘One Terminal’ concept at TOC Europe 2015 as a solution for integrated terminal operations. \nBuilding on almost 60 years of heritage in terminal tractor expertise and over 65,000 units manufactured, the new Kalmar T2 is set to work even in the harshest of environments.\nIt is designed to operate both in the busiest distribution terminals as well as in heavier (LoLo) port operations. \nChris Booth, Vice President of Terminal Tractors at Kalmar, said: \"The key features of the new Kalmar T2 are focused on driving down costs and optimising operational performance and flexibility.”\nTo read more about Cargotec in our Supplier Directory, click here \nThe clear-view cabin is built around the driver to deliver an uninterrupted view of the working environment. This helps improve safety and awareness through panoramic visibility. All major controls are designed to fall readily to hand for smooth operation.\nThe Kalmar T2 comes as standard with certification to meet roll-over and falling object protection standards (ROPS/FOPS), as well as noise reducing high-density cabin insulation.  \nAccording to Kalmar, with two points of access into the cabin and a flat rear access platform, the T2 speeds up the hooking-up process, reduces driver fatigue, improves productivity and lowers operating costs.\nChris Booth continues: \"Improving cycle times for trailer movements is of vital importance when calculating cost of ownership. The new T2 provides optimum visibility and ease of use. This ensures that cycle times, machine damage and, ultimately, the cost of every trailer movement are reduced, allowing more movements per shift and greater throughput.”\nThe new machine's powertrain efficiency combined with electronic engine RPM management results in around 10% reduction in fuel consumption.\nThis leads to average fuel savings in excess of around US$4,470 per truck, per year. \nThe Kalmar T2 can be tailored to individual customers' requirements thanks to manufacturing flexibility and modular construction, thus reducing cost by avoiding over specifying the product. The chassis is based on the highly acclaimed Kalmar Ottawa T2, launched in the American markets in 2014. \nChris Booth concluded: \"Our main concern is to keep our customers operational at all times. With key features built into the T2, such as quality construction, easily-accessible controls, and innovative fuel efficiency system, downtime and repairs are minimised and servicing costs are reduced.\n“Kalmar's service teams are close to wherever our customers are. Should there be need for support, all new Kalmar T2 terminal tractors come with a standard 2-year or 4,000-hour warranty, giving our customers peace of mind and helping to manage and further reduce operating costs.”\nFor all the latest on Kalmar, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T19:02:48.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
