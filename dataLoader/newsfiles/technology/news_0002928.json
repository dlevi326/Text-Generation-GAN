Those embryos go into less expensive females to incubate, producing multiple desirable calves instead of one at a time. \nArtificial insemination and embryo transplants played a role in the birth of 13 calves at West Texas A&M University in March, but there was a key difference. The calves came from mothers and a father that were cloned by WT, Abraham, Timbercreek veterinarian Gregg Veneklasen and genetics company ViaGen. \nThe cloned parents were made from tissue taken from carcasses that met the top beef grade of Prime Yield Grade 1. \nThat grading system measures the fat marbling, thin ribbons of fat in muscle tissues, without excess outside fat and the size of the ribeye from a carcass. \n“We want taste fat without waste fat,” said Ty Lawrence, professor of animal science and director of the Beef Carcass Research Center at WT. \nThe plan now is to raise the calves without special treatment and slaughter some next spring to test the team’s hypothesis that making the top grade is a genetic trait that can be passed on. \n“This is science, but we’re still at ‘if,’” Lawrence said. \nThe calves aren’t getting special treatment. \n“It’s been pretty normal,” said Landon Canterbury, a graduate student who manages the ranch where the cattle are being raised. “Of course, they’re pretty important, but there hasn’t been anything special on my end.” \nIf they get the answers they expect, it will be one more step to developing advanced animals that can produce meat more efficiently. The animals could eat half the amount of grain to reach slaughter weight, Abraham said. \nConsumers shouldn’t begin to trim their grocery budgets if the experiment works. \n“Prime beef might be cheaper, but choice and select (produced traditionally) will still be there in the store,” Abraham said. \nThere may be a degree of disease resistance built in, meaning offspring of cloned cattle would require fewer antibiotics. To get the Prime Yield Grade 1 ranking requires not only good genes but good health. \n“To be Prime Yield Grade 1, you can’t have a bad day,” Veneklasen said. \nAbraham and Veneklasen said while they make money on cloning for private clients, this is different and all about the science and WT. \n“I’m excited about the scientific part, but there’s nothing financially,” Abraham said. \n“For WT, it’s an incredible tool to attract students. Young people eat this up,” Veneklasen said. “We’re doing what they want to do. How are we going to feed the Earth without this technology?” \nOn top of enhanced prestige for the school, other benefits could be attracting advanced instructors and more cash in the form of donations and legislative funding. And there might be discoveries about how genes work and how to turn them on and off. \n“I hope someday we can select for genes that make our lives better,” Veneklasen said. \nPrivate company ViaGen is a partner in the project and already owns the patents involved. WT will move products that result from the research into the market, Veneklasen said. \nThose products could range from semen to embryos to bulls, Lawrence said. \nOutsiders who get a look inside the project express surprise. \n“They say it’s cool, intriguing. There’s amazement that technology today is what it is,” Lawrence said. “To create live animals from tissue from dead animals.” TAGS:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:04:10.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
