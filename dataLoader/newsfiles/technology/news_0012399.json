Often referred to as just the Slippery Dick. Thank you, Twitter.\nExpert Village/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET I tend to think of biologists as furiously scuttling around, wondering which species will be the next to die out.\nI am, on occasion, a pessimist.\nStill, biologists themselves aren't without a sense of humor. Look, please, at a Twitter hashtag that might bring you a little joy. It consists of biologists (and other intelligent beings, of course) chuckling at some of the ridiculous names animals have been given over the years.\nThe hashtag is #StupidCommonNames , and represents a glorious collection on images of animals and their entirely inappropriate, silly, are-you-sure names. It's not about someone who called their goldfish Bert Glugchuckle.\nInstead, these are the real scientific names of these creatures. For example, naturalist Phil Torres offers an image of a fine, proud yellow-bellied bird . This is apparently a bananaquit. As Torres mused, \"Because how can it quit if it never bananaed?\"\nWhat about the one pointed out by biologist PZ Myers? As he points out , there is apparently a zebrafish. \"Zebrafish. I always have to explain the stripes are horizontal, not vertical. Also...not zebras.\"\nBiologist Christopher E. Smith offers the mantis fly. \"Neither a mantis nor a fly.\"\nThere are, I have learned thanks to science writer Jason G. Goldman , macaroni penguins. He notes that \"Macaroni penguins should never be stirred into cheese sauce.\"\nDid you know there was a black ghostshark? Neither did I.\nBrit Finucci, a Ph.D. candidate researching poorly known deepsea chondrichthyans (what?), explains the naming rationale. \"Because its scientific name translates to the Batman water-hare.\" Batman Water-Hare. Isn't that a movie you'd want to see next summer?\nMore Technically Incorrect Steven Spielberg says superhero movies will die like Westerns President Obama roams Alaska with, oh, a selfie stick Teen reportedly shoots self dead while taking selfies with gun I cannot remember the last time a Twitter hashtag was so enthralling, educational and fundamentally human. Here you can find the information that the American buffalo is actually a bison.\nPerhaps, though, the top level of the podium is occupied by an innocent-looking striped fish whose name is apparently so rude that some scientists allegedly want to change it . What could this be? Why, it's the Slippery Dick Wrasse. It's often merely known as the Slippery Dick.\nAt #StupidCommonNames, though, marine biologist David Shiffman admitted , \"No one said we want to change it...\"\nShould you have nothing better to do this Labor Day weekend, or should you be just trying to get your kids interested in something other than Madden 16, a trip to #StupidCommonNames isn't the worst idea.\nWhere else could they learn about the grateful midget and the puddingwife?\n( Via Daily Dot )", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BritFinucci/status/638832057209110528", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/StupidCommonNames?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/jgold85/status/638865095964028928", "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/this-fish-s-name-is-so-rude-scientists-want-to-change-it-154923055.html#QzNuxI8", "https://twitter.com/FieldEcology/status/638880562254495744", "http://www.dailydot.com/geek/stupid-common-names-hashtag/?tw=dd", "https://twitter.com/phil_torres/status/638846295654817792", "https://twitter.com/WhySharksMatter/status/639433828990324736", "http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/03/9d370166-2d9d-4e84-ac7f-054e04a25fda/resize/570xauto/4da38a6e728a2258c19c2bf354e0c60c/dick2.jpg", "https://twitter.com/pzmyers/status/639482245242159104"], "published": "2015-09-04T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T04:15:15.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
