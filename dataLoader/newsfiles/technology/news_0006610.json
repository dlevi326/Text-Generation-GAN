With a range extension factor of 4-6 times that of microwave-based technologies, the RaptorX provides the ability to reach near and beyond line-of-sight locations at minimum expense.\nEstablishing in-structure wireless connectivity is costly and problematic using Wifi and cellular solutions. RaptorX’s VHF/UHF spectrum advantage and multi-carrier transmission technology provides the punch-through enabling floor-wide and multi-storied robust connectivity supporting building automation, security, healthcare and integrated public safety systems, cellular extension services and emergency communications.\nRaptorX’s spectrum advantage extends to economically implementing robust shipboard and marine systems networks where it is impractical, dangerous or simply difficult to reach with copper or wireless LAN systems.\nIndustry Firsts:\nRaptorX introduces a number of White Space technological innovations that enhance operation, security and system reliability:\n1. Full operation in all permissible VHF and UHF channels 7-51.\n2. Full legal power output\n3. Dual independent channel support for increased system reliability and network resiliency.\n4. Multiple channel bonding to increase link speed and reliability\n5. Access options for TDMA, peer-to-peer ad hoc and CSMA/CA nodes\nAbout White Space Spectrum\nThe transition from analog to digital broadcasting made available hundreds of unused TV channels. In 2010, the US Federal Communication Commission issued Operating Rules and Equipment Regulations for the unlicensed use of unused TV band channels. Covering 270 MHz of prime spectrum spanning TV channels 2 through 51, nearly every zip code in the US has a minimum of one unlicensed 6 MHz VHF channel and several UHF channels available. Moving from urban areas into the nation’s hinterland 10s of unused TV channels are available for unlicensed use to meet the spectrum needs of government and industry alike.\nAvailability\nProduction shipments commence 1st quarter, 2016. MSC offers several RaptorX system packages aimed at addressing a variety of range and coverage requirements for professional users. FCC ID #2ABCU-50739.\nAbout Metric Systems\nEstablished in 1992 and headquartered in Vista, California, Metric Systems Corporation designs and sells white space and dynamic spectrum access wireless networking equipment and systems to support the business and mission objectives of government and industry.
