By eliminating the need to use two wavelengths with the 16-QAM modulation format, the new Oclaro 400G external modulator is designed to enable networking companies to more quickly design and test next generation, high-speed networks that deliver the highest level of performance and reliability. \"In order to scale to 400G speeds and higher in the future, optical networking companies are improving spectral efficiency and lowering the cost per bit in fiber transmission systems, something that is not economical with two wavelengths,\" said Adam Carter , Chief Commercial Officer at Oclaro, Inc. \"With its new 400G modulator, Oclaro is once again at the forefront of optical network innovation, delivering the components and modulation techniques that will enable customers to simplify and accelerate the development of these ultra-fast networks.\" As optical network capacities continue to increase to meet the rising demands for bandwidth, optical designers have turned to coherent modulation techniques to obtain the highest transmission speeds and lowest bit error rates (BERs) in their networks. The most advanced systems are boasting port capacities of up to 400G. While in the past they were limited to using two wavelengths to achieve this, they can now achieve 400G capacity on a single wavelength, making it easier than ever to deliver the increased bandwidth telecom operators are demanding. About the Oclaro 400G External Modulator The Oclaro 400G lithium niobate external modulator is designed to enable 400G and beyond speeds on a single wavelength or carrier. This modulator is a high electro-optic bandwidth Polarization Multiplexed Quad Parallel Mach-Zehnder (PM-QMZ) device that integrates into a hermetic package an input beam splitter, four parallel Mach-Zehnder modulators configured for I-Q modulation, a polarization combiner, and monitor photodiodes for power and bias control. Key features of the 400G lithium niobate external modulator include the following: 3dB electro-optic bandwidth exceeding 35GHz Very smooth optical response up to 50GHz enabling a symbol rate of up to 64Gbaud Extinction ratio above 25dB to enable complex modulation formats Insertion loss below 13dB for high efficiency About Oclaro Oclaro, Inc.
