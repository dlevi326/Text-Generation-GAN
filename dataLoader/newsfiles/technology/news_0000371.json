Quick-change feeders have been specially designed for applications requiring the maximum possible material handling and changeover flexibility. Single screw feeders handle free flowing powders, granules, pellets and other free flowing materials. Twin-screw feeders are ideal for floodable powders and more difficult, sticky or hard-to-flow materials. \nThe 2400 Series Powder and Pellet Receivers provide a high-capacity sequencing system designed to handle powder, pellet, regrind and granular materials. Each receiver has a stainless check valve to allow multiple receivers to draw material from a common conveying line. Applications include railcar unloading, silo to daybin transfer, in-plant transfer or feeder refill. \nThe ActiFlow Smart Bulk Solids Activator offers an innovative method to reliably prevent bridging of cohesive bulk materials in stainless steel hoppers without internal hopper agitation. ActiFlow is a non-product contact device, consisting of a patent-pending vibratory drive and intelligent control unit, designed specifically to work with Coperion K-Tron’s line of gravimetric loss-in-weight feeders. Working together with the gravimetric feeder controller, ActiFlow continuously activates the material inside the hopper with an optimized frequency and amplitude, without exerting any mechanical force on the bulk material. \nCoperion K-Tron’s Bag Dump Station with integrated dust hood (photo) is specifically designed to maintain a clean, dust-controlled process environment; the unit is equipped with a pulse-cleaned cartridge filter. The central exhaust ventilation is started automatically when the hatch is opened and generates a slight vacuum. The primary filter is only cleaned when the hatch is closed and the exhaust fan is on. The Bag Dump Station can handle powder, granular, and pelletized materials. \nThe unit on display at Fakuma will feature a 150 l (40 gal) feed bin, a bag rest for 25 kg (55 lb) standard bags, a stainless steel mesh to prevent ingress of pieces of bags or oversize pieces as well as a KS60 single screw feeder for metered discharge of the bulk material. Several different filter media are available to accommodate different applications. In addition, a user-friendly access door with gas-piston cylinders provides easy access and hands-free loading of material. The unit is made of stainless steel and designed for easy cleaning. The modular design makes it easy to tailor the configuration to the application and add options as needed, such as aeration pads or a fully fluidized cone to eliminate flow problems. Versions suitable for ATEX zones 3D or 2D are also available.
