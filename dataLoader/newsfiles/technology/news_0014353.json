The rub? It costs $1,000 per day for all 12 weeks of treatment.\nBush’s clinic, First Choice Community Healthcare, is a federally qualified health center in the rural town of Los Lunas, New Mexico, which means she sees a disproportionate number of patients who are uninsured, underinsured, and on Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor. In other words, they can’t afford Sovaldi.\nThe state’s Medicaid program rations access to Sovaldi and other blockbuster Hep C drugs to only the sickest patients. Even with those limitations, the drugs will likely cost the state an estimated $140 million this year. At various points since Sovaldi became available last year, Bush said, Medicaid has required her to perform risky liver biopsies on patients to prove how sick they are, or wait until patients have late-stage liver disease before they can be eligible for coverage. Each day, Bush juggles seeing patients with writing appeal letters and filing pre-authorizations that are often denied.", "external_links": ["http://www.abqjournal.com/622285/news/amazing-drug-to-cost-nm-medicaid-140m.html"], "published": "2015-09-25T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:06:16.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
