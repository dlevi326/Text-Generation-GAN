The new partnership was announced earlier today by both companies at the Internet Marketing Association's IMPACT15 conference in Las Vegas , where their CEOs shared the stage to discuss the power of connecting people in meaningful ways.\nEvite is providing this service free to planners, hosts and guests that use Evite.com, and unlike many online donation-processing services, Pledgeling does not take a portion of charitable donations as a fee.\n\"The team at Evite is extremely customer-focused, and the ability to accept charitable donations as part of throwing an event is a capability that many of our customers have been asking for,\" said Victor Cho , Chief Executive Officer of Evite, which recently sent its 2 billionth event invitation. \"Evite invitations kick off millions of parties every year. In offering the option to easily make a charitable donation, either in lieu of or in addition to traditional party gifts, we have an opportunity to help our users make a huge positive impact on the world.\"\nThe integration between Evite and Pledgeling is seamless.\nAs part of creating a free Evite invitation, planners and hosts can now add charitable donation functionality for their guests by simply selecting from a list of top non-profit charities in the U.S., or by recommending a new one. For event guests, the collaboration provides a simple method to show their support by sending their tax-deductible donations online in a few simple clicks. Guests then receive an email receipt for their transaction and the option to create a free Pledgeling account to keep track of year-long charitable giving.\n\"We believe people have an inherent desire to give back, and we are excited to help Evite and its millions of users quickly and easily make charitable donations as an integral part of their celebrations,\" said James Citron , Chief Executive Officer of Pledgeling. \"Making a charitable contribution of any amount is a wonderful way to honor the special people in our lives, while supporting causes that matter to us.\"\nIn announcing their partnership, Evite and Pledgeling are working together to solve a challenge that many charitable groups face: having simple, flexible tools to reach potential donors, collect donations of any size, and keep track of those donations all in one simple-to-use account.\n\"We've always been a service at the heart of bringing people together face-to-face, and now we can help people 'do good' at the same time,\" added Cho. \"It's a perfect combination.\"\nAbout Evite\nEvite ( www.evite.com ) is the leading digital service for bringing people together.
