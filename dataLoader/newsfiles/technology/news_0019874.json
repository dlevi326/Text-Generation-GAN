The sale of CADRA in fiscal 2014 allowed us to significantly reduce our outstanding debt ($2.7M at the beginning of fiscal 2014, $446,000 at the end of fiscal 2015), to make investments in the PLM market in Europe and to develop a new product called HomeView during fiscal 2015. \nOur European office focused during 2015 in pursuing PLM opportunities. Subsequent to fiscal year end 2015, that office received an order for approximately $350,000 in a phase 1 project at a large manufacturing company that could turn into a multi-year, very large contract when phase 1 is successful. Several other identified PLM opportunities in Europe that we think will close during fiscal 2016 give us comfort that the 2015 investments were well placed. \nHomeView. During fiscal 2015, we also invested approximately $600,000 (about $400,000 expensed, and $200,000 capitalized) in the development of our HomeView patent-pending technology. HomeView, very simply, is PLM for the residential property market. The residential property market in the U.S. alone is valued at approximately $27 trillion . Homeowners spend about 3% to 4% of that market value each year in maintaining and renovating their homes. HomeView is aimed at providing those homeowners with a robust but easy-to-use technology that will not only help them manage the things in their homes but also provide a maintenance, repair and replacement record for future owners. \nWe believe the following with regard to the need for HomeView in the market today: a buyer of a residential property should demand that the seller provide them with a complete record of the components of a property along with pertinent information about those components so the buyer knows whom to call when things break and knows when to expect the component will have to be replaced; a paper system to track maintenance and replacement needs is a system that is doomed to failure. An automated, redundant, electronic system that can be maintained and passed along to future owners of the property is far superior and will save the homeowner time and money; a home seller that can demonstrate a record of care and attention to their home through a system like HomeView can command a higher resale price than one that doesnâ€™t; and a home that is completely transparent as to the age, condition, repair history and other relevant data for all the components in the home will sell faster, avoid 11 th hour issues from the inspection and at a higher price relative to a home that hides the data. \nJust a decade ago, Realtors closely guarded the information about the homes in their markets that were for sale or that sold. Home buyers had to come to them if they wanted that information. Today, there are numerous portals such as Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, Realtor websites and many other online sites that provide ready access to the basic listing data. This has revolutionized the real estate market. It is estimated that 80% of prospective home buyers browse online through one or more of the popular portals before even interacting with a Realtor. Realtors are scrambling to adjust to this new world. \nHomeView believes the basic listing data about a home that includes the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, acreage, pictures, physical location, school systems and other general information is a great initial rudimentary start for the home buyer. But why stop there? Home buyers also have great interest in the appliances, utility costs, age of the roof, heating and cooling systems and all the other things that go into making a house a home. Before they purchase they want to know the cost of operating a particular home and the capital needs over the next five to ten years. When they take ownership they will want to know the service people that are familiar with the components of their home and how to reach them. HomeView delivers all that and more. \nAdditional information about HomeView is available at www.HomeView.com . \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nThe Statements of Operations for the three and twelve month periods ended May 31, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year are presented below.
