That's more than double the company's value from a little more than a year ago. Its revenue grew 10 times in the last year, said the source, who asked not to be identified because the information was not public.\nCompass is among technology companies including Zillow Group seeking to disrupt the real estate industry through software. Seattle-based Zillow, which bought competitor Trulia this year, provides online listings for purchase and rent all over the United States.\nLike Zillow and Trulia, Compass lists properties on its web platform. Compass agents work with users looking to rent or buy properties. Agents work exclusively with Compass and receive commissions, just as they would under the traditional real estate model, said Ori Allon, Compass's co-founder and executive chairman.\nCompass built technology to help agents track and manage relationships with clients and uses data to draw insights on home values. The company, which has more than 350 agents and about 100 other employees, plans to use the capital to bring its service to new cities and hire more data engineers to improve the site's features, Mr Allon said.\n\"They have seven different data feeds in New York, for example, and they're registered brokers of record, so they have all the traditional data,\" said Todd Chaffee, a general partner at Institutional Venture Partners. \"They've gone through and automated the whole transaction flow for the agents, where the agents can do things in 10 minutes that used to take them two days.\"\n$1b revenue possible Mr Chaffee said the company could reach $1 billion in revenue in three years and was one of the fastest-growing companies the venture capital firm had seen. IVP will advise Compass on scaling the business to reach and exceed that goal, he said.\nRelated The funding round brings the total capital raised by Compass to $123 million. Previous investors including Thrive Capital, Founders Fund and Salesforce.com chief executive officer Marc Benioff also participated in the round, Mr Allon said. With the new cash, Compass will also target cities including Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and Houston. The company is present in only New York, Washington DC and Miami.\n\"Next is probably Boston and the Hamptons,\" Mr Allon said. \"We'll at least double the cities we're opening in the next year if not more.\"\nCompass will face challenges in developing a system that could provide standardised insights to agents in different cities, Mr Allon said. The algorithms and predictive models for one city might not work for a different city, he said.\n\"Most of our focus there is really about scaling and making sure our tools work across the cities. That's something we're still learning, and as we expand, we need to normalise the data and we need to process the data differently.\"\nMr Allon, who founded Compass with CEO Robert Reffkin in 2013, said he had no intention of selling the company. He declined to specify Compass's revenue and to comment on the valuation.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:25:49.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
