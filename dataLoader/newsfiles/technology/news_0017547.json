Eyeprint ID technology allows customers to log in using their phone’s camera and an “eyeprint” rather than a user ID and password. \nUsing the camera on iPhone and Android phones, Eyeprint ID technology captures an image of the eye and matches the unique vein pattern to verify identity, eliminating the need to remember and type a password. Eyeprint ID provides automatic authentication if the eye image matches the eyeprint registered with the device. The biometric solution provides consumers using Eyeprint ID the same level of access as if they had entered a valid username and password to access online banking. \n“Eyeprint ID is the latest demonstration of First Internet Bank’s commitment to customer-centric digital banking,” said David Becker, President and CEO. “Eyeprint ID comes quickly after our introduction of Touch ID authentication earlier this year, which enables customers to log in with a fingerprint. Biometric technology allows us to provide innovative solutions to our customers’ need for secure, convenient account access.” \nEyeprint ID access is immediately available through the First IB personal banking mobile app, for both iPhone and Android users. \nAbout First Internet Bank \nA premier provider of online banking services nationwide, First Internet Bank of Indiana opened for business in 1999 as the first state-chartered, FDIC-insured institution to operate solely via the Internet.
