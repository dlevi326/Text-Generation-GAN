The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added to its August decline, while the Dow Jones industrial average capped its biggest monthly drop in five years and Chinese shares capped their worst sell-off since 2008.\nOil surged into a bull market amid the biggest three-day rally since 1990, adding 27 percent to ease concern about persistently low inflation. Treasurys fell since faster price increases erode the value of long-term debt.\n“It seems that the uncertainty from China’s roller coaster is not over yet,” said Guillermo Hernandez Sampere , who helps manage the equivalent of $167 million as head of trading at MPPM EK in Eppstein, Germany. “Any panic created out of this high volatility keeps investors out of the market. There’s still no clear message” on when the Fed will raise rates, he said.\nThe S&P 500 dropped 0.8 percent, bringing its August slide to 6.3 percent, the most since May 2012. The MSCI All-Country World Index lost 0.7 percent, while European shares capped the worst month in four years. U.S. oil jumped 8.8 percent, stoking speculation that inflation may pick up, while the yen strengthened for the first time in five days.\nThe rout in global equities this month erased more than $5 trillion from the value of shares as Chinese policymakers tried to bolster their market amid growing concern that its economy may be in worse shape than analysts had estimated. Morgan Stanley reduced its forecast for world growth this year and next on Monday, citing weakening industrial activity in China.\nTrading in U.S. equities has been volatile. Last week alone, the S&P 500 plunged the most since 2011 to enter a correction before rallying more than 6 percent over two days for its best back-to-back gains since the beginning of the bull market in 2009.\nStephen Kirkland and Jeremy Herron are Bloomberg writers.
