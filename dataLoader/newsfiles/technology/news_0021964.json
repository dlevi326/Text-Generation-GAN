In CL 15 the HG-10K-20 Hybrid System supplied electric power to critical and vital facilities under conditions governed by specific operational scenarios and the system demonstrated its ability to interoperate with other systems of different countries. \nThe HG-10K-20 system belongs to Hybrid Electrical Power Systems (HEPS) of IDE and is the result of long-term self-financed research and development effort on new power technologies. The HEPS series products of IDE include sophisticated energy systems for applications in military installations, transportable units and systems integrated in tracked and wheeled military vehicles offering reduced fuel consumption, long range and significantly reduced life cycle costs. \nThe exercise was attended by the President and the Defense Minister of Hungary, as well as by high officials from NATO and its member-countries. A video from the participation of the Hybrid System HG-10K-20 of IDE in the NATO exercise is available by visiting the company's website.
