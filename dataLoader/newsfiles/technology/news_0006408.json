(AP) â€” The latest on the decision not to list the greater sage grouse as threatened or endangered (all times local):\n8:20 a.m.\nThe head of the House Committee on Natural Resources calls the decision not to seek federal protections for the greater sage grouse a cynical ploy.\nThe U.S. Interior Department said Tuesday that the bird does not need to be listed as threatened or endangered across its 11-state Western range. But Republican Rob Bishop of Utah says the announcement is intended to mask the fact that the Obama administration has imposed limits on development across the West.\nHe's referring to changes in government policies guiding lands controlled by the U.S. Forest Service and Interior's Bureau of Land Management .\nThe Independent Petroleum Association , meanwhile, says the land use plans will hurt the country's smaller oil and natural gas producers, which operate about 95 percent of its wells.\n___\n7:30 a.m.\nAn aide to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell says recent policy changes provide protections for the greater sage grouse on 67 million acres of federal lands. That includes 12 million acres where strict limits on oil and gas drilling will be enforced.\nSarah Greenberger made the comments after the U.S. Interior Department said Tuesday that the bird does not need to be listed as threatened or endangered across its 11-state Western range.\nGreenberger says efforts made by the federal and state governments in recent years produced the largest land conservation effort in U.S. history.\nThe Obama administration says it has struck a balance to save the imperiled ground-dwelling birds from extinction without crippling the West's economy.\n___\n7 a.m.\nThe U.S. Interior Department says the greater sage grouse does not need federal protections across its 11-state Western range after some limits were put on energy development and other activities.\nTuesday's announcement signals that the Obama administration believes it has struck a balance to save the widespread, ground-dwelling birds from extinction without crippling the West's economy.\nIt follows a costly conservation effort, and could help defuse a potential political liability for Democrats heading into the 2016 election.\nFederal protections could have brought much more sweeping restrictions on oil and gas drilling, grazing and other human activities from California to the Dakotas.\nRepublicans have seized on the issue as supposed evidence of wildlife protection laws run amok.\nEnvironmentalists who sued to force Tuesday's decision are certain to challenge it.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-22T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:31:30.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
