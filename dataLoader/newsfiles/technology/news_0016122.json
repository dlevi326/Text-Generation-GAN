Normally religious people can live with science especially when they benefit from it. But as soon as it contradicts the ancient texts that is another story.\nThen we hear across the airwaves the self-righteous and pompous, indignation and condemnation of science - as witnessed by the recent ridiculous and ignorant comments from people like Mr Vavi ex COSATU leader and ANC MP Dr Mathole Motshekga who poo-pooed the greatest archaeological discovery of Homo naledi in South Africa, akin to the finding of Tutankhamen’s tomb in Egypt. One wonders if they get out much- that is out of their comfort zone of understanding.\nScience and Christianity and all religions operate from two opposite methodologies. Despite what Christian leaders say; science and religious faith mixes like oil and water. The one requires evidence the other just needs faith.\nScientists require evidence before accepting a hypothesis, and so science can only investigate that which is detectable. This is its limitation. We all know this. So it operates on the principle of methodological naturalism.\nIt cannot do otherwise. Science assumes there is a natural explanation for everything it investigates precisely because this is the only way it can work. If natural explanations for events were not possible because God regularly intervened in the world, then science simply would not be possible.\nSince science does work then a miraculous intervening God does not exist. Scientists don’t use the God hypothesis in any of their activities. For instance when working out how hurricanes are formed they don’t think maybe God is involved – let’s look at the God hypothesis.\nThat would be insane. Why? - Because which God of the many worshiped is involved and what verifiable proof of God is there in the first place and if there is a God who intervenes in our world then science cannot work at all.\nThe very basis of science is predicated on a non-miraculous world order. Since science is possible a miracle working God doesn't intervene. If God sends the rain then exactly how does he do this when meteorologists can predict weather patterns and storms?\nDoes God tell the weatherman what to say? If he did and he intervened in the natural order of things, and if he did that very often the science of meteorology would not be possible. Meteorologists could not predict weather patterns and storms at all.\nScientist would have nothing to do. Scientists do not detect these kinds of divine miraculous interventions in any of their areas of expertise. It goes for meteorology. It goes for all the other sciences. The very fact that neurologists can detect brain malfunctions and correct them is predicated on the non-miraculous workings of the human brain.\nThe very fact that modern medicine can detect illnesses and heal bodies is predicated on the non-miraculous workings of the human body. The list goes on and on and on. Science itself would not be possible if there were a miraculous intervening God.\nThe pursuit of truth produces knowledge, not anything else, and there's bad and good methods to obtain it. Faith is thought by the religious to be a method to obtain knowledge but since it cannot be tested or verified it fails miserably, so we can discard it at once.\nKnowledge comes from one place and from one place only: reason, diligently and methodologically applied. Science does not prove things. It gathers evidence. If you have enough evidence, you corroborate your theories, and corroborated theories are what you consider to be probably the truth. If you find good contrary evidence, you falsify your theory, and you stop believing.\nWe have evidence that religious faith is a failure, a bad method. No reasonable person remains sick and trusts God to heal them before they go to medical science for treatment. There is also no evidence for any religions gods or heavens or hells. At most religious faith works like a placebo. That’s okay but it isn’t divine and there is no evidence that anything is.\nWe have evidence that there is no God because if there was why would he be inert, silent and never do anything to prevent evil. So seeing that there is not enough evidence for any religions god the God hypothesis fails miserably.\nScience is not assuming anything; it is merely corroborating the Theory of the Natural Reality every day and falsifying the supernatural. Such activity is exactly equal to anything else it does, and the result of corroborated theories is what we expect to be truth.\nIf you accept the scientific method, you should accept that Naturalism is most likely to be true, in the same way the Theory of Gravity, the Theory of General Relativity, the Big Bang Model, the Theory of Evolution, the Out of Africa Theory, the Age of the Earth and others are most likely to be true.\nWhy? Because there´s massive evidence for them. So unfortunately it is not God and science, you must choose this day God or science. You cannot have both.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:16:27.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
