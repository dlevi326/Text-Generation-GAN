Ironically, the old IOS Newstand app, which still resides on the front page of IOS devices, still has the NYT in there. But readers there can only read 10 articles monthly for free.\nOther additions:\n—Wallet. The home for Apple Pay has a new look on the front page, with a black border, but otherwise, nothing has changed.\n— A new way to search. Instead of swiping down to get to the search bar, you can also swipe left, and can do more than just look for stuff on your iOS device.\nSearch has been expanded now to also include web searches \"and even see suggestions before you start typing,” according to Apple.\nA search for president Barack Obama brought up his Wikipedia page, while typing the letters CH brought up my Chipotle app. (Apple must know I access it all the time.)\n“Calif” got me a listing for a nearby California Pizza Kitchen, and “All About” got to me Meghan Trainor’s “ All About that Bass ,” song via my Apple Music subscription.\nA search for \"Calif\" produced California Pizza Kitchen in IOS9 (Photo: Apple)\nOne other new feature to look for: the “Notes,” app has new tools. Beyond just jotting down quick ideas, you can also add photos, either by taking a picture with the iOS camera, or from the Camera Roll, or drawing into the note itself.\nFun stuff.\nThe new iOS so far seems as advertised: smaller in scope, with enough fun new features to warrant an upgrade.\nHopefully that will remain the same as we use it more often over the rest of the week.\nThe new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus goes on sale Friday, September 25th.\nFollow USA TODAY tech columnist and #talkingtech host Jefferson Graham on Twitter, where he’s @jeffersongraham and listen to his daily audio tech reports on Stitcher and TuneIn.\n45 CONNECT 103 TWEET 10 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1KgBphe TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d7f7245c264b6c2de102ff7b84cc0b2519d30f74/c=0-167-750-1167&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/09/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635780158302903331-IMG-2025.PNG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5bbf3093f40516a3456238cde43d5966d89c2a3a/c=0-117-2400-1473&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635773271368466826-iPhone6-3-Up-iOS9-Transit-PRINT-2.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KgBphe&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1KgBphe", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KgBphe&text=Apple%20iOS%209%20is%20great%20for%20news%20junkies&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d87936826212cb0c21150c824cafe7f0f1817757/r=224x400/local/-/media/2015/09/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635780158302903331-IMG-2025.PNG", "http://twitter.com/jeffersongraham", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635780158302903331-IMG-2025.PNG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8203b372c183eb5fde26f7b94b89cf2120d7c54d/c=0-167-750-1167&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/09/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635780158702271011-IMG-2027.PNG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8203b372c183eb5fde26f7b94b89cf2120d7c54d/c=0-167-750-1167&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/09/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635780159073870157-IMG-2028.PNG"], "published": "2015-09-16T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T05:33:04.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
