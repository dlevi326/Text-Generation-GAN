Clinton sent out a link to a New York Times article about it. \nClinton promised to unveil a plan on Tuesday to take on \"outrageous\" price increases like that one. Her campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on specifics. Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I'll lay out a plan to take it on. -H https://t.co/9Z0Aw7aI6h \nRelated: Why Clinton's profit-sharing proposal may not do much \nThe drug highlighted by the Times was acquired in August by Turing Pharmaceuticals, a privately held startup that's run by former hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli. \nShkreli defended the price increase to the Times, saying: \"This isn't the greedy drug company trying to gouge patients, it is us trying to stay in business.\" \nTuring did not immediately respond to a request from CNNMoney to comment on Clinton's remarks. \nThe former first lady's comments has clearly spooked investors. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF ( IBB ) went from flat the day prior to falling 4.5% after the tweet. \nBiotech stocks helped knock the Nasdaq into the red on what had been an otherwise positive day for U.S. stocks. The nine biggest losers on the Nasdaq 100 were all biotech stocks, led by BioMarin Pharmaceutical ( BMRN ) and Biogen ( BIIB ) , both of which tumbled 5% a piece. Other big biotech names under pressure include Regeneron Pharmaceuticals ( REGN ) , Gilead Sciences ( GILD ) and Celgene ( CELG ) . \nRelated: The Silicon Valley recipe to win 2016 election \nBiotech stocks have been on fire for years. The iShares biotech ETF has skyrocketed nearly 300% over the past five years, vastly outperforming the broader markets. The industry has benefited from huge demand for next-generation drugs and a wave of mergers & acquisitions. \nOne of the hardest-hit biotech stocks was Retrophin ( RTRX ) , which plummeted 14% on Monday. Retrophin was founded by Shkreli, but he was fired by Retrophin last year and the company has since sued him. Still, investors are clearly worried Shkreli used some of the same strategies that have gotten the attention of Clinton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:30:51.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
