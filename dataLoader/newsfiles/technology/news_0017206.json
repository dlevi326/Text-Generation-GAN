The new VMware software was developed in part by AirWatch, the mobile-device-management company that VMware bought last year for about $1.5 billion.\nThe collaboration between the two longtime rivals shows the sometimes strange bedfellows in the technology industry as demands of consumers and businesses shift. VMware and Microsoft battle fiercely over big markets such as software \"virtualization\" for computer servers, and Microsoft also offers its own device-management software that competes with AirWatch.\n\"There is overlap between our two products, but that doesn't matter,\" VMware Executive Vice President Sanjay Poonen said at the San Francisco conference.\nWrite to Shira Ovide at shira.ovide@wsj.com\nSeptember 01, 2015 12:55 ET (16:55 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:51:03.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
