This extrapolates to a program/project cost of R 11.232 million, but if the correct remuneration that should be paid (R85.00 per day) is used amounts to a project cost of R 16.848 million. So somewhere along the line R 5.616 millions is disappearing through the cracks!\nBut the most disturbing matter is that the LED Manager within the Elias Motsoaledi that is self-proclaimed to be in charge of scrutinizing applicants for the vacant positions have made it more than abundantly clear that supporters and or voters of the ANC would have preference over the employment of others in reference to the program/project and that he would be the only one to identify beneficiaries of the employment opportunities.\nIn the notice as issued by the Municipal Manager (Me. RM Maredi) of which the closing date is the 25 th instant, in this regard, no mention is made that employment in the project would depend on political affiliations, which it should not be, yet the Manager within its confines seems to think that he has the ‘jurisdiction and powers’ to add the criteria for consideration as a prerequisite for employment based on political affiliation.\nFourteen wards are to benefit from the program/project which in essence means that each ward should benefit for 38 employment opportunities in its ambit.\nLocal Councilors that represent each and every ward that is to benefit from the opportunities, whom are au fait of the most deserving cases that should have preference to employment should have the mandate and jurisdiction to nominate, elect and shortlist the applicants of the ward to be employed, and such a responsibility should not be vested in one person alone, which makes ‘ex gratia’ opportunities easier and less controllable.\nFor once let there be accountability, transparency and good clean governance, and not to use an opportunity to gain and score political points.\nLet the recruitment be above board, a-political, and to advance employment and alleviate poverty in the area for once without having any personal agenda in its methodology and or even any undertone that may raise suspicion and cast doubt on the integrity of people", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:04:24.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
