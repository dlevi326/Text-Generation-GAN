Urban Airship Connect makes it simple for digital marketers and data teams to select and stream granular mobile signals of customers' interests, preferences and intentions to any other business system, driving actions within marketing automation platforms, ad targeting solutions, business intelligence systems, customer databases and more. Joined at launch by 10 partners with connections to more than 50 business systems, marketers and data analysts can put mobile user-centric insights to work in minutes. \nMobile is the front door for businesses with mobile app usage pegged at five to 10 times higher than Web activity. However, the usefulness of the sheer volume of behavioral mobile data is limited by existing approaches that rely on pre-defined reports, aggregate data or batch exports that lack both timeliness and the necessary granularity. \n\"Traditionally, marketers use analytics retrospectively to analyze highly structured customer and campaign data and apply what they learn to the next campaign or customer experience improvement project. In a contextual marketing engine, you must apply analytics on the fly within the interaction cycle,\" (Forrester Research, Inc., The Power of Customer Context, 4/14/14). \nWith Urban Airship Connect, marketers and data analysts can easily zero in on the exact mobile insights necessary to drive automated and targeted actions in other systems. For example, businesses can instantly: Send a persuasive win-back email the moment a user uninstalls an app Notify a sales associate when a VIP customer is looking for answers in-store Present a can't miss Facebook offer based on the product they just researched Feed mobile campaign and audience data to BI solutions for cross-channel attribution and to understand mobile's ROI impact on the business Send signals across a supply chain, as safety or inventory checks are being performed, to speed the flow of information and drive business efficiencies \nUrban Airship Connect seamlessly ties the user journey together across any business system through a flexible user identification system using device IDs, user IDs, Apple's IDFA and Google's Advertising ID, custom CRM identifiers, or other IDs, resulting in more accurate campaign attribution and personalization. \nExisting Urban Airship customers can simply \"turn on\" Urban Airship Connect, while new customers benefit from only needing a single SDK for both the broadest mobile engagement capabilities and real-time mobile data streaming that enriches existing customer data and drives more effective targeting and automation for cross-channel marketing. \n\"Mobile is the most personal, permission-based experience brands can have with customers, and now they have a powerful solution to use real-time behavioral insights as powerful triggers for actions in any other system,\" said Brett Caine, president and CEO, Urban Airship. \"Today, we are moving the mobile industry forward with a commitment to an open omnichannel approach where data freedom empowers businesses to act with insight and benefit from prior investments in business systems.\" \nAvailability Urban Airship Connect will be generally available in Q4 this year, including pre-built connectors to Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) and Amazon Kinesis, as well as many other partner integrations including a new strategic partnership with mParticle . \nAn easy-to-use streaming API and server libraries ease custom integrations.
