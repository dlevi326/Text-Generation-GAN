( http://www.CarteNav.com ) is pleased to announce that its AIMS-ISR® software has been selected for a second time by the UK’s National Police Air Service (NPAS) – this time to be installed on newly acquired, fixed-wing surveillance aircraft.\nCarteNav’s software was previously selected for installation on seven EC-135T2 helicopters.\nFour Vulcanair P68 fixed-wing aircraft are being provided by Airborne Technologies of Austria and will provide a 24/7, all-weather flight capability. Each aircraft will be significantly modified and upgraded, including the addition of a sophisticated camera system which can be controlled by CarteNav’s AIMS-ISR® software.\nMr. Paul Evans, CEO of CarteNav, said “We are delighted to have been selected a second time by NPAS, and look forward to working closely with both Airborne Technologies and the end customer to deliver a solution ideally suited to the mission parameters of the new fixed-wing aircraft.”\nCEO of Airborne Technologies, Mr. Wolfgang Grumeth, said “Dealing with the requirements of one of the most advanced police forces was a great challenge. We put a lot of time and effort into understanding the individual needs, as well as the overall philosophy of the tender. Together with our longstanding partners L-3 WESCAM, ECS, and CarteNav Solutions Inc., we were able to prepare a superb overall package.”\nThe powerful AIMS-ISR® software system will integrate an MX-10 camera and a number of other sensors and features, making the Vulcanair P68 a highly capable reconnaissance and surveillance platform. The new aircraft have a much greater range and endurance than the helicopters they are replacing and will serve the whole of England and Wales.\nAbout CarteNav\nCarteNav Solutions Inc. is an international leader in mission management and sensor management software solutions for the airborne, land, and maritime environments.
