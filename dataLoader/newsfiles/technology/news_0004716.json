He is also pushing for the disclosure of arrangements made up to at least 5 years ago.\nThe Commission, the EU executive, also plans to launch a new proposal next year on a \"common consolidated corporate tax base\" (CCCTB) for multinational companies.\nThe plan will have a first phase where only a common tax base would be introduced. Consolidation, the most contentious issue, would be introduced later and entail the elimination of tax avoidance practices.\nA previous attempt to bring in CCCTB drew opposition from member states who saw it as a first step towards harmonising tax rates, regarded as a sovereign issue.
