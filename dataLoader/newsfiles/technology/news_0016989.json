Through the collaboration, the universities are seeking to evolve science that would enable them to build surgical robots known as \"intelligent surgical assistants.\" \n\"We want to make the robots smarter to help surgeons perform more effective manipulation in surgery,\" said M. Cenk Ã‡avu?o?lu, a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Case Western Reserve University, who is a co-investigator on the grant. \nThe EAGER grant focuses on robots that could change shape and insert themselves into confined areas. Cagdas Onal, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at WPI and a co-principal investigator, cited an example of using a soft robot in a search-and-rescue mission. For example, a soft robot built like an elephant trunk could be strong but flexible, while one modeled on an octopus tentacle could maneuver around rubble or other debris to find its source. \n\"These objects could be deformable and small enough, yet strong enough, to reach into cluttered environments and potentially move rubble out of the way and find a person,\" said Onal. \nAdditionally, Onal noted that a soft robot could potentially work alongside humans in factories or small-scale operations. For instance, he said, a robot built with a soft arm could do less damage to equipment or harm to people than one built with rigid materials. \"A soft arm is a potential solution to many challenges we face in human-centric manipulation tasks,\" said Onal. \nOnal is optimistic about the future of soft robotics research. \"I'm very excited about where all of this research may lead,\" he said. \"This is a very exciting time to be involved in groundbreaking research that has such widespread application.\" ### \nAbout Worcester Polytechnic Institute \nFounded in 1865 in Worcester, Mass., WPI is one of the nation's first engineering and technology universities. Its 14 academic departments offer more than 50 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in science, engineering, technology, business, the social sciences, and the humanities and arts, leading to bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees. WPI's talented faculty work with students on interdisciplinary research that seeks solutions to important and socially relevant problems in fields as diverse as the life sciences and bioengineering, energy, information security, materials processing, and robotics. Students also have the opportunity to make a difference to communities and organizations around the world through the university's innovative Global Projects Program. There are more than 40 WPI project centers throughout the Americas, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. \nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T02:21:13.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
