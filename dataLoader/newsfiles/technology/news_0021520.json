And it acts just like they thought it would.\nThe European Organization for Nuclear Research, known by its French acronym CERN, said Tuesday that two experiments that previously helped confirm the particle have produced the best precision yet on its production, decay and interaction with other particles.\nThe results largely match with the predictions of the Standard Model, which explains how much of the universe works at the subatomic level. CERN and other physicists are trying to establish the accuracy of that model.\nCERN's Large Hadron Collider was instrumental in the discovery of the Higgs boson, a subatomic particle that had long been theorized but never confirmed until 2013.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T12:39:40.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
