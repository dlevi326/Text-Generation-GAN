(NYSE Paris:SESG) (LuxX:SESG), one of the world’s leading satellite operators, announced the launch of a 24/7 multi-genre linear Ultra HD cable TV channel via satellite. The new Ultra HD network is called High 4K TV and features a broad range of round-the-clock content from Ultra HD movies and TV shows to sports and documentaries. Content for the new High 4K TV channel will be delivered over the SES-3 satellite, one of three satellites (SES-1, SES-3, AMC-18) that make up SES’s Ultra HD neighbourhood at the centre of the orbital arc over North America. High 4K TV will be the latest channel to join SES’s growing worldwide Ultra HD line-up. The trio of satellites at the core of SES’s North America Ultra HD platform enable programmers to reach more than 100 million U.S. television homes through virtually every cable TV, IPTV and direct-to-home provider across the region. “The new channel, with its breadth of programming, is another key step in helping cable operators through North America accelerate the delivery of linear live Ultra HD content to subscriber homes across the U.S.,” said Steve Corda, Vice President of business development for SES in North America. SES has developed the first end-to-end solution capable of delivering linear live Ultra HD content to a cable system. The innovative Ultra HD platform was unveiled by SES and Harmonic at the NAB Conference earlier this year, followed by cable operator trials of the plug-and-play service and the launch of North America’s first Ultra HD demonstration channels. “This launch is a major step toward enabling the affordable and timely delivery of Ultra HD to cable homes across America,” noted Justin Borrelo, Head of Business Development at High TV. “It is indeed a major milestone for us, as an international 4K channel, to be present in North America with SES. We are excited to be bringing the very best in lifestyle and entertainment programming to an audience that embraces entertainment as the very essence of their culture, and we look forward to expanding the delivery of High 4K TV programming to other regions around the world.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T19:23:57.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
