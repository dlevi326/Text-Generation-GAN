From deep sea, surf and pier fishing to boat rentals on quaint lakes, lagoons and back bays, the Wildwoods offer it all.\nThe Wildwoods are scheduled to host three of the top fishing tournaments during the fall season – from the Pennsauken Surf Fishing Club Tournament, to the NJBBA’s Great Fall Classic Surf Fishing, and the Annual Jersey Shore Beach ‘n Boat Fishing Tournament. Over 4,500 registered anglers compete in the Beach ‘n Boat Fishing Tournament – a season-long, inshore, multi-species challenge for anglers of all skill levels.\nBelow is a detailed list of the fishing events happening in the Wildwoods this fall:\nThursday, October 1 – Sunday, November 1 – Jersey Shore Beach ‘n Boat Fishing Tournament\nThe Jersey Shore Beach ‘n Boat Fishing Tournament is fun for the whole family and is open to everyone. The family can fish any time during the month from the beach or a boat or a kayak, private boat, party boat, charter boat, off a deck or an inner tube in the bay or the ocean. Anglers of all skill levels compete for cash and prizes. The Beach ‘n Boat Tournament and Challenges have become the fastest growing, highest paying inshore events in the world.\nSaturday, October 3 – Pennsauken Surf Fishing Club Tournament\nNorth Wildwood beach will host the 60th annual surf-fishing event. Teams shall consist of six members. There will be a plaque awarded to the teams finishing first, second and third. Each person on the winning and placing teams will be given individual awards as well. Individual anglers are welcome to participate. Registration will be located at the Anglesea Firehouse, 2nd and New Jersey Avenues in North Wildwood. Registration begins at 6 a.m. Registration fee is $50 per team and $15 per individual. The tournament will be held from 7:30 a.m. – 1 p.m.\nSaturday, October 10 – NJBBA’s Great Fall Classic Surf Fishing Tournament\nThe New Jersey Beach Buggy Association’s 37th annual Great Fall Classic Surf Fishing Tournament will be presented by the Association of Surf Angling Clubs (ASAC) in North Wildwood. This event is both a team and individual surf fishing tournament. Registration is located at the Angelsea Fire House at 201 New Jersey Avenue, beginning at 5 a.m. The ASAC tournament will run from 7 a.m. – 1:30 p.m. and the individual tournament starts at 5 a.m. Entry fee is $50 per six-man team and $10 per individual.\nFishing, a favorite seashore pastime, is a great way to have some fun and enjoy the island environment. A fishing pier on the Intracoastal Waterway – known locally as “the back bay” – at Sweetbriar Road in Wildwood Crest is a popular fishing spot for island natives and visitors alike, and there are beaches along Hereford Inlet in North Wildwood where fishing enthusiasts gather to surf fish.\nCharter and party boat captains in the Wildwoods offer a variety of excursions, ranging from night fishing trips for bluefish or drum-fish; full-day excursions in quest of tuna, marlin and swordfish; or a Mississippi River-style paddleboat journey for those who prefer to take in the serene sights rather than catch “the big one.” Whether it’s a father-and-son outing, a guys’ day out, or a full family event, fishing in the Wildwoods’ waters will grant you some of the largest catches off the coast and back bays along the Jersey Shore. Fishing boats typically offer four, six or eight-hour trips. Those who find themselves in need of fishing equipment are gladly outfitted with the necessary rigs and bait.\nWhether you opt for a full day of fishing, a sightseeing dinner cruise or an all-out tournament, don’t miss the opportunity to take advantage of the Wildwoods’ prime location, surrounded by the bounty and beauty of the sea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T09:12:29.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
