Mother Teresa\nThe 21 st of September is the World Day of Peace. The primary aim of observing the World Day of Peace this year is to highlight the importance of working together in the society to strive for peace. For a few months now, a group of parents in Orange Farm have been doing exactly this – using murals to build bridges of understanding in their community, with remarkable results.\nWhat bridges do we speak of? Bridges for children who live with disabilities and their families. Too many children suffer in silence – hidden in back rooms, kept away from the public, the object of shame and stigma. But now mural art is spreading tolerance, acceptance and awareness in a big way.\nFacilitated by local NGO Afrika Tikkun, this group of parents and caregivers has launched the Paint it Purple Campaign. The campaign brings substance to the meaning of real peace by educating the community and challenging stigmas around disabilities through art.\nSince June, the group has arranged to paint one family’s house purple each month. The purple houses each have a mural designed to celebrate the child living there – using images and messaging to promote understanding of the child’s disability. The Paint it Purple campaign aims to paint 18 more houses purple before the end of the year. And in 2016, it will expand nationally.\n“Stigma and superstition are perhaps the greatest challenge to those living with disabilities in South African communities,” says Jean Elphick, Manager of local NGO Afrika Tikkun’s Empowerment Programme with Children with Disabilities and their Families.\nAccording to Elphick, families of children with disabilities feel that while the physical and practical challenges of living with disabilities are huge, it is the social exclusion which families battle with most. Most of the time, it is single women carrying the burden of children with special needs in communities that not only offer little support, but stigmatise and reject them as well.\n“Many people still believe that those living with disabilities are cursed, bewitched or not even human,” Elphick explains. “The result of this is that such people – and particularly such children – are often abused and maligned”.\n“The outcomes so far have been extraordinary,” says Elphick. “Not only have the murals prompted open conversation, questions and understanding, but group members have met people who, until now, have kept their children with disabilities hidden from the public.”\nWe are finding parents, who have been hiding their children from the world – sometimes for over a decade, bringing their children into the open. They are finding out what the children are suffering from. They are learning to walk with dignity and breaking shame. They are finding support, community, understanding and getting access to services.\nThis is the peace that comes from a community realizing that they belong to each other.\nTo find out more about the Empowerment Programme for Children with Disabilities and their Families: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVh6sTQdMKs\nTo find out more about Afrika Tikkun’s range of programmes for holistic development, visit www.afrikatikkun.org or email catherinev@afrikatikkun.org.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVh6sTQdMKs"], "published": "2015-09-23T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:06:43.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
