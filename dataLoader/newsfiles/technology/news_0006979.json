The element serves as a semiconductor, transporting electrical charges very quickly. It was used in the development of the first transistor, and is still being used in many electronic devices today, including smartphones, computers, and fiber-optic cables. \nGermanium is not that rare. In fact, it’s found in soil all around the world. The problem is that it is difficult to extract, and most sources are currently located in China. The new extraction method may make it easier to get the element, and do it anywhere. \nScientists from the Freiburg University of Mining and Technology are working on developing this new method, which they call “mining with plants.” The idea is to extract the elements in a plant’s shoots and roots, which the plant absorbs from the soil it is planted in. \nBiology professor Hermann Heilmeier is using common plants to develop this idea from concept to practice. \n\"What is being cultivated in this field are various energy crops -- for example sunflowers, corn, reed canary grass - but instead of using them for energy purposes we want to use them for phytomining,” he said in a statement . “We want to bring elements that are present in the soil into the roots and shoots of the plants, harvest them and then extract these elements from the plants after they have been used for energy, that is to say fermented.” \nThe process is cost-effective since it piggybacks on existing biogas practices, explains Professor Martin Bertau of the Freiburg University. \n\"We use the normal biogas process, collect the products of fermentation and all there is left to do then is extract the germanium from them. The processing costs of this downstream step are manageable, so even with these low amounts it is still economically viable,\" Bertau said. \nThe process is not ready for the mass market just yet. Currently germanium can only be extracted in very small quantities at a time. Bertau says that thanks to support from the German ministry for education and research, “we have now actually found a solution to an intractable problem and have got to the point where we can upscale the process.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T09:23:23.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
