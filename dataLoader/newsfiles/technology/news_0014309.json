The new drivers will be introduced through the company’s bank and software partners over the coming months, and include updates for the CheXpress CX30, TellerScan TS240 and BranchXpress BX7200 check scanners. The previous-generation TellerScan TS230, as well as all future Digital Check scanners, will also be supported. \nRick Ooten, Digital Check’s Director of Product Management, says the update is part of the company’s commitment to providing ongoing support for its key product lines. “We realize that when people buy Digital Check scanners, they buy them with the expectation that they’ll last for years. A Windows 10 update ensures that their useful lifetime will be extended into the next decade, or even longer.” \nBecause scanner drivers are typically included as part of check processing software, they will be pushed out as regular updates by banks and Digital Check software partners. Individual end users are advised not to update the drivers on their own, as doing so before they are tested with a particular software package risks destabilizing the system. \nAdditional operating systems supported by Digital Check devices include Windows Vista, 7, 8 and 8.1, Mac OS X, and several Linux distributions.
