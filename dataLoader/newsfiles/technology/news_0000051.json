The program aims to educate students with the help of renowned international instructors in the fields of computer science and entrepreneurship, which provided hands-on access to high tech, coding, business and leadership skills while working in parallel with the Group's current strategy. \nSelected students were rising ninth graders from Palestine and will participate in the program for a duration of three years. During each year, the program will include a two-week summer camp as well as year-long weekly sessions. This year's summer camp included 24 students, (10 from Gaza Strip ) and four CS instructors from Stanford University and a local CS instructor. In two weeks, students learned about the fundamental functions in Python such as drawing objects using Turtle, loops and variables. Students were also provided business and entrepreneurship training from local instructors. \nAbdulmajeed Melhem , General Manger of Jawwal, encourages the program by stating that, \"We always strive to launch initiatives and development programs that contribute to the enrichment of technology and modern software, in order to support this sector in Palestine.\" He further stated, \"All Paltel Group companies are linked closely with the field of information technology and offer modern technology to the public through the Internet and cellular phone services.\" \nSamah Hamad , the General Manager of Paltel Group Foundation further elaborated on the future plans of this program by stating, \"This will help the selected students' enrollment in universities when the time comes. By the end of the three-years, students will not only have gained necessary skills for the next level of their education, but will also be taken on a two-week tour to California to visit some of the known technology companies in the world.\" \nBy the end of Year 1, students should be able to develop a program such as Soduku or a conference call app and develop basic teamwork skills. Year 2, students will learn more advanced technologies, i.e. embedding multimedia in GUI's, building business plans in addition to more skills on entrepreneurship, business and team-work skills. Students will work on a real-world project with web technologies where the teams will be led by mentors to develop a digital solution for an issue impacting Palestinians. \nAbout Paltel Group \nPalestine Telecommunications Company (PalTel Group) is the telecommunications leader in Palestine, which was established in 1997 as a public shareholding company.
