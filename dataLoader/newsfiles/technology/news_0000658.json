The conference is scheduled for Sept. 23-25 at the Austin Convention Center. \nSpiceWorld attendees are invited to visit with CompTIA representatives to learn about the latest trends in career opportunities for IT professionals and the skills employers are looking for. Recent and future innovations and updates to CompTIA's skills certifications portfolio will be featured. Visitors can also take the CompTIA CertMaster Challenge. \nCompTIA CertMaster is a revolutionary new way to learn nd prepare for CompTIA certification exams. It's a test prep companion that gives certification candidates an edge. Built on principles of brain science and game study, CertMaster understands how each individual learns and retains information, helping to speed learning and improve retention. \n\"CertMaster is unique because you start answering questions right away, rather than having to wade through long pages of text or listening to lectures,\" said Thomas Reilly , vice president, CompTIA Learning. \"Asking questions first makes more sense based on how we learn and remember new information.\" \nLearn more about CompTIA CertMaster by watching this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUISIeCRRqs&feature=youtu.be . \nAlso at SpiceWorld Austin 2015, Dr. James Stanger , senior director, product management, CompTIA, is scheduled to speak on \"Persistent Threats, Custom Frameworks-A Practical Guide to Network Security.\" \n\"Hardware and software vendors have offered security solutions for more than 20 years, yet security incidents continue to occur at an alarming rate. Why? Because we tend to think that a specific technology or single approach will resolve our security issues,\" Stanger said. \n\"You need to create and modify a security framework that makes sense for your particular organization,\" he continued. \"It's essential to map the organization's security technology and procedures to its particular information security needs.\" \nStanger will discuss practical solutions to this longstanding problem, including: Designing custom frameworks to detect initial attacks and advanced persistent threats. Mapping technologies to a custom framework. Skills that security professionals – and hiring managers – need to manage security. \nThe presentation is scheduled for 3:45 p.m. (CDT) on Thursday, Sept. 24 . \nTo keep up follow all of CompTIA's activities at SpiceWorld Austin 2015, follow the hashtags #WeLoveITPros and #SpiceWorldAustin. \nThe Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is a non-profit trade association serving as the voice of the information technology industry.
