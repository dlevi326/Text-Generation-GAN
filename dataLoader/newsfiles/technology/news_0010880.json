The world is filled with thousands of pieces of wonderful content that never reach their marketing potential because minimal attention was paid to making them discoverable. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150923/269806 \nThe original version of this blog post appeared on PR Newswire's Beyond PR blog: http://www.prnewswire.com/blog/content-marketing-secret-weapon-is-pr-13784.html . \nIt's not enough to write an eloquent white paper or create an engaging video. If no one sees your content, no one shares it, and no one will be inspired to get a demo of the product it supports. \nSo how can you make sure your content gets noticed? The secret to discoverability is public relations. \nPublic relations is the practice of communicating messages and creating connections. It's about sharing stories. And what better story to share than that of your content? \nA piece of great content is an asset that has value; the sharing of it should be given appropriate attention and care. \nStrong content deserves a strong PR plan. \nNever thought about it that way? Not convinced your content is worthy of a PR campaign? Ask yourself the following question: Is your content marketing as worthy as your last strategic partnership or personnel announcement? \nDon't make the mistake of under-estimating your content. Content connects and content converts. \nContent marketing has real value and is worthy of a well-crafted PR campaign to share those assets. Make your content discoverable by using a multi-channel, synchronized approach of paid, earned and owned media. \nSend a press release: We use this tactic a lot in the marketing department at PR Newswire and it works. There are many different approaches you can take when writing a content press release . \nA release distributed through a newswire service with a link to your content will live on hundreds of websites, driving discoverability. Include a photo or graphic and you'll see even better outcomes. \nBonus: Media pickup of your press release can send positive signals about your content to search engines. \nBlog about it: Write a blog post that doesn't repeat or summarize your content, but touches on the same topic. For instance, if you're promoting an ebook, you could write a blog post that focuses on one specific aspect of the larger topic your ebook is about. Then include clear calls to action that take people to your content. \nOf course, if the content you're promoting is a blog post, this suggestion may not seem like a good fit. In those cases, don't write a blog post about your fantastic blog post, but do create opportunities to reference and link back to it from other blog posts. \nTailor your social media: Promote your content on all your social channels, but customize the messaging to fit the platform. Your Facebook messaging can be a little more relaxed than your LinkedIn message and your Twitter post has to be succinct and include an appropriate hashtag. \nDo include an image with all. We see especially good results when a unique graphic is created with a quote from the content. \nDon't stop at just posting to your brand's social accounts; tap your internal and external advocates to help promote your best content. And remember that social sharing should be used to not only direct readers to your piece of content, but also to cross-promote the aforementioned press releases and blog posts. \nEvery piece of content you produce is an ambassador for your brand. \nTo learn more about PR's impact on your discoverability and how to write a news release that drives engagement and leads, read our white paper Setting the Record Straight: Press Releases that Stand Out in the Digital Age . \nOnce you accept that your content is worthy and treat it as such, others will also. \nAbout PR Newswire PR Newswire ( www.prnewswire.com ) is the premier global provider of multimedia platforms that enable marketers, corporate communicators, sustainability officers, public affairs and investor relations officers to leverage content to engage with all their key audiences.
