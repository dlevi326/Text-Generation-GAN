I was seeing the next great technology platform.\" \nThe first Rift virtual reality headset is on track for release in the first quarter of next year, followed shortly thereafter by the debut of Touch controllers designed to let people reach in and interact with faux worlds. \nAsus, Dell and Alienware will release personal computers with processing and graphics power configured for Rift virtual reality, and bearing a logo to show they are \"Oculus Ready,\" according to vice president of product Nate Mitchell. \nOculus has yet to disclose what it will charge for Rift headsets, but said that Oculus Ready computers coming to market will have prices less than $1,000. \n\"This is a once-in-a-generation moment where we can create something that inspires millions of people... something that will change their lives forever,\" Oculus chief executive Brendan Iribe told the audience.
