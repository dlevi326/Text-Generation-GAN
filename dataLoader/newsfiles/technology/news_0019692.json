Jerry Brown and Senate Democrats abandoned legislation Wednesday that would have mandated a 50 percent cut in petroleum use by 2030, blaming an intensive campaign against the measure by the oil industry.The bill, the latest and most ambitious part of a series of legislation and regulations by the state to significantly curb greenhouse gas emissions over the next 35 years, passed the Democratic-controlled Senate but faced almost certain defeat in the Assembly, where Democrats tend be more moderate and represent economically struggling parts of the state. Opponents had warned that the 50 percent mandate would result in higher fuel and electricity costs; the oil industry, in its advertisements, asserted that it could lead to fuel rationing and bans on sport utility vehicles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:29:40.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
