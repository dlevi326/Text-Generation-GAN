The Obama administration and affected states have committed hundreds of millions of dollars to saving the grouse without Endangered Species Act protections that many argued would threaten the oil and gas industry and agriculture.\nTuesday's announcement signaled that the Obama administration believes it has struck a delicate balance to save the birds from extinction without crippling the West's economy. It also could help defuse a potential political liability for Democrats heading into the 2016 election — federal protections could have brought much more sweeping restrictions on oil and gas drilling, grazing and other human activities from California to the Dakotas.\nThe government was providing some level of habitat protections on 67 million acres of federal lands, including 12 million acres where strict limits on oil and gas limits will be enforced, an aide to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said. That's more than a third of the animal's total range and does not include millions of acres of private land shielded by conservation easements.\n\"It's the most complex, the largest land conservation effort in U.S. history,\" Jewell adviser Sarah Greenberger said. \"This model of science-based, landscape-level conservation is truly the future of conservation.\"\nJewell and the governors of Wyoming , Montana, Colorado and Nevada were to make a formal announcement later in the day at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge just north of Denver.\nEven before that event, elected officials and interest groups offered a mix of praise and condemnation as news of the decision circulated.\nPetroleum industry representatives said measures enacted to prop up the bird's population threaten to choke off oil and gas production. That echoed previous concerns raised by the governors of Montana and Wyoming over federal land-use plans intended to preserve the grouse's shrinking habitat.\nSome conservation groups, including the Environmental Defense Fund and National Audubon Society, said the case demonstrates that cooperation among governments and private interest groups can preserve imperiled species. Other wildlife advocates said loopholes in federal land-use plans would allow too much development.\nGreater sage grouse once numbered in the millions. Over the last century, the bird lost roughly half its habitat to development, livestock grazing and an invasive grass that's encouraging wildfires in the Great Basin of Nevada and adjoining states. An estimated 200,000 to 500,000 birds now occupy sagebrush habitat spanning 11 states.\nTuesday's finding reverses a 2010 determination that the sage grouse were in precipitous decline. Under a federal court settlement with the group WildEarth Guardians, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service faced a Sept. 30 deadline to decide the bird's status.\nErik Molvar with WildEarth Guardians said Interior officials had turned an opportunity to help the grouse into \"an epic conservation failure.\" He said allowing exceptions, modifications and waivers within federal land-use plans means protections could evaporate with the stroke of a pen.\nRepublicans cast the issue as evidence of endangered-species laws run amok. Congress last year voted to block Fish and Wildlife from spending money on efforts to change the bird's legal status.\nHouse Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop said the announcement was a \"cynical ploy\" intended to mask the fact that the Obama administration has imposed limits on development across the West. Bishop was referring to changes in government policies guiding lands controlled by the U.S. Forest Service and Interior's Bureau of Land Management .\n\"Do not be fooled,\" the Utah Republican said in a statement. \"With the stroke of a pen, the Obama administration's oppressive land management plan is the same thing as a listing\" under the Endangered Species Act.\nThe ranking Democrat on the committee, U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, said House Republicans attack Obama when his administration lists a species as endangered and when it decides against a listing, comparing the rhetoric to a game of \"Mad Libs.\"\nThe Obama administration has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into conservation measures in hopes of patching together enough sagebrush habitat to ensure the bird's long-term survival. Federal officials worked with state governments to adopt their own habitat protection plans, which included local restrictions on energy development and setting aside private and public lands as habitat.\nThe administration also is proposing to withdraw mining claims on 10 million acres considered key habitat.\nIn addition, sales of oil and gas leases that were previously deferred on more than 8 million acres will undergo a 90-day review before a final decision is made.\nAt the center of the fracas has been Wyoming, home to roughly 40 percent of the bird's population and a hub of fossil fuel development, with huge potential for wind energy and uranium mines.\nEfforts to avoid protections in Wyoming have resulted in a significant impact: No drilling may take place near vital sage grouse breeding grounds during nesting season. Oil and gas wells in areas deemed as core habitat must be clustered together and directionally drilled from well pads.\nOther states have adopted similar plans.\n———\nGruver reported from Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n  US Rejects Protections for Greater Sage Grouse Across West   \n  \" \nAirline  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T19:41:52.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
