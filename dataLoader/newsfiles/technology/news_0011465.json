The number of employed went from 235,600 to 237,800, and the number of unemployed dropped from 16,600 to 13,000. The civilian labor force went from 252,000 to 251,000. \nZeller says this is the 34th- straight month the state has been behind the nation’s job-growth rate. \nOhio still is 42,800 jobs short from the recession and is 225,100 jobs short from 2000, he said. \nThe lack of jobs has led to a decline in the civilian labor force in the Valley and elsewhere in Ohio. \nThe civilian labor force is the sum of those employed and unemployed. It includes those 16 and older working or looking for work. A drop in the labor force shows that workers have retired and others have left the workforce. \nFrom 2010 to 2015, the Valley’s civilian labor force has dropped by 8.5 percent with Trumbull County’s dropping by the most at 12.1 percent. \nJust in Mahoning County, the jobless rate dropped from 6.4 percent to 5.2 percent. In Trumbull County, the jobless rate was 5.4 percent in August 2015, down from 6.9 percent. And in Columbiana County, the jobless rate went from 6.3 percent down to 4.9 percent. \nOhio’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate reported Friday was 4.7 percent in August, down from 5 percent in July. \nThe U.S. unemployment rate for August was 5.1 percent, down from 5.3 percent in July and 6.1 percent in August 2014.
