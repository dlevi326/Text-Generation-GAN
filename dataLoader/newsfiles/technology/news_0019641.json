Affected employers should have already been tracking employee data for 2015 and will need to issue/file forms for employees and the IRS by the end of January and February 2016, respectively. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150212/175218LOGO \niSolved's human capital management technology has incorporated a number of vigorous features and reports to help customers avoid getting burned by penalties or fines due to insufficient adherence or noncompliance. Employers preparing to comply with the complex ACA requirements will appreciate the intuitive ACA Executive Dashboard, ACA Checkup services and the filing of IRS Forms 1094 and 1095. iSolved has also established a full, online ACA Resource Center where employers can find additional tools and information to assist with ACA compliance. \n\"ACA continues to be a top concern for most employers,\" stated Todd La Fever, President of Technology and Employer Services for iSolved. \"The comprehensive and robust ACA features within iSolved and the optional managed services will help ensure that employers are fully compliant.\" \nGathering all of the data required for the ACA can be daunting.
