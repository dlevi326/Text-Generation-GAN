RELATED Apple's big event is only hours away now. And for all those who want to watch Apple's big launch event of the year where we expect to see the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus for the first time in all its glory, here are the ways you can stream it live. For most Apple users, it'll be simple process of heading to Apple's event web page here. At the most basic, you'll need access to Apple's special HTTP Live Streaming technology, which can be found on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with Safari on iOS 7.0 or later. If you're on a Mac, you'll need Safari 6.0.5 or later on OS X v10.8.5 or later, while streaming on an Apple TV will require a second- or third-gen Apple TV with software 6.2 or later. Interestingly (and somewhat surprisingly), Apple's live streaming tech is now also supported in Microsoft's new Edge browser, which is available on Windows 10. So if you've recently upgraded your PC to Windows 10, you won't need to scramble to find an Apple phone, tablet or computer to catch the live stream, just head to Apple's event page through the Edge browser. The event is scheduled for September 9 at 10.30 pm IST, and as long as you have the above requirements and decent access to the internet, you should be able to watch it live from any where in the world. 7 things Apple may launch at its iPhone event of 8 Eight years after changing the way we use our smartphones, Apple now plans to change the way we use touchscreens with the (widely expected) launch of iPhone 6S and 6S Plus with Force Touch technology. However, the new iPhones will not be the only major product Apple will unveil at tonight's event. Apple has booked the gigantic Bill Graham Civic Auditorium with a seating capacity of 7,000, so the event is pretty huge to the company too, not just for its fans. Wondering what's so special about the event and what new products will be unveiled tonight? Take a look at our list of 7 things Apple is likely to launch at tonight's iPhone event... Apple's new flagship smartphones, iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, will not see an increase in screen size, but will probably change the way we use touchscreens. The new iPhones are expected to come with Force Touch-integrated display panels so that the screen can identify the difference between two types of taps (and maybe even three types). It is also expected that iPhone 6S and 6S Plus will be made of tougher material than previous models, but don't expect a change in design yet. Apple is also said to be launching the two smartphones in a new Rose Gold colour option. iPhone 6S and 6S Plus will run on a faster quad-core chipset, offer 2GB RAM (the current models only have 1GB RAM), and probably have 12MP cameras with optical image stabilization and 4K recording. We may see an incremental increase in battery life too. After rumours going back as long as late 2013, it seems the iPad Pro with a 12.9-inch screen will finally see the light of the day at tonight's event. The big-screen tablet will be positioned as an alternative to a laptop and cost around $1,000. Unlike the current crop of iPhones and iPads, the rumoured iPad Pro is said to come with base storage of 64GB; a 128GB model is also expected, but no 16GB variant. iPad Pro's A9X processor will be a major upgrade over iPad Air 2's A8X chip, according to 9to5Mac. Apple is expected to offer a Force Touch-integrated Bluetooth stylus and a Bluetooth keyboard for iPad Pro, but these will not come bundled with the tablet. On the software side, iPad Pro will be able to show two full-sized iPad apps side-by-side. It is also said to come with optimized versions of Siri and Notification Center interfaces. Apple will reportedly take the covers off iPad Mini 4, which will be a more meaningful upgrade to the tablet series compared to last year's iPad Mini 3. The Apple tablet is not only expected to be thinner than iPad Air 2, but will also support two apps simultaneously in landscape view. Under the hood, iPad Mini 4 is likely to be powered by a faster processor and is rumoured to feature an 8MP primary camera. Apple TV, the set-top box, is expected to become a more mainstream product with this year's launch. The company will likely unveil tonight a slimmer Apple TV model with Siri support, system-wide search capabilities, and a touch-based remote control. Powering all this will be Apple's dual-core A8 processor, which is also under the hood of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It is expected that Apple is planning a full-fledged App Store for the new Apple TV and will also position it as a gaming machine, in which the touch-based remote will act as the controller. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=iPhone 6S Plus,iPhone 6S,Apple,iPhone,iPad  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T18:20:54.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
