By consolidating the multiple systems it previously had in place into a single, comprehensive software platform, Capital Paper will be able to more closely track purchases and inventory levels in real time, provide delivery of fresh and traceable products, and improve the efficiency of their operations. \nWhen Capital Paper acquired Capital Foodservice in 2009, it left the company with multiple, disjointed legacy systems that were ill-equipped to drive efficiencies across the merged business operations. Capital Paper turned to NCR for a single, comprehensive solution to replace its various outdated systems; which in some cases consisted of time-intensive manual processes. With a focus on optimizing perishable inventory management, the NCR Power Enterprise platform facilitates the flow of inventory, as well as the associated labor, equipment and payments through complex supply chain networks. This provides Capital Paper with real-time data insights it can use to provide complete product traceability from farm to fork. \n“We looked at a number of providers in search of a vendor with significant domain experience in perishable inventory who really cared about our business and understood food and foodservice well,” said Jeff Zettler, President, Capital Paper. “NCR’s breadth of solutions and unique focus on food and fast-moving consumer goods distribution made them the ideal partner for us. NCR’s software has allowed us to merge and modernize our systems, create a seamless operation and improve our business analytics while working with a single vendor.” \nDesigned to improve operational efficiency for wholesalers and distributors of all sizes, the NCR Power Enterprise suite optimizes every supply chain transaction. It includes warehouse management, transportation optimization, warehouse and store replenishment, merchandising, and store and customer engagement tools. Key solutions within the suite that were associated with this deal include: Power Warehouse for warehouse operations; Power Analyzer for business analytics; Power Net and Power Sell for customer relationship management; and Power Transportation and Power Delivery for optimized transportation processes. \n“For a company like Capital Paper, it’s critical to have a single view across operations and a system in place that provides all the necessary data insights to make strategic business decisions,” said Todd Michaud, Global Vice President and General Manager, NCR Global Enterprise, Merchandising and Supply Chain (GEMS). “For Capital Paper, that meant replacing multiple outdated systems with a centralized platform that makes it easy to manage everything from the management of their warehouses to the complex logistics of their delivery truck distribution network. We are proud to have worked alongside Capital Paper as a trusted partner to aid them in this journey.” \nAbout NCR Corporation \nNCR Corporation (NYSE: NCR) is the global leader in consumer transaction technologies, turning everyday interactions with businesses into exceptional experiences.
