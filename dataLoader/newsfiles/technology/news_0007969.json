GTL Industry Update: Exclusive Interview Released with Siluria Technologies for Gas to Liquids 2015 SMi Reports (London, UK): Exclusive interview just released with Dr. Erik Scher from Siluria Technologies in the run up to the 18th Annual GTL Conference LONDON, ENGLAND, UNITED KINGDOM, September 9,   In the run up to the Gas to Liquids 2015 conference, the SMi Group asked one of their keynote speakers Dr. Erik C. Scher, Siluria Technologies, a few questions about the company’s vision on the Gas to Liquids Market, and Siluria’s new OCM+ETL technology. The complete interview could be found in the download center at the event website - www.gas-to-liquids.co.uk Dr. Erik Scher, Executive Vice President - Research & Development, Intellectual Property will be giving a keynote address entitled: “Building With Natural Gas” at the 18th annual Gas to Liquids Conference, taking place in London on the 12th and 13th of October 2015. In his unique presentation Dr. Scher will discuss: • Direct methane to ethylene enables a novel route to chemicals and fuels from natural gas • Siluria’s proprietary technology facilitates low capital intensities with standard and modular equipment • Compatibility with existing energy infrastructure creates unique capital and operational synergies When asked what he thought the future of the GTL industry look like? Dr Scher said: “We think that a lot of the technologies broadly grouped into “GTL” have a role to play in adding value to natural gas. There are so many segments and market opportunities, that there is room for many different technologies to be used. We feel that trying to commercialize by adding value to existing assets creates a situation where rapid adoption can take place and both the technology provider and the asset owner can capture the value created. Some of the larger markets like large stranded gas plays in parts of Africa or the Middle East, or more challenging (both economically and technically) plays like offshore flared gas will take longer to adopt new technologies but will eventually occur as we globally seek to better use the carbon that we have.” SMi also asked how he expects the industry to grow in the coming decade, he commented: “We expect that parts of the GTL industry will perform very well over the next decade. Those companies with a technology and a business model that adapt to the economic environment will build strong businesses that provide value to their investors and their partners. As we have seen, one of the largest barriers to entry has been the large capital and new infrastructure required for some GTL technologies. Our approach to avoiding this problem is to integrate with existing plants and to share the value created with the asset owners. We feel that our technology uniquely enables this approach for the midstream industry and can then be applied to other integration opportunities.” To read the full interview visit the download centre Confirmed attendees for GTL 2015 include: Servon Nigeria, Repsol, Velocys, Intrepid GTL, Gas ConTec GmbH, The Hong Kong and China Gas Co. Ltd., Renaissance Heavy Industries, Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions Germany GmbH, Ventech Engineers International LLC, FFTechnology, Haynes and Boone LLP, JX Nippon Research Institute and many more… Benefits of Attending Include: • Learn about the latest technological developments in small scale GTL • Hear from leading experts in the field on long term trends and drivers • Discuss the effect of the oil price margin on the GTL industry • Understand what makes projects fail and risk mitigation strategies • Join topical panel discussions on the economic and commercial viability of GTL • Assess the locational aspects of GTL including where, why and when it works • Debate the benefits of GTL versus other gas monetisation options In addition to the conference, the event will feature an interactive half-day post-conference workshop entitled: ‘How Viable Are GTL Opportunities in Today's Energy Price World?’ which will be hosted by Alex Forbes, Director, Forbes Communications Delegate information: contact Andrew Gibbons +44 (0) 207 827 6156, agibbons@smi-online.co.uk Contact for media-partners: Julia Rotar, jrotar@smi-online.co.uk END", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T03:39:30.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
