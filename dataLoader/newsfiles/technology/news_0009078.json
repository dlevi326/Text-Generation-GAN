Brady’s R-4700 thermal transfer ribbon and UltraTemp™ series of high heat label materials were tested against the harsh chemicals, extreme temperatures and high pressures of both inline and batch wash processes. “Brady has been developing polyimide label materials and ribbons to align with the evolving needs of the printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing industry,” says Jennifer Smith, product marketing manager at Brady. “By printing our supplies on a thermal transfer printer, label making becomes more efficient and labels more reliable. To prove the durability of these labels, we worked with ZESTRON and Speedline to put our label materials to the test against the high pressures, strong chemicals and extreme heat of circuit board wash processes.”\nRibbon and label materials were tested by Speedline with:\n 15% cleaning agent concentrate 150 degree Fahrenheit wash temperatures Inline wash exposure for 2.6 minutes Batch wash cycle for 15 minutes Hot circulating air drying Inline rising at 140 degrees Fahrenheit and 80/60 psi spray pressure Batch rinsing at room temperature and 60 psi spray pressure\nBrady’s R-4700 ribbon and Brady’s UltraTemp matte finished polyimide materials (B-719, B-728 or B-729) passed all of the tests without a reflow process, lasting up to four passes. This ribbon is based on a resin formulation which offers the end user a high performance image, with excellent solvent, smear and high heat resistance. It is available in various sizes to be used in Brady’s benchtop thermal transfer printers and is UL Recognized on various Brady labels.\nFor more information:\nFor Brady’s complete product offering, visit BradyID.com .\nAbout Brady Corporation:\nBrady Corporation is an international manufacturer and marketer of complete solutions that identify and protect people, products and places.
