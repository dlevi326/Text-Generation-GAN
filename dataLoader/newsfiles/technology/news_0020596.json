The Cozmo 2.0 is crafted in San Francisco and is available exclusively from the WaterField Designs' online store.\nSan Francisco, CA\nWaterField Designs , an innovative leader in custom laptop sleeves, bags and cases for digital-minded professionals, announces the Cozmo 2.0: an elegant, all-leather laptop briefcase . Thoughtfully designed details enhance the Cozmo’s functionality and comfort for professionals—from the padded laptop sleeve compartment and rolling suitcase slot to the off-set, ergonomically-friendly shoulder strap. An impeccably-crafted business attaché , the full-grain leather Cozmo 2.0 stands up on its own and stands out in a crowd.\n“We wanted to make the IDEAL business briefcase , and I think we’ve come really close,” explained owner Gary Waterfield. \"The Cozmo fits right in to any formal business setting. We chose distressed leather to give it a worldly look. The padded laptop compartment cradles a computer and leaves plenty of room for more gear. Carry it with super-comfortable leather handles or use the off-set shoulder strap that makes the bag feel weightless.”\nThe Cozmo 2.0 demonstrates WaterField’s commitment to artisanal American craftsmanship . Every stitch is precise. Each bag is sewn from the same leather hide to insure consistency in tone and texture. To reduce weight, the premium full-grain leather is then meticulously split and skived to within one millimeter accuracy. The leather pieces are carefully cut and sewn in our San Francisco studio to avoid any un-necessary holes. Our highly trained leather workers ensure that every Cozmo meets our American-Made quality standards.\nThe Cozmo 2.0 looks compact yet includes ample interior space. Wider at the bottom, it tapers at the top for a slender look. A sewn-in plastic bottom plate gives it structure to stand on its own. The main compartment opens wide with two sleek waterproof zippers and includes a built-in padded laptop sleeve. A gold liner brightens the main compartment as if someone “turned a light on” inside. Two internal hanging pockets aid organization, and a key tether keeps keys or a pouch at hand in a hurry. A deep outside front pocket secures shut with a leather tab and classic metal screw stud.\nBusiness travelers will appreciate the strip at the rear of the Cozmo that slides onto a rolling suitcase handle for convenient, hands-free carrying at airports. For every-day use, soft and comfortable dual-leather handles allow for a briefcase-style carry and an offset, removable shoulder strap creates a weightless feel and lets users alternatively carry the bag messenger-style.\nAvailability & Pricing\nPrice: Compact—$369.
