The company is making a portion of its content available for offline playback – meaning you can download certain movies and TV shows in order to watch them without an internet connection. \nThis feature has been available on Fire devices for some time, but today Amazon is giving it to iOS and Android users. \n“There’s no doubt that the way people watch entertainment is changing—anytime, anywhere viewing is important and we are excited to provide our Prime members with offline viewing capabilities on iOS and Android platforms starting today,” stated Michael Paull, Vice President of Digital Video at Amazon. “We are proud to be the first and only online subscription streaming service that enables offline viewing—on vacation, in a car, at the beach, on a plane, wherever our Prime members want to watch they can, regardless of internet connection.” \nAmazon makes a point to mention that Netflix does not offer this – and they’re absolutely correct. Amazon’s streaming service has certainly bested Netflix with this feature. \nOf course, not everything is available for offline playback. Amazon originals like Bosch , Transparent , and Mozart in the Jungle are – as you’d expect – as are popular series like Hannibal, Downton Abbey, 24, Justified , and Orphan Black . \nYou’ll need to download the updated Amazon Video app for iOS or Android, which now includes the Prime Video downloads. \nI’m taking a trip soon, and it looks like I’ll be watching Orphan Black on the plane. Can’t say the same for Narcos .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:12:39.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
