Featuring an impressive array of trees, the Ozarks enable you to take in an abundance of colors. The area’s Red Oaks’ and White Oaks’ leaves yield vivid oranges and deep reds. The Blackgum tree complements with brilliant scarlet leaves, while the Sycamore contributes stunning yellow and orange to the picture. The Hickory trees’ leaves turn a magnificent yellow, and the scenic red, orange, purple and yellow leaves of the Sweetgum tree add to the mix. Blend in the reddish-purple leaves of the Dogwood, and the bright reds and oranges of the Sugar Maples, and you’re in for a real treat.\nA very nice way to experience the season is by taking advantage of the special “Fall Foliage BOGO50 Promotion” that is available at the AAA Four-Diamond Chateau on the Lake Resort & Spa, which is situated on a beautiful Ozark mountaintop overlooking Southwest Missouri’s picturesque and pristine Table Rock Lake.\nAvailable for stays Sunday-Thursday through October 29, 2015, the offer enables you to stay for three nights with the first night at the regular rate and the second and third nights at 50% off, in a newly renovated guest room at the beautiful mountaintop resort. The offer also includes free basic in-room Internet, free indoor and outdoor parking, and two coupons for one scoop of ice cream at the resort’s Sweet Shoppe. Add to this the resort’s convenient location just minutes from the many popular attractions and shows of Branson, and it is a very appealing offer.\nVisiting in the fall also provides the opportunity to experience Silver Dollar City’s National Harvest & Cowboy Festival, being held Wednesdays-Sundays through October 31, 2015.
