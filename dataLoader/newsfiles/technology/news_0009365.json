This was a hybrid migration from Windows Server 2003 to Microsoft Office 365.\n“We were looking to migrate our systems from Windows Server 2003 to Office 365, but lacked the hardware infrastructure and staff to make it a smooth transition,” Danny Dugan, CIO of La Clinica, explained. “CORE stepped in as a workforce supplementation and consulting partner to help us with this move, and they delivered in a big way.”\nThe migration started in February 2015, was finished in July 2015, a full month ahead of schedule, and was delivered under budget with zero effect felt by La Clinica customers. Over four hundred and fifty users were a part of this migration.\n“This was a great collaborative effort between us and La Clinica to make this transition go as smoothly as possible,” said Scott Anderson, President and CEO of CORE Business Services. “HIPAA compliance was a main concern, and we needed to maintain that status for La Clinica and their customers while going through this intricate migration process.”\nMicrosoft Office 365 provides La Clinica with data loss protection, the ability to encrypt emails, and a BAA (business associates agreement) through Microsoft, allowing peace of mind for La Clinica and their customers.\nAbout CORE Business Services\nCORE Business Services provides fixed fee technology services such as network management services, back up and disaster recovery, cloud computing, enterprise project implementation, ShoreTel VoIP phone systems, managed print services and more. CORE has offices in Portland and Medford, Oregon and Denver, Colorado.
