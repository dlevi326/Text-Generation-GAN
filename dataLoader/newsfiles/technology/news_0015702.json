They have been able to counter this danger to some extent by hiring Saudis especially women in administrative jobs and binding accounting and marketing departments. \nInvestors said that they cannot find many trained Saudis for the sector because of lack of training institutions. Students do not want to study at the training facilities in Riyadh and Jeddah they said. \nInvestors said the introduction of digital technology in the sector would be costly but eventually ensure higher quality and production. \nAbdulaziz Al-Ghamdi chairman of the committee said Saudis do not want to work in the sector because they do not find it attractive. In addition businesses pay low salaries of about SR3000 a month. The sector did establish a training facility but Saudis did not turn up for training he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T09:46:34.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
