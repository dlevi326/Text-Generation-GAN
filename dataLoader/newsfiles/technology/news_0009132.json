GlocalMe is a safe, personal Wi-Fi and charging gadget that is contract-free and operates on a pay as you go system.\nWith GlocalMe , users can switch among mobile networks in over 100 countries. Networks are secure and private to protect information from hackers. GlocalMe is set to become a big hit among the public, as it combines convenience, safety and affordability into one device.\nThe telecom industry has kept prices high while providing minimum service due to a lack of competition and barriers that prevent new players from entering into the market. High roaming costs often cause people to be disconnected with traveling. While visiting new locations is exciting, losing access to technology can be potentially dangerous. GlocalMe G2 is able to keep costs low with its advanced cloud SIM technology and a system that does not require expensive infrastructure. The Wi-Fi hotspot device is created as a way for travelers to conveniently and affordably stay connected on the go.\nSome travelers choose to use 3G hotspots on the go, but hotspots are a hit or a miss. Sometimes they work, but sometimes they don't. GlocalMe G2 provides 3G and 4G services from the best possible networks to ensure consistency, without charging roaming fees. G2 allows users to manage data with efficiency, no matter what device they use.\nOne of the most popular features of GlocalMe G2 is its ability to support up to five devices all at the same time. Individuals and groups can use GlocalMe alike. Additionally, GlocalMe has created a mobile application that allows users to purchase data and check their balance on the go to simplify the process of paying bills. GlocalMe users will have the flexibility to use whatever network and devices they would like, unlike other products on the market that limit usage to specific models.\nWith one day left in the Kickstarter campaign, GlocalMe has now raised eight times the initial funding goal of $20,000.\nCONTACT: Effie Sun, +86-139-2849-8831, This email address is being protected from spambots.
