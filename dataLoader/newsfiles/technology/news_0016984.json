Photo: AFP \nThe first version of Microsoft's Office suite developed specifically for Windows 10 is just days from landing on the PC desktop. \nAs well as being optimized for the latest version of Microsoft's operating system, the new update will bring some smart features, such as real-time co-authoring and much better integration with the cloud. \nAlthough services such as Evernote and Google Drive are beginning to get to a point where they're good enough for many consumers' needs, Office is still the best package out there for spread sheets, fully compatible presentations and of course word processing. \nSo, if you already have an Office 365 Personal or Office 365 Home subscription, from September 22 you'll be able to start downloading individual apps while automatic updates will start popping up on the desktop from October.
