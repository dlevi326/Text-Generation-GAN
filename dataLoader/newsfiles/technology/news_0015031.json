Sept. 9-11 . \nCarolyn April , senior director for industry analysis, is scheduled to speak on \"Trends in Managed Services\" as part of the business education track at the MAX 2015 Conference. Her session is scheduled for 4 p.m. (EDT) on Wednesday, Sept. 9 . \nApril's presentation will focus on the customer thought process and how managed services providers (MSPs) can use this information to influence a potential buyer's decision. \n\"Many factors beyond cost savings enter into the customer's decision-making process before they sign a managed services contract,\" April noted. \"Some compaies view managed IT services as a way to improve efficiency within their IT operations. For others it's a desire to access the latest technologies without making a huge capital outlay. It's critical for MSPs to understand the unique needs of each customer and to tailor their business pitch accordingly.\" \nApril will share data from the latest CompTIA research on the managed services market, which found that many organizations use an MSP to manage specific IT functions – outsourced email or help desk duties, for example – while internal staff keeps responsibility for other IT functions. \n\"This isn't necessarily bad news for MSPs,\" April said. \"It simply indicates that the market opportunity is still wide open to scale additional services to existing customers alongside the chase for new clients.\" \nComplete presentation slides will be posted on CompTIA's SlideShare account ( http://www.slideshare.net/comptia ) at the conclusion of the live program. \nNow in its fifth year, MAX 2015 brings together the world's largest community of over 12,000 MSPs and IT service providers. This year's conference is scheduled for Sept. 9-11 at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Washington, D.C. \nAbout CompTIA The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is a non-profit trade association serving as the voice of the information technology industry.
