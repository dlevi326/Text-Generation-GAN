A group of design students in Estonia have strategically placed three massive loudspeakers in the heart of a remote woodland in late September to amplify its murmurs \n\"We placed the three megaphones at such a distance and at a suitable angle, so at the centre of the installation, sound feeds from all three directions,\" he told AFP of the whopping megaphones, measuring three metres (yards) in diameter. \nCulture rooted in nature \nForests blanket 51 percent of Estonia, a tiny Baltic state of 1.3 million people that is renown for its IT savvy after giving the world Skype, e-voting, e-residency and, most recently, TransferWise. \nSurveys suggest that Estonia is one of the world's least religious countries—a 2005 Eurobarometer poll found just 16 percent believe in God—but many here profess a deep and abiding love of nature, particularly forests. \nEstonian author Valdur Mikita describes the project as a \"slightly exaggerated meeting of nature and culture.\" \nThe Estonian Art Academy's design quest for a \"forest library\" was originally inspired by his book entitled \"The Linguistic Forest\". \nAn Estonian bestseller, it explores in an ecstatic and playful way the deep connection of nature and culture by revealing how the Estonian language is rooted in nature. \n\"I have a theory that the exceptional number of talented composers in Estonia is the result of the special sense of hearing that originates from living in the forest,\" he told AFP, evoking artists like Arvo Part, the world's most performed living composer. Whimsically dubbed \"Mother Nature's megaphone\" by hikers, the installation is made of simple materials like wood and nails, but mimicking nature, its design is both hi-tech and geared to creature comfort \nLike nature, music is key to Estonian identity. Here, conductors are celebrated like rock stars at massive song festivals where up to 30,000 singers perform together on an outdoor stage. \nCosmic forest \nWhimsically dubbed \"Mother Nature's megaphone\" by hikers, the installation is made of simple materials like wood and nails, but mimicking nature, its design is both hi-tech and geared to creature comfort. \n\"Materials-wise the installation is made of larch and the boarding is cut at the correct angle to amplify the (sound) focussing effect even more,\" says Tallinn-based architect Aet Ader, who mentored students involved in the project. The installation is made of simple materials like wood and nails, but mimicking nature, its design is both hi-tech and geared to creature comfort \n\"We did have to consult an acoustics engineer to get it right. \n\"You can sit down comfortably in each of the megaphones. Their sides offer support for your back... and frame the sky on one side and moss and blueberries on the other,\" she told AFP. \n\"It's an extremely symbolic reference to the sense of hearing and to the process of listening ... it might be enough to inspire people to listen to the cosmos of the forest .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:05:25.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
