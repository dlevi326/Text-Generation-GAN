(NYSE:ARW) announced today the approval by the company’s Board of Directors of the repurchase of up to an additional $400 million of common stock through a share repurchase program. The company has spent approximately $1.4 billion on share repurchases since the beginning of 2010. \n“Arrow’s capital allocation priorities continue to be organic investments that accelerate our growth, accretive acquisitions that expand our capabilities and reach, and the return of excess cash to our shareholders,\" said Michael J. Long, chairman, president, and chief executive officer. “Our company’s growth and the effective management of our balance sheet enabled the Board of Directors to increase the size of this authorization compared to prior authorizations.” \nThis action will permit the company to continue repurchasing shares of its common stock as market and business conditions warrant. The program can be terminated at any time. The company may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases under the program.
