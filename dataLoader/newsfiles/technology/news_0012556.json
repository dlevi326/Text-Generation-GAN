Inspired by our creative heritage, Analysis Workspace changes how data is organized and visualized within an organization. Analysts are now able to manipulate views of data to create polished analyses that they can then curate out to those who need actionable data to make business decisions. Helping deliver insight and drive action users of Analysis Workspace can express their “analytics creativity” without boundaries as they examine data. Simple, Photoshop-inspired workflows: In our new Analysis Workspace, we made it simple and quick for users to create and share useful reports. Inspired by our legacy creative tools like Photoshop and Elements, they simply drag and drop dimensions, metrics and segments into a flexible data “canvas.” Manipulating complex data sets and sharing “curated” workspaces becomes highly instinctual, without the need for extensive training. Intuitive data visualizations : Seeing data in easily understandable and simple visuals (of the user’s choosing) is as important as building the workspaces.Whether it’s a bar graph or a donut chart,visualization is a key part of the analysis and reporting process, allowing users to quickly interpret the information.Leaning on our creative heritage, new data is visualized instantly following a simple drag-and-drop of the relevant components. Data sets large and small can instantly be rendered and easily manipulated, allowing for interactive resizing, renaming and swapping between different chart and graph types. Unprecedented power, flexibility and speed: Analysis Workspace allows users to compare and dissect data in ways not previously possible. For the first time, it includes powerful industry-leading tools such as Anomaly Detection, Contribution Analysis, Calculated Metrics and a new Cohort Analysis tool .Leveraging our experience with tools for creatives, we make the complex simple with our new tools, creating an understanding of data sets that encompass hundreds of dimensions and metrics, thousands of segments and millions of data combinations. \n“Our unique legacy with creative tools and powerful workflows allowed us to re-imagine data analysis in a way nobody else could,” said Jeff Allen, senior director, Product Marketing, Adobe Analytics. “This industry-first approach makes highly complex data sets accessible to a much broader group of people within an organization. The paint is still wet on the thoughtful new insights they deliver, so the recipients can easily manipulate it further if desired.” \nFor more details, see the blog post and demo video for more information. \nAbout Adobe Systems Incorporated \nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.
