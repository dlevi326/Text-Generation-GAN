Apps were infected after software developers used compromised versions of Apple’s developer tool kit, the researcher said in a report posted on its website.\nA total of 39 apps using Apple’s iOS software -- including WeChat and that from ride-hailing service Didi Kuaidi Joint Co.-- were infected, potentially affecting hundreds of millions of users, Palo Alto Networks said. The malware is capable of prompting fake alerts to phish for user credentials, infect other apps using iOS and read users’ passwords.\n“We believe XcodeGhost is a very harmful and dangerous malware that has bypassed Apple’s code review and made unprecedented attacks on the iOS ecosystem,” Palo Alto Networks said in the report . “The techniques used in this attack could be adopted by criminal and espionage focused groups to gain access to iOS devices.”\nXcodeGhost already has conducted phishing attacks that prompt dialogue boxes asking victims to input passwords to Apple’s iCloud, the report said.\nTencent said the flaw only affected WeChat version 6.2.5 for iOS, and new versions of 6.2.6 or later won’t be affected. Based on a preliminary investigation, the malware hasn’t caused any theft of users’ information from WeChat, Tencent said.\nDidi Kuaidi didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.\nThe security breach previously was reported by the Wall Street Journal.", "external_links": ["http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/update-xcodeghost-attacker-can-phish-passwords-and-open-urls-though-infected-apps/\\", "http://blog.wechat.com/2015/09/19/fixed-security-flaw-in-wechat-v6-2-5-for-ios/\\"], "published": "2015-09-21T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T06:55:19.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
