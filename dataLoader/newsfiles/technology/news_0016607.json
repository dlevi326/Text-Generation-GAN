The news comes shortly after Alexandra Wrage, the President and Founder of anti-bribery compliance expert Trace, warned that shipping has become the most corrupt industry in the world .\nWrage stated: “In many ways, the shipping industry is exposed to more levels of corruption than any other industry, as it is a global industry that does not have a mature anti-corruption compliance culture.”\nAccording to The Guardian , London-based Trader Luis Nobre allegedly tricked Allseas by pretending to be a well-connected international financier in order to funnel money out of the Dutch company in 2011.\nIt has been claimed Nobre ensured Allseas they would receive billions working with him and his associates.\nBarclays sounded an alarm after growing suspicious of multimillion pound transactions.\nOpening the case at Southwark Crown Court in London, Prosecutor David Durose told the jury: “Allseas were seeking to raise capital in order to fund the building of a new ship and had available the enormous sum of €100m ($111) to invest.\n“Ultimately it is clear that the individuals who ended up advising them were not the international financiers that Allseas thought they were.”\nIt is alleged that Nobre was a member of a gang of conmen led by Marek Rejniak, a criminal presently on the run.\nThe trial continues.\nRead how China is combatting mass corruption in shipping", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:08:35.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
