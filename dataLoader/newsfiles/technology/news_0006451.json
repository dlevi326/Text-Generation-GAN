Piezo actuators are based on solid-state motion effects and are used in applications that require any or all of the following attributes: high speed, high force, and virtually unlimited resolution.\nTubular Stacks vs. Piezo Tubes\nTubular stacks combine the advantages of stack actuators with the versatility of piezo tubes. Stacks are significantly more robust than tubes and provide much higher stiffness and forces as well as longer travel ranges. P-080 stacks come in displacement ranges of 5, 11 and 25 microns with up to 850N blocking force.\nWho’s Sensitive?\nConventional, polymer-insulated piezo actuators are sensitive to environmental conditions, especially humidity and temperature. Based on a patented, ceramic-encapsulation process developed by PI’s piezo division PI Ceramic, PICMA® multilayer piezo stack actuators are significantly more durable and reliable. PI’s actuators are a manufactured in a cofiring process as monolithic blocks that can be combined to achieve longer displacement range.\nWelcome to the Family\nThe P-080 joins a large family of piezo actuators including miniature chip actuators (2x2x2mm) and high-force actuators providing several 1000lbs of force. As a multilayer stack actuator, the through-hole of the P-080 is ideal for preloading or as aperture for optical applications. Microsecond response, sub-nanometer resolution and the low operating voltage, along with minimal power consumption while holding the position, make the P-080 ideal for many precision motion tasks in optics, semiconductors, photonics, and precision engineering applications.\nWatch Video Animation https://www.youtube.com/embed/OPwIKWSiwVU?rel=0\nProven Reliability on Mars Rover 100 billion successful cycles, no failure\nHaving passed extensive NASA performance qualifications and testing, PI’s actuators are used in the sample analysis system of the CheMin instrument in the Mars rover Curiosity. “Quality awareness and careful process monitoring from powder to dispatch really do pay off”, says Dr. Karl Spanner, CEO of PI, Karlsruhe, Germany. “We ourselves have been using the PI Ceramic PICMA® multilayer actuators for more than ten years in our piezo nanopositioning systems.”\nRead More About PICMA Actuators in Space and Industrial Applications http://www.pi-usa.us/blog/reliable-piezo-motion-devices/\nSpecifications, Datasheet, More Information http://www.pi-usa.us/products/PiezoActuators/index.php#P-080\nApplications of PICMA Actuators\nApplications range from semiconductor test & inspection to super-resolution microscopy, bio-nanotechnology, life sciences, and astronomy/aerospace technology.\nFeatures & Advantages\nStiffness up to 145 N/µm Travels range 5.5 µm to 25 µm Operating voltage range -20 to 100 V Operating temperature range -40 to 150 °C\nUSA / Canada\nhttp://www.pi-usa.us | info(at)pi-usa(dot)us\nEast\n(508) 832-3456\nMidwest\n(508) 832-3456\nWest\n(949) 679-9191 (LA Area & Mexico)\n(408) 533-0973 (Silicon Valley/Bay Area)\nAbout PI\nPI is a leading manufacturer of precision motion control equipment, piezo motors, air bearing stages and hexapod parallel-kinematics for semiconductor applications, photonics, bio-nano-technology and medical engineering.
