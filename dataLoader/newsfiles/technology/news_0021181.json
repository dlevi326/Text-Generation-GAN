This year, an open-source software development team Open Bionics has received notoriety for its development of a 3D-printed prosthetic hand. Unlike many current offerings in the prosthetics industry, the team has solved many financial and timing issues that face consumers in the market today. \n\n\nWith an estimated 11 million amputees worldwide, designers and engineers look to innovations in technology to create more accessible and affordable ways to get prosthetics to those in need. The team behind Open Bionics did just that, while retaining the high-end functionality that has come to define modern prosthetics. \nBeginning with a 3D-scan for a completely customized fit, the team is able to build a custom fit socket within days—a process that typically takes up to several weeks. From there, a four-piece base is fashioned—in the likeness of the human skeleton—to grip, shake and pick up items, sensing the user’s muscular movements through sensors that work off of myoelectric signals. A final skin-like coating covers the skeleton and allows users to customize the appearance. \nThe device itself uses sensors that monitor when the hand comes in contact with an object. This allows the hand to determine pressure needed for gripping items and gives the user the dexterity to handle an egg. \nThe initiative started as an Indiegogo campaign two years ago and has since grown under the mentorship of Walt Disney’s Techstars Accelerator program . Joel Gibbard of Open Bionics is r eportedly looking to start selling the prosthetic hand by next year, though long-term plans to extend the range of prosthetics are already in the mix. \nThe addition of the affordable prosthetic will impact the market but more importantly the lives of amputees. Current prosthetics can cost upward of $50,000, a cost largely prohibitive for children amputees in need of frequent resizes so the $3,000 offering is sure to disrupt. \nAs the conversation around prosthetics continues to permeate popular culture—taking a step outside of science and into the worlds of sports and fashion —personal technology takes on an entire new meaning. With big name brands joining the cause, the average consumer will see the byproducts of these advancements influence industries from athletic wear to gaming, so we can all get a good grip on the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:45:51.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
