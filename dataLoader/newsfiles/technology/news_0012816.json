The primary point I hope we drove home is the export of e-waste from developed to developing countries is still going on and is a significant problem that has no place in the sustainable lifecycle of electronics. We’re pleased we were able to have this important discussion with such influential thought leaders as Elizabeth, David and Aaron. ERI has been a longtime e-steward, leading by example when it comes to the issue of responsible recycling.” \n“We are extremely proud to be among the first e-Stewards in our industry and to have our own Aaron Blum sitting alongside Jim, Elizabeth and David for this vital discussion,” said John Shegerian, Chairman and CEO of ERI. “We strongly support BAN’s certified, third-party audited program, and proudly display our e-Steward Certification documents at each of our locations. Exporting toxic e-waste abroad is simply not an ethical or responsible option. Thank you to the Green Electronics Council for providing such a substantial forum for us to broadcast this message loud and clear.” \nThe Emerging Green Conference is the premier gathering of technology leaders to discuss the advances, challenges and future of sustainable electronics. Throughout the week, experts and thought leaders focus on the unique hurdles and opportunities electronics pose. Emerging Green addresses the full spectrum of the electronics lifecycle, from material selection and supply chain social issues to closing the loop and emerging technologies. \nFor more information on general recycling needs, visit www.electronicrecyclers.com , www.Recyclenation.com , http://greenisgoodradio.com or www.urbanmining.org . \nElectronic Recyclers International (ERI), the nation’s leading recycler of electronic waste and the world's largest cybersecurity-focused hardware destruction company, is e-Stewards and R2 certified to de-manufacture and recycle every type of electronic waste in an environmentally friendly manner.
