Network with the nation's top CRE dealmakers at RealShare APARTMENTS in Los Angeles on Oct 21-22, RealShare INDUSTRIAL in Atlanta on Nov 3-4, RealShare NEW LEASE WEST in Los Angeles on Nov 11-12 and \nNEW YORK More than half of property owners, brokers, and investors recognize that advancing technologies expose retail and office space to risks of obsolescence, but the benefits of technology outweigh the negatives, according to a new study produced by GlobeSt.com with GlobeSt.com Thought Leader . \nShifting demographics have always affected real estate, but the signifi­cance and speed of technological change is dramatically changing real estate at an unprecedented rate, says Joe Derhake, PE , \nThe study, PARADIGM SHIFT: Technologys Impact on CRE , is available for free download from . You can also listen to a replay of Partners recent webinar on the results of the survey. \nDespite the identification of building obsolescence as a risk, survey participants overwhelmingly believe that technology will be a value creator. Three quarters of the respondents see mobile technologies, mastery of big data, and ubiquitous interconnectivity are likely to transform the commercial real estate industry, improving data collection, analysis, and sharing for all stakeholders. \nIn a world of complex capital stacks and regulated lenders, a lot of stakeholders need to see data, says Bill Tryon , director of strategic development, Partner. Tools like SiteLy allow for greater sharing and transparency during due diligence and beyond. Some two-fifths of the participants in the survey say collaboration tools will change the way sales, leases, and acquisitions are completed. \nOnline marketplace platforms, crowd-investing, and workflow tools are removing friction, broadening access, and creating efficiencies around real estate transactions and ownership. No wonder so many venture capitalists and private equity ­firms are injecting capital into such RE tech, says Rob Barber RealtyTrac. \nClose to half of the surveys respondents cited wireless technology as one of the most critical value-add opportunities in commercial real estate. About a fifth of survey respondents also see how new demands for digital medicine will determine the requirements for healthcare facilities in the future. \nTechnological advancements of telemedicine, home monitoring, virtual labs, and so many more will have a profound impact on the way we view and use traditional healthcare facilities resulting in better outcomes, says Charles S. Maggio, AIA, ASHE, NCARB , managing director, Northeast, Healthcare, . The real estate industry will need to start rethinking the design and construction of new healthcare facilities and the creative adaptive reuse of existing ones accordingly. \nA quarter of those polled believe that obsolete buildings can be put to different, possibly higher, uses through targeted upgrades or adaptive reuse projects. \nObsolete buildings create opportunities for adaptive reuse. Repurposed buildings with character and creative use of space can be highly marketable, but the due diligence needed to confidently take on and successfully complete one of these projects is drastically different, says Partner division president Ralph Orlando, PE to get a complete picture. \nWhen it comes to adding value to assets, energy optimization is seen as the greatest benefit that technology will deliver to the industry. Respondents recognize that better-operated buildings will yield higher returns, and that investing in technologies to improve energy efficiency has the potential to significantly increase the marketability and value of commercial real estate assets. \nContinuous energy commissioning, persistent building optimization, and real time utility benchmarking are some of the most signifi­cant value-add opportunities facilitated by technological developments in the CRE space, says Tony Liou , president, Partner Energy. In recent years, more and more of our clients who own and manage real estate portfolios consider energy efficiency and sustainability an integral part of their real estate investment strategy. Many have quoted positive returns and increased asset value, the need to attract institutional capital, and environmental concerns as motivating factors for this shift. \nMore than half of respondents believe that such energy improvements will come from retrofitting HVAC systems and adding more efficient LED lights and control technologies. Survey respondents also see building automation as a key driver of ROI. Participants expect a fairly rapid, 3 to 4-year payback on investments in energy optimization improvements. As a result, the vast majority of respondents cited energy efficiency and renewable energy when asked about the most promising technology investment. \nAchieving energy ef­ficiency is a high priority for most building owners and managers but the task may seem daunting when initially considering all of the elements involved. Starting with low-cost, quick-return measures can provide the motivation to undertake more complex, higher-return endeavors, says Clare Broderick, PE , principal, \nPartner Engineering and Science, Inc. is a full-service engineering, environmental and energy consulting and design firm completing projects nationwide.
