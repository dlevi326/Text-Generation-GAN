A survey found that more than a third of smartphone owners look at their device more than 25 times a day, while a sixth check it more than 50 times each day.\nFor one in 10 people, reaching for their smartphone as soon as they wake up is part of their daily routine.\nDeloitte, which carried out the research, says the extent of smartphone usage shows that it is one of the best-value devices that people can own.\nThe firm's head of technology, Paul Lee, said: \"The modern, touchscreen-based smartphone is less than a decade old, but it is more intertwined with our lives than ever.\n\"Constant technological improvements are allowing us to delegate more and more tasks to our phones, from ordering taxis to browsing catalogues and paying for a meal.\n\"The frequency of consumers glancing at their smartphones arguably makes it one of the best value devices available.\n\"For the sixth of smartphone owners who look at their devices 50 times or more a day, the cost per glance is less than two pence a day for a Â£700 handset kept for two years. And that's before allowing for trade-in value.\"\nThe iconic iPhone, which helped popularise the smartphone, launched on 29 June 2007.\nYet in less than nine years the smartphone has become an essential bit of kit for the 40 million UK adults who own one.\nAs expected, usage intensity is higher for younger age groups.\nSome 80% of young people use their devices on public transport and 43% while eating at a restaurant.\nA fifth of 18 to 24 year-olds admit to checking their phones when crossing the road.\nThey also check their phones around 52 times each day, compared to 12 times a day for those aged over 55.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:33:26.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
