Hydraulic power units, cylinders, valves and pumps \nParker's expertise extends to the core motion technology of hydraulics. \nThe company has market-leading power-dense systems and products that improve industrial and mobile machinery performance. \nA sample of these products includes accumulators, electro hydraulic valves, hydraulic power units (HPUs), gear pumps and motors, hydraulic cylinders and valves, and hydraulic pumps and motors, as well as air-cooled and water-cooled oil coolers, and reservoir isolators. Instrumentation solutions to increase accuracy \nParker supplies instrumentation valves, fittings, tubing and manifolds to flow control systems, which help improve accuracy and productivity while reducing risks. \nMany of the company's products comply with pressure equipment directive (PED) quality standards, ASME B31.1 & B31.3 power piping code, and newly enacted fugitive emissions standards. \nThe product selection includes flow control valves, flow meters and controllers, high-purity valves and fittings, instrumentation regulators and tube and pipe fittings, instrumentation tubing and valves, as well as manifold valves and systems, thermowells, probes and sensors. Comprehensive sealing and shielding devices \nParker's technically advanced sealing devices are manufactured for tight tolerances, higher temperatures and aggressive chemistries found in modern machines. \nThe products can fit virtually any sealing and shielding application and cover o-ring seals, fabric expansion joints, gaskets, PTFE seals, rotary and shaft seals, and custom seal kitting (OEM or planned plant outages). On-site gas generation solutions \nOn-site gas production is a cost-effective, energy-efficient, reliable and safe alternative to traditional gas supplies. \nParker's iH2 hydrogen generators provide an on-demand, continuous source of hydrogen gas in high volumes, which can be used in a wide range of power generation and renewable energy applications. \nFor continuous nitrogen gas on demand, the Domnick Hunter line of MaxiGas Nitrogen Gas Generators produces gas from compressed air that can be used in a wide range of power plant applications and multi-banked if required. Condition-based monitoring and diagnostic solutions \nParker offers in-depth expertise in condition monitoring, with a variety of proven and leading-edge products for power applications. \nOn-site condition monitoring capabilities use the following machine components: Bearings, including radial and thrust bearings Seals and packing rotors, auxiliaries such as lube oil and cooling systems, and more \nThe company's product range includes online / offline particle counter detectors, fuel quality and contamination monitoring, oil contamination monitoring and testing field kits, online sensors (oil condition, moisture and metal ferrous debris) and wireless remote monitoring sensors (vibration, pressure, temperature and humidity), as well as acoustic emission (AE) sensors for bearing monitoring. Process water and wastewater treatment solutions \nParker offers significant advantages for process water filtration. From reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration systems for cooling tower blow-down, boiler make-up, and feed water filtration, to gas and oil filtration, Parker has it covered, from intake to outflow. \nA wide range of filter cartridges in a variety of materials from stainless steel to melt-blown polypropylene combine with an assortment of vessel types and sizes to reduce both cost and contamination. \nThe company's customisable solutions include reverse osmosis filtration systems (Both SWRO & BWRO), automatic self-cleaning filter units, media filters, chemical injection skids, high-flow large diameter filters, multi-cartridge large diameter filter housings and melt-blown high capacity filter cartridges. On-engine solutions for gas turbines and diesel engines \nFor on-engine solutions, Parker provides unmatched reliability and consistent performance. \nThe company's industry-leading, well respected ABEX Jet-PipeÂ® EHSVs (ATEX and FM certified) and fuel nozzles, as well as the proprietary turbine inlet air cooling spray nozzles, are engineered solutions that keep gas turbines running longer and stronger. \nAdditional products include:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:20:29.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
