This was one of the largest food recalls in the country's history. \"These acts were driven simply by the desire to profit and to protect profits notwithstanding the known risks from salmonella.\" \nBesides Parnell, his brother Michael Parnell, a food broker, has also been sentenced for 20 years imprisonment. \nMichael supplied peanut paste from PCA to food manufacturer Kellogg's. \nFederal authorities found a leaky roof and rodents in the plant, which are ideal conditions to brew salmonella. \nBesides, they found emails and records that showed that the food was shipped despite lab tests confirming that the products were tainted with salmonella. \nThe judge said: \"These acts were driven simply by the desire to profit and to protect profits notwithstanding the known risks from salmonella. This is commonly and accurately referred to as greed.\" \nParnell's defence attorney Tom Bondurant was quoted by Nzherald.com as saying that 28 years in prison would amount to a life sentence and they intend to appeal the sentence. \n\"If you compare it with other food safety criminal cases, it's tremendously out of line,\" Bondurant said.
