With its guidance systems, the missile will also be able to attack a moving target, such as a carrier group at sea. \nAccording to Western defence analysts, the new missile may travel faster than anything that could be deployed to intercept it, The Telegraph reported. \nIn addition, China has unveiled its DF-26 anti-ship missile, which is claimed to be an advanced intermediate-range ballistic missile with a range of 3,000km to 4,000km. \nAccording to Chinese officials, the missile had already been fitted with an anti-ship warhead. \"A Chinese ability to attack reinforcing US naval forces with precision strikes out to Guam clearly undermines US security guarantees.\" \nInternational Assessment and Strategy Center senior fellow Rick Fisher was quoted by The Financial Times as saying: \"While an Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile (ASBM) version of the DF-26 was predictable, that it is already a deployed system is quite a shock.\" \nWith its high targeting capacity, DF-26 has a potential to reach US military bases in Guam. \nFisher added: \"A Chinese ability to attack reinforcing US naval forces with precision strikes out to Guam clearly undermines US security guarantees in our multiple Asian alliances, and our implicit security guarantees to Taiwan.\" \nThe military parade reportedly featured 12,000 troops, 200 planes and helicopters, and 500 troop carriers, rocket launchers, missiles and tanks. \nIn addition, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the country's military would be reduced by approximately 300,000 soldiers.
