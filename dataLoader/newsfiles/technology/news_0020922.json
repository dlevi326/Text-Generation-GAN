The employees were told in July that the company needs to get leaner and a reorganization was on the anvil.The layoffs come when Intuit is selling its flagship Quicken home-accounting software, Quickbase software that helps developers build applications, and Demandforce, an automated marketing and communications software. It is unclear if the developers who worked on these products will be transferred to other teams or absorbed by the buyer.The employee cuts were part of a change started in 2013 to focus on \"two strategic goals: to be the global operating system behind small business success, and to do the nations' taxes in the US and Canada,\" Intuit said in an email. The change in strategy had resulted in reductions in its India team and the \"tough choices\" would help Intuit succeed in the future.\"A number of impacted employees in India have been successfully placed into other roles within Intuit. Some employees, whose roles are 100% dedicated to a business unit, and the functional employees who are needed for the business to operate will be identified to go with the proposed sale of each business,\" Intuit said in an email response to ET.The employee cuts took place across levels and roles and included product developers. The number of talented developers is low and in India, they are typically protected from job losses.\"In India, most developers have been shielded when MNC companies undergo reorganisations. Most of the hit is felt by the sales and marketing teams,\" Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research, told.According to company sources, each of the Intuit products had at least 45 developers based in India.In its response to the impact on India, Intuit said, \"We are still evaluating the assets and the talent that will be sold, but at this stage we have generally identified what is in scope. We'll know more when we have buyers, but at this point, think the impact to India would be minimal if at all.\"Intuit laid off 399 employees, who received severance packages and career assistance from the company, Reuters reported on June 26. However, sources in the India office said the global layoffs have risen to at least 440. Affected employees would be eligible to look for other positions within the company, Reuters reported.\"My colleagues were given a three-month severance pay despite the fact that their notice period is just one month and some were even allowed to keep their stock options,\" said an executive who works in the India office. Intuit reported revenue of $4.2 billion in fiscal 2015 and had about 8,000 employees globally, according to an August 20 statement. The number of layoffs may be more than estimated earlier, industry watchers said.\"The thing is India was also saved earlier because the cost base was low. That is no longer the case. So you are seeing a greater scrutiny from the head offices on salaries and having people justify their pay,\" a person familiar with the layoffs said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T08:20:00.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
