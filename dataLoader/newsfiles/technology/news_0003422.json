It is a great opportunity for all to learn that Civil Engineers plan, design and build the infrastructure of the country, and for the children to have fun building the bridge.”\nThe event was organised by Newport West Communities First with help from the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) Wales Cymru, Network Rail and the National Trust. Children from Year 5 and 6 of Duffryn, Maesglas, and Gaer Junior Schools took part on Wednesday 23 September and Thursday 24 September.\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T15:50:24.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
