Expected to be operational by the end of 2016, the plant is anticipated to generate enough electricity to serve the needs of approximately 4,500 homes, based on estimates provided by the Solar Energy Industries Association. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150713/235415LOGO \n\"This SunPower solar power plant supports SSVEC's commitment to community growth and quality of life, and brings us to about 95 percent of the renewable energy goal established by the Arizona Corporation Commission that SSVEC is to meet by 2025,\" said SSVEC Chief Executive Officer Creden Huber. \"SunPower brings a complete solution to solar power plant development and operation that is proven to maximize energy delivery over the long term, optimizing the cost-effective, emission-free solar power that SSVEC provides its customers.\" \n\"Today, power generated from solar power plants is cost-competitive with power from traditional, fossil fuel burning plants,\" said Jorg Heinemann, SunPower executive vice president, global power plants and EPC. \"We commend SSVEC for its leadership in including solar in its energy mix, enabling their customers to take advantage of Arizona's abundant solar resource.\" \nThe project is expected to create approximately 125 jobs during construction, which is anticipated to commence in early 2016. \nSunPower plans to design and build a SunPower® Oasis® Power Plant system at the site. Oasis is SunPower's fully integrated, modular solar power block solution for utility-scale solar projects that is designed to optimize land use and is engineered for rapid, cost-effective installation. \nSunPower will likely offer the project for sale to 8point3 Energy Partners LP (Nasdaq: CAFD), the YieldCo joint venture formed by SunPower and First Solar, once it is operational. SSVEC has the option to purchase the facility at a later date. \nAbout Sulphur Springs Valley Electric Cooperative Sulphur Springs Valley Electric Cooperative is a non-profit, member-owned distribution cooperative providing electricity to more than 51,000 services over some 4,100 miles of energized line.
