Share on twitter by David Ramli Fire fighters, police officers and other emergency services should use phone companies like Telstra for their future communications needs because a dedicated service would cost $6.1 billion over 20 years, according to a draft report from the Productivity Commission.\nState governments and organisations like the Police Federation of Australia have long said that a dedicated mobile broadband service with its own allocated electronic airspace (spectrum) would help save lives and ensure public safety. Communication breakdowns were a key reason for lives being lost during the Victorian \"Black Saturday\" fires in 2009.\nBut the Productivity Commission on Wednesday will publish a draft report that claims relying on existing phone and internet providers would cost around $2.1 billion compared to the $6.1 billion needed for a dedicated system - a move that could cause anger amongst emergency service lobby groups.\n\"On first principles, a commercial approach represents the most efficient, effective and economical way of delivering a [public safety mobile broadband] capability to [public safety agencies],\" it said in a statement. \"A commercial option is cheaper because it requires significantly less 'new investment' than a dedicated or hybrid option as considerable existing infrastructure could be used or shared.\n\"The benefits of each option are not expected to vary markedly.\"\nThe Productivity Commission (PC) was asked in March by then-Treasurer Joe Hockey to investigate the various options for building such a network. Public safety mobile broadband would give front line officers real-time access to location services, videos and images as well as messaging services.\nIt said that rolling out a dedicated service would take five years, based on the amount of time it's taking Telstra to expand 4G service to 99 per cent of the population. By comparison, a commercial service could be \"hardened\" for use during emergencies within two years.\nControversially, the PC valued all the spectrum needed by the emergency service agencies at its opportunity cost and judged it accordingly. This means valuing it at a commercial rate instead of giving emergency services the discounted price they've been calling for.\n But the PC said doing so would encourage all parties involved to use it more efficiently without wasting unused spectrum.\nEmergency service groups had previously said that the Rudd Labor government had promised them a portion of the 700MHz spectrum band for building PSMB systems.\nBut the government backed away from the deal and chose to sell the valuable resource to telecommunications companies in an auction that eventually raised $2 billion . Both Labor and the Coalition have chosen not to set aside the remaining spectrum for emergency services.\nEmergency service organisations believe that better communications with the ability to broadcast locations at any point would provide a huge leap forward. The Royal Commission into the Black Saturday fires made the point that pager and radio services quickly broke down when stretched to their limits, with smoke causing signal problems .\nCompanies like Motorola would be major financial winners if the federal government decided to help the states and emergency services build a dedicated service while telcos would benefit greatly if commercial services were picked instead.\nTelecommunications companies including Telstra, Optus and Vodafone Hutchison Australia have long called for the right to buy the spectrum for use in their mobile networks.\nTelstra trialled a system built with Motorola called \"LANES\" for the Brisbane G20, which sets spectrum aside as required.\nThe PC said these and other commercial options would give emergency services the communications systems they needed into the future for a much lower cost and with less construction requirements.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli", "http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/"], "published": "2015-09-22T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:18:53.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
