The CORBYS robot in action \n'This could help reducing pressure on repetitive tasks of the therapist during rehabilitation of stroke and other patients and improve the general availability of the therapist for required interventions,' said Dr Polani. \nThe robot works by measuring patients' gaits in one setting where no restrictions are imposed, therapists can then study how they walk and manipulate the movement. \nIn the Corrective Operating Mode the patient can walk on the treadmill constrained by the robotic system, which can be tweaked and modified by the therapist. \nThe publication of the paper is the culmination of a 4 year research effort within the European Union-funded 6.1 million Euro project CORBYS. \nRehabilitation \nThe CORBYS project united universities and companies from across Europe to 'design, develop and validate an integrated cognitive robot control architecture for supporting robot-human co-working with high level cognitive capabilities.' \nDr Polani added: 'At the heart of the project was the development of an architecture which allows adaptable control of robots in different situations. \n'Rehabilitation is a particularly good example for the flexibility of the architecture.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T16:53:26.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
