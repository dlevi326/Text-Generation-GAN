I should have had two accounts, one for personal and one for work-related.\"\nDoubts over Clinton's trustworthiness have damaged her poll numbers, allowing liberal Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders to narrow the gap with her before the first nominating contests for the election early next year.\nClinton's slump in opinion polls has also given space for a possible run by Vice President Joe Biden. Biden, whose son died earlier this year, said on Thursday he is trying to determine whether he has the emotional energy for a White House bid.\nClinton said that while she should have behaved differently, she had done nothing wrong. \"It was allowed and it was fully above board. The people in the government knew that I was using a personal account,\" she said.\nThe FBI is now investigating the security of the private server and any classified information on it.\nReviews by Reuters of Clinton emails released to the public under a judge's orders found 87 email threads that the State Department has marked to show they include information shared in confidence by foreign government officials, from prime ministers to spy chiefs.\nU.S. government regulations say this sort of information, whether written or spoken, must be classified from the start and handled through secure, government-controlled channels.\nClinton said she used the personal email account for convenience and did not give the issue much thought when she took over as secretary of state in 2009.\n\"I was not thinking a lot when I got in. There was so much work to be done. We had so many problems around the world. I didn't really stop and think what kind of email system will there be,\" she said.
