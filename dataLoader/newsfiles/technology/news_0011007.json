The installation is expected to be completed in December 2015 and is a major step in providing the oil and gas industry with access to this new and innovative technology. This will enable the efficient delivery of large volumes of proppant coated with SandTec to hydraulic fracturing sites and transload facilities. “The team at Superior has a visionary approach to the industry,” said John Suldickas, Oil and Gas Commercial Manager at ArrMaz. “Working with them will allow us to provide the industry with a valuable tool to lower silica dust levels at all transfer points and increase operational safety.”\nSilica dust control is an ongoing concern in the hydraulic fracturing industry. The SandTec coating technology offers an attractive alternative to mechanical dust control systems. It provides superb dust control performance, is frac fluid compatible, is environmentally friendly and does not require the expense of equipment mobilization and demobilization. This allows for smaller operational footprints at frac sites as well.\nSuperior Silica Sands will begin offering SandGuard proppant utilizing SandTec coating technology to its customers in December. “We (SSS) are excited about incorporating the SandTec technology and ArrMaz’s understanding of material safety handling for our company and industry. Their knowledge in dust mitigation is important to SSS as we focus on helping our customers create a better well with the focus of a safer work place at the well site,” said Justin Renfro VP of Sales and Marketing at SSS. “Our partnership with ArrMaz is one that we see as a compliment to an already strong position in the frac sand industry.”\nSandTec is one of many innovative technologies developed by ArrMaz designed to help its customers in multiple industries enhance the efficiency of their operations and to improve the quality and value of their products.\n---\nAbout ArrMaz\nSince 1967, ArrMaz has grown to become the global leader in producing advanced performance process aids and functional additives for fertilizer, industrial minerals, coating technologies, asphalt and ammonium nitrate production.
