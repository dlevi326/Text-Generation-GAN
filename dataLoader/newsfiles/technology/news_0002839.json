The free service is scheduled for a full launch later in the fall and will take the form of both an app and a website. The online platform will include professional digital content from partners such as Vice Media, the onion, NBC sports (NBC) and Buzzfeed lifestyle, which will be supported by ads. The new service is Comcast's latest effort to hook in millennials viewers, who are pushing back against the pay TV model. The news comes following Comcast's 51 percent acquisition of universal studios Japan, which the cable operator bought for $1.5 billion. The deal will help grow the company's international presence, following the collapse of its previous efforts to buy Time Warner Cable (TWC).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:36:55.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
