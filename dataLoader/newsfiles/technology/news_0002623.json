The resulting images, entitled “ Mädchenland,” or Kingdom of Girls, are on display at The Half King in New York City until September 13.\nRather than photograph every aspect of Khasi life, Klüppel spent nine months taking portraits of the young girls she encountered in the village, capturing their confidence in vibrant colors. “ I decided to focus on the younger girls because I was so impressed by their self-assured appearance, and thought that this must be how matrilineality becomes visible,” Klüppel told Fotografia Magazine . Where one might expect images of shy smiles or timid looks, the girls are defiantly free, exhibiting commanding body language in every frame.\nKlüppel has shared five images from her essay with us, as well as some commentary, which you can see by clicking through the above slideshow.", "external_links": ["http://www.karolinklueppel.de/", "http://www.halfkingphoto.com/", "http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/cleanest-village-questions-its-blessings-amid-influx-of-visitors/", "http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/girls-rule-in-an-indian-village/#", "http://fotografiamagazine.com/madchenland-karolin-klueppel/"], "published": "2015-09-09T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:31:42.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
