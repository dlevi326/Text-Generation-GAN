(NASDAQ: DAEG), a global information governance, data migration and application development software company, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended July 31, 2015. \nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2016 Financial Highlights Total revenue of $5.2 million, compared to $6.7 million year over year. Approximately $1.3 million of the decrease is the result of the Company’s strategic de-emphasis of its eDiscovery services business. Revenue also declined $200,000 from the strengthening dollar on certain of the Company’s European maintenance renewals. GAAP net loss of $0.7 million or $0.04 loss per share, compared to GAAP net loss of $0.2 million or $0.02 loss per share for the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA of $1,000, compared to $823,000 last year. (1) Non-GAAP net loss of $75,000 or $0.00 loss per share, compared to Non-GAAP Net Income of $240,000 or $0.01 per share last year. (1) Cash at July 31, 2015 was $2.5 million, compared to $5.4 million at April 30, 2015. The decrease reflects a $1.5 million elective debt payment made during the quarter. Total debt outstanding at July 31, 2015 was $9.8 million, a decrease of $2.0 million from April 30, 2015. \nCommenting on the results, Daegis’ CEO Tim Bacci said, “Our first quarter results reflect the execution of our enterprise software strategy and the wind down of our eDiscovery services business. Excluding eDiscovery services revenue and the headwind from the strengthening dollar over last year, our revenue is slightly up year over year. There is stability in our core business with strong maintenance renewals and a backlog of approximately $1.2 million in professional services, which we expect to recognize over the remainder of this fiscal year. Our product roadmap is customer-focused with a major upgrade release of the archive planned for later this month as well as a recently released new version of our SQLBase product that delivers significant new functionality for our development and database customers.” \nBacci continued, “We’re managing the business by investing in the areas that continue to advance our strategy while maintaining a disciplined cost structure in support of our long-term strategic objectives. Our focus is where it needs to be, which is developing sustainable global direct and channel programs and initiatives while delivering products that meet the needs of our customers. Consistent with what we’ve been anticipating, we expect to begin to see top line growth, with second quarter revenue sequentially increasing by a range of $250,000 to $750,000 over the first quarter of fiscal 2016.” \nOther Company Highlights Released SQLBase 12.0 with significant new capabilities for scalability and multi-user performance. Completed development of Version 4.0 of the AXS-One Archive to meet the enterprise needs of global organizations for expanded search capabilities, as well as SharePoint connector enhancements. Achieved additional certification of the AXS-One Archive on Cisco’s storage product lines, which allows for a more comprehensive go-to-market plan with Cisco’s global sales force. Conducted training initiatives to support a broader global rollout of our Information Governance solutions with Oracle’s sales force. Added two seasoned enterprise software sales executives to the U.S. region. \nFirst Quarter 2016 Comparative Financial Summary $ In Millions, except per share and % data", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:22:33.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
