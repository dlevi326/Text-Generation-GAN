The launch of the iPhone 6s handset is the biggest smartphone launch this year.

Related Content What the iCar will mean for Apple's bottom line By David Goldman \nSince Apple is being typically tight-lipped about the project ( it declined to comment on \"rumors and speculation\"), it's hard to know exactly what the company is working on. The rumors range from an electric car to a operating system for vehicles to a self-driving car that will launch in 2019. \nHere's what CNNMoney knows for sure so far. \n1. Apple has been hiring a ton of car battery and auto engineers \nOver the past few years, Apple has hired engineers who built prototypes at Bentley, made vehicles quieter at Chrysler and Hyundai, and managed crash dummy tests. \nThe company's hiring spree has even spurred legal action. \nA123, an electric car battery maker, sued Apple for poaching its staff earlier this year. The Massachusetts company claimed that Apple has hired away five high-tech PhD and engineering employees, causing \"irreparable harm.\" \nA123 also said it has had to \"effectively shut down\" certain projects. \n\"Apple is currently developing a large scale battery division to compete in the very same field as A123,\" the lawsuit says. \nApple has also been hiring from Tesla Motors, and vice versa, according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. In fact, Musk said that Tesla has hired about five times as many people from Apple as Apple has recruited from Tesla over the last 12 months. \n2. The company has also been hiring automotive executives \nDoug Betts, a longtime auto industry executive, moved to Apple from Fiat Chrysler earlier this summer. \nBetts had previously been Fiat's quality chief. Before that, Betts worked at Michelin, Toyota, and Nissan. Currently, he works in Apple's Operations unit according to his LinkedIn profile. \nIn 2014, Apple hired Johann Jungwirth, who led research and development for Mercedes-Benz in North America. He specializes in Internet-connected cars and autonomous driving. Now, Jungwirth is \"director of Mac Systems Engineering.\" \nAnd, according to publicly available employment records, Apple has also hired a number of recruiters from Tesla. \n3. An Apple-leased van filled with sensors has been driving around a San Francisco suburb \nUnmarked vans loaded with cameras and sensors have been spotted driving around Brooklyn and a suburb of San Francisco. \nThe car in California is leased to Apple, CNNMoney has confirmed with California state records. The sensors indicate the car is conducting more than just Google-style street mapping, according to engineers familiar with self-driving cars. \n4. Competitors are already welcoming the challenge \n\"I certainly hope Apple gets into the car business,\" Elon Musk said during an earnings call earlier this year. \"That would be great.\" \nBut Musk has previously said he'd like to see as many electric car competitors as possible. \nInvestors have also speculated for some time that cash-rich Apple would be well positioned to buy Tesla and its high-flying stock. \n5. Car makers welcome the idea too \nSergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobile, has said he's open to partnering with Apple. \"I think we should encourage that dialogue,\" Marchionne said this spring. \"All of us should encourage it.\" \nOn the other hand, Marchionne also added that Apple and other tech companies would pose a tremendous threat to the auto industry if it moves into the sector. â€¹ Previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:10:14.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
