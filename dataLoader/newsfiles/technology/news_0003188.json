The solution was implemented by Freiburg-based Clavister partner IT-Systemhaus Jerg and covers critical functions such as antivirus and web content filtering. More than 100 Eagle firewalls will be deployed across the churches over the next two and a half years. \nThe administration manages all the pastoral, educational and other ecumenical departments of the churches. With the various parishes being separated by long distances, the specially built private cloud digitises and centralises the different applications of individual departments. Staff can access Office applications and the terminal server as well as file sharing, which is particularly important to the internal workflow. \nJürgen Selz, Managing Director of IT-Systemhaus Jerg, commented: “The solution is perfect for this environment as the large number of firewalls can be easily and comfortably administered and monitored through the centralised InControl system.” \nThe Clavister Eagle series appliances are ideal for securing remote or branch offices, delivering firewall performance of up to 4GB at a highly competitive price with the E80. They offer full NGFW features such as application control, user identity awareness, IPSec and SSL VPN, and content security services including IPS, IDS, web content filtering and anti-virus. \nThe Eagle appliances are centrally managed using Clavister InControl, making it easy to maintain a unified security model across the organisation. Together with user identity awareness, this gives powerful, granular visibility and control over users’ access to applications across networks, enabling busi­ness-critical application usage to be prioritised and increasing overall business productivity. \nAbout Clavister \nClavister is a leading supplier of security for fixed, mobile and virtual network environments.
