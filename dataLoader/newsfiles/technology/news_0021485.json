The Silicon Valley giant’s latest problems come from India. Last week, after a three-year investigation, India’s antitrust authority, echoing similar complaints in Europe, sent Google a report outlining its concerns about search dominance and anticompetitive behavior. The report from the investigative arm of the Competition Commission of India, citing the company’s size and financial heft, argued that Google is abusing its dominant position in search and online advertising by ranking its own services ahead of those of competitors, according to people familiar with the report, which has not been made public. The Indian commission adds to growing international scrutiny about how Google operates. The company appears to be facing a kind of regulatory contagion, with accusations in one jurisdiction hopping across borders and emboldening competitors and authorities elsewhere. In Brazil, authorities are investigating whether Google favored its own services other others’. In Mexico, a local regulator, also mirroring regulation in Europe, has backed so-called right-to-be-forgotten proposals that allow people to request links about themselves be removed from online search results. And privacy watchdogs from Argentina to Hong Kong have questioned the amount of data that Google collects on its users. The biggest of these threats is in Europe, where the region’s antitrust authority has charged the company with abusing its dominance in search to benefit some of its own services and is also investigating other potential violations connected to Google’s Android mobile phone software. The European Commission ’s decisions are likely to influence regulators in other regions. “It’s a little hard to imagine others will take decisive action until they see what Brussels does,” said William E. Kovacic, a professor of law at George Washington University and former chairman of the United States Federal Trade Commission. “In many ways they take their cue from what the older and more experienced agencies do.” Indeed, other international watchdogs, while not explicitly following the European lead, are raising similar questions about Google’s online search dominance, how it uses people’s digital data and what privacy rules should apply to its operations worldwide. In two decades, Google has grown from a tiny start-up to one of the world’s largest companies. But the price for that scale and influence is an expanding list of regulatory woes that could lead to billions of dollars in fines and demands for it to change its business practices to accommodate local laws. While the search giant calls the West Coast home, the majority of its users are now located outside the United States, which has left the company open to regulatory scrutiny that often goes beyond what American officials have called for. “It’s a consequence of their stature, and I think in many agencies you have, country by country, a large number of affected firms going to the competition agency saying, ‘You have to do something,’  ” Mr. Kovacic said. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:43:27.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
