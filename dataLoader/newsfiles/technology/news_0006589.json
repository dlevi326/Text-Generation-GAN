Ant Financial has ambitions to become a dominant online financial services provider, sometimes taking on powerful mainland China state banks on their own turf.\nMore than 200 million users of Ant Financial’s Alipay payment system already manage their wealth via financial products like Yu’E Bao, a money-market fund that pooled in 613.4 billion yuan by June 30.\nThe company introduced a new application called Ant Fortune in August that lets users buy about 900 fund products from more than 80 Chinese financial institutions.\nAnt Financial declined to comment in an e-mail. Alan Lee, a spokesman for Taipei-based Cathay Financial, declined to comment.
