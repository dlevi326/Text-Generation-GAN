For a few moments, they were kind of dumbfounded. After all, cats aren't exactly known as the Michael Phelpses of the animal kingdom.\nBut the kitten was on a beeline toward them, and was meowing the whole way. When the animal got close enough to the boat, one of the anglers reached over and hauled it over to the deck. The cat looked more grateful than Ralphie when he finally got his Red Ryder. It rubbed up against the anglers' legs, and seemed to make itself at home.\nThere was a reason.\nThe anglers looked up and saw another identical kitten swimming from the same point. Someone who didn't want the young animals had apparently dropped them off to fend for themselves. The kittens evidently saw the bass boat as their rescue ship.\nWatch the video here:", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/w8WFqM9wMrQ"], "published": "2015-08-31T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:55:33.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
