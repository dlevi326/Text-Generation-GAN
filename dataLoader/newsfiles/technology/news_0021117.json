This website has now released the names of top rated mobile apps for the month of August.\nTribe (10/10): This app differs from other social media apps that let you shoot and share by limiting who gets to see your posts. The app is also limited to videos and does not share anything you record on any of its servers - Describe your Tribe. Choose up to 10 friends to share with. You don’t have to choose 10, that’s just the max. Videos are accessible by only your Tribe. You choose whether or not you want to save or scrap your videos.\naJoy (9/10): aJoy, for iPhone and Android smartphones, takes messaging to a whole new level. It lets you send messages that carry more than just a standard message, it makes the message more fun to read. aJoy asks the user to register with its phone number. No other personal information is required, which is a refreshing change. Then you are in. From there you can choose from a myriad of options.\nWhat2Share (8.7/10): What2Share has heard the cry of frustrated message-senders looking for a more convenient way to send more colorful messages. It’s a free to download app - available for the iPhone and iPad and provides you with a customizable keyboard that’s chock full of fun. The app itself offers several customizable keyboard themes. Two are free, and the remaining require an in-app purchase.\nArabian Heroes (8.5/10): Imagine, if you will, living in an exotic Arabian desert, in which its peaceful inhabitants have flourished for years. The game sets a unique stage of play that takes you away, something that was quite alluring to me. The description given is fairly vivid, and from the sound of it, their graphics are just as powerful to match, making game play that much more realistic and engaging.\niBiome-Wetlands (8/10): Finding science education software that kids want actually want to play and one that delivers can be a daunting task. It almost takes enough research to write your own thesis! Fear not, because the creative coders at Springbay Studios have brought fun and science together in an app like no other. If you are looking for a fun and easy way to learn more about wetlands, then iBiome-Wetland delivers.\nWhile speaking about their new app marketing packages, Joe Ellen, an Editor at AlphaDigits said, “We gave a new look to our website and we improved it last month.
