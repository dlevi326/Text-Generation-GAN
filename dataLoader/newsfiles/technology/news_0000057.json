Having already closed its operations in Greece and Turkey, Groupon said it is also leaving Morocco, Panama, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay.\nThe Chicago company said it wants to focus its money on energy on fewer countries.\n\"We saw that the investment required to bring our technology, tools and marketplace to every one of our 40 (plus) countries isn't commensurate with the return at this point,\" Chief Operating Officer Rich Williams wrote in a blog post.\nGroupon Inc. said in a regulatory filing that the cuts will be essentially done by September 2016 and lead to pre-tax charges of up to $35 million, the bulk of it in the current quarter.\nShares of Groupon fell 10 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $4.07 in midday trading. The stock has traded in the range of $3.53 and $8.43 in the past 52 weeks.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-22T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:40:29.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
