You need JavaScript enabled to view it.\nPORTLAND, Oregon – September 1st, 2015 - 64 Audio (formerly 1964 Ears) announced today the launch of a ground breaking new line of professional in-ear monitors and consumer earphones. Both lines will have the revolutionary patented ADEL (Ambrose Diaphonic Ear Lens) technology. ADEL is the world’s first and only patented in-ear technology that safely delivers a louder, more spacious and richer sound while minimizing the risk of hearing damage. 64 Audio will also be using a new process called 3Dfit Technology. This new in-ear impression manufacturing method will create a more accurate and comfortable fit for your custom in-ear monitors.\nA-Series Custom In-Ear Monitors\nA-Series is a new custom in-ear monitor offering a variety of speaker options from 2-speakers (in each ear) and up to 12-speakers (in each ear). Prices range from $599.00 USD to $1999.00 USD. Each of these products is specifically designed for live stage musicians and the instruments they play. The result is a variation of sound signatures that compliments every professional or aspiring musician and provides complete aural enjoyment for any Audiophile no matter what device they’re being listened through. All 64 Audio custom products deliver a sound signature that allows you to hear exceptional detail, spaciousness, and clarity that has never been heard before. A-Series also feature patented ADEL technology.\n\"We are extremely excited to be the first company that not only brings the highest fidelity products, but also offers a real solution to hearing loss, which is a known problem in the music industry,” said Vitaliy Belonozhko, Founder and CEO of 64 Audio. “The collaboration between 64 AUDIO and Stephen Ambrose of Asius Technologies was natural and could not have happened at a better time!\"\nU-Series Universal Fit Earphones\n64 Audio is also launching a complete line of consumer universal-fit earphone products named the U-Series. These products are designed for consumers but come from the same family and sound signature of the new A-Series line. These products also range from 2-speakers (in each ear) up to 12-speakers (in each ear). Pricing varies by speaker configuration and starts at $399.00 USD to $1599.00 USD. These products come with specially angled universal-fit spout and 4 different sizes of comfortable fit tips to ensure the perfect fit. All of these products come designed with the patented ADEL technology.\nADEL Technology\nADEL (Ambrose Diaphonic Ear Lens) technology is at the epicenter of all the 64 Audio in-ear monitor and earphone designs. Funded by the National Science Foundation, Stephen Ambrose (original inventor of the first in-ear monitor and now founder and chief scientist of Asius Technologies) invented the ADEL technology to solve the 77% increase in hearing loss recently attributed to all personal listening devices. “We discovered that widespread hearing damage occurs when sound pressures are delivered to the eardrum at substantially higher volumes than they need to be, due to the fact that personal listening devices prematurely trigger the body's acoustic reflex.” said Stephen Ambrose. “This problem increases exponentially when you consider that over 125 million earbuds are sold annually.” By utilizing a revolutionary second ear drum to take the pounding, ADEL technology absorbs the harmful pneumatic sound pressures caused by all personal listening devices and provides a much safer and higher fidelity listening experience for everyone. Formal studies conducted at Vanderbilt Medical Center confirmed that personal listening devices modified with ADEL technology sound louder at lower volumes than anything else on the market. ADEL delivers sound the way it was always meant to be heard -- bass sounds deeper, midrange is clearer and highs sound richer than ever.\nAbout 64 Audio\n64 Audio is a Portland, Oregon based custom in-ear monitor (IEM) manufacturer that is committed to making the finest, yet affordable products. In a world of expensive custom in-ear monitors, 64 Audio’s mission is to bridge the gap between price and quality. 64 Audio started as 1964 Ears and was founded by a sound engineer who has been working with musicians, in the Northwest, for more than a decade. During this time he discovered the advantages of IEM’s over traditional floor \"wedges.” Not satisfied with what was available, many months went into sourcing, prototyping and field-testing his designs. The result is products that are specifically designed for touring bands, houses of worship and audiophiles.

While his original invention protected musicians from loud stage environments as well as the harmful pneumatic pressures that arise from devices that seal the ear canal, they required specific tuning for each listener. After touring for decades with hundreds of top bands, Stephen obtained research grants from the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health and invented and patented the second eardrum, which is self-tuning.
