To support those goals, the institute implemented the deviceWISE IoT platform from Telit . I-SENSE researchers have already integrated the platform into several of their projects, and the institute has now formed a partnership with the company. \nAs part of the partnership with I-SENSE, Telit will provide the institute with technical support, training and an unlimited license to the deviceWISE IoT platform. I-SENSE researchers will also offer their expertise to several of Telit's upcoming initiatives. \nThe Telit deviceWISE IoT platform is a cloud-based, end-to-end solution designed to simplify the process of connecting and managing \"things-to-apps,\" according to information from the company. The platform integrates \"remote sensors, devices and production assets with Web-based, mobile apps and enterprise systems, across any wireless network.\" According to the company, the platform is flexible enough to support the rapid creation of IoT prototypes by students and makers while also supporting larger-scale research initiatives. \nFlorida Atlantic University and Telit will present their shared vision for the Internet of Things at a public IoT information event, \" It's Academic with IoT ,\" hosted by the South Florida Technology Alliance (SFTA) on the FAU campus on September 17.
