Photo: Supplied\nMr Baxter said that his own conversations with the new prime minister convinced him of Turnbull's tech acumen.\n\"Sometimes, with politicians, you talk to them on this topic and their response shows that they don't really understand or get it,\" he said.\n\"I have no fear that that's an issue with Malcolm Turnbull.\"\nIn announcing his leadership challenge to Tony Abbott on Monday, Turnbull touched on his vision for an economy that embraced tech and business reform.\n\"We have to recognise that the disruption that we see driven by technology, the volatility in change is our friend, if we are agile and smart enough to take advantage of it,\" he said.\nStart-ups have expressed their hopes for a Turnbull government to promote the field by introducing a ministerial portfolio or increasing government investment in start-ups.\nCutting business red tape and making technology and entrepreneurship subjects compulsory in school were also on the wish list, Job Capital founder and serial entrepreneur Jo Burston said.\nThe rousing reception for the new prime minister reflects a survey last year where 600 start-up founders named Turnbull as the politician they believed best supported the start-up sector.\nHowever more than half the respondents also named no politician, indicating the Abbott government at the time was perceived as doing nothing to support the sector.\nLingering resentment around Turnbull's record as communications minister, where he oversaw data retention laws and a disappointing NBN roll-out appear to have been tempered by new hopes for change.\n\"Although he was following the party line, there was always uncertainty as to how strongly Turnbull personally supported that approach [to the NBN] and his elevation to the PM spot may allow for an NBN recalibration,\" said Ovum analyst Al Blake.\n\"Having someone with an understanding of technology at the highest position in government cannot be underestimated.\"\nAAP", "external_links": ["http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/shark-tank"], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T05:28:10.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
