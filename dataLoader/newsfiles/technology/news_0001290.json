By Hailey Desormeaux | Wednesday, September 09, 2015 DAT Solutions, an electronic freight posting company that serves North American transportation and logistics professionals, launched a new online analytics service, which allows users to access truck and load data on the 149 key market areas in North America with the highest concentrations of inbound and outbound freight. Customers can access a set of trucking freight data visualizations through a Tableau web portal and have the ability to import data into their own systems, DAT said in a statement. The data, which can be sorted by individual and multiple market areas, comes from the company's load boards and DAT RateView, an online tool that provides real-time spot market and contract freight rate information. Data visualizations currently available include carrier development charts, which provide carrier load-search and truck posting activity based on company and market area; supply and demand heat maps, which illustrate the available freight load to available truck ratio in each market area; inbound and outbound trucks and loads maps; and truck density maps, which illustrate the concentration of trucks by equipment type within specific regions. DAT Solutions is based out of Portland, Ore. and is a subsidiary of Roper Technologies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T05:30:07.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
