More than half the devices running on Good's systems are Apple Inc products such as the iPhone.\nBlackBerry said it expects to realize about US$160 million in revenue from the acquisition in the first year after the deal closes, expected by late November. Its Toronto listed shares were up 1.1 percent at CUS$7.97 in early trading.\nOn a call with analysts and investors, BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen was asked about Good's cash burn. He promised that BlackBerry would remain cash flow positive overall.\n\"There obviously will be hard work involved,\" he said. \"But I do see a lot of opportunity here to drive value for our shareholders.\"\nChen said BlackBerry will maintain both company's products as it develops a unified platform that customers can upgrade to. He said that a unified product may take a year or two.\nRelations between BlackBerry and Silicon Valley-based Good had long been tense. The companies settled a series of patent lawsuits in 2004, but as recently as January 2015, BlackBerry critiqued one of Good's product announcements in a blog post, annotating the rival company's press release in red ink.\n\"There is a very long history here. We are in an incredibly competitive market and speak to many of the same customers,\" said Good Chief Executive Christy Wyatt in an interview posted on BlackBerry's news site.\nWyatt said her company's technology would boost BlackBerry's ability to manage \"Internet of things\" devices, supporting wearable technology such as the Apple Watch and Android-based competitors.\nBlackBerry has recently made acquisitions to expand its services business, and in July Chen said the company would likely make more. On Friday, he compared the acquisition of Good with previously announced deals for Secusmart, Movirtu and WatchDox.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Good on the deal, BlackBerry said.\n(With additional reporting by Anannya Pramanick in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Chizu Nomiyama)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-09-05T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T19:27:18.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
