They had responded to the building after receiving an emergency call that an infant had fallen from a window.\nAn autopsy revealed the infant died of blunt force injuries, chief medical examiner Dr Barbara Sampson said on Tuesday. The baby's death was ruled a homicide, meaning she had been born alive.\nBerry, who is 33 years old and lives in nearby Yonkers, was being held on Tuesday in police custody pending her arraignment and couldn't be contacted. It was unclear whether she had an attorney.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:16:20.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
