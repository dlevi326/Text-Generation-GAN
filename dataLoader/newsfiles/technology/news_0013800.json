Leading additive manufacturing solutions provider, EnvisionTEC has announced a collaboration with global science company, DSM 's product brand Somos , a world leader in the development of 3D printing materials. \nSomos has been developing game-changing materials for over 25 years and currently has over 15 different stereolithography resins all used in a wide range of applications from automotive to injection moulding. The partnership will allow both companies to advance their technologies and develop new applications and high-performance materials for heat resistance, durability, high detail resolution and dimensional stability. \n\"Somos consistently produces cutting-edge materials for 3D printing,\" John Hartner, Chief Operating Officer of EnvisionTEC, explained. \"Working together will accelerate the possibility of producing large industrial parts with a high level of performance at much faster speeds.\" \nMelissa Lutz, Business Director for Somos added: \"We are very excited to be working with EnvisionTEC. Their new, 3SP large-frame machines produce parts two to three times faster than the existing, industry-leading equipment. We can't wait to develop high-performance materials that enable their equipment to expand into new industrial applications.\" \nEnvisionTEC founder and CEO, Al Siblani, will kick off the TCT Show + Personalize Conference next week with a keynote presentation on how the company has grown and his view for the future of 3D technologies.
