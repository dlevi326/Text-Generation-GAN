Benchmark your success and failure and optimise your future approach based on measured evidence. It is all here. \nThe WSN market is expected to grow to $1.8 billion by 2024. These figures refer to WSN defined as wireless mesh networks, i.e. self-healing and self-organising. Wireless Sensor Networks will eventually enable the automatic monitoring of forest fires, avalanches, hurricanes, failure of country wide utility equipment, traffic, hospitals and much more over wide areas, something previously impossible. It has started already with more humble killer applications such as automating meter readings in buildings, and manufacture and process control. \nThe WSN business is set to become a multi-billion dollar activity but only if there is major progress with standards and technology. This techno-marketing report scopes manufacturers and developers and looks closely at the impediments to roll out and how to overcome them. For example, today's power sources often stand in the way of the desired 20 year life so the report looks closely at how energy harvesting can help and profiles the relevant power source manufacturers. Ten year WSN forecasts are made based on the very latest information. \nKey Topics Covered: \n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS \n2. INTRODUCTION \n3. PHYSICAL STRUCTURE, SOFTWARE AND PROTOCOLS \n4. ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL WSN APPLICATIONS \n5. EXAMPLES OF DEVELOPERS AND THEIR PROJECTS \n6. POWER FOR TAGS \n7. IMPEDIMENTS TO ROLLOUT OF WSN \n8.
