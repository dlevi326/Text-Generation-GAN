Please understand this, I studied at Stellenbosch University, and I studied in ENGLISH – yes, you read correctly, ENGLISH. For those who didn’t know, before you even reach a lecture hall, you have plenty of opportunities to discover exactly which subjects are dual medium and how they will affect your studies. It is also a well known fact that Stellenbosch University does offer classes in Afrikaans – which means, before you’ve even chosen where to study, you KNOW that knowing some form of Afrikaans might be required at university.\nInternational students who study at Stellenbosch, know this, so why is it such a big issue with our local students? Why don’t you try UCT, or NMMU or CPUT or any of the many tertiary establishments South Africa has to offer? Nobody is forcing you to go to Stellenbosch University, so stop complaining about the language.\nEvery subject you choose to study will state very explicitly whether Afrikaans is used as a teaching medium or not. So please, don’t turn around now and expect me to believe that you not speaking Afrikaans is suddenly such a major issue – because it’s not. You have always known whether or not your subject choices would be affected by the inability to speak and understand Afrikaans and that is a fact.\nI loved studying at Stellenbosch University, I had some trouble following the lessons in Ancient Cultures, but I knew what I was letting myself in for and I would never have the audacity to complain about that. Classes notes were mostly always in English and the course syllabus was ALWAYS in English and Afrikaans, so I knew what I had to study.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:04:47.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
