The event will bring together top military maritime leaders and solution providers to discuss and explore current and future requirements of unmanned maritime operations. \nThe summit will provide the unique opportunity to gain access to the most active maritime stakeholders in the industry when they discuss ongoing and future acquisition programs of unmanned maritime systems and vehicles. \n“We will be unmanned under, on and above the sea. We need to have an organic, unmanned, persistent, unblinking eye capability,” said Admiral Michael G. Mullen, former CNO and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \nIn August 2015, China announced it will develop unmanned ships. In response, the U.S. Navy revealed the formation of an unmanned weapons systems director (OPNAV N99) and a deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for Unmanned Systems. While the U.S. Navy continues to decrease in size and manpower, an increased focus on unmanned maritime systems has propelled the industry forward, thereby creating a need for emerging requirements in this growing field. Stakeholders and solution providers are needed to evaluate the capability gaps of existing fleets of small- and medium-sized unmanned systems, which are struggling to meet future demands. \nKey decision makers in attendance include: Rear Admiral Charles Richard USN – Director, Undersea Warfare (OPNAV N97) U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Anita Lopez NOAA – Deputy Director, Office of Marine and Aviation Operations NOAA. Rear Admiral Lorin Selby USN – Commander, Naval Surface Warfare Center U.S. Navy CAPT David Honabach USN – Program Manager, Unmanned Maritime Systems (PMS-406) U.S. Navy \nFor more information, on sponsorship/exhibition opportunities, please contact us today or visit www.UnmannedMaritimeSystems.com/opportunities", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T19:33:36.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
