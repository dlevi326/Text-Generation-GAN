The product is available in two flavors, and is set to hit Kickstarter early next month. \nWith wireless charging becoming more prevalent, we've seen a lot of solutions for integrating Qi pads more seamlessly into our homes. Those range from attractive, nature-inspired pads to flatpack furniture that hides the tech in plain sight . Now WallJax is getting in on the game with a pair of simple shelf solutions, available with either a pure white or walnut finish. \nFirst up is the WallJax EZ. The unit plugs directly into a 120-volt outlet, providing a small shelf at the top that's just about the right size to sit your smartphone on. The EZ passes through a pair of regular AC outlets, meaning you won't loose any functionality by using it. There's also a USB port on the base of the unit, catering for additional charging needs. \nThe WallJax Float is similar, but perhaps a little more convenient. It's powered by an included USB cable, and attaches to the wall by either a supplied non-mark adhesive, or by screws. Unlike the EZ, you can place the Float anywhere that you can get power to, making it a little more versatile. The USB power can be attached from below, or from behind, allowing the user to run cables behind the wall for a seamless look. \nBoth products have integrated Qi wireless charging coils, providing 5W of power. You'll be able to use them with devices like the Samsung Galaxy S6 , S6 edge , Note 5 and S6 edge+ right out of the box. If you've got a non-wireless-charging smartphone, such as Apple's iPhones, then you're not completely out of luck, with numerous cases adding the tech in peripheral form . \nAs the company is crowdfunding the product, there's no guarantee you'll actually be able to ultimately get your hands on it. With that in mind, you can reserve a unit for US$59 for the Float and $79 for the EZ, starting October 6. You're certainly paying for the convenience factor here, as that's pricier than more standard Qi charging pads on the market. \nFor a look at the WallJax EZ and Float, you can take a look at the video below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:24:08.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
