Did Sacramento's new CEO-led economic development group kill SARTA? Leaders of the Sacramento Regional Technology Alliance say flagging fundraising doomed the group. And several say the Greater Sacramento Area Economic Council , which launched early this year, is getting most of the corporate dollars available for economic development. But economic council CEO Barry Broome says Greater Sacramento tried to help SARTA survive. Moreover, the groups didn't go after the same funding, he said. While SARTA raised money from events and small donations, “We don’t compete for those dollars,” Broome said. SARTA on Tuesday announced it is closing after 14 years of work supporting tech startups. It was the second business group to fold recently for lack of funding; the Arts and Business Council shut down on Aug. 24 . Howard Bubb , CEO of SARTA, said the board voted Monday to close because \"businesses and individuals are putting their support elsewhere.” The group had an annual budget of just over $500,000. “It’s a tough environment for SARTA,” said Sanjay Varshney , professor of finance at California State University Sacramento and former SARTA board member. It is difficult to raise money with “so many organizations trying to achieve the same goals.\" “Everything has an impact,\" noted Dave Sanders , a longtime SARTA board member and managing partner of executive search firm Worldbridge Partners. \"The market itself wants a smaller number of places to write checks. It is a result of all that has gone on in Sacramento in the last year.” One big change in the last year has been the launch of the economic council. More than 20 of the region’s biggest companies -- ranging from Raley’s to Wells Fargo to UC Davis Medical Center -- are founding partners of Greater Sacramento. Founders agreed to contribute $100,000 a year for five years. Several SARTA board members, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to preserve business relationships, said they believe corporate commitments to Greater Sacramento made it difficult for SARTA to raise funds. But Broome said Greater Sacramento tried to help the older group hang on. SARTA approached the new organization early this summer to propose a merger, he said. While the Greater Sacramento board decided not to move forward with that idea, on Thursday it did authorize $125,000 to help SARTA restructure. By then it was too late, said Broome. On Monday, SARTA announced the group needed an emergency cash infusion to make payroll. “My board authorized financial resources to help them, but it was tied to a restructuring plan, not an emergency fund,” said Broome. “We didn’t know until Monday that they were going out of business.” Although Greater Sacramento wants to focus on its business attraction and retention role in the near future, it is open to someday absorbing some of the functions of SARTA, Broome said. Kevin Nagle, the pharmaceutical executive who sits on Greater Sacramento’s board, has set out to explore what model makes sense for Sacramento’s tech community, said Broome. But for now, he said, the economic council needs to stay focused on its mission of recruiting companies and helping existing employers expand. The SARTA model could also transform into a for-profit venture, said Broome. And some of its functions could be handled by the region’s two public universities. Although the failure of SARTA is a “short-term setback, I think it will be a better long-term proposition for the community,” said Broome. “I think people should be optimistic.” The Sacramento Metro Chamber helped launch SARTA in 2001. Since then, SARTA helped thousands of local startups, said Peter Tateishi , CEO of the Chamber. “We’re sad to see it go,” Tateishi said. “They have a good track record to show they have moved the needle in the tech space.” Though SARTA was affiliated with it, the Chamber has no plan to take up any part of SARTA’s role, Tateishi said. The absence of SARTA will be felt in the region, said Meg Arnold, who had been CEO of SARTA for five years until she quit in Sept. 2014. “It is easy to take for granted all the partnerships and relationships and the ability to draw people together for events,” she said. \nGet Sacramento  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:18:41.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
