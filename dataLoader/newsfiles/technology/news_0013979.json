They repeatedly tap the brakes when they detect danger, affecting nearby human drivers who may stop abruptly. \nMonths of testing on the streets of Silicon Valley have forced Google to alter its algorithms. According to The Wall Street Journal , its researchers have studied human driving to find that we “cheat” when making manoeuvres. \nGoogle’s cars make wide turns Subscribe now", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:30:19.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
