Defence attorneys argued that she accidentally fell while snapping a photo and prosecutors' evidence was largely circumstantial.\nProsecutors argued during a two-week trial that Henthorn staged his wife's death to look like an accident because he stood to benefit from her $4.7 million in life insurance policies.\nThey said Henthorn gave inconsistent accounts of the deadly hike and could not explain why he had a park map with an \"X'' drawn at the spot where she fell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:17:23.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
