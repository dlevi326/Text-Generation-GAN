But as the ruling comes from an administrative board, not a full court, Uber says it “does not have any wider impact or set any formal or binding precedent”, meaning future cases are free to decide differently.\nThe case strikes at the heart of Uber’s business model, which relies on the firm positioning itself as a mere middleman between drivers and passengers. Many analysts have questioned whether the firm would even be sustainable if it was forced to provide standard employee benefits to all its contractors.\nThe decision was handed down by the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and appealed twice. It was most recently upheld by the Appeals Board from its Inglewood office this August. The case came to light when a lawyer suing Uber on behalf of other drivers posted documents to her website.\nThe EDD decision is one of several rulings that appear to undercut how San Francisco-based Uber operates, relying on independent contractors to transport passengers.\nAmong the others were rulings by a Florida regulatory agency in May, the California Labor Commissioner in June, and another case this year, in which a Los Angeles-area Uber driver was classified by the EDD as an employee and given unemployment benefits.\nBut significantly, the ruling from Inglewood is among the first of these cases to be appealed and to have those appeals denied, foreshadowing how other appeals may be handled, some legal experts say.\nIn the Inglewood case, a former Uber driver, whose name was withheld from case documents, applied for unemployment benefits in April 2014.\nAfter the EDD determined the driver had rights to unemployment benefits as an Uber employee, the company appealed the decision first in November and again in June, according to the EDD.\nAccording to the administrative law judge who heard the first appeal, Uber has sole discretion over fares, and can charge drivers a cancellation fee if they choose not to take a ride, prohibit drivers from picking up passengers not using the app and suspend or deactivate drivers’ accounts.\nBased on that, “there was in fact an employer/employee relationship”, according to the decision.\nThe company argues that drivers want independent contractor status because they value the chance to be their own boss.\nEight states have issued rulings that classify Uber drivers as independent contractors: Georgia, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Indiana, Texas, New York, Illinois, and California, which made such a ruling in 2012 that applied to only a specific case.\nBut a federal judge in San Francisco ruled last week that drivers are entitled to class-action status in litigation over whether they are independent contractors or employees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T15:18:19.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
