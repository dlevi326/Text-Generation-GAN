While the accommodations that students receive depend on their disabilities, Student Disability Services can provide students who are registered with their office with software that records and transcribes notes, read textbooks and emails, take photos of the board during lectures and insert them into their notes and more. The software, which includes Kurzweil 3000, Dragon, Sonocent and AudioNote, is available for free to students registered with their office and they can use it throughout internships and into their careers, said Coordinator of Adaptive Technology Colleen Hanna. They just finished introducing new software to students and hosted a workshop on technology on Friday, Sept. \" target=\"_blank\"> \nTechnology has made classes at Central Michigan University more accessible for on-campus students with disabilities, but work is still being done to make improvements. \nAccessibility for students with disabilities is being updated with new note-taking software taking the place of student notetakers, new buildings being added to campus that are more accessible, and the Accessibility and Advisery Council providing resources to make events more accessible. Most learning accommodations can now be taken care of with software, said Lynne L’Hommedieu, director of Student Disability Services. While the accommodations students receive depend on their disabilities, Student Disability Services provides registered students with software to make their classes easier to navigate. The new software was introduced to students in a workshop on Friday, Sept. 25. It features tools for recording and transcribing notes, reading textbooks and emails, taking photos of the board during lectures and inserting photos into notes. The software, which includes Kurzweil 3000, Dragon, Sonocent and AudioNote, is available for free to students registered with their office, and can be utilized throughout internships and in their careers, said Coordinator of Adaptive Technology Colleen Hanna. Another accommodation the Student Disability Office offers is student note takers that attend classes and take notes for students with disabilities. However, L’Hommedieu said it’s difficult to find note takers, especially for upper-level classes. She hopes the number of student note takers will decrease dramatically within the next couple years and be replaced by the technology that records and transcribes. “More and more, we’re going to keep moving in that direction because it allows students to operate independently (like) any other student, and not depend on another person,” she said. With student note takers, students with disabilities have no way of guaranteeing the notes are good quality. With the software, students can leave class with notes that are complete and their own, Hanna said. Freeland senior Dakota Burch, who is visually impaired, uses Kurzweil to scan books. He can't see enough , so he uses a screen reader. “(Technology) makes the assignments more accessible so we don’t have to ask for help all the time or have people read it to us,” he said. “It just (allows) us to be able to enjoy college without thinking of it like, ‘oh, I can’t do this; why can’t I do this?’ and stressing us out.” The office of Student Disability Services offers various accommodations, with the most common one being extended time and a quiet space for tests. “I think for the most part, CMU has come a long way in terms of striving for accessibility,” said Beth Kennedy, American Sign Language instructor and co-chair of the Accessibility and Disability Advisory Council. She said some buildings on campus are older and not as accessible, while newer buildings have shown more positive changes. “I also think that in terms of accessibility of historical buildings and older things, it’s not just an issue at CMU, but around the world, so it’s exciting to see more and more new construction,” she said. Megan Potts, Campus Programs Program Manager at the Mary Ellen Brandell Volunteer Center, said some accessibility issues on campus can be easy to miss. During David Garcia Project open sessions, she said students go through the doors of the Bovee University Center bathrooms while in a wheelchair to see how difficult it can be to get through. David Garcia Project Student Coordinator Erica Wilson said she had to use a wheelchair as part of her therapeutic recreation course last year and couldn’t get into her dorm. The two of them hope David Garcia Project sessions will make people more aware of disabilities so they can spread that awareness. “Say you’re in an organization that is hosting an event,” Potts said. “Hopefully you will think, ‘Well, is someone who is in a wheelchair going to be able to attend this event and do everything that everyone else is doing?’” The Accessibility and Disability Advisory Council, which has almost 40 members from various departments and offices on campus, also hopes to make events more accessible. “One of our goals I’m most excited about is that we have some funds we’re allotting in the ADAC budget, which is small, where people who are having an event on campus can contact us if they have a need to make an event accessible,” Kennedy said. “If they’re not able to afford interpreters or there’s been a community request for something they don’t have, they can contact us and we can try to help with that.” She said making events accessible for as many people as possible is important, but can be a barrier because of people’s budgets. They’ve already had some requests for interpreters this year. If they can’t provide the funding, she said, their intention is to help people look for other partners to ensure accessibility at events. “Accessibility is something that can benefit lots of people, so the more we all rally around that, I think the world will be a more accessible place for everyone,” Kennedy said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T12:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T20:34:24.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
