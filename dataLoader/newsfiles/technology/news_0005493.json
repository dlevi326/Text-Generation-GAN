Powered by the proven Neuralytics self-learning predictive engine, the Predictive Cloud taps into the intelligence gathered from analyzing nearly 100 billion sales interactions. The Predictive Cloud represents the evolution of big data applications for businesses, allowing companies to realize the full potential of predictive technologies in their own applications, business processes, and sales practices. \nInsideSales.com will showcase the Predictive Cloud at the Dreamforce conference this month, highlighting three unique ways companies can leverage this new technology: Predictive-as-a-Platform - Through the Predictive Cloud Open API, independent software vendors (ISVs) can tap into the Predictive Cloud to add predictive functionality into their own apps. Predictive-as-a-Service - Companies can leverage the Predictive Cloud to scale revenue and improve internal processes and operations. Sales Acceleration Apps - Thousands of companies are already leveraging the power of the Predictive Cloud to accelerate sales via InsideSales.com Sales Acceleration apps for sales communications, email and web tracking, predictive forecasting, lead and opportunity scoring, sales gamification, and sales hiring. More information is available here . \n\"The vision for the Predictive Cloud dates back to the founding of the company in 2004,\" said Dave Elkington, founder and CEO, InsideSales.com. \"We are building an Amazon-style recommendation engine for business -- a system capable of intelligently analyzing billions of data points in real-time and recommending the optimal next steps for almost any application or business process. This lays the groundwork for a future where predictive technology can be applied not just to sales organizations, but also to government, healthcare, retail and beyond.\" \nIn her July 2015 report, \"CRM Sales Automation Software for Every User,\" Kate Leggett, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research, noted: \"Solutions in the sales acceleration category speed prospects' progress through the sales funnel through prescriptive insights. These take the insights driven by predictive analytics and layer on domain-specific business logic resulting in context-specific, actionable prompts for individual salespeople.\" \nThe Predictive Cloud analyzes nearly 100 billion sales interactions and is powered by InsideSales.com's Neuralytics engine, a real-time, self-learning predictive engine that incorporates advanced learning algorithms to analyze data and provide intelligent recommendations. This self-learning capability means that all transactions are automatically captured and continuously refreshed, providing a tight feedback model between actions and results to enhance the predictive power of the system. Data from the Predictive Cloud is combined with anonymized customer data, then correlated and enriched with external data sources, creating \"High-Definition\" Data to increase predictive accuracy. \nInsideSales.com has partnered with visionary companies to develop proof-of-concepts that highlight the benefits and unique ways the Predictive Cloud can be applied within an organization: Cloudbilt , the makers of MapAnything, is integrating with the Predictive Cloud to add individual NeuralScores (likelihood of a lead to close a sale) to its app, helping joint customers leverage predictive insights to prioritize effectively and ensure time spent in the field impacts the bottom line.
