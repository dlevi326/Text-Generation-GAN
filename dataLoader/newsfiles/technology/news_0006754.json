The application is aimed at both professional and casual photographers who want to remove grains or tiny speckles , commonly referred to as noise, from their digital photos. \nIt is capable of enhancing the clarity of any selected image with minimum efforts. There are three modes of noise removal in the app, i.e. Low, Medium and Custom which users can use depending upon the level of noise they want to remove from the photograph. \nUsers also have direct access to the smartphone’s camera from within the application and clicked photographs can be corrected for noise instantly from there. A slider is also present that allows users to smoothen images. \nMr. Shrishail Rana, CEO of Systweak Software stated that , “The idea behind the application was to make the process of removing noise from digital images easy and effective and our team has to be commended for coming up with such a flawless application for Android users”. \n“The best part of NoiseReducer is that it is mostly automated and users just need to tap a few times to get an enhanced and noiseless image” says Aditya Singhal, the Project Head for the application. \nNoiseReducer is available for download on Google Play Store and supports Android 3.0 and later. It is free for a limited period of time. \nMore Info: http://photonoisereducer.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T00:53:47.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
