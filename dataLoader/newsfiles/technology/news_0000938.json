The new services represent an industry-first in personal data control options.\n“It’s a little-known fact that nearly every individual, regardless of age or time spent online, has their personal information displayed on numerous people search, background check, and real estate evaluation websites. We’re excited to have developed techniques to remove people from sites that, up until a few months ago, were not possible. Our services now give people maximum control over how they appear on the Internet,” said McAdam. Examples of these problematic websites include WhitePages.com, InstantCheckMate.com, and BlockShopper.com; in all, over 100 of these sites exist online, many of them ranking in the top of Google Search.\nThe information found on these sites - information that we remove and monitor for - includes items prime for identity thieves: full name, current address and address history, date of birth, phone number, email address, mother’s maiden name, association to relatives, and in many cases, employment history and school district. The United States is one of the few Westernized countries that still legally allows this practice to continue. PrivacyDuck’s aggressive removal and monitoring subscriptions put a stop to this practice for the individual.\nPrivacyDuck offers three Membership levels, designed to meet all levels of privacy needs. The base program, Premium Privacy ($50/month), removes personal information from all people search sites online. VIP Privacy ($150/month), removes information from people search sites, background check sites, and real estate evaluation sites. The Entrepreneur Privacy service ($250/month) takes the VIP Privacy service to the next level with personal info removal and monitoring from business directory sites.\nPrivacyDuck was founded in 2013 by Will McAdam, author of the 2015 book, “Claim Your Name” and former Director of Executive Privacy at Reputation.com. PrivacyDuck’s team of experienced privacy and reputation professionals is consistently looking for new ways to help individuals control their information online. Other services include Online Reputation Management, Social Media Claiming, and Business Listings.
