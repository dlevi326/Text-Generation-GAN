But apparently that wasn’t enough, so they’ve decided to announce a 23-karat version of the device for those with money to burn. \nThe LG Watch Urbane Luxe is a $1,200 smartwatch, and though it’s not quite as overpriced as Apple’s Watch Edition, it’s a limited-edition 23-karat gold version with a strap made of alligator leather, and will have an “exclusive” shiny lacquer case. Unfortunately it’s pretty much the same functionality as the almost $200 basic version. \nAccording to LG’s Chris Yie, “wearable devices shouldn’t be thought of as an extension of one’s smartphone but an extension of oneself.” \nOnly 500 of the luxurious watches will be made so if you do spend $1,200 on one of these baby’s you’ll be in a pretty exclusive Android Wear club. \nMuch like with the Apple Watch Edition, would you be willing to spend $1,200 on a smartwatch which has the same functionality as one worth $150?
