Columbus-based Sage was formed one year ago by Bob Houghton and Jill Vaské, the pair who founded and sold e-recycler Redemtech Inc. New York City recycling pioneer Hugo Neu Corp. provided startup capital, which gave it the largest single stake followed by the founders. No single owner has a majority. Sage has gained some Fortune 500 as well as middle-market customers and started operations in January in Columbus, Baltimore, Maryland, and Reno, Nevada. In August, it launched its online Electronics Bluebook, setting values for used cables, phones, monitors and other equipment. “The mid-market we’re finding is under-served across the country,” Houghton said. “The big (IT equipment disposal) players are going after the biggest customers. These smaller organizations have all the same problems.” Sage and Hugo Neu already worked closely together, but the non-cash acquisition provides a more complete package to customers of each, Houghton said. Neu's recycling customers will have more opportunities to refurbish and resell instead, while Sage gets more efficient recycling for equipment it can't repair. “We believe there’s a lot of brand equity in that (Hugo Neu) name and we want to maintain that,” Houghton said. Sage will set up operations in Hugo Neu's 130-acre industrial park in Kearny Point, New Jersey, opening a fourth processing facility a few months ahead of schedule, a 15-minute drive from Manhattan. Neu even has a fleet of small trucks that serve the city. “It couldn’t be a better property to serve the New York and Northeast marketplaces,” Houghton said. “The logistics and expense of serving New York are so difficult. ... We expect quite a bit of business out of New York.\" Sage still plans to open a fifth processing center by the end of 2016 in one of the southern states. Its plan is to open a center every six months; each employs 50 to 80 when at full capacity. \nGet Columbus  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:06:47.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
