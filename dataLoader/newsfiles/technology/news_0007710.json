You'd probably better off knowing, at least, if your CV has been read or not. Or, as a PR person who's sending the latest press release, you'd like to track what the recipients did with it.These are just some of the situations in which the new attachment tracking feature being introduced by the popular Gmail extension Bananatag , could come handy.Bananatag is one of the most appreciated of a number of services - like Boomerang , Who Read Me , Rightinbox among others - that allow users to take control of their Google email by scheduling messages, setting up email reminders, and monitor whether their messages are read or not. The new attachment tracking feature will let people know which pages or slides of attached documents were viewed or skipped, in real time, providing engagement data similar to what was previously available for website visits, but for the files users send with their emails.It will only be available for paid plans, starting from $6.25 a month.Knowing whether a file you sent by email has been opened is not, by itself something completely new, or groundbreaking. Other products, like the one provided by a startup called Yesware , that allow sales persons to get this kind of information, or Livehive .But they are mainly designed for enterprises and cover a certain market niche, while Bananatag, with some 200,000 clients so far, could make attachment tracking become more widespread and available to anyone's who willing to spend six bucks a month.\"Our view is that more data helps senders better understand the effectiveness of their email content and make informed decisions on how they follow up on them. Often it helps users send fewer emails, which saves everyone time,\" Bananatag's Andrew Benes tells me by email.Sounds cool, and I can see how this kind of feature could prove useful in many cases, but I also wonder whether some people could find the whole thing of having their opening behavior tracked disturbing.There are options for users that feel concerned about this, however. These include viewing emails in plain text mode, or not clicking through links in emails. As for attachment tracking, if users download or print an attachment, their activity is not tracked, apart from that they took those actions with the file.If, instead, they open the file (it could be a PDF, a presentation, or another file format) in a Web viewer, the sender will see how many pages they have read and for how long, on a 'heatmap' that shows the level of engagement.", "external_links": ["http://whoreadme.com/", "http://livehive.com/", "http://www.rightinbox.com/", "http://venturebeat.com/2014/03/11/yesware-attaches-new-product-feature-makes-sales-email-tracking-more-robust/", "http://www.boomeranggmail.com/", "http://bananatag.com/"], "published": "2015-09-14T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:04:56.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
