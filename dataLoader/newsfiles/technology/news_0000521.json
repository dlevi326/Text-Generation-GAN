Dubbed OTTO, this handy robot is designed for heavy-load transport within industrial environments. \nAccording to the manufacturer, OTTO is ideal because traditional material handling systems can be expensive and any infrastructure changes make adapting to a new environment difficult. OTTO can transport 3,300 pounds at up to 4.5 mph, while also tracking optimal paths and avoiding any possible collisions. \nOTTO has also secured the backing of industry giant GE, who announced that they would partner as a strategic investor with the robotics manufacturer. \nSO WHAT DO YOU THINK? \nAre automation systems like OTTO or Amazonâ€™s Kiva robots indicative of a broader industry trend? Could these industrial innovations give manufacturers an edge against low-cost offshore competition? \nEmail us or leave your comments below. \nTune in every weekday for your next Manufacturing Minute.
