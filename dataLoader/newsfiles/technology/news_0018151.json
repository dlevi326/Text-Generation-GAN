It said emissions need to be at least 17 billion tons lower to limit warming below 2 degrees C. \nThe U.S., China and other countries accounting for two-thirds of global gas emissions have announced targets so far.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T10:28:14.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
