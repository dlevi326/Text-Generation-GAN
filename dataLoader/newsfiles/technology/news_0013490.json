The Baby Focus is a detachable device for all mobile phones which comprises of a colorful rattle to attract the attention audibly, and then retains the attention visually giving you time to take the photograph of the subject with the impression of them looking right down the lens. The Baby Focus saves your phone’s memory by avoiding blocks of the same photograph, thereby capturing actual memories.\nThe rattle will be available in five different colors, including Pretty in Pink and Brilliant Blue. Also, because of the extendable arms, it will fit on most mobile phone devices such as the Windows Range, the Samsung S3 to S6 Edge, and the iPhone 4 through to the iPhone 6+.\nHowever, before this product can begin capturing memories for parents and grandparents alike, The Baby Focus needs help. That’s why they launched their Kickstarter campaign on Sunday August 23. The goal of this project is to raise $60,000 AUD by September 21, 2015. The funds raised will go towards tooling, production, packaging, and marketing.\nTo help bring this innovative product to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign here and pre-order yours now. The Baby Focus devices will be delivered between October 2015 and December 2015.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign and help parents with an everyday problem! Help The Baby Focus reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people who know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nAbout The Baby Focus:\nThe Baby Focus was created by Dave Canavan to solve the problem of trying to get your child or pet to look at your phone so you can take that perfect photograph with them looking right down the lens.\nMedia Contact Details:\nDave Canavan\nM: +61448 034 345:\nE:\nAvailable for TV, radio and print and I am a seasoned presenter on and off screen.\nPhotographs and Videos to use:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/94d7o1b38tr4w5t/AABxMXHVbHsir_MAR7uJxSXpa?dl=0", "external_links": ["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/573088777/the-baby-focus?pr", "https://www.dropbox.com/sh/94d7o1b38tr4w5t/AABxMXHVbHsir_MAR7uJxSXpa?dl=0"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T10:36:16.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
