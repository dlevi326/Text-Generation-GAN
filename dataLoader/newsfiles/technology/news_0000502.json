I think they [a group of armed men] were waiting for us because my husband locked up the shop and before he could even sit down they were around him,\" she said.\n\"They shouted at him to give them the keys, but I had them so I passed them to him and then one of them came around and opened my door. Then they took me out and they were shouting at me to give... the money and I gave him both my cell phones,\" she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:04:49.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
