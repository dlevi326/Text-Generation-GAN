Any further delay will make matters difficult as the money crosses Indian shores very quickly.\n\n\"Victims of online fraud should complain to the police as early as possible, which means the moment money gets deducted from the bank account. In any online banking transaction, the gateway clearance takes at least 24 hours. So, if victims approach the police without wasting time, we can freeze the money and there are 90 per cent chances of recovery,\" joint commissioner of police (CCS) T Prabhakar Rao told TOI.\n\nAccording to the police, lack of foolproof system in issuing ID cards such as Aadhaar, voter ID etc is compounding the problem. Criminals obtain these IDs illegally and use it to open bank accounts. Most banks do not bother with background verification or check whether the account holder resides in that address or not. Thus, when investigators pull out accounts where money gets illegally transferred, they often reach a dead end.\n\nInternational gangs sometimes are also in connivance with locals who help them use bank accounts for the initial transfer of money. From these accounts, the money quickly reaches international accounts.\n\nFor instance, the CCS officials recently arrested one Dhirendra Kumar from Delhi in connection with a matrimonial fraud. He was a repeat offender and was helping Nigerian frauds use several transit bank accounts. People like him often get commissions of eight to 20 per cent.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T03:44:01.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
