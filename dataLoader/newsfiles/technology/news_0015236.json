AT&T said it may value the assets at the so-called Simadi exchange rate of about 200 bolivars per U.S. dollar, according to the filing. Venezuela introduced the Simadi rate in February as part of a currency devaluation.\n\"If AT&T changes to the Simadi exchange rate, it will have a negative impact on reported revenues, operating income and the fair value of our investment in the Venezuelan subsidiary,\" the company said in the SEC filing on Friday.\n(Reporting By Tim McLaughlin ; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:11:58.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
