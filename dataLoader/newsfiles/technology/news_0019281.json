Credit: ITV Border Cumbria Police says the force's two new drones have already been used to good effect, in a number of missing person searches.\nAnd they say the new resource will not replace police patrols.\nEarlier this year the unmanned aerial vehicles were brought in to be tested, and they've now been official unveiled by the force.\n£2,300 Cost of each drone 500m Distance from which officers on the ground can control the drones Police say they will be using the equipment in line with the current Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations.\nThe benefit of using UAVs to assist police operations has already been proven in other police force areas and we believe this is going to be an innovative and cost-effective resource that will enable officers to save lives and tackle criminal activity.\nThe UAVs will help collect evidence and monitor events from a distance which would help us detect crime and prosecute offenders. The UAVs can also be deployed into situations where deploying patrols would put members of the public or officers themselves at risk.\nPreviously the only way officers in Cumbria could gain aerial assistance was to call out a police helicopter from the National Police Air Service. This would not only be a costly resource for the force but it can also be time-consuming. The use of the UAVs however provides a solution to this problem.\nUAVs will only be deployed when required and they will not replace patrols. They are an effective resource that provides police with an efficient air advantage.\"\n– Chief Inspector Matt Kennerley, from the Operational Support Unit Last updated Tue 1 Sep 2015 Read more 2 updates Police drones taking off in Cumbria Technology Cumbria Cumbria Police", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T06:28:12.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
