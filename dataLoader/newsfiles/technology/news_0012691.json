But the tasty game fish is almost never found in the Cuyahoga, historically one of the most-polluted rivers in the country.\nHowever, roughly 45 years after the fire that sparked the modern environmental movement, the success of efforts to clean up the crooked river can be measured by the fish found there.\n\"Fish are our benchmark, our canary in the coal mine,\" said Jane Goodman, executive director of Cuyahoga River Restoration: \"If the fish are abundant, healthy and diverse, then that is a good sign.\"\nJane Goodman Cuyahoga River Restoration Most of the signs were good Wednesday morning during the three hours the sewer district crew spent on a retrofitted bass boat in the river, electro-shocking the water to collect whatever floated to the surface.\nAfterward, they tallied their catch on the sandy shoreline, separating the fish by species into holding buckets. Then they examined each fish for lesions, tumors or eroded barbs, weighed them, and released them back into the river. Visible signs of pollution were minimal.\nCrew leader John Rhoades' eyes widened as he scooped up the small green fish from one of the buckets, cradled it in his hand and looked closer.\n\"Look at that, a walleye!\" he said,\nAmong the 27 species of fish collected were several pollution-intolerant species. They included golden redhorse, greenside darter and the walleye â€“ only the second that Rhoades and boat mate Seth Hothem could recall finding during their periodic fish-zapping forays into the river.\nTheir take included hundreds of different species of shiners, minnows, darters and suckers. This graph shows the gradual improvement of water quality in the Cuyahoga River based on fish-testing samples taken at the 7, 10, 11 and 16-mile marks of the river. Graph courtesy of Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District Rhoades considered his boat-piloting job a minor victory, noting that he managed to protect Hothem, his net man in the bow, from the dangers of hanging branches.\n\"John brought his A-game today,\" Hothem said. \"I usually get whacked in the head a few times.\"\nFortunately, no grass carp were among the catch. Grass carp are one of several invasive species known collectively as Asian carp, known for leaping into the air at the sound of a boat motor, and feared for the decimation they could cause to game fish if they escaped into the Great Lakes.\nGrass carp -- that are not the leaping Asian variety -- have been found by water quality monitoring crews during previous fish-gathering trips, and are shipped to an Ohio Department of Natural Resources testing facility. All of the grass carp from the Cuyahoga River have been found to be incapable of reproduction, and suspected of escaping from private ponds.\nGame fish collected during last week's survey included a few one-pound smallmouth bass, yellow and white perch, bluegills and three species of catfish: channel, flathead and bullhead. After the water temperature cools later in the fall, the crew expects to find steelhead trout.\nAmong the less-desirable species collected were freshwater drum -- aka sheepshead -- common carp and round goby. No sea lamprey were found.\nThere was no way to determine whether the walleye was hatched on the river -- as the crew hopes -- or from the lake. The fact that the walleye was present 10 miles from the mouth of the river was sufficient to excite the naturalists.\nKevin Kayle, a fish administrator at ODNR's Division of Wildlife, has been conducting a water quality evaluation on the Cuyahoga for the past four years, and was thrilled by the walleye news.\nWalleye spawn in the Maumee and Sandusky rivers in the lake's western basin, and also have been found in the Grand and Black rivers. That the Cuyahoga could potentially provide spawning grounds for walleye is cause for optimism, he said.\nKayle's study of river water from the Harvard-Denison Bridge to the mouth has found an improving diversity of larval fish based on the quality of habitat and the availability of aquatic food living in the mud.\nThe majority of larval fish he's finding are emerald shiners and gizzard shad, basically food for other fish and wildlife, he said. But he also has found good numbers of more desirable species such as bluegill, perch, bass, and catfish being produced in the river in recent years, Kayle said.\nNine years ago, the big news was the discovery of a pair of fresh water mussels in the same vicinity as last week's survey, just upstream from the district's Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant.\nThe Southerly plant empties an average of 125 million gallons of treated wastewater each day back into the Cuyahoga, and is considered one of the reasons the river quality has been improving in recent years.\nAdditional credit for the river's cleaner water goes to the Mill Creek Tunnel, a $200 million storm-water overflow pipe the sewer district built to the once badly polluted tributary to the Cuyahoga.\nAlso, the river passes through 26 miles of Cuyahoga Valley National Park, which was established about 40 years ago, and serves to filter the water and provide spawning grounds for fish.\nGoodman said the river's improvements 10 miles upriver are tempered by the paucity of species downriver in the five-mile shipping channel that runs from the ArcelorMittal steel mill to the mouth of the river, that she described as \"basically a 23-foot deep, steel-walled bathtub.\"\nRecent studies found the water in the shipping channel so stagnant that it took young fish 14 days to swim from the top of the channel to the mouth of the river.\n\"We're happy, not thrilled,\" she said. \"Once we give the smaller young fish some habitat to grow in, it's going to keep getting better.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T09:25:44.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
