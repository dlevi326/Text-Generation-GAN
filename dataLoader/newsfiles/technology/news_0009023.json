Do you want to help find those bugs or do you want to wait a bit and have a more trouble-free experience?\nSome people, like me, love to be early adopters.\nAt work, when a new version of the Mac OS comes out, I know there are going to be users here who want to upgrade. They’ll be coming to me to ask if they should upgrade or wait.\nComputers used for work need special consideration. Here we install the newest OS on a few computers and do some testing with all the software we use to put out a paper and website each day.\nWe have to make sure our core programs will work as expected before we start upgrading work computers.\nA lot of us want to work from home as well, or use our home computers to connect to the office network.\nAt home, if your computer is used only for fun, by all means upgrade if you feel like it. If you rely on your computer for your livelihood, you might want to slow down. Take stock of exactly what software you use to do your job. Is there special software involved? Check with that company to see if it has started supporting the new OS.\nCheck user groups or Internet discussion forums to see if people have had any trouble upgrading.\nThink long and hard about what would happen if your computer stopped working altogether. Do you have a backup plan?\nIf this makes you uneasy, slow down, do some reading and see what others have experienced. There’s likely no need to hurry.\nSpeaking of a backup plan, the days and weeks leading up to an upgrade are a great time to go through your hard drive, cull what you don’t use, and make sure you have a current backup.\nThis advice goes for smartphone users as well — delete any apps you don’t use and then make a backup of your phone.\nI do phone backups to the cloud and to my local computer before any upgrade.\nYou might want to connect your phone to your computer and make sure your photos are backed up. Phone backups happen a lot faster if your phone is not full of photos.\nOn Twitter:\n @jimrossman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jimrossman"], "published": "2015-09-20T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:45:03.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
