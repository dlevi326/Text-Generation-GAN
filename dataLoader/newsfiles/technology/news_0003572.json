The Apnea Observer was designed by developer Clemente di Caprio from Rome, Italy, who has been awarded $5,000 to help advance his prototype. Sleep apnea affects up to a quarter of the general population according to the British Journal of Anaesthesia , with 90 percent of sufferers remaining undiagnosed. If left untreated, this chronic sleep condition can lead to serious health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke and weight gain. \nThe competition was launched in February 2015 to raise awareness of how easily products can be designed with ARM CMSIS software components and middleware. It attracted more than 700 entries, with 350 moving to the development phase where entrants could choose to work with ARM Cortex ® -M processor-based development boards from Freescale, Infineon, NXP or STMicroelectronics. Fourteen entries were selected as finalists, with the three prize-winners chosen by a panel of judges including Jens Nickel (Elektor), Reinhard Keil (ARM) and Christopher Seidl (ARM). \nOther winners awarded prizes of $500-$3,000 include: Stephan Lubbers of Dayton, USA, for his WhereSat portable ham radio satellite finder Waldemir Cambiucci of Sao Paulo, Brazil, for his water consumption monitoring system with web interface Fernando Lichtschein of Buenos Aires, Argentina, for his framework for IoT workshops Bernhard Schloß of Tübingen, Germany, for his CamBot with optical image recognition. \n“It was impressive that so many participants with limited experience of ARM technologies completed projects in the short timespan available,” said Reinhard Keil, director of microcontroller tools, ARM. “This has reinforced our confidence that CMSIS and ARM tools are easy to learn and use. The ready-to-use software components also proved flexible enough for use across a diverse range of applications and enabled seamless access to a range of different ARM-based microcontroller families.” \nThe winning Apnea Observer monitors sleeping noises and detects acute sleep irregularities. The application runs on the NXP LPC4330, a dual-core microcontroller that combines the ARM Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M0 processors. The Cortex-M4 performs the audio analysis, making use of its integrated digital signal processing functionality, while the Cortex-M0 handles the data acquisition and storage. The device also engages the ARM Keil ® MDK-Professional file system component and CMSIS-Drivers to interface with the memory card and serial and audio capabilities. \nNotes to Editors \nFull details of all the winners’ innovations, along with other honourable mentions can be found on a dedicated blog on the ARM Connected Community . \nAbout CMSIS \nThe Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) provides a ground-up software framework for embedded applications that run on Cortex-M based microcontrollers. CMSIS was started in 2008 and the initiative is in close cooperation with various silicon and software vendors. CMSIS enables consistent and simple software interfaces to the processor and the peripherals, simplifying software reuse, reducing the learning curve for microcontroller developers. \nAbout Keil MDK \nKeil MDK Version 5 is the most comprehensive software development solution for Cortex-M processor based microcontrollers. MDK includes IDE, C/C++ compiler, debugger, Software Pack management, and CMSIS software components. The MDK Professional Edition also includes the MDK-Professional Middleware with software components for TCP/IP networking, USB Host and Device, File System, and Graphical User Interfaces. \nAbout ARM ARM (LSE: ARM, NASDAQ: ARMH.US) designs technology at the heart of the world's most advanced digital products.
