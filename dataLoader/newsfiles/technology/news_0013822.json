Tepper Quadrangle, both at Carnegie Mellon University. The support was announced in conjunction with the Carnegie Bosch Institute’s (CBI) 25 th anniversary, at which CBI also announced the appointment of Taya Cohen, Associate Professor of Organizational Behavior and Theory at CMU’s Tepper School of Business, as the newest junior faculty chair. \nLocated in Pittsburgh, CBI is the result of a unique alliance of the Bosch Group and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), making Bosch one of the first multinational companies to commit to international management initiatives while embedded within a university through its Bosch executive-in-residence. The institute serves as a source for executive education and research grants designed to advance the management of global companies. \n“We take pride in our role and are proud of the success CBI has achieved,” said Mike Mansuetti, president, Robert Bosch LLC. “With the international management resources provided by CBI, we’re pleased to have a role in contributing to the development of executives around the world.” \nThe Bosch Distinguished Professor in Security and Privacy Technologies chair has been granted to David Brumley, the director of CyLab, one of the largest university-based cybersecurity research and education centers in the United States. The goal of the new Bosch professorship is to support research in two areas. First, the creation of breakthrough technologies that enable Internet-scale systems, allowing the connection between the physical and cyber domains to be secure. Second, the development of next-generation technologies that enable and ultimately guarantee the use of personal data in accordance with individual privacy preferences in the ever-changing computing world. \n“As a global company focused on innovation and improving the quality of life, we work to provide innovative technological solutions to challenges facing our society now and in the future. The Internet of Things brings considerable promise, but also concern surrounding the security of our connected environment and the privacy of personal data,” said Jiri Marek, senior vice president, Bosch Research and Technology Center – North America. “This Distinguished Professor position will address these concerns with research to find breakthrough technologies and a holistic approach to security.” \nOngoing partnership \nIn addition to the distinguished professor position, CBI will distribute $1 million to support construction of the David A. Tepper Quadrangle, which will house the Tepper School of Business and become a home to major CMU initiatives including entrepreneurship and technology-enhanced learning. \nBosch and CMU established CBI in 1990 within the Tepper School of Business at CMU to focus on the improvement of international management through research, education and collaboration. The institute was made possible by a major endowment provided by the Bosch Group, whose goal was to develop research that would provide guidance for managers in an international environment and to improve the understanding of critical issues related to the global orientation of business. \nGoing beyond the traditional teaching of global business, the Bosch Group and CMU agreed that CBI, led by a seasoned Bosch executive as its president, would provide a diverse perspective through a unique on-campus presence and front-line involvement with faculty and leaders from academia. To do so, CBI sponsors five academic research chairs, funds research projects and conferences, and provides innovative executive education programs targeted to the needs of multinational companies. \n“These new gifts and initiatives will allow us to further the Carnegie Bosch Institute mission of improving international management,” said Sylvia Vogt, president, Carnegie Bosch Institute. “Positioned at the intersection of industry and academia, we are uniquely able to affect how researchers and managers think about the future of global business.” \nBosch provides CBI with an executive-in-residence arrangement, in which a Bosch executive manages CBI business operations while sharing their experiences and supporting research and teaching efforts at the Institute. \n“As a global company, we understand the importance of providing continuing education for executives leading multinational companies,” explained Mansuetti. \nThe CBI Governing Board is composed of Bosch executive management, CMU senior leadership and other executives from global companies. \nAbout Bosch \nHaving established a regional presence in 1906 in North America, the Bosch Group employs some 28,700 associates in more than 100 locations, as of April 1, 2015.
