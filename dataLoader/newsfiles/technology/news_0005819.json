Acquires AppRedeem, Inc., an Innovator in Mobile Rewarded Video, in an All-Stock Transaction September 21, 2015 05:46 PM Eastern Daylight Time \nAUSTIN, Texas--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Perk.com Inc. (TSX: PER) (“Perk” or the “Company”), a leading cloud-based mobile rewards platform provider, today announced it has completed the acquisition of AppRedeem, Inc. (“AppRedeem”), an innovator in rewarded video for mobile devices with its longstanding mobile rewards platform, pursuant to an all stock transaction. Under the terms of the transaction, stockholders of AppRedeem received an aggregate of 831,601 Perk common shares. Based on the closing share price on September 18, 2015, this transaction is valued at C$3,326,404. In the 12 month period ending June 30, 2015, AppRedeem generated revenue of approximately US $3.2 million. Based on historical and forecasted results, Perk believes that the acquisition will immediately add incremental earnings beginning in the fourth quarter 2015. \nTransaction Highlights: Enhanced scale and increased user base in the mobile rewards space Acquisition of a leading brand in the mobile rewards ecosystem Additional revenue and cost synergies are expected to enhance accretion to Perk shareholders Inclusion of accomplished highly skilled technical professionals to Perk’s management team \nBased in San Francisco and founded in 2010, AppRedeem ( www.appredeem.com ) is an advertising platform for mobile app discovery, branding and monetization. AppRedeem’s leading mobile application, AppTrailers allows AppRedeem members to receive points for watching trailers of the latest apps as well as popular videos. Members are then able to redeem points using Appredeem’s “Real Rewards” system in exchange for gift cards or cash. As of June 30, 2015, there have been over 7.9 million installations of AppRedeem apps and its users have redeemed more than $7 million in Real Rewards paid. \nTed Hastings, Chief Executive Officer of Perk, stated: “We are excited to complete this transaction, and to be working with the team at AppRedeem. At a time when the fundraising landscape has a high degree of uncertainty, we have been afforded an opportunity as a public company to utilize stock as payment for this transaction; this has served to expedite our growth strategy without impacting our capital resources. This acquisition is consistent with the objectives we have stated of increasing our user base and advertising inventory as well as expanding our suite of products, which will assist in increasing CPM and fill rate over time. These types of transactions are a win for our three focus groups – our advertisers get exposure to more daily active users viewing their ads through to completion, our customer base gets access to a broader set of rewards and apps and our shareholders get an accretive deal.” \nSheffield Nolan, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of AppRedeem, commented: “The mobile rewards space is rapidly expanding and we have grown AppRedeem to the point where we are ready to broaden our reach. We considered going the course alone but with Perk, as an initial competitor of our business with a similar vision focused on complementary markets and publicly traded, it made sense to join forces and create a stronger company. We believe this transaction will further accelerate our growth and are proud to be a part of the Perk team.” \nAbout Perk.com Inc. \nPerk provides a rewards platform targeting consumers primarily by rewards for people's every day mobile and internet activities.
