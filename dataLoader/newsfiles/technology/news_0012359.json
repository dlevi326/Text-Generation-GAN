As soon as you get into the vehicle you know immediately that it’s a good place to be.”\nAt Jaguar, to make development and testing even more efficient, the vehicle integrity team’s subjective assessments are fed back into the CAE tools used by the vehicle dynamics CAE team. This improves the models and therefore delivers even better simulation results – and vice-versa. This iterative loop of continuous improvement ensures that prototype vehicles are ever better, benefiting the tuning and assessment process.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/web-1_-Jaguar-F-PACE.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T17:45:43.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
