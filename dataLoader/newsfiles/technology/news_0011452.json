The company is also planning for record sales of its new handset this time around.\nIt might not be a brand new iPhone but that doesn't mean that there's nothing new about the latest Apple gadget.\nYou might think Tim Cook was overstating things when he said “The only thing that has changed is everything”, but this time, there might be some truth in it.\nOn the outside, everything looks the same , except for a new colour addition to the line-up - the blushy Rose Gold .\nBut take a look under the hood and it’s all different. The iPhone 6S comes with a new A9 chip with the new M9 motion-co-processor embedded within to make your daily swipes flow even more smoothly.\nElissa Loi The iPhone 6s keeps the same sized screen as the 6\niPhone 6s: The camera The iSight camera has been bumped up to 12 megapixels and now takes Live Photos. These are something between a Vine and a still shot.\nWhat it does is record 1.5 seconds of moving action before and after you hit the trigger so you capture the story behind the picture.\nVideo loading Watch next Watch this video again Watch Next\nTo activate it, all you have to do is tap the new icon in the top bar within the camera app and it will flash Live to signal you’re in Live Photo mode. To switch back to the conventional still image, just tap the icon again and you’re gold.\nThe front-facing FaceTime camera maintains its megapixel count at 5MP, but what’s interesting is that you can now take selfies in the dark. The iPhone 6 utilises the display as a flash and in true Apple fashion, gives it a new name - Retina Flash.\niPhone 6s: 3D Touch\nWhat’s known as Force Touch on the Macbooks and Apple Watch is now called 3D Touch on the iPhone 6S.\nAnd this is the epitome of a slight change creating a very different user experience. Just like we’ve been conditioned to swipe and pinch out, we’re on the cusp of being mentally reconfigured to apply pressure to every display from here on out with the new generation of iPhones.\nElissa Loi\nCatchily called Peek and Pop (now these new terms we can handle for our near capacity Apple section of the brain), these two actions are the result of 3D Touch.\nEssentially, you Peek before you Pop when you apply pressure on content within native apps like Email and Messages. If someone sends you a URL in a text, press on it to Peek into a preview, a little window opening within Messages itself.\nAnd if you like what you see, just press a little harder to Pop yourself right into Safari.\nAside from allowing you to preview content before you decide to take further action, 3D Touch gives you shortcuts within your iPhone 6s.\nJust think of it as the right click on your mouse. If you press a little harder on 3D Touch-enabled apps, a list of three to four Quick Actions will pop right up. 3D Touching your Music app will let you play Beats 1 or play a recently played song while doing that on a third party app like Instagram will bring up the option to quickly post a photo.\nIt might take you some time to wrap your brain around 3D Touch.\nElissa Loi\nFor example, we found ourselves just tapping and holding on an app, triggering massive app seizure also known as the option to move them around and we had to hit the Home button to start over.\nBut as with all things Apple, your knowledge of multi-touch will grow to accommodate 3D Touch soon enough and you won't be able to stop 3D Touching everything.\nYou can also choose to deactivate 3D Touch or adjust its sensitivity if you so desire.\niPhone 6s: Conclusion\nEverything checks out well on paper. And what's probably the best loved feature on the iPhone - the camera - gets interesting upgrades.\nIf you're packing an iPhone 6, changing up for a 6s might not make sense. But if you have an iPhone 5s or earlier, the iPhone 6s is worth checking out, especially since 3D Touch will probably get more and more use case scenarios.\nYou can find all the latest gadget news, reviews and features at Stuff.tv\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/v1/unsecured/media/4221396001/201509/2176/4221396001_4473805286001_iphone.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://www.stuff.tv/apple/iphone-6s/review", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T21:46:25.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
