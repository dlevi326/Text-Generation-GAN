Chris Pearce Share on twitter by Ben Potter Australia has crept up a notch in a key global competitiveness league table, but remains outside the top 20 and is poorly equipped to fight the battle of the 21st century in innovation, the World Economic Forum says.\nUnderlining the steepness of the challenge facing the Turnbull government to build a more competitive society in the wake of the mining boom, Australia was placed a lowly 26th in innovation, 27th in business sophistication, 27th in goods market efficiency and 36th in labour market flexibility. It trails New Zealand, Malaysia, Taiwan and Canada in the overall rankings.\nOverall the nation improved a notch to 21st in the World Economic Forum's 2015-16 Global Competitiveness report , a welcome turnaround after four years of decline.\nBut chief executives surveyed by the WEF rated restrictive labor regulations and a poor work-force ethic as the biggest obstacle to doing business, followed by the burden and complexity of taxation, inefficient government bureaucracy, inadequate infrastructure and the lack of innovation.\nOn some measures the economy performs miserably. Australia ranks below the top 100 countries in wage determination flexibility, hiring and firing practices, the burden of taxation on incentives to work, and between 80th and 100th for impact of taxes on incentives to invest, and overall burden of regulation.\nIn innovation measures, Australia is 8th in the world in the quality of our scientific research institutions, but only 21st in patents and applications per capita, and university-industry collaboration in research and development, 27th in company spending on research and development, 25th in overall capacity to innovate and a poor 70th in government procurement of advanced tech products.\nTop level meeting The report comes as new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull prepares to meet business, union and community leaders to seek their views on whether a consensus can be reached on tax, welfare and labour market reforms to boost competitiveness and innovation.\nAustralia trails Malaysia, New Zealand and Taiwan in the Asia-Pacific region when it comes to a competitive economy. World Economic Forum Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox noted that countries with similar economic profiles did better than Australia\"s 21st position. Canada was 13th (up from 15th in 2014-15) and New Zealand was 16th (up from 17th in 2014-15).\nThe top two positions were taken out by Switzerland and Singapore, two countries that outgunned Australia in a recent beauty parade for a new CSL blood products plant.\nThey were followed by the United States, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Sweden Finland and Britain – which has put a major effort into attracting start-ups and research-based businesses – in tenth spot.\nAustralia's single largest trade partner, China, was ranked the 28th most-competitive economy, the same position it held in 2014-15.\n\"This WEF report underlines the importance of Canberra's new focus on shifting the policy discussion in Australia towards improving our workplace relations, taxation and innovation performance,\" Mr Willox said.\n\"This should be front and centre in the 'summit' of business and community leaders with the PM later this week.\"\n​New Industry, Innovation and Science Minister Christopher Pyne has picked up an innovation and competitiveness agenda from his predecessor Ian Macfarlane aim at bringing research priorities into closer alignment with the need for firms in fields such as advanced manufacturing, to be more internationally competitive.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@OBenPotter", "http://www3.weforum.org/docs/gcr/2015-2016/Global_Competitiveness_Report_2015-2016.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-30T09:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:18:39.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
