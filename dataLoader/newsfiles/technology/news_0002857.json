The new automotive wireless communication SoC is designed for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication in the 5.9-gigahertz (GHz) band. \nThe R-Car W2R delivers top-class performance when using Renesas’ exclusive radio frequency (RF) system design technology. It is the first device of this type capable of reducing out-of-band transmit emissions to less than –65 decibel-milliwatts (dBm) (Note 1), achieving the requirements of the European standards organization European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). Transmitting high-quality signals with very little interference makes it possible to incorporate V2X into various types of Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) applications, such as forward collision warning and lane keep assistance. The R-Car W2R also conforms to the IEEE 802.11p communication standard for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) used in Europe and North America. \nPrevious safe driving assistance systems relied on technologies such as camera images, infrared signals, and milli-wave radar (Note 2). However, there are tradeoffs with these, such as the inability to track traffic conditions over wide areas and difficulty obtaining information on vehicles approaching intersections where visibility is poor. V2X aims to reduce vehicular accidents and traffic congestion by enabling direct, bi-directional communication between vehicles (V2V) and between vehicles and signal devices or road signs (V2I), without the need to route data through the cloud. V2X communication standards are being adopted in various countries, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) mandate on V2V communications technology implementation , and a number of companies, including Renesas, are accelerating development work in this area with the expectation that V2X will become an important technology for drivers in the years ahead. \nEurope and North America have already adopted the IEEE 802.11p 5.9 GHz band wireless communication standard, which enables vehicles to obtain information on approaching vehicles outside line of sight and over a wide area. The R-Car W2R complies with this standard and enables the reliable collection of information on vehicles and infrastructures over a wide area to enable high-quality signal transmission. When combined with existing products based on the R-Car platform, it enables bi-directional V2V and V2I communication of information that cannot be picked up using camera images or radio waves. This allows ADAS systems development for enhanced safety and comfort, making it possible to alert the driver with accurate, real-time information. \nKey features of the R-Car W2R SoC: \n(1) Exclusive RF system design technology that reduces out-of-band transmit emission to less than the –65 dBm level for the first time ever \nThe R-Car W2R is based on exclusive RF system design technology that reduces noise generation by the chip itself and combines with a filter to block external noise, resulting in the suppression of out-of-band noise to less than the –65 dBm level for the first time ever in a device of this type. This satisfies the demanding requirements set by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and delivers leading level of low out-of-band noise. This also makes it possible to track traffic conditions over wide areas and to obtain accurate information on vehicles approaching intersections where visibility is poor. Thus, 5.9 GHz band wireless communication can now be incorporated into driver assistance systems requiring the highest level of safety. \n(2) IEEE 802.11p compliance and single-chip integration of communication functions from RF to the physical layer (Note 3) and the data link layer (Note 4) \nThe R-Car W2R integrates the V2X communication functionality for linking RF to both the physical and the data link layers in a 10 mm x 10mm single package. This contributes to the compactness of vehicle information systems. Previously, separate chips were needed to link the RF and the physical layer and the RF and the data link layer. The R-Car W2R leverages Renesas technology to miniaturize analog circuit designs and mixed analog-digital design technology to accurately analyze the effects of noise generated by digital circuits on analog circuits. \n(3) V2X ecosystem helps system manufacturers reduce development time and costs \nTo help reduce ADAS design complexity for system manufactures working with the new R-Car W2R, Renesas has developed a starter kit, which combines all the components required in a V2X unit including the R-Car E2 SoC, which implements security IP ideal for V2X applications, and along with drivers and software verified with ITS protocol partners. The reference design, in which the R-Car W2R is integrated in a compact module with RF components in an optimized design, is available with the related design information to help reduce the initial design time and costs. All the components required in a V2X unit including the R-Car E2, which implements security IP ideal for V2X applications, are provided as part of a starter kit that also comes with drivers and software verified with ITS protocol partners. The system manufacturers can utilize the starter kit and Renesas ecosystem partners to migrate their own software, reducing the time required for verification testing and other processes. \nRenesas plans to offer solutions with support for V2X applications by combining the R-Car W2R with existing R-Car products for cockpit and ADAS applications. \nPricing and Availability \nSamples of the R-Car W2R will be available from October 1, 2015, priced at US$30.00 per unit. Mass production of the R-Car W2R is scheduled to begin in December 2016 and is expected to reach a volume of 500,000 units per month by December 2018. (Pricing and availability are subject to change without notice.) \nFor more information on Renesas, follow Renesas Electronics America at @RenesasAmerica on Twitter and http://www.facebook.com/RenesasAmerica . \n(Note 1) A value of 0 dBm is equivalent to 1 mW and –65 dBm to approximately 0.3 nW. \n(Note 2) The frequency band is 30 GHz to 300 GHz. \n(Note 3) The first layer of computer communication functionality as formulated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
