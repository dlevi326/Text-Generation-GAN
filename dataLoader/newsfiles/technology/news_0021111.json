(GILD) said its investigational combination treatment for HIV-1 infection met its primary efficacy and safety goals in a phase 3 study.\nShares rose 1.9% to $103.45 in recent premarket trading.\nThe study looked at the investigational combination treatment--emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide--among virologically suppressed adult patients switching from HIV treatment regimens containing Gilead's Truvada. At week 48, patients in the study receiving the experimental therapy and Truvada both reached similar levels of virologic suppression. Gilead said the treatment also showed statistically significant differences in bone safety and renal safety.\nGilead Chief Scientific Officer Norbert Bischofberger said in prepared remarks on Wednesday that \"for more than a decade, Truvada has been a cornerstone of HIV therapy, and the results of this and other recent trials demonstrate the potential of F/TAF to become a next-generation backbone.\"\n\"The results from this study reinforce the efficacy, as well as the renal and bone safety advantages of TAF for patients who face a lifetime of treatment,\" he said.\nGilead said the continuing study also will assess safety and efficacy, as well as the secondary study goals related to renal and bone safety at week 96.\nGilead filed a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the combination treatment in April. The FDA is expected to decide whether to approve the drug by April 7, 2016.\nThe Foster City, Calif.-based biopharmaceutical company, which traditionally had been know for its HIV/AIDS treatments, recently has seen its sales driven by its new hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com\nSeptember 02, 2015 09:18 ET (13:18 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:28:16.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
