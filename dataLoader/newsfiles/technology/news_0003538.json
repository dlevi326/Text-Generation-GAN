I knew by the way his face was curved inwards it couldn't be good news. He was resigning. The first words that came out of my mouth was, \"I won't stay here if you're not.\" The truth is I had been miserable for as long as I can remember, but he had made it bearable.\nOver worked under paid\nMy misery was caused by the fact that I was doing a job suitable for three people, or that I was barely qualified to do half the stuff that was piled on me – in all honesty I was happy to be doing all that for one reason – experience. However, I lost hope when I realised that my employers would do anything to keep me where I was, they refused to take me for training (because the company \"didn't\" have money) and sometimes they wanted to see that I was really committed, despite having worked for them for six months without pay.\nAt this point I no longer felt the job was worth the struggle of having a side job to support it ( I made this known to my superiors). Only then I was offered assistance with transport money, a sum of R200, yes R200. With that minor relief, I continued slaving like a dog for another three months without pay, before I was hired. Well my supervisor forced them to hire me, otherwise they were happy to pay me with copious amounts of \"thank yous\".\nThe silent killer\nThe other reason for my dissatisfaction was the editor. I am convinced she was sent from the depths of hell to annihilate my soul. My Ed was not the breathing-fire-dragon type you see in movies. She was awfully sweet it made honey bitter. When I finally became permanent at the company, she fetched me from home and dropped me off. On my birthday she bought me flowers, chocolates and took me out for lunch. Did I mention how much she loved my writing? I would sometimes hear her chuckling out loud as she read some of my pieces and she would come over to my desk and high-five me. If she was swamped with work she'd Skype me: \"Well done! Great article\". She just never missed a chance to tell me how gifted I am. As a result she never really gave me any real feed back apart from an enthusiastic, \"well done!\" As you can imagine, I never knew where to improve and whenever doubt creeped in, I would quickly dismiss it by reminding myself of all her positive affirmations. At the back of my mind I knew I couldn't be that excellent, no one is. I would ask to have little meetings with her in the boardroom and print out my articles so we could go over them together. She never allowed it. \"I'm happy with your writing there's nothing to correct,\" she would re-assure me.\nAll hell breaks loose\nEven though I knew this was all too good to be true, I still believed she was sincere, well that was until I overheard a conversation between her and one of our colleagues. At first I was curious to hear who she and her companion were talking about. Even when I heard my name. She's told me many a time that I was the best at what I do and besides we were car buddies, hell we even spent our lunch hours together.\nNot so great after all\nAfter that day something weird started happening. I kept being called into the boardroom (by my mentor) as many as three times a week, because she'd told him I was not taking pride in my work (even though she'd told me the article was good when I asked for feedback). She'd tell him that I missed deadlines (even though she would send me to events and give me extension on deadlines). Now it was clear that we were Nicki Minaj and Tylor Swift. There was definitely B ad B lood between us.\nShoot me while I'm down\nA couple of days after I discovered that she was a wolf enveloped in a sheep's skin, I received an “accidental” email from her “confidant” with all their confer. There were lines like: \"she is so stupid! Gosh, working with here is like pulling teeth.\"\nAfter reading that email I wanted to just curl up in my room and die, never in my life had I been to demoralized. But I had to face her, every single day. Sometimes she would come to fetch me from home and I tried my damned best to act normal, while I pondered about what to do with the email. I toyed with the idea of sending it to the bosses, because they were in it too, they were labelled d*ck heads and other swear words that would make a pirate blush.\nThanks but no thanks\nFor a while I hated being at work and most of all she made realise that I too was capable of hating another. I hated her. I knew the only way to stop myself from turning into the spawn of the devil, I would have do something about it. So I wrote her a nice long email. My blows were precise and lacked mercy. I wrote it in such a manner that she would never be able to show it to anyone at the office, not even her new husband, because I Quote: d all the things she said about everyone including her beau. Showing it to people would have forced her to explain the Quote: s (I know this is a lousy form of revenge but, that's as dirty as I can get). Looking back I should have known not to believe a person who felt comfortable discussing the love of her life the way she did.\nSo as I was contemplating my resignation and potentially being homeless. I got retrenched from this high-end publishing company (how's that for the law of attraction?) However, something even more strange happened the following day, I was offered the same job at half the pay. I laughed and laughed and moved to moved to Cape Town.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T14:07:48.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
