Terminal Petikemas Surabaya (TPS), the largest terminal in Surabaya Tanjung Perak and the second largest in the country. \n“We are committed to our operations there and look forward to cementing our relationships. With our global experience we work closely with our partners to support the development and economic growth of the countries and communities in which we operate. The President’s visit builds on already existing amicable relations and lasting partnerships that benefit both countries.” \nBin Sulayem added that Dubai’s trade with Indonesia amounted to more than US$1 billion in the first six months of 2015. \nDP World has managed PT Terminal Petikemas Surabaya (TPS) terminal since its acquisition of P&O in 2006. It is a joint-venture with a 51% shareholding held by the state-owned company Pelabuhan Pelindo III and 49% held by DP World. \nFact File: The TPS terminal is located on the northern shore of eastern Java along the edge of Madura Strait and is the gateway to Eastern Indonesia, serving international and domestic trade for a wide-ranging hinterland. \nBy virtue of its geographical location close to cargo catchment areas with good connectivity to the hinterland by sea, rail and direct toll-way access, TPS is ideally located to act as an international and domestic transhipment point for all of Northern and Eastern Indonesia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T02:28:45.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
