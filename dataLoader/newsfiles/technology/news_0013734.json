We are getting fantastic feedback from our small business customers that love the ease of use of QuickBooks online, they love the time it saves them and the simplicity on smartphones and tablets.\"\nAnother important factor, according to Ms Maury, is ensuring that accountants and bookeepers aren’t seen as a sales channel but more as partners.\nIntuit’s growth is to a large extent driven by the continued migration of businesses from desktop to a cloud environment. However, the US giant is picking up customers from the other established players in the market like MYOB and Xero.\n“The biggest potential for us is in the small businesses that are not using any software right now,” Ms Maury said.\nA customer base of 33,000 may not seem that large given the current market share of MYOB and Xero, but Brad Paterson, vice president and managing director of Intuit in Asia Pacific, said the rate of growth is phenomenal.\n“A year ago we had just under 7,000 customers in Australia and we have grown now to be well over 30,000, it took nine years for Xero to get to that 200,000 number,” Mr Paterson said.\n“The rate at which we are going, it’s very clear that we are taking share not just from our competitors but we are also expanding the addressable market.”\nThe fierce competition in the local cloud accountancy market is underpinned by the fact that there’s plenty of room in Australia for all of the existing players.\nWith a large portion of the small business segment yet to make the switch to the cloud, Intuit is focused on enticing them to make the switch on the back of the QuickBooks Online offering.\n“Our focus really is on building great quality integrations and partnerships that best meet our local customer needs,” Ms Maury said\nIntuit may be the top dog in the US market but it is very much a challenger brand in Australia and Mr Paterson said that the dynamic has been a big driving force for Intuit’s local team.\n“We are the underdogs in Australia and we love it,” he said.\n“We are (also) a challenger in the UK market and we invest very heavily in the markets where we are challengers because we have aspirations to be number one.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T13:00:54.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
