That's because it applies to phones that are no longer popular. \nThe most recent phone affected by the injunction, the Galaxy S3, was released in 2012 â€” long enough ago to be eclipsed by slicker smartphones in the rapidly evolving market for mobile technology. Samsung recently began selling the Galaxy S6, which was unaffected by Thursday's decision. \nSamsung could also revise the features covered by the injunction.
