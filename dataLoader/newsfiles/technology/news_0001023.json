The announcement Wednesday comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping is in the U.S. and plans to hold a summit with President Barack Obama on Friday. Cybersecurity is one of the top items that will be discussed.\nThe announcement doesn’t increase the estimate that the hack compromised sensitive information and Social Security numbers of 21.5 million individuals, some of whom were screened for U.S. government security clearances. OPM said an interagency team will continue to analyze the data as it prepares to mail notification letters to those impacted.", "external_links": ["https://www.opm.gov/news/releases/2015/09/cyber-statement-923/\\"], "published": "2015-09-23T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:27:34.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
