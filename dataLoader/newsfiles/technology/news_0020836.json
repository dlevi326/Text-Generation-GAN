Ambarella shares fell 14% to $77.47 a share, as the wearables outlook masked an otherwise strong second quarter.\nA GoPro spokesperson didn't immediately respond to request for comment.\nAmbarella said new products are typically launched in the third quarter, in time for the holidays, but GoPro in June and July of this year introduced two new productsâ€”the Hero+ LCD and Hero4 Session cameras.\nStifel analysts noted that those products have been well received but aren't necessarily driving significant growth, and year-over-year comparisons will be tough due to the upcoming anniversary of the launch of GoPro's Hero4 camera line. Stifel maintained its third-quarter outlook for GoPro but trimmed its guidance for the fourth quarter.\nFor the upcoming 2016 fiscal year, Stifel said it will take a \"more conservative view...given concerns about potentially decelerating trends for the category.\"\nThough Amabarella's forecasts were specific to the current quarter, the guidance has sparked concerns that the wearable camera segment is declining faster than previously expected.\nRaymond James analyst Tavis McCourt said in a note that he has expected action camera sales to slow, but for GoPro to make up for those declines with growth in quadcopters and drones. But without a new camera for people to upgrade to during the holiday season, Mr. McCourt said camera segment declines could accelerate.\nMr. McCourt cut his 2015 earnings forecast for GoPro to $1.60 from $1.73 a share, citing a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter, and lowered his 2016 forecast to $2 from $2.35 a share citing slowing action camera growth.\nHe also lowered his price target on GoPro shares by 30% to $50.\nOn Tuesday, a report from Cleveland Research analyst Benjamin Bollin warned that there could be risks to GoPro's forthcoming third-quarter results.\nThe research report, which sent shares of GoPro and Ambarella lower Tuesday, said demand for GoPro's items appears to be falling below the company's estimates.\nGoPro went public in June 2014 and has seen sales surge recently amid big gains in Europe and Asia. Though GoPro's shares are now trading at less than half their all-time high of $98.47 reached last October, they are still well above their IPO price of $24 a share.\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com\nSeptember 02, 2015 11:05 ET (15:05 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:29:07.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
