In our HyperSound business, we continue to get positive feedback on our HyperSound Clear(TM) product and are looking forward to the upcoming launch. Finally, we secured $15 million in additional external financing in July and are now better positioned to capitalize on the high-value growth opportunities across our business.\" \nStark continued, \"Given our progress and the opportunity ahead, we have engaged Liolios to increase our institutional investor awareness. They will help us deliver the right message to the right audience, and establish high-quality relationships with influential members of the financial community.\" \nOver the course of the next several months, Liolios will work closely with Turtle Beach Corporation's executive team to continue developing and executing a comprehensive public investor strategy.
