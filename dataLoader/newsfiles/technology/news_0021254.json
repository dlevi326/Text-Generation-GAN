Now we are at the test phase.\" \n\"Our cooperation has evolved in a very good manner. We have even partly merged our offices at the site,\" TVO's project director Jouni Silvennoinen told AFP during a visit to the reactor. \nThe Olkiluoto 3 reactor, situated on a beautiful cape overlooking the sea, appears complete from the outside but inside some 40,000 wires have yet to be connected, as part of the automation process. \nPart of the automation system has been delivered by Areva's German partner Siemens and has been previously tested in Germany. \nFinland radiation safety authority STUK approved the tests and the systems are now being installed in Olkiluoto. \nThe reactor is now expected to start operations in 2018. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:02:23.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
