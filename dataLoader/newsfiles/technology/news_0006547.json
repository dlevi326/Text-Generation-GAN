While dynamic action, swelling music and sound, and stunning performances are all essential to a classic, so is an artistic sensibility that comes from a more classical discipline. Famous Frames helps connect filmmakers with visual artists, illustrators and cinematic storyboarders, and is now showcasing the contributions they have made in a new Famous Work section, to celebrate their 28th year in business. \nThe Famous Work section features work from Wet Hot American Summer, Furious 7, The Academy Awards, Bates Motel and more. The work includes commercials, TV, video games and more. The work itself is visualized side by the side with the finished product it inspired, showing what a crucial role the artists had in creating the world and the story. \nThe section also allows them to show off just a sample of their work, with further categories on the website exploring animatics and CGI, promotional artwork and more.
