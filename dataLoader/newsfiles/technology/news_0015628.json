The easy-to-use app funnels the sports dialogue into a real-time conversation for users to share and show off their player knowledge. Fans can post their player ratings and opinions on the app, as well as find out what players are trending based on the current user conversations about them.\n“FANSeye is the one-stop spot to gather information about your favorite players, what’s trending in the sports world and to catch up with your friends to talk about the big games,” said Arvind Sarin, founder and CEO, Copper Mobile. “Personally, as a big fantasy football fan, I can’t wait to start using the app to help me take home the win this year.”\nFANSeye was founded by Frank Provenzano, a former NHL executive with over 19 years of experience in the professional sports industry. Provenzano had the idea for an app that is driven by the fans and pre-sorts the conversation by players. Through FANSeye, users can choose their favorite players and add them to their ‘Player Feed,’ then post and rate their comments on the players.\nOne of the most unique features of FANSeye is the ‘FANSeyeQ’ ranking system that evaluates and rewards the most active users. Fans can impact each other’s FANSeyeQ score by voting thumbs up or thumbs down on other user’s comments and ratings. Those with the most popular content move up from ‘Benchwarmer’ to ‘Expert’ by contributing the most valuable content to the conversation. Experts are rewarded with the greatest power in the app, and their content is automatically curated into the ‘User Feed’ of all users.\nCopper Mobile has been working with FANSeye since June to quickly launch the app in time for football this fall. In just 12 short weeks, the Copper Mobile team created a redesign of an earlier version of the app, added new features, developed the Android version, updated the architecture and created a unique content management system.\n“I spent my career building scouting databases and metrics for teams, and I thought I could use that experience to develop a valuable and unique app database for the fans,” said Provenzano. “We are really excited to work with Arvind and the Copper Mobile team – they understand our vision, and have made the app into something much more engaging than I could have imagined.”\nCopper Mobile’s architecture innovations streamlined the process for FANSeye to add additional sports to the app in the future. Additional features included adding more player stats, simplifying the search options and developing the ability for users to filter between sports.\nCurrently, FANSeye offers NFL-specific content. In the spring of 2016 the app will be launching MLB followed by NCAA football next fall. Sports fans who are ready to jump into the FANSeye conversation can download the app on the App Store and Google Play .\nAbout Copper Mobile\nFounded in 2010 and based in Dallas, Copper Mobile excels at one thing above all others – building apps that make business sense.
