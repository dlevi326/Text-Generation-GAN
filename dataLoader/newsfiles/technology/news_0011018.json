The award reflects outstanding performance in such criteria as operational performance, year-on-year container volume growth, IT efficiency, advanced technology and customer satisfaction.\nAPMT Mumbai is one of three terminals currently operating at Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT), India’s largest container port, accounting for 45% of JNPT’s throughput, and approximately 20% of India’s total container traffic in 2014. \nRizwan Soomar, Chairman of APMT Mumbai, said: “We are honoured to be recognised as India’s best performing terminal and for setting a new national record in annual container throughput for Indian ports. \n“World-class port and terminal operations are crucial for India’s economic growth and the success of such government initiatives as ‘Make in India’.” \nThe annual India Maritime and Logistics Awards recognises top performers and individuals in the Maritime and Logistics industry across categories such as ports, terminals, shipping lines, customer and freight agents, corporate social responsibility and industry professionals.\nAs well as winning Container Terminal Operator of the Year for six consecutive years, APMT Mumbai has also won national awards, including Port/Terminal Operator of the Year – Health, Safety and Environment twice, Port/Terminal Operator of the Year - Safety and Quality in 2012, and International Maritime Offshore Logistics, Samudra Manthan Awards in 2011.\nRizwan Soomar said: “The issue of the Tariff Authority for Major Ports which restricts what private terminal operators at major ports are allowed to charge their customers remains a major concern.\n“India’s terminal operators, including ourselves, remain engaged with the government seeking a viable solution.  Our goal remains to do more and support India’s efforts around the Sagarmala project and establishing India as a regional trade hub. It is imperative however that we have the right policy environment that is transparent, realistic and market-driven.”\nFact File: APMT Mumbai is part of the APMT global terminal network and is a joint-venture between APMT and the Container Corporation of India (CONCOR-a Government of India undertaking).\nAPMT Mumbai is the first Indian terminal to feature among the Journal of Commerce (JOC) ‘Top Four’ global terminals for vessels working less than 8,000 TEU capacities.\nFor all the latest on APMT, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T19:03:25.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
