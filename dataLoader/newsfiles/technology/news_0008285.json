Many robots from the world of cinema may have once been perceived as a flight of fancy.\nHowever, in the 21st century, such fictional characters are becoming the inspiration for real-life robots with extraordinary talents.\nHere, we look at 15 robots featured in TV and film which made their mark on the big screen.\n:: Metropolis (1927) \nThis film was set 100 years in the future - and now, 2026 is barely a decade away. It features the Maschinenmensch (that's Machine-Human in German) - the first-ever depiction of a robot in film.\n'Maschinenmensch' in Metropolis.

Both have formed an unlikely bond.\nR2-D2 and C3-PO.

He has a \"brain the size of a planet\", but feels bored and depressed because he never gets the chance to use it.\nMarvin the Paranoid Android.

Pic: Yao Jianfeng/REX Shutterstock\nHe practically leads the Autobots, has excellent morals, and can also bring martial arts to the table when required.\n:: Terminator (1984 to present) \nPlayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, terminators are robotic soldiers who can also be programmed to assassinate humans.\nArnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator. Pic: Moviestore/REX Shutterstock\nUnlike many other robots depicted in film, they are capable of speaking naturally, reading, smelling...even bleeding.\n:: Robocop (1987) \nThis film looks ahead to the 2020s, when a city goes bankrupt and its police force is privatised.\nRobocop. Pic: Snap Stills/REX Shutterstock\nTo tackle high crime rates, an injured officer is rebuilt as RoboCop - but although he is designed to uphold the law and protect civilians, it doesn’t go to plan.\n:: Bicentennial Man (1999) \nAn android is sent to work as a housekeeper in the home, voiced by Robin Williams.\nBicentennial Man, Andrew. Pic: Moviestore/REX Shutterstock\nHis ability to express emotions becomes clear, and eventually, he requests freedom from his owner.\nThis soon turns into a battle to be recognised as a human being.\n:: I, Robot (2004) \nSet in 2035, the film works on the premise that robots are governed by three laws: they must never injure a human being, they must always obey orders, and they must protect their own existence on the condition they can do so without breaking the first two laws.\nI, Robot. Pic: Snap Stills/REX Shutterstock\nAs you'd expect, in this film, the laws aren't followed.\n:: WALL-E (2008) \nThis Pixar film explores the story of WALL-E, who has been assigned the task of cleaning up Earth after it is abandoned by humans.\nWALL-E. Pic: Everett/REX\nHe soon falls in love with another robot, EVE, who is vastly more modern and sophisticated in comparison.\n:: Ex Machina (2015) \nAva is a humanoid robot built by the owner of a major search engine, and has learned her behaviour after absorbing billions of phone calls made by humans.\nAva in Ex Machina. Pic: Everett/REX\nA young programmer is asked to perform a Turing test, where Ava has to prove she has human qualities…but events soon take a sinister turn.\n:: Robot Revolution: The Future Is Happening Now", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:09:10.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
