He had also announced his decision to field Dalit Sena candidates in all the districts in poll-bound Bihar to defeat NDA nominees.\nHe announced his patch-up with his father-in-law and Chirag at a press conference here.\n\"I take back all the comments made by me against Ramvilas Paswan and Chirag Paswan in the past,\" Sadhu said.\n\"My complaint has been redressed after a talk with the two. Ramvilas Paswan is our leader as well as guardian,\" he added.\nAsked if he was planning to contest Raja Paker (reserved SC) seat in Vaishali from where the party has already named Ramvilas Paswan's younger brother Pashupati Kumar Paras, Sadhu said, \"The party will decide the matter.\"\nParas has been fighting elections from two seats Alauli and Raja Paker, both reserved seats. Earlier, Sadhu had shown keenness to fight against Paras to avenge his \"insult\".\nHe dimissed making any deal and asserted that \"no deal is made within family.\"\nSadhu was expecting nomination from Kutumba (reserved SC) seat in Aurangabad from LJP but the ticket went to partner Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) where former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi's son Santosh Kumar Suman has been named as NDA candidate.\nSadhu was later kicked out as chief of Dalit Sena, a pocket organisation of the downtrodden of the LJP chief.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:28:28.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
