The PH9385 transformer series achieves 12mm creepage in a patent-pending, low-profile, compact, 17x16x7mm surface mount package. \nPulse’s transformer is built with a unique Sidecar package that has the coil inserted at one side of the open package and the high isolation pins placed on the other side. This configuration separates the coil and pins so there is a greater creepage distance between them. It also enables the package to be smaller while still maintaining an optimal creepage distance. \n“Isolation in existing toroidal transformer packages is limited by the proximity of the pins to the wound coil,” explained Gerard Healy, product manager, Pulse Electronics Power Business Unit. “The isolation can be enhanced by encapsulation, but this adds cost. This compact surface mount package achieves a high level of creepage without requiring encapsulation, so besides getting great performance, they are less expensive than encapsulated transformers.” \nPulse Electronics’ new PH9385 series builds on its PH9085 series of 2.5KV power transformers to offer protection for higher isolation applications. These transformers are RoHS-compliant and meet standard EIA481 requirements. They are available in tube and tape-and-reel packaging. Prices start at about $0.84 (FCA HK) for 10,000 pieces. Lead time is eight weeks. Samples are immediately available.
