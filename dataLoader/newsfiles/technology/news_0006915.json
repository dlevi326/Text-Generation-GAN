Both coated and non-coated samples passed the test in response to the general outgassing criteria based up on the micro-VCM test. \nThe milestone marks yet more progress in the sector of additive technologies for the production of highly-durable end-use components. Windform XT 2.0 is a polyamide-based material carbon filled and it assures the maximum mechanical performance for 3D printing and additive manufacturing. Windform XT 2.0 is a Top Level laser sintering material characterised by high stiffness, strength and reduced weight. Windform XT 2.0 can replace finished parts for small run of production that are usually made with standard technologies such as injection mould, lamination of carbon fabric and metal replacement in some applications. All Windform 3D printing materials can be CNC machined and processed with tooling machines. \nLast year a group of students in the U.S. launched a KySat-2 satellite, a 1U CubeSat, into space with Windform components made by selective laser sintering. CRP USA notes several benefits for using the combination of SLS and Windform materials for providing parts that were both tough and robust but also extremely lightweight. The process was also selected for the benefits it provides for small production runs and replacement parts by lowering the time to market and production costs.
