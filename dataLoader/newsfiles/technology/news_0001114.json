For the first time, the National Association for Trusted Exchange (NATE) has joined with the Strategic Health Information Exchange Collaborative (SHIEC) and HIT Users Group (HUG)  to present a joint, comprehensive conference with speakers and presentations addressing critical HIE opportunities including enabling patient access to their health information. DataMotion's technology has been lauded for overcoming interoperability issues and enabling secure communications between healthcare providers, electronic health records (EHR) software and HIEs. More recently, the company broadened the reach of its services to benefit the rapidly growing patient engagement and population health markets. The company was enlisted as a Platinum Sponsor of the HIE Conference to further promote and contribute to the movement towards greater patient engagement.\n\"Having access to health data helps patients make better decisions and leads to better outcomes,\" said Aaron Seib , chief executive officer of NATE, a not-for-profit association with a primary goal of enabling consumers to securely access and share their health information with family care providers, doctors and others. \"DataMotion is very established in the secure exchange of protected health information in the provider domain and is well-positioned to enable consumer-facing applications and services to benefit from these capabilities as well. From patient portals to health and wellness apps, they're pioneering how consumers will receive, access and exchange their health data on the device of their choice. Their sponsorship of the HIE Conference further illustrates their commitment to greater patient engagement, our community and the future of healthcare.\" \nDataMotion has achieved great success in healthcare due to the flexibility of its interoperable, cloud-based secure data exchange platform. Agnostic in nature, the DataMotion platform integrates its secure delivery solutions with a wide range of clinical connections and workflows. This includes DataMotion Direct 6.1, which allows healthcare providers, patients and health systems to send and receive protected health information (PHI) using the Direct Secure Messaging protocol that meets Meaningful Use requirements, complies with HIPAA and greatly enhances the exchange of health information.\n\"The healthcare community overwhelmingly agrees providing patients with access to their health records is the next major step forward and will result in better outcomes,\" said Bob Janacek , co-founder and chief technology officer of DataMotion. \"As a company, we've long felt greater patient engagement is the future – consumers should be as informed and in-charge as possible. We're committed to supporting the efforts of leaders like NATE, SHIEC and HUG, and providing the technical foundation necessary to make this a reality as soon as possible.\"\nAbout DataMotion \nSince 1999, DataMotion™ SaaS technology has enabled organizations of all sizes to reduce the cost and complexity of delivering electronic information to employees, customers and partners in a secure and compliant way.

Emerging from the Western States Consortium, a pilot project supported by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), NATE was established as a not-for-profit organization in May 2013 . Consistent with NATE's mission to address the legal, policy, and technical barriers that inhibit health information exchange between entities within a state and across states, NATE leads and participates in a number of ongoing and emerging projects in the HIE domain. NATE has been operating its own Trust Bundles in production since November 2012 and recently took over administration of the Blue Button Consumer Trust Bundles.  Working with a broad set of stakeholders through multiple task forces, crowdsourcing and a call for public comment, NATE is proud to make available the first release of NATE's Blue Button for Consumers (NBB4C) Trust Bundle beginning in 2015. NATE will soon move into a new phase of development around Blue Button Trust Bundles.
