Source: Supplied\n“He fell in love with Victor Churchill, which maybe we shouldn’t be surprised about because everybody did. He fell in love with my father, my family the business, everything. He has been a massive, staunch supporter of what we do and what we stand for.\n“Obviously he is a mega star when you talk about people in the food industry. But he’s very conservative. If you look at Anthony Bourdain he has never sold out, he is a massive media personality, but he has never sold out.\nProject mastermind Anthony Bourdain.

Anthony Bourdain has never endorsed a thing in his life, yet he has put his name and his money towards this incredible food hall and he has asked our family and Victor Churchill and me to be a part of it.\"\nPuharich and his father have built up a formidable business which sells some of the best meat in the world, both in Australian and to the diners of New York, Singapore, Tokyo and Beijing. Despite being lured by other offers in the past, Puharich had maintained his focus on a “mega city”.\n“I’ve always had ambitions, I’ve resisted them,” he said. “I’ve had submissions from all around the world — Singapore, Hong Kong, mainland China, the United Arab Emirates, you name it.\n“But I have resisted the temptation to open up another Victor Churchill store because my dream has been to open a Victor Churchill overseas in one of the major cities, whether it be London, New York or Tokyo, one of the real mega cites of the world, and New York has always been high on my list. You speak to anybody in food, if you do business in New York you’ve basically made it.”\n$450 A KILO: THE MOST EXPENSIVE WAGYU BEEF EVER SOLD IN AUSTRALIA\nBourdain Market will be a 25,000 sqm collection of about 100 retail and wholesale food vendors from New York, the US and overseas, including fishmongers, bakers and now Victor Churchill butcher.\n“The guy scours the world and he is the most well-travelled (food) person in the world and I am just humbled that he has chosen us,” Puharich said. Anthony Bourdain has called Victor Churchill “the world’s most beautiful butcher shop”. Source: Supplied\nThe Hudson River Victor Churchill will maintain the look and feel of the Sydney store. Source: Supplied\nPuharich said the multi-million dollar New York venue would maintain the look and feel of his Sydney store but there were no plans or budget at this stage.\n“It will be pretty grand, pretty massive. We haven’t decided what we wanted to do in terms of design and concept, look and feel. It will be very much like what Woollahra does but it will be very much tailored for the New York/American market.\n“Money is not what drives us. New York is New York and you go to your grave happy knowing you have done something like that.”\nIncrease Text Size Decrease Text Size Print Email Share Add to Digg Add to del.icio.us Add to Facebook Add to Kwoff Add to Myspace Add to Newsvine What are these?
