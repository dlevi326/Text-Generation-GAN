Here's a quick look at the discovery:\nWHAT DID THEY FIND?\nThey recovered some 1,550 fossils, from the skeletons of at least 15 individuals. The cave is about 30 miles northwest of Johannesburg.\nHOW OLD ARE THE BONES?\nNobody knows. The researchers said they've been unable to get a date, but that they will keep trying.\nWHAT IS THIS CREATURE?\nBased on details of the bones, the scientists say in the journal eLife that it's new to science but a member of the evolutionary group called Homo, which includes modern people and our closest extinct relatives. The anatomy combines traits found in other Homo species with more primitive ones. The researchers conclude it's an early member of Homo, but they don't claim it's a direct ancestor of modern people. Experts said they don't believe it is.\nWHAT DO THEY CALL IT?\nHomo naledi (nah-LEH-dee). The second name, which means \"star\" in a local language, was chosen because the bones were found in the Rising Star cave system.\nHOW DID THE BONES GET INTO THE CAVE?\nThat's a mystery. They were found in a room that can be reached only by following a complicated pathway and squeezing through narrow passages. There's no sign that naledi lived there. The bones evidently were not dragged in by predators. Maybe the room was used to dispose of bodies, the researchers suggest.\n___\nOnline:\neLife: http://elifesciences.org/\n___\nMalcolm Ritter can be followed at http://www.twitter.com/malcolmritter", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/24/8607031/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://www.twitter.com/malcolmritter", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/24/8607031/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/32/8607368/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://elifesciences.org/", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/32/8607368/7/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-10T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:48:40.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
