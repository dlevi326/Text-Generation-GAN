Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will continue (as it has since at least 2006) to protect, or \"ring-fence,\" pursuant to customary covenants, the assets of certain special purpose subsidiaries (the \"Relevant Subsidiaries\") holding real estate and/or intellectual property assets. \nUnder the definitive documentation, the Relevant Subsidiaries will grant PBGC a springing lien on the ring-fenced assets, which lien would be triggered only by (a) failure to make required contributions to the Company's pension plan (the \"Plan\"), (b) prohibited transfers of ownership interests in the Relevant Subsidiaries, (c) termination events with respect to the Plan, and (d) bankruptcy events with respect to the Company or certain of its material subsidiaries. \nThe Company will continue to make required contributions to the Plan, the scheduled amounts of which are not affected by the Agreement. The Company has consistently managed its business such that it is able to meet its obligations to the Plan despite the historically unprecedented low interest rate environment. Although the Company believes that no basis exists under ERISA for an involuntary or distress termination of the Plan, PBGC has further agreed to forbear from initiating an involuntary termination of the Plan, except upon the occurrence of specified conditions. \n\"This agreement results from good faith discussions between the PBGC and the Company and is another positive step forward for the Company; it provides meaningful protections to the PBGC while preserving the Company's financial and operational ability to continue implementing the transformation,\" said Edward S. Lampert, Sears Holdings' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \nForward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements, including about our transformation through our integrated retail strategy, our plans to redeploy and reconfigure our assets, our liquidity and our ability to exercise financial flexibility as we meet our obligations and possible strategic transactions.
