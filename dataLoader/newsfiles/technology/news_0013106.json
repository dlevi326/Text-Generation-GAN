The slice-and-dice game has been downloaded more than a billion times. That’s no small number, so its Brisbane-based creator, Halfbrick Studios, celebrated with cake.\n“One of the guys here who was from the team that made Fruit Ninja, his wife makes cakes,” says Halfbrick’s chief executive, 40-year-old Shainiel Deo.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shainiel Deo of Halfbrick Studios. Photograph: Halfbrick Studios\nA reference to 2007 puzzle game Portal suddenly feels appropriate: was the cake a lie ? “You had to do it,” he laughs uproariously, before becoming intensely serious. “No. It was an awesome cake.”\nMaking video games in Australia is also serious business and not for the faint of heart. Fellow Brisbanites THQ Australia closed in 2011, as did the Melbourne crew Blue Tongue . The last local AAA studio (industry code for a major production company), 2K Australia shuttered its Canberra digs in April.\nIt might have happened to Halfbrick too. Founded in 2001, for the company’s first seven years earnings primarily came from working on international projects. Then the global financial crisis hit, and all of a sudden Australia was no longer an affordable place to create entertainment products. With Halfbrick at risk of becoming Quarterbrick, and 70-odd employees at its Brisbane headquarters alone, that didn’t feel like a nice way to double down.\nSo in 2010 Deo set himself an ultimatum: “Get rich or die tryin’”. He says the company began pitching sessions for game ideas, called Halfbrick Fridays. “Guys would get up and pitch an idea and, if someone else liked it, they’d join them and form a prototype. They’d go away and work on those prototypes every Friday for about six or seven Fridays.\n“I guess the goal for this particular Halfbrick Friday was an iPhone game your mum can play – and Fruit Ninja was the fruit of that.” He says when the idea was pitched, only one other person saw any potential in it, meeting the minimum criterion for a project to be kicked off. “Thankfully there was that one, otherwise that idea would have died on the vine, so to speak.”\nRelated: Halfbrick launches maths-teaching sequel to Fruit Ninja mobile game\nFruit Ninja grew to epic proportions in a relatively short amount of time. Launched in April 2010, by July it had hit 1m downloads. Soon after that it appeared on Mythbusters and the members of One Direction declared they were fans of “real-life Fruit Ninja” (slicing actual fruit in the air) – something Deo seems comically embarrassed by.\nIn terms of marketing, the campaign was kept lo-fi, he says. “Everything was on a shoestring. If you look at our original Fruit Ninja trailer, I think it’s got at least two members of our development team. Our chief marketing officer at the time was holding the camera!”\nDeo attributes Fruit Ninja’s wildfire success to its slicey little mechanics and some fortuitous timing. In what seems familiar now, five years ago Fruit Ninja was one of the earliest games to showcase the simple and intuitive pleasures of touch devices. The game generated enough downloads to get traction on the Australian download charts. “Apple saw that and picked it up and showcased that to other countries, and then it just all exploded from there.”\nDeo says the game “put Australia on the map” in the gaming world yet few Australians outside the industry are aware Fruit Ninja is “locally grown”.\nRelated: Pokémon Go: new mobile game will let you catch Pokémon in the real world\nWith the gaming landscape anything but static, Deo says the company doesn’t take its position as a global leader in app-making for granted. “Apps aren’t the gold rush they were and the business models are changing all the time, too. When we first got involved it was all about paid apps, then it transitioned to ‘freemium’ and free-to-play based on internet purchases. Now we’ve been seeing the use of ad-supported apps.”\nWill Australia ever refocus its development lens on consoles and computers? “I don’t think we will, really, because the level of investment and manpower required is just so huge now, I think the risk is too great.”\nMobile game apps still provide a lot of room for innovation and, as they are better integrated with people’s lifestyles, the market for them is “massive”, he says.\n“Not everyone can have the time to sit in front of their TV for two hours and play a AAA console experience. But everyone can pull out their mobile device and play for two minutes here and there and get a lot out of it.”", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvkZDuubE6o", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6hUTC1Edyo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1ac2526b2c2ecc1787d5a9c2885ca4ea275be04/1144_0_2304_3456/master/2304.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=99a7f8f02cb2f7989b0edc0c76ded2b1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1ac2526b2c2ecc1787d5a9c2885ca4ea275be04/1144_0_2304_3456/master/2304.jpg?w=380&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=34f84e882f995b6e6b9f6f2dc73e5608", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1ac2526b2c2ecc1787d5a9c2885ca4ea275be04/1144_0_2304_3456/master/2304.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=d28465c2e84f6d155577dee78a6dbe0e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1ac2526b2c2ecc1787d5a9c2885ca4ea275be04/1144_0_2304_3456/master/2304.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=b5c7476c6ce6881420d9358e8aa4e646", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAwX1vRDI-w", "http://www.thq.com/us?lang=en_US", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6hUTC1Edyo", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cyg9%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cyg9&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Fb1ac2526b2c2ecc1787d5a9c2885ca4ea275be04%2F1144_0_2304_3456%2F2304.jpg", "http://www.2kaustralia.com/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Fruit+Ninja%3A+how+the+slice-and-dice+game+reached+1bn+downloads&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cyg9%2Fstw%23img-2", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Fruit+Ninja%3A+how+the+slice-and-dice+game+reached+1bn+downloads&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2Fsep%2F28%2Fhow-the-australian-gaming-app-fruit-ninja-reached-one-billion-downloads&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Fb1ac2526b2c2ecc1787d5a9c2885ca4ea275be04%2F1144_0_2304_3456%2F2304.jpg", "http://www.blue-tongue.com.au/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1ac2526b2c2ecc1787d5a9c2885ca4ea275be04/1144_0_2304_3456/master/2304.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=ca62dad274b6731a09e726ee9ad2bbe6"], "published": "2015-09-28T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T07:00:16.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
