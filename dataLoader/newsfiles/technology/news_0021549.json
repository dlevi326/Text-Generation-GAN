However, this has not happened because the department wants to render unions irrelevant.”\nConsequently, the ANAs were now high-stakes tests while they were introduced as a diagnostic tool to assess the system, Maluleke said. “It has been reduced to an onslaught on teachers with no intention to improve the system.”\nThe department had earlier said it was all systems go for the assessments, which are scheduled for September 15 to September 18. About 8.6-million pupils in grades one to nine will sit down for them.\n“Principals will allocate teachers to invigilate classes that they do not teach,” said department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga.\n“Provincial education departments will monitor the test administration process. [National department] will employ independent monitors to reinforce monitoring that will be done by [it], provincial education departments and district officials.”\nSadtu reiterated its criticism of the department’s push to introduce Mandarin into the school curriculum.\nThe department has maintained the language, which is to be taught as from January next year, is not compulsory. But Sadtu said this was a “disappointing continuous effort [by the department] to spin its way out of what is clearly an unpopular decision”.\n“The NEC took a decision that the union will engage on a programme to involve stakeholders in education including the Congress of South African Students, COSATU affiliates, Pan South African Language Board, traditional leaders, Education Alliance and the society at large against the introduction of Mandarin and its prioritisation over our indigenous languages,” Maluleke said.\n“The union will also discourage members from participating in the envisaged Mandarin training programme for teachers.\n“Further, the union will convene a seminar that will include those from the academia to fraternal organisations and create a platform which will see us engaging on how we can prioritise our own indigenous languages.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T01:58:18.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
