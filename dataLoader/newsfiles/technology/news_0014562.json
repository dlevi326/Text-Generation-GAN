The DCX3000 delivers fast switching of HD video, audio and USB across a combination of 30 sources and end users. Broadcast applications include live production studios, outside broadcast vehicles (OBV) and post production. Additional applications include control rooms for public safety, transportation, military, process control and manufacturing, utilities and air traffic control. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150910006343/en/ The DCX3000 Digital KVM Matrix switch is a 30-port switch for small-to-medium digital KVM applications. It features a graphical user interface for easy multi-source viewing and switching, a slim chassis for saving space, CATx connectivity and an attractive price point to help smaller applications enter the digital KVM field. (Photo: Business Wire) \nThe small form factor (less than 1U) system lowers cost by up to 50 percent compared to existing digital KVM matrix solutions. In addition, the unique, paradigm-changing graphical user interface enables easy selection and switching between video and computing sources through the use of auto-refreshing thumbnail images. The thumbnail selection window design provides an intuitive multi-viewer type user experience and enables an “at a glance” view of the matrix sources. \nVideo frames are delivered with zero compression and zero latency, ensuring the most graphically demanding applications operate with no reduction in image quality and no performance degradation. Up to 23 ports can be configured to connect to computers, and up to 29 ports may be used for connecting users for secure computing, resource sharing and content collaboration. User stations can be located up to 50 meters from the central switching unit. \nThe DCX3000 system contains three components: the central switching unit ( DCX3000 ), the receiver unit ( DCX3000-DVR ), and server access modules (DVI, DCX3000-DVT ; DisplayPort, DCX3000-DPT ). The remote-powered Server Access Modules (SAMs) extend DVI or DisplayPort signals and USB over standard CATx cabling from individual servers to the central switching unit and the receivers connect end-user stations to the central switching unit. \nThe Black Box portfolio of high-performance digital KVM matrix switches consists of the following solutions: DCX3000 — a low-cost, fixed-port system for switching DVI, DisplayPort, and USB over CATx cable with a graphical user interface for intuitive operation. DKM FX — a scalable platform with multi-chassis interconnect capability for HD video and peripheral signal switching, conversion and extension over CATx or fiber cable. Agility — a scalable, IP-based switching and extension system for sending DVI, USB and audio over a LAN to user stations or video monitors. \nBlack Box is demonstrating all three digital KVM matrix switching solutions at IBC 2015 at the RAI Amsterdam, September 11-15, booth 8-E32. \nTo learn more about DCX3000, visit blackbox.com/DCX3000 . \nA downloadable illustration is available from http://www.blackbox.com/about/news-and-events/media-resources.aspx . \nAbout Black Box \nBlack Box is a leading technology solutions provider dedicated to helping customers build, manage, optimize, and secure their IT infrastructure.
