Volkov will stay on at the ISS, while both Aimbetov and Mogensen will return to Earth on Soyuz TMA-16M on 11 September. \nMogensen is the first Dane to enter space while Aimbetov, who replaced British singer Sarah Brightman after the 54-year-old pulled out of the mission in June, is the third from his country to do so. \n“It’s a great honour for me to represent Denmark as an astronaut,” Mogensen said in a Google hangout organised by ESA last month. \nThe launch from Baikonur is the first since July 23, when Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko and US and Japanese astronauts Kjell Lindgren and Kimiya Yu blasted off on a 163-day mission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T03:08:50.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
