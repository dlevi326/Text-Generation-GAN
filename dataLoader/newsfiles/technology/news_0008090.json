The decision that has been taken by News24 to close comments is a 50/50 in my point of view as, yes it seems like censorship or limitation in terms of freedom of speech but we have to be honest in saying that the majority of the readers who read the racial, imperialistic, non-patriotic comments never corrected those commenters, they just chose to sit and laugh as if it was helping. I salute the editors and everyone on News24 by taking this decision, we need to remove these kind of racist and imperialistic fibres from our society, in a lawful and constitutional way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:24:31.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
