Picture: ESA ALEXANDER/SUNDAY TIMES Related articles Eat Out Awards enlivened by chefs’ demonstrations SA’s eateries shine at global awards TOP chef Luke Dale-Roberts is to open a pop-up restaurant at Johannesburg’s The Saxon, the boutique hotel in Sandhurst, Sandton, said on Tuesday.\nThis would not affect Dale-Roberts’ Cape Town restaurants, The Test Kitchen — which was placed 28th in this year’s S. Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurants — and The Pot Luck Club.\n\"It’s very exciting for us,\" said Saxon spokeswoman Nicolette Fortuin.\nThe name, menu and decor of the new Dale-Roberts restaurant would be released closer to the establishment’s January 21 2016 launch, she said.\nExecutive chef at The Saxon, the multi award-winning David Higgs, was leaving the hotel to open his own restaurant in Rosebank. Johannesburg, Fortuin said. Higgs has been at The Saxon since 2011.\n\"Obviously it’s a terrific thing for Johannesburg,\" said food critic Anna Trapido. \"Luke Dale-Roberts and David Higgs are very interesting chefs in the fine dining genre. ...The question has always been why Johannesburg has all the money and all the expensive restaurants are in the Winelands and Cape Town. If you compare us to Brazil, Sao Paulo and Rio (de Janeiro), then Sao Paulo is Johannesburg and Rio is Cape Town. All the good Brazilian restaurants are in Sao Paulo.\"\nTrapido said it was a myth that Johannesburg did not have \"fantastic\" food, but that — unlike Cape Town — Johannesburg’s best food spots were \"small, interesting, ethnic restaurants. I think you would struggle to find an excellent Congolese restaurant in Cape Town. We have loads of those.\"\nDale-Roberts’ contract with The Saxon was for a fully-functional lunch and dinner restaurant for \"three or four months\", Fortuin said.\nThe Saxon Quote: d Dale-Roberts as saying: \"The Saxon is an iconic hotel and the perfect home for us to set up a new creative space. I'm excited to venture into the Joburg market and see how diners there react to The Test Kitchen style of food.\"\nHiggs said his new establishment, opposite the Circa art gallery on Jan Smuts Avenue, Rosebank, would be open in March or April next year. He did not want to reveal any details now.\n\"I have no desire to go back to Cape Town,\" said the chef, who has been in Johannesburg since 2011. \"I love the vibe here. The thing about Joburg is the idea that anything can work. I love that. I love that it (the city) travels at 100k (sic) an hour.\"\nHiggs’ restaurant at The Saxon, Five Hundred, would continue under the guidance of head chef Candice Philip, Fortuin said. \"The culinary and service teams will remain the same.\"\nPhilip would take over from Higgs in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:23:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
