Yahoo's shares are also down 45 percent.\nAt a 40 percent rate, tax on the spinoff would be around US$9 billion.\n\"The decision could potentially put shareholders on the hook for any tax liability should the IRS challenge (Yahoo's) interpretation of tax treatment in the future. We expect this would trigger a legal battle,\" MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a note.\n\"We think this would present an overhang until clarity arrives,\" he said, but added that the uncertainty was fully priced in.\n(Reporting by Sayantani Ghosh in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey)\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-09-30T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T14:56:35.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
