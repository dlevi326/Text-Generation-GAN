The adoption of telemedicine in recent years is rising because of better information technology in terms of affordability and performance. Telemedicine has become a standard in most of the clinical application areas, such as cardiology, orthopedics, and neurology. There is a growing interest in teledermatology because of the increasing need for dermatology services and the lack of specialists or dermatologists in many countries. For example, in the UK there has been an increase by 50% in dermatology referrals in the last decade. However, there are not many dermatologists available in the country to address the concerns. Teledermatology is one solution for the healthcare community to address the dermatology workforce challene. \nAccording to the report, efforts to educate dermatologists and patients are expected to contribute to the growth of global dermatology diagnostic devices market. The initiatives taken by both government and private entities include regular education and training for physicians, conducting public awareness programs, and increase funding for scientific and epidemiological research. There are more than 2,000 recognized skin disorders. The increasing awareness and the need for improvement in diagnostic accuracy have created a relatively new responsibility and interest among practitioners in the field of dermatology. Accurate diagnosis and effective treatment depends on proficiency of general practitioners and dermatologists. \nSelf-diagnosing and self-medicating by patients for dermatological conditions are major factors hindering market growth. \nKey Topics Covered", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:13:54.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
