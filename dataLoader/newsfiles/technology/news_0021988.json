Thanks to a group of final year students from B.Tech mechatronics department of SRM University who came out with a solution for it. They have made a prototype of an electrical skateboard for personal transportation called 'E-board' or Vector. The unique feature in it is that even a beginner without any experience can easily step on and ride enthusiastically. Rakhshith.S., Mahendra Kumar and Vibhakar Senthil Kumar are the project's brainchild. They have been working on this project for the past four months. This is the second prototype they have made and now they are planning to make a final product. It weighs around seven kg but they hope to reduce it to four kg. This board can carry loads up to 120 kg and can cover a distance of 30 Km in an hour. It will cost between Rs 16,000 and Rs 20,000. \"The most interesting about the board is it is very light, you can carry it to you class or office. It is the most eco-friendly mode of transportation,\" said Rakhshith. \"The unique feature is that unlike the conventional skateboard it increases stability. We are increasing the wheel base and the track width, so that the board will be able to give much more stability,\" said Mahendra Kumar. The main features of Vector are it has wireless handheld control, adjustable power, intuitive software, mobile application and so on. \" Right now, it is made of wood and metal, we hope to replace it with fibre. It would be a convenient mode of transportation,\" said Vibhakar Senthil Kumar. He said, \" We conducted a survey wherein 80% of the students in our college wanted to buy.\" States: Tamil Nadu nation South Chennai Tamil Nadu electrical skateboard SRM University Also Read Feasibility study soon on Thammanam road work Oh deer!
