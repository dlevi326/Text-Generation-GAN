Gately is a proven executive and entrepreneur with extensive experience in senior management roles at technology companies, from fast-growing startups to mature organizations operating at a $300 million revenue run rate.  At Nasuni, Gately will oversee the company's global sales, marketing and field operations teams as it continues to rapidly expand both domestically and internationally.\nPrior to joining Nasuni, Gately led the buyout of ByteSphere, where he served as CEO until the company's successful acquisition by EXFO. He served in a variety of senior sales and general management roles at BMC Software, Mazu Networks (acquired by Riverbed), and GiantLoop Networks.   He was an early Sales and Marketing leader at EMC, where he helped lead the company into the storage market. Gately also founded two successful companies, including Linx Communications, a pioneer in unified communications, which was acquired by one of its outside investors.\n\"Nasuni is in a great position,\" Gately said. \"IT organizations are facing massive pain around the exponential growth of unstructured data and files, and the sharing of that information across the globe.  Nasuni is the only solution that can effectively move that workload to the cloud, provide 100% resiliency and make those files available to any user, anywhere and on any device, improving sharing and collaboration. The company grew 300% last year, and I fully expect that kind of growth for the foreseeable future. There's just so much opportunity out there.\"\n\"Joe has seen it all: big companies, startups, fast growing markets, direct sales, channel and just about every aspect of technology sales there is,\" said Andres Rodriguez , CEO of Nasuni. \"We're reaching an inflection point at Nasuni. Demand for Cloud NAS is accelerating. Joe is just the person we need to expand our sales force, both here and overseas, and align our complete go-to-market strategy to meet that rapidly growing demand.\"\nAbout Nasuni \nNasuni is an enterprise storage company that provides distributed organizations with a powerful Cloud NAS system.
