This time, the Perception Neuron team will be taking part in TechCrunch Disrupt , where emerging tech companies have the opportunity to engage with potential investors and members of the media.\nPerception Neuron will be in the exhibition area, where they will be discussing their full-body, wireless motion capture technology and introducing a new virtual camera component.\n“The response to Perception Neuron since our Kickstarter launch last September has been nothing less than remarkable,” says Tristan Dai, CTO of Noitom and developer of Perception Neuron. “We couldn’t be happier with the response we have received from professionals throughout the industry who want to work with Perception Neuron. Coming to an event like TechCrunch Disrupt really solidifies our place in the emerging technology field.”\nOne of the new concepts Perception Neuron is excited to share with their users, industry partners and media is their virtual camera experience which allows users to see an actor wearing a full body Perception Neuron setup through a tablet in a virtual environment in real-time. The virtual camera is an early development concept for a product slated for release in Q3 of 2016.\n“This is a very exciting time for us,” says Roch Nakajima, Americas Marketing Director for Noitom Ltd. “Now that our product is out there and we get to see the different ways in which people are using the technology, it gives us more to share with the industry professionals who attend events like TechCrunch Disrupt. This is an excellent opportunity for us to introduce the product to a whole new set of influential media and industry leaders.”\nPerception Neuron is the world’s only adaptive and affordable full-body, wireless motion capture system and one of the most affordable of its kind on the market.
