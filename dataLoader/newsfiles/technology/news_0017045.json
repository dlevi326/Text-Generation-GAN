EE spoke out after the industry's regulator confirmed it was raising annual charges for the 2G, 3G and 4G voice and data spectrum bands to almost £200m.\nOfcom argued it brought the charges more into line with those in other countries. \nThe fees vary by firm, depending on their spectrum use, leaving EE facing the biggest bill as its charge will rise to £75m - an increase of £50m.\nA spokesman told Sky News: \"We think Ofcom has got this wrong.\n\"The proposed licence fees for 1800MHz spectrum are based on a flawed approach.\n\"The trebling of fees is bad news for British consumers and business as it raises the risk that we won’t be able to offer the best prices, and invest and innovate at the pace we and our customers would like.\n\"We’re also very disappointed that Ofcom has not reflected the higher costs we’ve taken on to meet enhanced coverage obligations that Ofcom and Government encouraged us to accept.\"\nThe mobile industry is under pressure from the Government to expand premier network coverage across more rural areas.\nVodafone's response to Ofcom's announcement also reflected that.\nThe company said: \"We will be reviewing Ofcom's proposed spectrum fees over the coming days as they represent a significant increase when we are already investing around £1bn on our network and services this year.\"\nOfcom said it did not see a case for rising customer bills.\nIt said: \"Mobile operators have a strong incentive to keep prices competitive.\n\"The operators have had five years' notice that the fees would be increased to reflect full market value and we expect them to have budgeted for this.\n\"The fees announced today are in line with analysts' expectations and with the amounts that operators pay for accessing spectrum in other countries.\"\n:: Tell Us What You Want From The Sky News App \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T16:04:28.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
