The program is a multipronged education intervention that meets the priorities of the State Council's national \"Three Connections, Two Platforms\" plan. It supports the work of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) Poverty Alleviation Office (PAO) by helping increase teaching and learning capacity in Sichuan Province . The Learning Program was announced during a ceremony in which Qualcomm signed memoranda of understanding with two county governments in Sichuan Province – the People's Government of Guang'An District, Guang'An City and the People's Government of Yilong County, Nanchong City. Attendees included Qualcomm senior executives, MOFCOM officials, local country leaders and CCTF leadership. This Wireless Reach-funded program supports the development of a cutting-edge, 21 st century learning environment in selected classrooms at Guang'An Second Middle School in Guang'An District, and Meng Ya Primary School and Wen Xing Middle School in Yilong County. The schools are located in government-designated poverty-stricken areas. The program will deploy advanced ICT to improve teaching and learning, ultimately benefitting approximately 200 teachers and 4,000 students ages 7 to 15. All classrooms in the participating schools will be provided with broadband Internet connectivity, electronic smartboards, 3G/4G-enabled mobile tablets for teachers and access to educational materials. Students in several classrooms will receive 3G/4G enabled mobile tablets that will give them access to enhanced educational materials as well as convenient communication with teachers, mentors and fellow students. The program will also link to the Sichuan provincial and municipal educational portals. Many elements of the 21 st Century Classroom program will be ready for teachers and students in September. \"China Children and Teenagers' Fund is deeply honored to have a continuing relationship with Qualcomm, a world leader in mobile technologies, and we are excited about leading the implementation of the 21 st Century Classroom program in Sichuan Province ,\" says Zhao Donghua, Deputy Director General of CCTF. \"We are optimistic about this program's success and its potential for expansion to other counties and provinces throughout China .\" \"China Children and Teenagers' Fund is a renowned charity foundation in China .
