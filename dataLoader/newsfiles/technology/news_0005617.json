Burned vehicles sit on a property charred by the Valley fire in Middletown, California on September 13, 2015 \nThe US Forest Service has spent an additional $1.31 billion battling fires and says it is approaching its record, from 2002, of $1.65 billion. \nBrown's state of emergency will release additional funds to cover the costs of the firefighting efforts. \nNational Guard troops have also been called in to help. \nAfter a briefing on the Butte blaze, the governor's emergency services chief said this summer's fires were the most volatile he had ever seen.
