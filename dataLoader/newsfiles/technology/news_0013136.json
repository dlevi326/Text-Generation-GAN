Monday's announcement appears linked to the release of a new paper in which NASA researchers say analysis of imaging from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows that seasonal dark streaks on the Martian surface -- formally called recurring slope lineae -- are the result of briny water periodically flowing across the planet's surface. The salt content of the water is important because without it, the water would freeze in Mars' often bone-chilling temperatures. 11 photos: Life on Mars? You be the judge 11 photos: Life on Mars?

Hide Caption 11 of 11 Three of the paper's co-authors are participants in Monday's announcement, including lead author Lujendra Ojha, who first stumbled across the streaks in 2011 while studying at the University of Arizona. Ojha and his colleagues theorized at the time that flowing water was the cause of the streaks. Another participant in Monday's announcement, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter chief Alfred McEwen, co-authored the paper, along with NASA researcher Mary Beth Wilhelm and five other scientists. The paper doesn't offer an explanation about where the water could be coming from, but suggests several possibilities: It could be melting subsurface ice; it might result from salts widely believed to be in the Martian soil, pulling water out of the thin Martian atmosphere; or possibly liquid is bubbling up from an aquifer, the researchers say. In April, McEwen announced research showing that salts in the Martian soil have the ability to grab enough water out of the air to form tiny puddles at night. And in March, NASA said Mars may once have had a sea similar to the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. About 87% of that water has been lost to space, researchers said. 96 photos: Mars rover Curiosity 96 photos: Mars rover Curiosity NASA's Curiosity Mars rover has snapped a new selfie , which is actually a series of selfies combined.

The $2.5 billion NASA mission set out to explore Gale Crater, which was thought to have once hosted flowing water. Curiosity found evidence of clay formations, or \"mudstone,\" in the crater's Yellowknife Bay, scientists said in 2013. This clay may have held the key ingredients for life billions of years ago. It means a lake must have existed in the area.

Hide Caption 36 of 96 96 photos: Mars rover Curiosity This image shows part of the small pit or bite created when NASA's Mars rover Curiosity collected its second scoop of Martian soil on October 15, 2012. The rover team determined that the bright particle near the center of the image was native to Mars, and not debris from the rover's landing. Hide Caption 37 of 96 96 photos: Mars rover Curiosity This image shows what the rover team has determined to be a piece of debris from the spacecraft, possibly shed during the landing. Hide Caption 38 of 96 96 photos: Mars rover Curiosity The rover's scoop contains larger soil particles that were too big to filter through a sample-processing sieve. After a full-scoop sample had been vibrated over the sieve, this portion was returned to the scoop for inspection by the rover's mast camera. Hide Caption 39 of 96 96 photos: Mars rover Curiosity This 360-degree panorama shows the area where the rover will spend about three weeks collecting scoopfuls of soil for examination.

Hide Caption 41 of 96 96 photos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity cut a wheel scuff mark into a wind-formed ripple at the \"Rocknest\" site on October 3, 2012. This gave researchers a better opportunity to examine the particle-size distribution of the material forming the ripple. Hide Caption 42 of 96 96 photos: Mars rover Curiosity NASA's Curiosity rover found evidence for what scientists believe was an ancient, flowing stream on Mars at a few sites, including the rock outcrop pictured here. The key evidence for the ancient stream comes from the size and rounded shape of the gravel in and around the bedrock, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/Caltech science team. The rounded shape leads the science team to conclude they were transported by a vigorous flow of water. The grains are too large to have been moved by wind. Hide Caption 43 of 96 96 photos: Mars rover Curiosity This photo is an up-close look at an outcrop that also shows evidence of flowing water, according to the JPL/Caltech science team. The outcrop's characteristics are consistent with rock that was formed by the deposition of water and is composed of many smaller rounded rocks cemented together. Water transport is the only process capable of producing the rounded shape of conglomerate rock of this size. Hide Caption 44 of 96 96 photos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity completed its longest drive to date on September 26, 2012. The rover moved about 160 feet east toward the area known as \"Glenelg.\" As of that day the rover had moved about a quarter-mile from its landing site.
