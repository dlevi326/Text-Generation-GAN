Business needs grow, technology moves forward, and software systems become outdated. In fact, most businesses switch systems every 7-10 years. While switching can be a time-consuming process, the rewards in money and time savings can be huge. However, there are better times of the year than others for a business to make the switch.\n“Considering the time of year can be crucial to the success of an accounting software switch,” says Stephanie Elsen, Red Wing Software Marketing Manager.\nMoving to a different accounting system at the end of the year can be a good idea, since many businesses have their fiscal year set up to coincide with year-end. However, do keep in mind that end-of-year is typically the busiest time for accounting and payroll software providers. Developers of accounting and payroll software are typically busiest at end-of-year, since they are busy helping customers with closing out the year, end-of-year tax reporting, etc. For this reason, it may be easier and faster to receive data transfer options, training, and get questions answered well before year-end.\nIf a business is busiest at the end of the year, they would do better to schedule a software switch at a different time when they are less busy. Moving to new accounting software can be time consuming, with the installation, transfer of data, training time and learning curve. Therefore, scheduling a time when employees are the least busy is the best choice.\nWhen researching accounting software systems, whether hosted internally or elsewhere, be sure to find out from the software provider whether the data from your old system can be transferred to the new system. Which information a business is able to transfer can affect when to switch systems. Most software systems can accept at least the master files from another system, such as account numbers, customers, vendors, inventory items, and beginning balances. Do keep in mind though that if you are switching to a new software vendor, you will likely be unable to bring any history along from a different program.\nRed Wing Software, Inc, along with its nationwide network of business partners, offers industry-leading service, as well as training, on-site installation and implementation of the software. Their vision is “Creating the best management software experience”.\nRed Wing Software, Inc. develops, integrates and supports the accounting and financial management needs of small- to mid-sized businesses, agribusinesses, not-for-profits, and municipals across North America.
