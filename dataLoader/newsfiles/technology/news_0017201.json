( bit.ly/1KoRHYr )\nThe messaging service now has improved push and email notifications and messages are organized in a chat-style format with conversation threads akin to most messaging apps today such as Facebook Inc's Messenger and WhatsApp.\nLinkedIn, which operates the biggest social networking site for professionals, has started to roll out the new messaging service to English-language users accessing its platform via a desktop or through an app.\nUsers can also attach photos and documents to messages.\nThe company also said it was looking at offering voice and video calling with the messaging platform in the future.\nLinkedIn plans to make the revamped messaging feature available in other languages in the coming weeks.
