Dyneema floats on water and is resistant to moisture, UV light and harmful chemicals.\nThe socks’ soles have ‘grip dots’ that let the wearers use them on all terrains, ‘Daily Express’ reported.\n“FYF Increases your performance safely, and with a new sense of security,” said Dieter Hesch, founder of the company in Switzerland.\n“There are many sports where you would like to be barefoot but the risks of being injured are too high so you don’t do it.\n“For example water sports and martial arts, balance and equilibrium is very important,” he said.\nThe socks, however, will not protect against sharp objects that can puncture the feet like needles and sea urchin spines.\nFirst Published on August 30, 2015 10:00 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:05:11.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
