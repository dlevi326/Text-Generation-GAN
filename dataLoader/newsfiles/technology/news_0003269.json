Super hero or super villain? Source: Supplied \nWHILE Elon Musk spends most of his time running Tesla and Space X, his real dream is to be the first man on Mars. He even has an idea of how to make it habitable for humans... he wants to nuke it. \nYep, Musk spoke of his idea on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert yesterday as a way to heat the red planet up to a temperature humans could live in. \n“It’s a fixer-upper of a planet,” Musk told Colbert. “Eventually you could transform Mars into an Earth-like planet.” \nHe said that there’s both a slow way and a fast way to heat the surface of the planet up, with the fast option being to nuke the polar ice caps. \nSo how would this work? \nMars as it stands now is a dry, dead planet with no confirmed signs of life. It does however have polar ice caps that are a 50/50 split of carbon dioxide and water. \nThe idea with using nuclear weapons is that if they were used to vaporise the ice caps, carbon dioxide would be released into the atmosphere. Then, once the atmosphere became thick enough, a greenhouse effect would occur. \nThis would result in the heat and energy that comes to the planet being trapped much like it is on Earth. \nMore carbon dioxide would then be released until, ideally, the surface pressure of Mars would increase enough for water to be able to exist. This then leads to the possibility of human life. \nOf course, there’s the concern that radiation will cover the planet, but scientists say that modern nuclear weapons can be designed to leave minimal fallout, making it perfectly fine for humans to live around 100 years later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T08:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:22:01.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
