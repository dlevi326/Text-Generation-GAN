The audit spells out many of the requirements contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), to protect the privacy and security of protected health information. \n\"With completion of the HIPAA audit anticipated by the end of the year, our strategic goal is to offer a series of HIPAA hosting plans during 2016 and to bring our distinctive Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) approach to healthcare IT, from pricing to customer support,\" said Adam Stern, founder and CEO, Infinitely Virtual. \"HIPAA is a rigorous and demanding environment, and only a select number of vendors can truly compete in the space. Withour 'Enterprise-Ready' status from Skyhigh Networks and our recent inclusion among the Talkin' Cloud 100, we look forward to establishing a new benchmark of service in the HIPAA market.\" \nThe federal Office of Civil Rights established a comprehensive HIPAA audit protocol that specifies requirements to be assessed through these performance audits.
