When I landed at my new destination I was nervous, scared and excited about what the future might bring, yes I know this sounds like a whole lot of mixed up and crazy feelings; trust me it is…\nThe moment you reach your new “home” you have to unpack your life, it’s nothing more than what you use to cover your skin and some gifts from family. You need to start a new life and it comes with a “price”, during your first year you save no monies. The weak rand can contribute why you struggle financially your first month. Plan your departure well, and communicate with your bank that you stay abroad now and ensure a flawless flow of money back to South Africa. Also don’t forget “Uncle” SARS. Don’t do research on Google about your new destination, rather join some expat groups on Facebook and they will coach and guide you the way forward.\nStop converting monies when you buy food and essentials it will give you a nervous breakdown.\nFor whatever reason you leaving South Africa, good luck and know it a difficult journey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:50:41.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
