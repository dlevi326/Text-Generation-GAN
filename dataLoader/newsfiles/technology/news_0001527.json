This module is very fast, sampling data every 50 microseconds and is compatible with an extensive variety of analog sensors.\nTerryville, CT, August 27, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Advanced Micro Controls Inc. (AMCI), introduces their 5274A High Speed Data Acquisition module for ControlLogix™. AMCI’s 5274A is an analog input, high speed data acquisition module that plugs into the Allen-Bradley ControlLogix and programs using RSLogix5000 (Studio 5000). The module is referenced within the Rockwell Automation PartnerNetwork™ Encompass program, as its approved technology fills a gap within the Allen-Bradley product offering.\nThe AMCI 5274A High Speed Data Acquisition module acquires data at a programmable sample rate of 50 microseconds, and archives the data using the PLC’s registers for analysis or export. The 5274A can transfer up to 128 samples, either on one channel, or evenly divided over the module’s four channels, making it possible to capture data from up to four different analog sources, including weigh scale, thermo-couple, vacuum sensor, etc.\n“AMCI’s 5274A plug-in module adds sophisticated, high performance data acquisition capabilities to the Allen-Bradley ControlLogix PLC. Customers working in labs, research and development environments, or test & measurement applications for production can finally standardize on a single controls platform. In years past customers had to supplement their PLC investment with a separate and expensive PC-based data acquisition system – not anymore!” - Bob Alesio, AMCI Sales Manager\nAll of AMCI’s plug in modules for Allen Bradley PLCs utilize Rockwell Automation licensed technology and have been approved within the Rockwell Automation Encompass™ program. The Encompass program provides Rockwell Automation customers with a quick and concise way to locate compatible products that offer unique functionality.\nAMCI’s offers a wide assortment of specialty plug-in modules for Allen Bradley PLCs. Specialty functions available include: analog high speed data acquisition, resolver interface, SSI interface, LDT interface, PLS control, press control, PWM (pulse width modulation), and stepper/servo motion control.
