He’s taking his data analysis to Texas businesses and urging them to redesign their sick pay benefits.\n“If you pay people when they’re sick, some people will choose to be sick, particularly if their disability income ends up being a substantial portion of their base wage,” said Dr. Hank Gardner, CEO of HCMS (Human Capital Management Services) Group. “Those most likely to use these benefits are those in job failure.”\nThis is a variation on the argument that people consume more — and waste more — health care when they get to spend other people’s money. Gardner estimates a third of our $3.1 trillion national health care bill is wasted.\nHCMS presented its analysis last week in Houston and San Antonio before audiences of the Texas Business Group on Health, an umbrella group of the state’s large, self-insured employers. HCMS’ clients include Texas Instruments, Houston-based Waste Management and Austin-based Whole Foods.\nIn the presentations, an HCMS team showed findings from their Texas data. Five percent of the more than 100,000 employees studied accounted for 55 percent of health spending in any given year. The 5 percent averaged about $45,000 a year in health care provider and pharmaceutical costs.\nHCMS found that, of that 5 percent, about a third were high spenders because of serious illness. But half of them were on that list because of disability and sick leave incentives.\nGardner doesn’t claim these people are faking their way into disability checks. Many have medical problems such as arthritis, diabetes or cardiovascular issues. But often, he says, the medical issues aren’t serious enough to warrant disability status. Doctors will often grant a disability finding, or write prescriptions and pass such patients along to specialists, when they can’t find a specific cause for pain or mental anguish.\n“There is a significant presence of disease, but the solution isn’t to over-treat or over-utilize health care. It’s to get the incentives aligned simultaneously with the treatment,” Gardner said.\nGardner’s findings have found their way into the debate about how to shore up the finances of Social Security’s Disability Insurance program. Ever since the medical eligibility rules were loosened in 1984, the number of people seeking benefits has climbed well ahead of the premiums paid by employers and employees. By next year, the program is expected to exhaust its savings and go into the red. If nothing is done, payments will be cut by 19 percent.\nThe Obama administration is asking Congress to shift funds from Social Security’s retirement benefit into the disability account, with reforms to follow later. Congressional Republicans aren’t keen on that solution.\nThose arguing for a temporary fix say the increase in beneficiaries has reached a plateau, and that it was largely due to aging baby boomers. (Older workers are more prone to disability.) The disability payment averages just $13,980 a year, or only about a third of income. That isn’t much of an incentive to stop working.\nGardner argues there’s an important overlooked incentive. Those using disability insurance qualify for Medicare after two years.\nOn Twitter:\n @landersjim", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/landersjim"], "published": "2015-09-01T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T14:58:43.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
