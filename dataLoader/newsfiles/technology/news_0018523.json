He admits it’s not the safest craft in the world, but says that 54 “18 inch propellers at 5000 rpm, though hazardous, are still much less so than six five-foot ones”. And he’s added the plastic dome for his own protection – since the propellers are “inline with my head”. “It also doubles as a rain shelter,” he added.", "external_links": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/comments/3j28k6/a_54_propeller_multirotor_lifting_a_man/culne7x"], "published": "2015-09-04T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T17:18:48.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
