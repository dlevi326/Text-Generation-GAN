SPARTANBURG, South Carolina - September 25, 2015 - Lore Arcana, an exciting, fun, adventure video game, was recently announced. A unique open-world wizard simulator, Lore Arcana allows players freedom to easily create their own spells using hundreds of runes. This is a game of discovery. Users play as a wizard tasked with aiding and protecting humanity on the island nation of Brialta. In order to do so, players are empowered to create spells using the most versatile magic system in video games to date. This will give them the strength they'll need to confront crab-like fire breathing leviathans one day, and fend off ghoulish vampire bats the next. In Lore Arcana, users have access to an intuitive drag-and-drop interface where they can create their own spells to help complete their quests. Though this game is based on player freedom, there is also a full story mode, with a wide variety of missions. However, before this exciting game can come to life, these developers need help. Thats why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $35,000 by October 22, 2015. The funds raised will go towards fully developing the game, including animations, 3D freelance, licenses, and other fees. To help bring this innovative game to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered between December 2016 and June 2017. Please keep in mind this is an all-or-nothing deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help Lore Arcana reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T06:18:06.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
