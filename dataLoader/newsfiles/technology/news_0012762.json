Speakers identified key reasons for detentions including emergency response equipment, navigation equipment, engine room hygiene, radio communication equipment, and ISM/ ISPS/ MLC-related matters.\nIRClass officials pointed to the Concentrated Inspection Campaign (CIC) on crew familiarisation and enclosed-space entry, to be conducted 1st September - 30th November 2015, a series of inspections for which owners must be prepared.\nThere followed an open house discussion. Capt. L.K. Panda, Nautical Adviser to the Government of India, and Mr. V. Arora, Chief Surveyor at IRClass, responded to issues raised by emphasising proactive methods such as pre-arrival checklists, early annual inspections, and heightened vessel monitoring.\nIn follow-up, IRClass will schedule regular meets with shipowners to work together in achieving this common goal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T20:06:08.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
