Naraha was the first among seven municipalities forced to evacuate entirely due to radiation contamination following a massive earthquake and tsunami that sent the reactors into meltdown. The government says radiation levels in town have fallen to levels deemed safe following decontamination efforts and overnight lifted the 2011 evacuation order. The town represents a test case, as most residents remain cautious amid lingering health concerns and a lack of infrastructure. Naraha officials say only about 100 of the nearly 2,600 households have returned since a trial period begun in April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T05:59:27.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
