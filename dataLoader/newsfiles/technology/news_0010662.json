Petrochemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries Corp. whose profits are hurt by cheap oil dropped 2.2 percent and was the main drag. \nAl-Rajhi Bank lost 1.4 percent and another large lender National Commercial Bank fell 1.9 percent. \nCredit rating agency Fitch this week revised its outlook on both banks' ratings to negative from stable following a similar revision for the sovereign's outlook last month which was due to low oil prices. \nMakkah real estate developer Jabal Omar fell 0.7 percent after announcing that it had cancelled a SR1.6 billion (427 million) contract with a construction firm because both sides needed to review it. \nBut Saudi Telecom Co. (STC) rose 1.6 percent after its chief executive told Reuters on Tuesday the firm expected to spend another 1 billion in the second half of 2015 on enhancing its networks to meet surging demand for web-based services. \nDubai's stock index dropped 2.0 percent with most stocks in the red. But budget carrier Air Arabia which could benefit from cheaper fuel rose 1.4 percent. \nAbu Dhabi's bourse edged down 0.5 percent and energy firm Dana Gas fell 1.9 percent. \nQatar lost 0.3 percent as heavyweight Industries Qatar whose business is largely in petrochemicals fell 1.7 percent. \nEgypt's main index fell 0.7 percent and bourse data showed pressure mostly came from selling by non-Arab foreign institutions. \nThe Cairo bourse had jumped earlier this week on news that Italy's Eni had discovered a potentially huge natural gas field just off Egypt's coast but the rally was short-lived and the market has resumed moving in line with broader Middle East sentiment. \nSome stocks were positive however including El Saeed Contracting and Real Estate Investment which surged 7.6 percent after announcing a 20 percent bonus share issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:11:33.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
