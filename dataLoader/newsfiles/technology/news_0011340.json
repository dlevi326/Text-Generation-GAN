(OTCBB: RGBP) and (OTC PINK: RGBP) announced today receipt of the audited draft report from contract research organization Charles River , describing positive conclusions derived from animal safety studies requested by the FDA regarding Regen's Investigational New Drug (IND) Application #15376 covering HemaXellerate (a proposed therapy for treating aplastic anemia).\nThe experiments comprised of administering HemaXellerate in male and female mice lacking an immune system, and observation of the animals under Good Laboratory Practices. The report concluded that doses of up to 10 times higher than those that will be used in the proposed clinical trial were well tolerated and did not result in cell-related mortality, adverse clinical observations or changes in body weights.\n\"Completion of these experiments with positive results strongly supports the further clinical development of HemaXellerate, which is a personalized cell based therapy aimed at treatment of drug refractory aplastic anemia and other disorders of blood cell production,\" said Thomas Ichim , PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of Regen BioPharma. \"Given the rigor used by Charles River in conduct of the experiments, and the detailed analysis of numerous physiological parameters, we are confident that the FDA will accept this data and allow initiation of our proposed 10 patient clinical trial.\"\nHemaXellerate is a patient-specific composition of cells that have previously been demonstrated to repair damaged bone marrow and stimulate production of blood cells based on previous animal studies. The Company, together with an internationally-renowned group of stem cell researchers, published the scientific basis for the HemaXellerate Iâ„¢ product which may be found at http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/pdf/1479-5876-10-231.pdf .\n\"Safety of patients is our first priority. We are grateful to the FDA for advising us on the design of the completed safety studies, which will ensure we deliver a high quality product to patients in the proposed clinical trial,\" said David Koos , Chairman and CEO of Regen BioPharma.\nABOUT REGEN BIOPHARMA INC.: Regen BioPharma Inc. is a publicly traded biotechnology company (OTCBB: RGBP) and (OTC PINK: RGBP).
