ET has pieced together the story by speaking to executives, private investigators and officials. The break-ins and threats weren't reported to the authorities for fear that the information thus provided could have proven incriminating — hence the involvement of private detectives.\n\nThe threat is said to have emanated from the Middle East although it's not clear whether it goes back even further. The companies were told to pay up or face the consequences of the data being passed on to the Indian government, one person said.\n\nThe blackmail demands came a few months after a scam involving thefts of documents from the petroleum and other minstries erupted earlier this year. \"They waited for the opportune moment. The hackers kept reading and even downloading each and every correspondence between the employees and others for years,\" the person added.\n\nThe data are said to have included correspondence with middlemen and paperwork on sensitive financial transactions. While the companies didn't approach police or government investigators, senior officials currently involved in cybersecurity programme of the government have been tracking the development.\n\n\"In one case, the email system of a company got compromised, while in the other case, the hackers were able to get remote access inside the company's IT system to gain sensitive information,\" said an official. Cyberexperts said both attacks were made through botnets.\n\nBotnets are infected computers that can be controlled by a hacker. \"In one of the cases, the hacker could actually even see when a senior executive would move a mouse on his computer,\" said one person.\n\nIndian companies, including the two cited above, recently provided a list of hacker groups that had attacked them in the past six months. According to the official cited above, these included njRAT, XtreameRAT, h-w0rm, anonghost, SEA and Opsavegaza.\n\nThree of them — anonghost, SEA and Opsavegaza — have been traced as far back as the Middle East. Some experts suspect they could have some connection to the Indian underworld. Domestic intelligence agencies don't back the theory.\n\nIn similar incidents, two big Indian banks were hacked recently by cybercriminals. ET couldn't confirm whether any payment was made to them. One senior bank official said no money had been paid.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T19:05:56.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
