Although this is not the norm across California, it is all-too common in communities where students can least afford to lose learning time. \nAssemblymember Reginald Bryon Jones-Sawyer, Sr. introduced AB 1012 to limit these harmful practices. AB 1012 would: Limit the ability of schools to assign students to classes without educational content or send them home early instead of offering a real academic class; Limit the ability of schools to assign students against their will to classes they’ve already taken and passed; and Create a uniform mechanism to ensure that schools provide all students appropriate educational offerings. \nAB 1012 passed the legislature with unanimous bipartisan support and was recently sent to Gov. Brown’s desk, where it faces an uncertain fate. Your message Subject line * Editable text * I am writing today to ask you to veto the high-tech racial profiling bill, SB 249. On its face, passing SB 249 and allowing the Department of Motor Vehicles to start distributing \"enhanced\" driver's licenses that can also be used for border crossing, might seem like a good idea for California. But dig a little deeper into how these new licenses work and you realize they undo much of the progress California has made in ensuring immigrants are able to fully participate in our economy and society. In fact, because these licenses are only available to U.S. citizens and employers can make having one a job requirement, SB 249 will actually make it legal for employers to refuse to hire anyone who is not a U.S. citizen. They also give law enforcement a new tool for racially profiling people. They link your criminal background check to your driver's license and they broadcast your information to law enforcement and anyone who has an inexpensive device you can make at home to read the number. That means that police officers can know your race, citizenship status, and whether you've been arrested before they can even see you. Racial profiling in police stops is already a huge problem without making the problem worse by giving police the ability to collect sensitive personal information before deciding who to stop and when. Because these new licenses could be read from a distance without you knowing, SB 249 would also make it easier for the government to track protesters. And because these licenses would only be available to citizens, they could also be used by law enforcement or anti-immigrant groups to determine a person's citizenship status without ever interacting with the person. We are experiencing a crisis in biased policing. Now is not the time to enable high-tech racial profiling and discrimination against immigrants. SB 249 lacks the basic safeguards necessary to protect us from police abuses. These new enhanced driver's licenses just aren't safe for California.
