As they flew, the fibre wound itself around the beam.\nA third drone worked on the opposite scaffold to create the foot rail.\nThe demonstration hints at an autonomous future in construction, according to ‘Quartz’.\n“Flying machines offer a number of advantages compared to traditional construction machines,” researchers said on the ETH Zurich’s website.\n“Specifically, they can reach any point in space and fly in or around existing objects,” they said.\n 29, 2015 9:10 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:31:24.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
