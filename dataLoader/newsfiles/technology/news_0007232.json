With each evolution, we aim to elevate our offerings for an easy, inspiring shopping experience.” \nThe new shopping tools include: \nStore Mode for Kohl’s Mobile App : this new mode will provide a more personalized experience for customers while they are in-store, allowing them to search store inventory and access in-store promotions that can be applied to their purchases. \nEnhanced Mobile Payment Options : The rollout of Apple Pay this fall will allow Kohl’s customers to access a new, secure and simple payment option in stores. They have the option to add their Kohl’s Charge card as a form of payment within Apple Pay. Shoppers can also use Apple Pay within the Kohl’s mobile app. Visa Checkout will also be available on Kohls.com and mobile devices. And the Kohl’s mobile app will now feature enhancements to Kohl’s mobile wallet, including an option to scan and save Kohl’s gift cards and access direct delivery of promotional codes. \nOmnichannel Shopping Bag : This new feature bridges the digital shopping carts into one virtual shopping bag that can be accessed via smart phone, tablet, or desktop. That means that shoppers can shop across devices and their shopping bags will automatically be updated when they log into their Kohl’s account. \nBuy Online, Pick Up in Store Across All Channels: As of late September, customers will be able to purchase items online using their smart devices and pick them up in-store. Previously, Kohl’s offered this option for purchases on desktop or laptop. \nKohl’s has also redesigned its Mobile Kohls.com Site and Tablet apps, making it easier to find products and including an improved mobile checkout experience. \nAnd Kohl’s is also piloting same-day delivery for online purchases in select markets. Customers in the pilot areas are able to place orders on any channel, select the same-day delivery option, and their purchases will be delivered later that day. Like what you are reading?
