The company's Rocana Ops product has achieved adoption in three major industries -- financial services, online gaming, and retail. Additionally, Rocana has closed partnership agreements with Cloudera, Hortonworks, Oracle, and other leading providers of enterprise IT solutions. Rocana is bringing a new approach to IT monitoring and administration -- called \"Augmented IT Operations\" -- with greater efficiency, speed and scalability than any competitor can offer in today's market. \nReal time analytics is taking over the market for IT monitoring solutions, yet not every competitor's definition of \"real time\" is the same. Rocana's solution has exceptional speed and efficiencies in storage and power density, making it possible to deliver log and metrics analytics in Human Real Time (sub-second) or Near Real Time (within 15 seconds). With Rocana Ops, no query or visualization takes hours to return a result. Rocana Ops can collect and analyze a higher volume of data and scale faster than any comparable solution on the market. Rocana Ops, released just 6 weeks ago , is already being implemented by customers, the largest of which will collect 1PB worth of data in 30 days. At over 30TBs of data per day, this Rocana installation will be one of the largest IT Operations use cases known in the industry. \n\"Rocana is doing several encouraging things. The most innovative is how they're integrating predictive modeling and business intelligence,\" said Curt Monash , president of Monash Research and editor of DBMS 2 . \"Also, they have outstanding Hadoop people applying Hadoop to tasks for which Hadoop is well-suited, and are focusing on the particular requirements of log-file event-stream analytics.\" \nBuilt on the industry standard Apache Hadoop ecosystem, which provides the base for its exceptional scalability, Rocana Ops features out of the box anomaly detection that identifies IT infrastructure issues. A true real-time streaming function, which integrates with other tools for custom analytics and visualizations, makes it easier for IT operations staff to perform real time analysis against multiple high-volume data feeds. Site Reliability Engineers and other IT administrators get a full view of their infrastructure, and can pinpoint problem areas without resorting to aging paradigms like guess-and-search. \nWith such exceptional capabilities, Rocana has quickly established a key position in the market for real time analytics. Rocana Ops users include industry leaders in financial services, gaming and retail: A global financial services firm looking to consolidate multiple operational monitoring systems into a single system to improve site reliability. A gaming company worried about the interaction of network performance and player experience. A national retailer upgrading its security systems and improving its risk management position. \nYou can view a video of Rocana at: https://youtu.be/HyoBIvrGlyY \n\"As IT infrastructure becomes more complex, there are growing demands by IT operations staff to integrate visualizations, real time analytics and machine learning tools to maintain control of their infrastructure,\" said Omer Trajman, co-founder and CEO of Rocana. \"Fortunately, Rocana has been at the forefront of this movement, because of our unique experience building and operating Big Data solutions, and the unique strengths of our Rocana Ops product. We believe that we are well positioned for continued success as more enterprises demand Augmented IT Operations and real time analytics.\" \nAbout Rocana Rocana provides enterprises with the ability to maintain control of their modern, global-scale infrastructure. By using ​big ​data and advanced analytics, Rocana augments staff skills to increase efficiency and awareness, thereby improving service assurance.
