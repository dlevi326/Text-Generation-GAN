It is a bewildering blend of features: a skull and tiny brain like that of Homo erectus , an upper body suited to climbing, like that of Australopithecus afarensis , and small teeth like those of far more modern hominins. There is evidence of a powerful thumb and a complex wrist that are distinctly human-like—clear signs of regular tool use. But the fingers are strongly curved, suggesting hands that were also regularly used for climbing. The specimens’ femurs have ridges never seen in a hominin. The list goes on. \nGiven the current taxonomy, then, it is impossible to know where H. naledi fits in. Knowing the age of the specimens would help, but their isolation in the chamber has so far frustrated the typical methods of using sediments or nearby animals to date them. (One tantalising possibility is that they survived until relatively recently, segregated from other hominins.) \nIn any case, the grab-bag of characteristics presented by H. naledi —and also by Australopithecus sediba , a species unearthed in South Africa in 2008 which presented a similarly confounding mix-and-match morphology—underscores a shift in palaeoanthropological wisdom. Evolution’s little experiments yield a many-branched tree and not just a timeline; physical features arise and disappear or persist in a way that frustrates efforts to define ancestry just on the basis of what old bones look like. As a result, the idea that there is one clear lineage from the australopithecines to humans via some small number of progressively more human-like ancestors must now be thrown out. And the more excavations are carried out far from eastern Africa, where most of the fossils underpinning our current understanding of the human family tree were dug up, the more diverse and interesting the human story will become.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:08:12.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
