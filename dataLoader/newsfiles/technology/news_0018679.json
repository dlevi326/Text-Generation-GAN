Just in time for the US flu season, Kinsa has announced its second-generation smart thermometer that's designed to read temperatures from the ear, track illness symptoms, and help people take actionable steps. \nA little over two years ago, Kinsa launched its original Smart Thermometer on Indiegogo. Today, these connected devices can be purchased online or in brick-and-mortar stores. Kinsa's new, second-generation Smart Ear Thermometer takes ease of use one step further, which is a boon for those caring for squirmy infants and/or stubborn toddlers. The wireless Smart Ear Thermometer is designed to take accurate, instantaneous temperature readings from the ear without the hassles of an attached smartphone or keeping a probe under the tongue. \nThe Kinsa Smart Ear Thermometer features one-button activation and a screen that displays temperature, battery life, connectivity, and smiley/frowny faces. The thermometer's internal memory is designed to store up to 50 readings, syncing data via Bluetooth with a connected device. \nFor power, the thermometer runs off of a pair of AAA batteries (included). And unlike many other ear thermometers, this one by Kinsa does not need probe covers. It can be wiped clean with a damp cloth between uses. \nJust as with Kinsa's original thermometer, the actual device is only half the experience. The Kinsa app, which is available for iOS and Android, helps families by storing time-stamped temperature readings under unique profiles for each individual member. Users are able to record symptoms, write notes, and save photos. By keeping a log of events, one can take the guesswork out of when to administer another medication or describing situations to doctors. \nIn addition to keeping track of individual records, the Kinsa app can pull up information about symptoms or potential illnesses local to one's area or their child's school. The community-minded nature of the app lets users ask questions and share information openly or anonymously. Along with the provided guidance and recommendations based on recorded data, parents and family members won't be left not knowing what to do. \nThe Kinsa Smart Ear Thermometer is currently funding on Indiegogo, having raised 105 percent of its US$50,000 goal in just one day, with another 30 days left to go. The company states that the purpose of this campaign is to thank original supporters by offering a discount on the Smart Ear Thermometer, grow awareness of Kinsa products, and use the funds to expand FLUency, which is Kinsa's initiative to provide thermometers to families and schools nationwide. \nIf production goes according to plan, the Kinsa Smart Ear Thermometer is expected to be in the hands of backers, available online, and on retail store shelves sometime this November. Its estimated retail price is $60.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:28:16.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
