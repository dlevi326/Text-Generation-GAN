These systems control and manage building facilities such as lighting, electricity, fire precautions, safety, security, and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning. They are installed in buildings such as commercial buildings, IT parks, hotels, restaurants, manufacturing plants, retail outlets, and residential buildings for effective facility management. BEMS includes hardware, software, and services. Building energy software helps in the prediction of energy usage of buildings. The software uses tools for monitoring, controlling, and optimizing electrical loads. Also, it allows the user to monitor and reduce the energy consumption of electrical and electronic devices and conserve energy. It also helps in power management by tracking the real-time energy consumption of electronic devices and comparing it with historical data. End-users obtain a holistic view of their energy performance, which is compiled through a wide array of sensing and control devices, data feeds, and analytics software.Technavio's analysts forecast the global building energy software market to grow at a CAGR of 16.24% over the period 2014-2019.Covered in this ReportThe report includes the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global building energy software market for the period 2015-2019.
