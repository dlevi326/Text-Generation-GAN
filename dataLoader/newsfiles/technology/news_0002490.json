Lufthansa is to offer the new service on 180 of its planes.\nSpohr said customers placed a high value on staying connected, with 85 percent willing to give up other amenities on board to get Internet coverage.\nBut the desire to connect did not extend to voice calls. \"The explicit wish of our customers is not to allow phone calls on board, and I promise you we will guarantee this very last privilege of privacy,\" he told reporters.\nDeutsche Telekom said it would build a network of 300 high-capacity 4G base stations across Europe using dedicated spectrum that would connect to aircraft, with coverage switching to an Inmarsat satellite when the flight was over the sea.\nChief Executive Tim Hoettges said the dedicated network of 4G base stations, which each have a range of about 80 km, would cost in excess of 100 million euros ($112 million).\nAhead of the hybrid network trial, Lufthansa said it would offer in-flight connections on European flights using Inmarsat's separate new satellite network GlobalXpress from 2016.\nAnalysts at Jefferies welcomed the announcements, although questions, for example on the split of revenue and costs, would need to be answered.\n\"While Lufthansa validates the commercial and technical proposition, the presence of Deutsche Telekom validates our view that Inmarsat is uniquely positioned as a 'strategic' cog in the final frontier of wireless,\" they said.\nA air-to-ground network serving commercial aircraft has been offered in the United States by Gogo Inc since 2008.
