FREMONT, CA, September 04,   HandScape, Inc. will soon launch HandyCase (see-through technology for mobile devices). The company will introduce HandyCase on Kickstarter.com September 8, 2015. This ergonomic, patented technology allows users to tap and swipe their tablet or mobile device from the back panel, without obscuring the screen with their hands. HandScape, Inc. was founded in 2013. The company develops software solutions that are reinventing touch technology. HandyCase is thin, light, and durable, and attaches to the back of devices such as iPads. Users are able to see their hands through the screen while interacting with their device from behind. The case is Bluetooth Smart (BLE) and has a long battery life. Tong Luo, Ph.D., Founder and CTO at HandScape, explains \"A key issue for tablet owners is how to hold the device while quickly entering data, typing messages, or playing games.\" App developers have a great tool in their portfolio and can provide an intuitive means to maneuver on-screen objects without users obscuring the screen with their hands. HandyCase allows for one-handed and two-handed interaction with games, maps and other next-generation applications. \"HandScape is delivering a new dimension of input technology for next generation mobile devices. We are putting all of our energy into making HandScape a success,\" says Dr. Luo. HandScape was recently recognized by Forbes in an article titled \"Chinese Startups That Splashed at CES\" and was also nominated for the Top 30 Innovation Award during the 2014 Silicon Valley Innovation and Entrepreneurship Forum (SVIEF).
