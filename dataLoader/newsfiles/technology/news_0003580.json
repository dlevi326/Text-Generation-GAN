This new lightweight charging solution enables an operator to rapidly charge SkyRanger batteries using Protonex SPM (Squad Power Manager) and VPM (Vest Power Manager) intelligent power management kits, and eliminates the weight of a dedicated sUAS charger. \nThe need for military operators to keep SkyRanger batteries charged during demanding and often remote operations can introduce significant challenges. Wall sockets are rarely available, and personnel need to take advantage of any accessible source of power such as solar cells, car batteries, and single-use batteries. The Protonex power managers enable SkyRanger batteries, as well as radio, laptop, and other tactical and civilian batteries, to be charged simultaneously from any available power source, delivering maximum operational uptime, while reducing the need to carry multiple batteries or transport large charging systems. \n“The new charging solution for Aeryon SkyRanger batteries addresses a common challenge faced by military small UAS operators,” said Dave Kroetsch, President and CEO of Aeryon Labs Inc. “This new offering helps the operator move fast and adapt to changing conditions, and is just one example of how we continue to invest in our class-leading sUAS through both in-house R&D and key technology partnerships such as the one with Protonex.” \n”Protonex is pleased to work with partners, like Aeryon Labs, that bring unique capabilities to our warfighters,” elaborated Phil Robinson, Protonex Vice President of Defense Power Systems. “By leveraging power management capabilities that they are already carrying, these operators can deploy new technologies like the SkyRanger without carrying a plethora of new chargers and converters.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T14:54:53.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
