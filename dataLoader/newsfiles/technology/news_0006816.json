Following proof of concept, Portage will look to sell or license the products to large pharmaceutical companies for further development and commercialization. \nPortage is seeking discovery and co-development partners in areas such as cancer, infectious disease, neurology and psychiatry developing novel targeted therapies, stem cell therapy and even older marketed products that have been found to have novel patentable characteristics that bring new value to patients. \nPortage seeks to work with a wide range of partners, in all phases of development through in-licensing or other types of alliances.
