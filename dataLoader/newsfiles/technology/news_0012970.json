A day earlier, Mr Xi had Quote: d Martin Luther King and sprinkled references to US pop culture into his speech to tech executives.\nChina also stressed Mr Xi’s personal connection to the US, with Xinhua news agency carrying a video on its Facebook page — not mentioning that Facebook is blocked in China — showing him putting on a friendly face for Americans.\n\"From Iowa visitor to White House guest,\" the video explains, referring to a brief 1985 visit when Mr Xi was an animal-feed official in Hebei, Iowa’s sister province.\nThe pope’s visit to the US, by contrast, has barely featured in the Chinese media. The Vatican has had no formal diplomatic ties to Beijing since shortly after the Communist Party took power in 1949.\nPope Francis, the most socially progressive pope in generations, has drawn large crowds and the kind of welcome normally reserved for rock stars during his first US visit, which ended in Philadelphia yesterday. US live news networks have hung on his every word and step.\nTalk of the pope dwarfed any attention given Mr Xi’s visit, according to data provided by MediaMiser, which tracks news and media content.\nFrom August 26 to September 25, tweets in the US about Pope Francis topped 765,000, compared to 107,000 for Mr Xi, according to MediaMiser.\nOnline articles from Monday to Thursday last week mentioned the pope nearly four times more than Mr Xi. On television, the pope was mentioned 25 times more.\nPope Francis flew out of Washington, heading to a rapturous reception in New York and a star turn at the United Nations General Assembly, just as Mr Xi was arriving.\nUnder Mr Xi, US-Chinese relations are at a low, hurt by tensions over cyber theft and China’s assertive moves in Asian maritime disputes.\n\"To be contrasted with someone who has no military, no economic might and be completely eclipsed, I think it’s astounding. I don’t think the Chinese are noticing the contrast in messages,\" said Jorge Guajardo, the former Mexican ambassador to China, who lives in Washington.\nChinese officials played down any suggestion that the pope’s visit had eclipsed Mr Xi. \"The pope’s visit, we noticed that and that ... he is welcomed by the public. His visit has his own bearing here. President Xi’s visit has its own bearing,\" said Chinese delegation spokesman Lu Kang.\nMr Xi slid further down the US news agenda on Friday, when Republican House of Representative speaker John Boehner announced his resignation. The big networks quickly cut off Mr Xi speaking with Mr Obama to follow a briefing by Mr Boehner.\nChinese officials have kept security around Mr Xi’s visit particularly tight, limiting his ability to go off script and interact with the public.\nOfficials in Tacoma said the security preparations had been particularly gruelling.\n\"We met with advance teams six or eight times over the summer,\" Tacoma Mayor Marilyn Strickland said of Mr Xi’s visit to the high school.\nMing Xia, a political science professor at the City University of New York who travelled to take part in an anti-Xi protest outside the White House, said the pope’s humility during his visit had highlighted what he called Mr Xi’s arrogance.\n\"The pope was praying with the homeless and said we are all equal in the eyes of God, the real father. Mr Xi thinks he’s the father of the Chinese people — he has assumed the power of God.\"\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:03:11.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
