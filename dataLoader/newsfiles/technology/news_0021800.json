And this could prove to be pivotal in the growth of the Disaster Recovery as-a-Service market going forward. Currently, the revenue contribution from this part of the world to the overall market has been minimal. The poor IT infrastructure, the lack of proper data protection policies, the lower technological appetite and limited financial capabilities have been hampering the growth of solutions like DRaaS. Recently, the region is witnessing technological advancements and this would propel the growth of DRaaS in the coming future.\nSimilar to the Asia-Pacific market, the small and medium businesses here are highly cost conscious and do not invest in new technologies upright. They follow a wait-and-watch approach before investing in technologies. Also, businesses here are not keen on protecting their customer data as there are weak rules governing the data protection. All these factors have contributed towards the slow growth of Disaster Recovery as-a-Service market here.\nGoing forward, with growth technological maturity in the region and improving awareness about the data protection, businesses here are expected to start adopting DRaaS. Also, the affordability factors associated with this solution would certainly make the businesses to go for these solutions.
