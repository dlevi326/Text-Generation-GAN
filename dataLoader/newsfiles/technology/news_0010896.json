Built on complementary app-optimization, networking and cloud virtualization technologies, the platform enables customers to deploy and scale new or existing multi-tier applications in the private or public cloud of their choice, and to simplify the movement of applications between clouds. For the first time, customers can assemble their cloud infrastructure with components from Avni and Citrix. The Avni Software-Defined Cloud platform is verified Citrix ReadyÂ®. \n\"Citrix NetScaler defined the Application Delivery Controller category and continues to lead the market in data traffic optimization for distributed applications,\" said Steve Shah, vice president of product management at Citrix. \"With the advent of cloud computing, Citrix is once again taking a leadership role in delivering advanced technologies and carefully selected partnerships to simplify production-grade deployment of enterprise applications. Together with Avni's Software Defined Cloud, we are filling an important gap between Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Software-as-a-Service -- but, more importantly, solving the severe traffic optimization and security challenges created when companies move web-scale apps, en masse, to the cloud.\" \nThe market for providers of technology addressing cloud app development and migration represents a massive opportunity for network and application technology innovators. According to Forbes , by 2018, 27.8 percent of the worldwide enterprise applications market will be SaaS-based, generating $50.8 billion in revenue, up from $22.6 billion, or 16.6 percent of the market, in 2013 -- a 55 percent increase in five years. \"Demand for SaaS enterprise applications is accelerating and exceeding the demand for on-premises applications by five times,\" said the report's authors(1). \nRelieving Frustrations with Running Production Apps in Clouds \nWorking with Citrix, Avni addresses the challenges of enterprises struggling to maximize app performance and elasticity for their production applications in private or hybrid clouds. Web applications typically contain hundreds of discrete modules and microservices that, when connected, result in a complex mesh of business logic and data traffic. In this environment, optimizing app performance requires traffic optimization, caching, security, and acceleration -- demands met by an application delivery controller such as NetScaler. As companies begin to migrate their production apps to the cloud, they require a platform, such as the Avni SDC, to simplify IT Ops and expedite migration by offering critical application services in a drag-and-drop format for DevOps. This straightforward and intuitive approach allows developers to run those apps in a cloud, migrate apps to a new cloud in the app development process, and move established apps from cloud to cloud. Citrix and Avni's joint work is unique because it allows IT Ops and DevOps personnel to rapidly create, deliver and manage a highly scalable, cloud-based network of web applications. \n\"Avni is first to create a full-featured platform that includes app services, software-defined network services, 3D analytics, policy automation, and cloud virtualization, enabling organizations to operate their digital business in the clouds of their choice,\" said Rohini Kasturi, founder and CEO of Avni. \"The launch of the Avni SDC gives IT Ops and DevOps teams -- for the first time -- the tools necessary to realize an ROI in just a few months as they migrate and operate hundreds or even thousands of apps in private, hybrid, or public clouds. The integration of our SDC with Citrix's powerful NetScaler ADC allows us to overcome the bottlenecks that once drove down the performance and elasticity of individual apps in a large-scale cloud environment. We're delighted to partner with Citrix in making our joint vision a reality.\" \nAbout Avni Avni offers the first Software Defined Cloud platform to automate the deployment of applications to private, public or hybrid clouds.
