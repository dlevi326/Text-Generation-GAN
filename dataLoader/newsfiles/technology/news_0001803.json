Photo courtesy of NOAA WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ Faced with the prospect of a near-record toxic algae bloom in Lake Erie this summer, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Friday it would invest an additional $5 million in a project designed to curb algae-feeding phosphorus runoff from farm fields.\nThe new funds represent a 66 percent increase to the $7.6 million already invested this year in the USDA's Environmental Quality Incentive Program, said Jason Weller, chief of the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service.\nThe injection of capital into the project came in response to a plea two weeks ago by U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.\nIn a letter to Vilsack, Brown and two of his colleagues on the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry asked for help developing a comprehensive strategy to improve water quality in Lake Erie, and to release federal money to help farmers improve their soil conservation practices.\n\"Protecting Lake Erie will require a long-term investment in the region, as well as strategic treatment and prevention efforts,\" Brown said in response to the USDA announcement.\n\"We need to stop runoff before it starts.\" These funds \"ensure that farmers can take actions to preserve water quality and prevent runoff that can cause harmful algae blooms.\"\nThe $5 million boost to the Environmental Quality Incentive Program will help farmers in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan with financial and technical assistance. The program helps farmers to implement conservation practices such as planting cover crops, adding gypsum to soil, using conservation tillage or no-till systems on fields, adding agricultural drainage water management systems, and implementing nutrient management plans, the USDA said in a prepared release.\nSince 2009, the Natural Resources Conservation Service has invested $57 million from Farm Bill programs in Lake Erie's western basin, Weller said. That represents about half the program's total cost. Farmers pay the other half out of their own pockets, he said.\n\"We just want to make sure the farmers in Ohio get credit for all of the work they're putting on their ground,\" Weller said.\n\"These are conservation practices that will ultimately protect Lake Erie. We're trying to be as proactive and responsible as possible.\"\nStudies show that, in the past six years, the work farmers have done with NRCS assistance has had a tangible impact on at least 435,000 acres of cropland, Weller said. Steps taken by farmers have reduced annual sediment losses flowing into Lake Erie by 488,000 tons, nitrogen loss by 7 million pounds, and phosphorous loss by 1.2 million pounds, he said.\nThose benefits were achieved by a science-based survey of thousands of farmers, whose planting practices, soil management, drainage control, and fertilizer application practices were improved, he said.\n\"USDA is committed to helping farmers do their part to protect and improve water quality in Lake Erie, and this targeted funding will allow for solutions to be expanded and delivered more quickly,\" Vilsack said.\n\"We will continue to work with the Western Lake Erie Basin Partnership and other partners across the region to find common ground to address water quality issues in the basin,\" Vilsack added.\nIn the latest report on the toxic algae bloom released Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said a blue-green scum continued to form in high concentrations due to light to moderate winds in the Western Basin. Levels of toxic microcystin were extremely high in the scums, although no toxins had been detected in Toledo's drinking water.\nWith southwest winds in the forecast, the scum was expected to spread eastward into Friday, although there was no indication it would reach Cleveland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:10:39.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
