The district will begin with an instructional basketball session, and eventually add track and field, soccer and flag football. \nA youth travel team will also be available for boys and girls grades 7 and 8. \nThe Bayonne Board of Education will also launch The Academy for Professional Studies, which partners with New Jersey City University to provide opportunities in areas such as business and technology, and the Career Academy, creating a pathway to a career after graduation. \nMeanwhile, Bayonne High School principal Richard J. Baccarella announced that the school will hold its annual \"Back to School Night\" on Monday, Sept. 21 from 6 to 8 p.m. During the course of the evening parents and guardians will follow an abbreviated form of their child's schedule. \nParents and guardians are asked to report to the school's auditorium at 5:30 p.m. There they will be greeted by Baccarella and the administrative staff and will be given a brief overview of life at Bayonne High School. Members of the Bayonne High School Ambassadors Club will then escort the attendees to their child's homeroom. \nDuring homeroom parents and guardians will be given a copy of their child's schedule, which they will follow throughout the night. \nBack to School Night will be held at the city's elementary schools on Sept. 28, with Nicholas Oresko School holding its Back to School Night on Sept. 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T06:40:37.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
