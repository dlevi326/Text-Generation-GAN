Raspberry Pi\nHow touching: the cheap-as-chips Raspberry Pi mini-computer now has an official 7-inch touchscreen for building a basic tablet or control panel.\nThe touchscreen comes from element14, the British company behind Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi micro-computer brain is designed to be plugged into other components to custom-build everything from computers to media servers to smart home devices. It's aimed at enthusiasts and newcomers to building computers and electronic equipment, as well as helping kids to learn to code and learn about hardware at the same time.\nThe Raspberry Pi can be attached to the back of the touchscreen to create a basic tablet, and both will run off one USB power source.\nThe touch screen unit measures 194 by 110 by 20mm. It's only 800x480-pixels, so it's better suited to displaying controls than actually watching content; for that, you're better off linking your Raspberry Pi media centre to a TV or monitor via the built-in HDMI connection. The good news is that the touchscreen doesn't take up the HDMI port so you can have the low-resolution controller screen and a high-res display running at the same time.\nThis content is rated TV-MA, and is for viewers 18 years or older. Are you of age? Yes No Sorry, you are not old enough to view this content.\nPlay The screen will be integrated into the latest Raspbian OS and will work without a keyboard or mouse. It supports 10-finger touch and an onscreen keyboard. Touch input will be enabled on educational software available for the Pi system, or you can develop your own apps and devices.\nMore on Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi 2 model B review What you need to know about Raspberry Pi 2 Rewind: This Raspberry Pi cassette player plays Spotify tunes from actual tapes The screen connects to the Pi's DSI display connector via an adapter board that handles power and signal conversion. It's compatible with the Raspberry Pi 2 released in January this year, which runs a special version of Windows 10, and the original Raspberry Pi models A+ and B+. It does work with the original A and B models too, but the mounting fixtures are designed for the + models. For more details and how to install the simple Kivy interface, check out the Raspberry Pi blog .\nThe touchscreen costs £41.74 in the UK or $60 plus local taxes and shipping in the US. It's on sale from Farnell element14 and CPC in UK and Europe, or from the Swag Store , at RS Components/Allied Electronics and at Premier Farnell/Newark in North America.", "external_links": ["https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/the-eagerly-awaited-raspberry-pi-display/", "http://swag.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-7-inch-touchscreen-display", "http://cpc.farnell.com/raspberry-pi/raspberrypi-display/raspberry-pi-touchscreen-display/dp/SC13858", "http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetmpxpdk/pdk", "http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetjs/js/utils/advertisement.js", "http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/08/950a7014-884b-4621-8346-f92f02409f19/resize/570xauto/ebc18937665158322fb72fa69a0bafd9/rapsberry-pi-touchscreen-7-inch-main.jpg", "http://uk.farnell.com/raspberry-pi/raspberrypi-display/raspberry-pi-7inch-touchscreen/dp/2473872"], "published": "2015-09-08T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:47:26.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
