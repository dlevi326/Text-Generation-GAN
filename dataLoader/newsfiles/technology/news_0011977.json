Tears of joy.\nFirst class travel is up there in bucket list land. Chances are most of us will just dream about it. But when I was invited to try it out on the sky’s big boy, a Qantas A380, on a flight back from Los Angeles, I came home with some very bad news. It totally rocks. And here’s why.\nThe new first class lounge in Los Angeles: things that make you go ‘mmmm’ ...\nLoungin’: and I’m not even on board yet ...\nRoomy: the first class ‘suite’ on a Qantas A380.\nA perky champagne and a caviar canape. Cheers.\nJust in case you DO want to actually talk or eat with someone. You can.\nNo, this isn’t my date but some totally handsome model booked by Qantas to look really attractive when he sleeps.\nToken first-class proof: and lovin’ it …\nThe handset that holds the keys to your next 13 hours of high-flying happiness\nBrekkie time: freshly made Buttermilk pancakes and raspberries. As you do.\n1 of n", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a7d1822a3bccb4c84f5f426358570e96?api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/914437162bb3f8fb84da06cbc65e0810?api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cc9a3fc449312176c6c8f8df411ba243?api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f61eb2eb57d4d9c4a149e7eacca56b29?api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/562392be56746c639d0eda4b9d09993b?api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/47a0c775a01aae99514e88f2489d1dcb?api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/132168c00017d80baf34dff14c4092c7?api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a925786d38180322001767b39c346fea?api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e9cbd13a56b390ddfece84c9f69c01a7?api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5"], "published": "2015-09-29T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T12:26:32.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
