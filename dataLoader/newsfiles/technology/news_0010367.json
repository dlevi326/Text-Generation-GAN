This latest platform features a modern and well-designed UI that makes app development easy even when design, coding or DevOps skills are limited. Application developers at small and medium businesses (SMBs) can now use the same visual rapid application development platform used by WaveMaker's enterprise customers, without the hassles of investing in additional hardware or setting up the software environment. \nWaveMaker addresses three key technology trends: the consumerization of IT, commodity computing and integration ready applications. Together, these trends are aimed at reducing huge upfront technology investments. \n\"An important way for development tools to provide significantly higher reach and productivity is by being more highly abstracted,\" said Stephen D. Hendrick, principal analyst for application development and deployment research at Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG). \"WaveMaker 8 achieves this goal by being built on leading application frameworks and providing modern support for standardized and containerized deployment. A new templatized visual approach to UI development simplifies front-end design, eliminates bottom-up coding, and dramatically reduces time to value.\" \nThe speed and simplicity of building contemporary looking and business-grade apps, particularly when technical experts and designer availability are limited, is useful for SMBs that want to provide custom applications to their employees, as well as software consulting houses that develop applications for their customers. Enterprise developers can also use WMO to evaluate use of WaveMaker Enterprise for on-premises deployment. \nWMO offers complete freedom when developing applications, automatically placing source code through integrations with users' accounts on popular repositories such as Github, also deploying the final packaged application to the user's current hosting provider or cloud. WMO provides integrated continuous delivery capabilities built on Docker containers and familiar technologies including Tomcat, Hibernate, spring, AngularJS and Bootstrap frameworks. \nWhile the code generation and backend design of WaveMaker was inherited from earlier releases (acquired from VMWare ), the UI and application front-end portions are completely new in WaveMaker 8. The key highlights of WaveMaker 8 platform include: Visual development of applications via drag and drop tools, which means no need for writing code from scratch Designer-built templates and themes, adhering to modern UI design practices App development completed in days versus weeks or months Collaboration among developers for faster completion Use of code that runs on industry-standard infrastructure and frameworks \n\"I never thought I would be able to use a rapid application development tool to create a sophisticated Cloud Management Portal, but WaveMaker has proven to be amazing,\" said Dave Durkee, ENKI Corp., Enterprise Cloud Company, California. \n\"WaveMaker 8 makes developing responsive web apps even more easily and quick,\" said Deepak Anupalli, vice president engineering at WaveMaker. \"Themes provide a means to corporate branding or consistent look and feel across apps, and templates give developers a head start for building modern UI. WaveMakerOnline.com brings this ability to all developers irrespective of the size of the company.\" \nWaveMaker Online is available for a 30-day free trial and has convenient pricing options.
