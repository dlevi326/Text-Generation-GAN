The series will share \"from the trenches\" advice, expertise, and direct experiences for managing business-critical responsibilities and optimizing infrastructure performance management.\nThe webinars are free, 60-minute presentations for CIOs and IT professionals, whether current Galileo users or not. On a quarterly basis, webinars will include discussions by recognized industry experts and analysts, customer case studies, as well as occasional ‘lunch and learn’ formats for IT administrators addressing specific “how to” solve performance management issues.\nThe first webinar will be held on September 16 at 2:00pm EST, where Galileo is teaming with Taneja Group, a leading analyst and consulting group focused on storage, server, networking, and other infrastructure technologies, including Big Data and Cloud. Discussions will focus on a \"from the trenches\" executive overview presenting best practices and practical applications by Mike Matchett, Sr. Analyst and Consultant from Taneja, along with ATS Group / Galileo co-founders Chris Churchey and Tim Conley. It will focus on:\n How to better prevent system slowdowns How to troubleshoot problems faster in IT environments How to best size environments on-premise, cloud, or hybrid How to keep IT environments running optimally How to gain predictive operational insight into IT environments\n“We know firsthand the constant pressure for IT teams to focus on larger, \"more pressing\" issues like cost-cutting, consolidation, outsourcing, research, and implementation of new technology for competitive advantage,” said Galileo principal and co-founder Chris Churchey. “We also know that it's easy for the common day-to-day performance and user experience headaches caused by any data center environment to be lost in the mix. With decades of experience and a large staff focused with clients on solving their infrastructure performance management issues, we can share not only the expertise provided by Galileo Performance Explorer, but we also raise industry respect for IT’s ability to support business growth.”\nTo attend, register online on the Galileo website.
