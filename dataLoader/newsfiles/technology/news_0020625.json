Energy savings have not balanced out high costs. This could change that.\" \nYu developed this new LED technology using a combination of organic and inorganic materials. The material, which dissolve and can be applied like paint, shines a blue, green or red light and can be used to make a light bulb. \nBut what makes it really special is that it's far simpler to manufacture than existing products on the market. \nMost LED materials require engineers to put four or five layers of material on top of each other to create the desired product or effect. Yu's material only requires one layer. \n\"In the future, to do manufacturing, it's a big challenge if you have to deal with multiple layers,\" he said. \nHis research has resulted in an award by the National Science Foundation to further investigate the essential materials and establish the processing platform for the development of intrinsically stretchable, active-matrix organic LED displays. \nThe research is crucial to the development of LED technology, which is fast becoming an avenue to reduce the country's electric consumption. LED lighting is already sold in stores, but widespread adoption has been slow because of the costs associated with the material and the quality. \nBut, LED lights do save energy. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, residential LED lighting uses at least 75 percent less energy than regular incandescent lighting. \nYu came to FSU by way of the Energy and Materials Strategic Faculty Hiring Initiative. He is a researcher at the FSU's High-Performance Materials Institute (HPMI), a multidisciplinary research institute dedicated to the research and development of advanced materials and manufacturing technologies. \n\"HPMI has really benefitted from Dr. Yu's diligent work, as well as the other top researchers who have joined FSU as part of the Energy and Materials Strategic Hiring Initiative,\" said Richard Liang, director of the High-Performance Materials Institute. \nOther authors on the journal article published in Advanced Materials were FSU post doctoral researcher Junqiang Li and graduate students Sri Ganesh Bade and Xin Shan. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:23:26.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
