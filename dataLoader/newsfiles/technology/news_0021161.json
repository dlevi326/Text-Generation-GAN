MORE ROUTER AND SWITCH MARKET HIGHLIGHTS With the SDN hesitation slowing router and carrier Ethernet switch spending, IHS is projecting the worldwide service provider router and switch market to grow at a 2.0 percent compound annual growth rate from 2014 to 2019. Carrier switching and routing revenue was up in all major geographical regions in 2Q15 from a year ago, with the exception of Asia Pacific, which was down 16 percent. It was the usual suspects vying for router-only market share in 2Q15, with Cisco leading, Huawei maintaining the 2-spot, Juniper rising to 3 rd and Alcatel-Lucent a very close 4 th .
