Spending at U.S. restaurants and bars overtook grocery stores for the first time in March, with take-out sales appealing to eateries that can boost business during peak periods without adding seats.\n“We obviously want to grow this,” Amazon Restaurants General Manager Gus Lopez said in an interview.\nChicago-based GrubHub, Inc. connected 30,000 local restaurants with customers in 800 U.S. cities, as of the end of 2014. The company estimates Americans spent $70 billion on take-out meals in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:33:49.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
