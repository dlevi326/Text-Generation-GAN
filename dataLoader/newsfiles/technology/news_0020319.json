Not only does it take far less time, you know that the components are going to work well together and you don't even need to think about thermal paste. The problem is that many cobbled together rigs come with poorly designed cases that can make slotting in new components a chore.\nEnter the Lenovo Ideacentre Y900: a pre-build desktop gaming rig that packs plenty of power and comes in a case that won't leave you dreading the day you want to swap out the graphics card or other components. The chassis isn't as showy as other pre-built gaming PCs such as Acer's Predator G6 , which was also shown off at IFA 2015, but it's attractive nonetheless in a more subtle sort of way.\nThe chassis is big enough to accommodate full ATX motherboards and supports power supplies up to 1000W, which is pretty standard fare. The neat part is that you can pop off a number of panels with the press of a single button to gain access to certain areas without the use of any tools.\nThe top panel, for example, comes off easily and lets you pop in a fan to be used as part of a water-cooling system. The side panel, which is transparent to let you keep an eye on components and read any LED information codes they made be displaying, also comes away with a single press. On the front of the machine is a panel that reveals a dust filter once removed. Instead of stressing your PC's fans by sticking a vacuum cleaner nozzle in there, you can simply remove the filter and tap its contents into a bin. There's also a handle on the top of the Y900 to make carrying it around easier.\nThe Ideacentre Y900 should make upgrading components a breeze, but you won't have to do so for a while as the machine has enough power to chew through the latest titles from the start. It can be configured with up to a sixth-generation Intel Quad-Core i7-K processor backed up by up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM (achievable using four DIMM slots). Graphics duties are taken care of by an Nvidia GTX 980 GPU - and there's enough space to slot in another graphics card for a dual GPU setup. There's also space for up to four hard drives that can store up to 2TB each.\nThere's a wealth of ports along the front of the machine, including a 7-in-1 card reader, SDHX, SDXC, MMC, 4 x USB 2.0 ports, 4 x USB 3.0 ports (one which supports always-on USB charging) and an audio/microphone jack.\nFlip the machine around about you'll find 2 x USB 2.0 ports, 4 x USB 3.0 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI/VGA/DVI ports for video-out and 6 x audio jack with 7.1 surround sound support.\nEarly verdict Lenovo's Ideacentre Y900 is a different kind of pre-built beast. It's powerful enough to make you not have to worry about upgrading it for quite some time, but when you do, at least you know it won't be a stress-filled exercise. Intel's Skylake processor and top-end Nvidia graphics make it a serious proposition, and one that even custom PC builders may be interesting in thanks to its approach to accessibility, upgradability and maintenance.\nIFA coverage brought to you by the new Xperiaâ„¢ Z5 from Sony\nWhat is a hands on review? 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.
