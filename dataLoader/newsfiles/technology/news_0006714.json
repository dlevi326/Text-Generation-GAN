In future there is a strong desire to reduce design cycle time by replacing tests with advanced numerical analysis. Significant research advances have been made in recent years, especially in modelling interlaminar failure in composites and disbonding in adhesive joints with cohesive interface finite elements. This project seeks to investigate a range of challenging cases for the numerical models to predict failure. It will apply and validate these techniques on representative structural elements and identify areas requiring further development. Additional research challenges to be addressed include predicting the effect of variable thickness bondlines under mixed mode loading, and of different temperature and environmental conditions. This project is supported by BAE Systems. \nHow to apply: \nPlease make an online application for this project at http://www.bris.ac.uk/pg-howtoapply .
