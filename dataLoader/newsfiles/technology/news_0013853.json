The handheld projector uses a laser light source to deliver HD resolution images (1920 x 720), with high contrast (80,000:1) for accurate colors. The short-throw, pocket-sized mobile projector can display a screen size up to 120 inches, and can be used indoors and outdoors for home and mobile entertainment, business presentations and to display content from smartphones or tablets. \n“This is Sony’s first stand-alone Pico projector, but not our first projector,” said Viviano Cantu, Director Product Marketing, Media & Applications Solutions Division. “We combined the best of everything we’ve learned over years of designing large and small projection technologies for the home and office, and the result is this on-the-go mobile projector that easily turns virtually any surface into an HD theater through a simple Wi-Fi or HDMI connection.” \nSony’s Laser Beam Scanning (LBS) technology helps to maintain the projector’s small size and light weight. This processing system also enables its HD resolution and focus-free projection, allowing for seamless viewing on uneven surfaces. With the addition of auto focus, the projector can keep constant, uninterrupted focus at various distances without the need for manual adjustments. The unit also provides the ability for keystone correction to maintain screen uniformity, both vertically and horizontally, despite angled surfaces. \nThe device has an aluminum body with a matte finish. It features a built-in 3400mAh battery, which can also charge a cell phone or tablet via the USB port and the projector additionally includes a USB cable and detachable stand.
