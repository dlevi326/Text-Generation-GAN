With a 43% growth in its number of new customers, the UAE remains the company's largest market in the Middle East.\n\nThe company made significant inroads in the region this year with major customer wins, such as Abu Dhabi Gas Industries Ltd. (GASCO), flydubai and American University of Sharjah (AUS) to name a few. With the deployment of Veeam Availability Suite„, GASCO, for instance, managed to maximize productivity, save money and renew its commitment to observing a sustainable and green strategy across its business. \"Installation of Veeam was far more cost-effective than our previous solution and we have also saved US10,000 each year in new storage. Due to instant VM Recovery our IT team minimized disruption to the company's 5,000 users,\" confirms Abdullah Al Marzouqi, Manager, Systems Support for GASCO.\n\nVeeam's ongoing success in 2015 has been fueled by the strategic strengthening of its channel. One of the biggest channel initiatives was the launch of the VMCE certification training program that has enabled channel to fulfill end-to-end transactions with minimal support from the Veeam team. This approach proved to be successful as from January 2015 to June 2015 Veeam saw an 86% year-on-year increase in the number of ProPartners in UAE.\n\n\"Technologies such as virtualization, storage and cloud, on which the modern data center is built, have gained tremendous momentum in the Middle East on account of the obvious benefits of simplifying IT operations, reducing costs and allowing IT organizations to respond faster to changing business demands. However, enterprises in the UAE are still grappling with the challenges of maintaining an Always-On Business and the demand from end users requiring round the clock access to data and applications. We have witnessed a large number of enterprise customers showing a great deal of interest in Veeam's technologies for the modern data center as they seek to ensure availability for users. Thanks to the highly supportive Veeam's ProPartner program, we have been able to equip ourselves with all the tools we need to become trusted advisors and consultants to customers. We are happy to have been able to contribute to Veeam's success in the region,\" concludes Mr. Mohannad Saaydeh, Sales Director at Emitac, Veeam Gold ProPartner.\n\nWhile the results in the first half of 2015 have been strong, Veeam continues investing, adding to headcount and expanding its partner network to achieve the ambitious growth targets set for the UAE. Veeam Availability Suite v9, coming out later this year, will offer service providers a direct pipeline to benefit from the Veeam ecosystem through the opportunity to provide customers with Veeam Cloud Connect replication and cloud-based disaster recovery-as-a-service (DRaaS). \n\n\"Enterprises in the UAE, particularly in the BFSI, government, education, medical and O&G sectors continue to rely on Veeam to protect and ensure availability of their modern data centers. The growth we've experienced would not have been possible without the relationships we have built with our ProPartners and the credibility Veeam solutions have among customers. The fact that Veeam adds four thousand customers per month around the world proves todays demand for availability is just increasing,\" says Gregg Petersen, Regional Director, Middle East and SAARC, Veeam Software.\n\n\nAbout Veeam Software \nVeeam recognizes the new challenges companies across the globe face in enabling the Always-On Business„, a business that must operate 24/7/365. To address this, Veeam has pioneered a new market of Availability for the Modern Data Center„. Unlike \"Legacy Backup\" solutions which provide recovery time (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) of hours or days, Veeam helps organizations meet recovery time and point objectives (RTPO„) of less than 15 minutes for all applications and data. This is achieved through a fundamentally new kind of solution that delivers high-speed recovery, data loss avoidance, verified protection, leveraged data and complete visibility. Veeam Availability Suite„, which includes Veeam Backup & Replication„, leverages virtualization, storage, and cloud technologies that enable the modern data center to help organizations save time, mitigate risks, and dramatically reduce capital and operational costs. Founded in 2006, Veeam currently has 33,000 ProPartners and more than 157,000 customers worldwide. Veeam's global headquarters are located in Baar, Switzerland, and the company has offices throughout the world.
