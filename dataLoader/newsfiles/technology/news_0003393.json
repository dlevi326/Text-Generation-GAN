The popular conference again attracted record attendance, with 75 technology companies participating and nearly 300 total registrants, including distribution CEOs, industry analysts and channel partner executives. GTDC members drive more than $135 billion in global product and services business, covering 187 countries worldwide. \nThe conference begins this evening with a reception and dinner recognizing the distribution industry's \"Rising Star\" award winners -- the fastest-growing companies in distribution sales over the past year (related press release to be distributed Thursday, Sept. 10, at 9 a.m. EDT). Gerry Smith , Lenovo's executive vice president and chief operating officer, PC & EBG business groups, will be featured in a \"fireside chat\" that kicks-off the conference, which includes a broad range of business-building sessions and networking opportunities throughout the day tomorrow. Today, the Global Technology Distribution Council's board of directors unanimously approved the appointment of Arrow Electronics chairman and CEO Mike Long as the organization's vice chairman, which contributes to the GTDC's overall strategic direction and role as an industry thought leader. He'll be among the many distribution CEOs and other executives on hand for the Rising Star awards event. \nDelving into service requirements reshaping market landscape \n\"Technology companies and their distributors have never faced such sweeping changes,\" commented GTDC CEO Tim Curran . \"This year's Summit puts it all into perspective -- the toughest of challenges as well as unprecedented emerging opportunities that supply-chain leaders are addressing with diverse new services and investments. Top technology distribution CEOs are face-to-face with the channel leaders of today's most successful IT companies. The agenda is clear -- to bring the full power of all IT channels to the forefront of the most salient changes reshaping the market landscape across North America.\" \nLong, the GTDC's newly appointed vice chairman, added, \"It's exhilarating to be part of such a transformative period in our industry's history, and I'm honored to take on this role as the GTDC and our vendor partners connect with distribution in ways that are truly groundbreaking. The Rising Stars that take the stage tonight reflect the advances already well in progress. They represent the most dynamic sectors of the marketplace, from cloud to mobility, security, virtualization, hyper-converged infrastructure and much more. It's all here and with a proactive partnership mentality that exceeds what I've ever witnessed over the years in distribution.\" \nRed Hat CEO to keynote second day of 2015 Summit GTDC Chairman and SYNNEX CEO Kevin Murai begins the sessions tomorrow, which include Curran's annual state of the industry presentation, followed by keynote Jim Whitehurst , CEO of Red Hat. In addition to participating in private meetings, attendees will also take advantage of the conference's most compelling panels and sessions in the history of GTDC Summit, now in its 13th year. \n\"We're delivering on our commitment to provide the best industry analyst perspective as well as deeper dives into data showing how routes-to-market are transforming, plus more executive networking options than any of our previous Summit conferences,\" Curran explained, noting that panels feature distribution CEOs while breakout sessions include top analysts from Global Touch ( Denise Sangster ), IDC ( Darren Bibby ), IPED ( Beth Vanni ) and channel program insight and guidance from VIA International Chairman Julian Dent , author of Distribution Channels - Understanding and Managing Channels to Market.
