Conference attendees are invited to join Paradigm at booth #4033 , where the company will present its SKUA-GOCAD (TM) interpretation-to-modeling platform, Geolog (®) formation evaluation system, and Interpret (TM) well test interpretation solution. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150918/267988 \nThe Paradigm technical program will include demonstrations of the latest enhancements to SKUA-GOCAD, as well as a new plug-in from GeoScale for pore pressure prediction and wellbore stability in SKUA-GOCAD. The industry-leading Geolog system will be presented, and audiences will be treated to a glimpse of the new capabilities in the upcoming Geolog 7.4 release, including log-based geomechanics and production logging. The presentations will also focus on how both Geolog and SKUA-GOCAD can be used to optimize returns from unconventional plays in today's challenging environment. \nIn addition, Paradigm subject matter experts will be on hand to provide individual demonstrations of the latest version of Interpret, which provides deeper insights into the reservoir through a new implementation of pressure transient deconvolution. \n\"Paradigm is continually enhancing its products to help our customers analyze and integrate all of their data, in order to better understand and manage their reservoirs,\" said Emmanuel Gringarten, director of Product Management. \"We look forward to showing visitors to our booth at SPE just how the latest versions of our reservoir characterization, modeling and engineering solutions can help them enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and control risks.\" \nFor more information on Paradigm products and services, visit www.pdgm.com , or e-mail info@pdgm.com . \nAbout Paradigm(®) Paradigm ( www.pdgm.com ) is the largest independent developer of software-enabled solutions to the global oil and gas industry.
