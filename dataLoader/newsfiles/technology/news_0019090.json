Meet Magento Brazil 2015 will take place on October 5th, at the Hotel Caesar Business Faria Lima in SÃ£o Paulo. Brazil is expected to become the fourth largest eCommerce market in the world by 2016, and much of region's eCommerce explosion is fueled by innovative local retail businesses built on Magento.\n\"From the hosting perspective, eCommerce markets are similar: they need great performance, sustained reliability, and a hosting company that can support their store as it grows. But each region is also different in it own way,\" commented Chris Wells, President and CEO of Nexcess, \"Part of the excitement of sponsoring events like Meet Magento Brazil is discovering what the specific needs of local eCommerce retailers are and how our Magento hosting platform can best serve those needs.\"\nIn addition to sponsoring Meet Magento Brazil, the Nexcess team will be present to meet with members of the Brazilian eCommerce community and learn about the needs of Brazilian eCommerce retailers. Nexcess Community Developer Miguel Balparda will be giving a presentation entitled Maintaining An Open Source Extension, in which he will discuss the lessons learned maintaining the Nexcess-developed Turpentine extension, which improves the integration of Magento with the Varnish cache.\nNexcess is a global eCommerce hosting provider and its Miami data center offers excellent network connections to South American eCommerce markets. Nexcess is well placed to accommodate the hosting requirements of Brazilian eCommerce retailers and international retailers ready to expand into a flourishing market.\nNexcess offers a full spectrum of Magento hosting plans from its Miami facility, which range from plans suitable for smaller stores to complex clustered configurations capable of supporting the largest online retail presence.\n###\nAbout Nexcess\nNexcess is a Southfield, Michigan-based managed Magento hosting company founded in 2000, with data centers distributed throughout the United States, Europe, and Australia.
