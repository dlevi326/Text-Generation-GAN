Launched earlier this summer, ArtistWorks for Libraries is now live at participating libraries. “Many children and adults spend hundreds or thousands of dollars a year on private music instruction—or do not have the means or access to accomplished professionals,” said Rich Freese, Recorded Books president and CEO. “ArtistWorks for Libraries offers many communities an alternative to high-cost private-arts instruction.”\nArtistWorks for Libraries provides patrons with world-class music, voice and art instruction through self-paced video lessons taught by highly accomplished and Grammy Award–winning music and art professionals.\nArtistWorks for Libraries offers 24 instrumental, voice and fine arts classes providing patrons with everything they need, from the basics of an instrument through intermediate instruction to advanced playing. Patrons can also enjoy on-the-go learning without needing an app since ArtistWorks for Libraries is browser enabled for both desktop and mobile devices.\n###\nFor more information regarding Recorded Books’ ArtistWorks for Libraries service, email artistworks(at)recordedbooks(dot)com or call 1-877-828-2833.\nAbout Recorded Books\nRecorded Books is the largest independent publisher of unabridged audiobooks and provider of digital media to consumer, retail, professional, school, library and infotainment markets.
