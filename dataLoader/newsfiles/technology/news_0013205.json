August 16, 2012 \nResearchers have designed a metal oxide catalyst for removing pollutants from diesel engine exhaust that could potentially replace costly platinum catalysts. Researchers design a catalyst that neutralizes gases responsible for climate change June 13, 2013 \nThis new technology, developed by the Research Group in Carbon Materials and Environmental allows, through a catalytic system active, efficient and stable over time, to eliminate nitrous oxide decomposing it into nontoxic ... Improved low-temperature performance of catalytic converters January 30, 2014 \n(Phys.org) —Toxic vehicle emissions, such as carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons, are chemically converted to benign compounds, like carbon dioxide (CO2) and water, by catalytic converters. Although catalytic converters ... The state of research on two catalysts that can work in lean-burn engines June 9, 2015 \nLean-burn engines operate under net oxidizing conditions to improve fuel efficiency by more than 25 percent, compared to conventional engines. Unfortunately, the added air causes the performance of conventional exhaust emission ... Molecular fuel cell catalysts hold promise for efficient energy storage July 15, 2015 \nIn the quest for better, less expensive ways to store and use energy, platinum and other precious metals play an important role. They serve as catalysts to propel the most efficient fuel cells, but they are costly and rare. Scientists discover precise location of active sites on popular catalyst August 13, 2015 \nIf you want to change a situation, it's often best to get to the heart of the matter. For chemists, this often means delving into the active sites of catalysts, which speed the reactions behind billions of dollars worth of ... Recommended for you Biodiesel made easier and cleaner with waste-recycling catalyst September 14, 2015 \nResearchers at Cardiff University have devised a way of increasing the yield of biodiesel by using the waste left over from its production process. New catalyst addresses engine efficiency, emissions quandary September 14, 2015 \nA catalyst being developed by researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory could overcome one of the key obstacles still preventing automobile engines from running more cleanly and efficiently. Programming tool could help engineers build biologically inspired materials September 14, 2015 \nFor decades, materials scientists have worked to infuse the lessons learned from natural proteins into the design of new materials. Scientists produce cancer drug from rare plant in lab September 10, 2015 \nMany of the drugs we take today to treat pain, fight cancer or thwart disease were originally identified in plants, some of which are endangered or hard to grow. In many cases, those plants are still the primary source of ... German researchers using plants to mine germanium September 9, 2015 \nA team of researchers at Germany's Freiburg University of Mining and Technology has found a new way to get germanium (which was first discovered in that country and used in early transistors), according to a report from Reuters—they ... 'Lab-on-a-Chip' technology to cut costs of sophisticated tests for diseases and disorders September 11, 2015 \nRutgers engineers have developed a breakthrough device that can significantly reduce the cost of sophisticated lab tests for medical disorders and diseases, such as HIV, Lyme disease and syphilis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T18:58:27.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
