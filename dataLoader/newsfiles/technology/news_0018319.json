So the nickname for this cosmic object—the Sunflower Galaxy—is no coincidence. \nDiscovered by Pierre Mechain in 1779, the galaxy later made it as the 63rd entry into fellow French astronomer Charles Messier's famous catalogue, published in 1781. The two astronomers spotted the Sunflower Galaxy's glow in the small, northern constellation Canes Venatici (the Hunting Dogs). We now know this galaxy is about 27 million light-years away and belongs to the M51 Group—a group of galaxies, named after its brightest member, Messier 51, another spiral-shaped galaxy dubbed the Whirlpool Galaxy. \nGalactic arms, sunflowers and whirlpools are only a few examples of nature's apparent preference for spirals. For galaxies like Messier 63 the winding arms shine bright because of the presence of recently formed, blue–white giant stars and clusters, readily seen in this Hubble image. Messier 61 looks straight into Hubble's camera June 21, 2013 \n(Phys.org) —The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has captured this image of nearby spiral galaxy Messier 61, also known as NGC 4303. The galaxy, located only 55 million light-years away from Earth, is roughly the size of ... NASA image: A hungry starburst galaxy May 13, 2014 \n(Phys.org) —This new Hubble picture is the sharpest ever image of the core of spiral galaxy Messier 61. Taken using the High Resolution Channel of Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys, the central part of the galaxy is ... Image: Hubble sees a dwarf galaxy shaped by a grand design June 24, 2014 \n(Phys.org) —The subject of this Hubble image is NGC 5474, a dwarf galaxy located 21 million light-years away in the constellation of Ursa Major (The Great Bear). This beautiful image was taken with Hubble's Advanced Camera ... Image: Hubble sees a fascinating galactic core June 8, 2015 \nThis elliptical galaxy was discovered in March 1781 and lies about 60 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Virgo (The Virgin). The galaxy is part of the very heavily populated center of the Virgo Cluster, ... Hubble looks at stunning spiral July 13, 2015 \nThis little-known galaxy, officially named J04542829-6625280, but most often referred to as LEDA 89996, is a classic example of a spiral galaxy. The galaxy is much like our own galaxy, the Milky Way. Image: Hubble peers into the heart of a galactic maelstrom September 7, 2015 \nThis NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image shows Messier 96, a spiral galaxy just over 35 million light-years away in the constellation of Leo (The Lion). It is of about the same mass and size as the Milky Way. It was first ... Recommended for you Astronomers peer into the 'amniotic sac' of a planet-hosting star September 13, 2015 \nAstronomers have successfully peered through the 'amniotic sac' of a star that is still forming to observe the innermost region of a burgeoning solar system for the first time. Mysterious, massive, magnetic stars September 11, 2015 \nA Canadian PhD student has discovered a unique object – two massive stars with magnetic fields in a binary system. Matt Shultz of Queen's University, Ontario, Canada found the system – Epsilon Lupi – and will publish ... New Pluto images from NASA's New Horizons September 11, 2015 \nNew close-up images of Pluto from NASA's New Horizons spacecraft reveal a bewildering variety of surface features that have scientists reeling because of their range and complexity. Ceres' bright spots seen in striking new detail September 9, 2015 \nThe brightest spots on the dwarf planet Ceres gleam with mystery in new views delivered by NASA's Dawn spacecraft. These closest-yet views of Occator crater, with a resolution of 450 feet (140 meters) per pixel, give scientists ... Astronomers discover how lowly dwarf galaxy becomes star-forming powerhouse September 9, 2015 \nA nearby dwarf galaxy poses an intriguing mystery: How is it able to form brilliant star clusters without the dusty, gas-rich environments found in larger galaxies? The answer, astronomers believe, lies in densely packed ... Mars panorama from Curiosity shows petrified sand dunes September 12, 2015 \nSome of the dark sandstone in an area being explored by NASA's Curiosity Mars rover shows texture and inclined bedding structures characteristic of deposits that formed as sand dunes, then were cemented into rock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:05:07.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
