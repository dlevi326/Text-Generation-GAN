Among them was pink-haired software developer Jo Engo, 37, who has lobbied Apple leaders past and present for a phone in his favorite color.\n\"I have emailed not only Steve Jobs but Tim Cook,\" Engo said outside the store. \"I'm so excited they're finally doing it.\"\nPhones in rose-gold - an approximation of pink - proved popular at stores in New York and San Francisco.\nFBR Capital Markets senior analyst Daniel Ives said the color was a \"major selling point.\"\nRepair firm iFixit, which opened up an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus on Friday, said battery capacity was down \"a bit\", probably to accommodate the Taptic Engine. Apple has said battery life is unchanged in the new phones. (http://bit.ly/1OxY5xs)\nThe new iPhones use chips made by, among others, Qualcomm Inc, Avago Technologies Ltd, Qorvo Inc's TriQuint Semiconductor and RF Micro Devices, Texas Instruments Inc and Skyworks Solutions Inc.\nShares of audio chipmaker Cirrus Logic Inc jumped more than 17 percent after iFixit's tear-down revealed that Apple had used its chips, as it did in previous iPhones.\nThe iPhone 6s also houses NAND flash memory chips made by Toshiba Corp, while the iPhone 6 used memory chips made by SanDisk Corp.\nLackluster offerings this year from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd will help Apple stand out in the marketplace, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. He said he expected the 6s to eclipse the 6 \"over the long haul.\"\nThe 6s and 6s Plus start at US$199 and US$299 respectively with a two-year service-provider contract.\n(Reporting by Pauline Askin in Sydney, Siddharth Cavale in New York, Julia Love in San Francisco and Supriya Kurane, Lehar Maan and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Writing by Lincoln Feast and Robin Paxton; Editing by Stephen Coates and Ted Kerr)\n- Reuters/al\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source=", "http://bit.ly/1OxY5xs)"], "published": "2015-09-26T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T22:03:18.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
