It is housed in an elegant wooden frame, and can be updated from anywhere in the world using a simple Web interface. Just like a normal old-fashioned sign, you can use the Glyph to display information to people. That’s a pretty broad set of uses – what makes Glyph different is that you can change what it displays at any time, remotely. This means that it need never show out-of-date information and that it can be re-used endlessly.\nGlyph is perfect as a desk calendar or daily agenda, linked to an online calendar and automatically showing what is planned for the day ahead. It also can be used for Meeting room booking display. Hook it up to the office calendar, and never have to argue over rooms again, or simply use it as a “Do Not Disturb” sign for the bedroom door. However, before everyone can enjoy this e-paper, Glyph needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise £33,000 by October 22, 2015.\nTo help bring this innovative e-sign to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered between October 2015 and June 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help Glyph reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nGavin Sallery\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
