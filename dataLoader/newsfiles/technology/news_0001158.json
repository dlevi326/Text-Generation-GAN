More information on QBracelet\nJames Kernan, the project leader of the award winning Wearable Technology project QBracelet said “The QBracelet is a stylish bracelet designed for both men and women that has the ability to charge smartphones. When designing the QBracelet, the Q team was driven by the minimalism exhibited during the Mod era of the late 1960s through 1980s. When looking at the QBracelet you might notice the clean lines, and lack of distinguishing marks on the fluid surface all of which give it an iconic minimalistic design. The QBracelet has set the bar in terms of the possibilities for the marriage of technology and fashion.” Learn more: https://competition.adesignaward.com/design.php?ID=37851\nDesign Team for QBracelet\nQBracelet was realized by James Kernan and Alessandro Libani\nThe Golden A' Design Award\nThe Golden A' Design Award is a prestigious award given to top 3% percentile designs that has achieved an exemplary level of excellence in design.
