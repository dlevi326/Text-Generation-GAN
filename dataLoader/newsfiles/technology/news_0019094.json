(AP) â€” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called social media a powerful tool for democracy and touted his goals for developing India's tech economy during a \"town hall\" meeting hosted Sunday by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the headquarters of the world's largest social network.\nResponding to a question, Modi also vowed to improve education for girls and expand opportunities for women in his country.\nModi got a warm welcome from about 1,000 people at the Facebook event, many of them Indian immigrants and tech workers. The hour-long session came during a whirlwind tour of Silicon Valley that included meetings with the CEOs of Apple and Google.\nThe prime minister is scheduled to speak later at a rally that's expected to draw 18,000 people to a sports arena in downtown San Jose.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-27T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T22:43:31.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
