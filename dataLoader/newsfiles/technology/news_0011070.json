Credit: Diaz and Trainor, BMC Evolutionary Biology 2015 \nThe chameleon's exceptional tree-climbing ability is dependent on vital ball-and-socket joints in its wrists and ankles, according to research published in the open access journal BMC Evolutionary Biology . The study also finds that chameleons have twice the number of wrist and ankle skeletal elements than previously thought, and explains how they evolved to live in the trees. \nNo other living reptile is as well adapted to a tree-climbing lifestyle as the chameleon. One of the animal's most distinctive traits is its 'two-toed' feet, which are actually bundles of digits bound together by connected tissue, similar to duck feet and bat wings. This hand and foot shape aids in precision, security and mobility in the tree environment, relying on gripping branches rather than the use of claws and specialized skin as in other lizards. \nTo find out more about these unique adaptations and how they develop, researchers studied embryos of the Veiled Chameleon ( Chamaeleo calyptratus ) collected at various time points. \nThe species has a particularly slow rate of embryo development (around 200 days) allowing the team to gain detailed insights into the development of its hands, feet and limbs, and compare them with eight other chameleon species and two non-chameleon lizards. \nLead author Raul Diaz from La Sierra University, USA, said: \"Most of what we know about vertebrate development comes from zebrafish, frogs, chickens, mice and humans. Looking at atypical species, such as the Veiled Chameleon, forces us to begin to think within an evolutionary framework to try and figure out how a unique chameleon body was made. This provides us with a deeper appreciation for the evolution of the animal biodiversity we see today.\" \nThe study showed that to develop the chameleon's unique hands and feet, the most important aspect is the remodeling of the wrist and ankle skeleton in order to make a ball-and-socket joint. This allows for greater rotation of the wrist and ankle, which is important while climbing. Morphogenesis of Autopodia. Credit: Diaz and Trainor, BMC Evolutionary Biology 2015 \nThe larger, more recently evolved, tree-climbing chameleons were also found to have more individual skeletal elements in their wrists and ankles (up to eight) than the smaller, earlier diverged species that are generally ground and bush climbers (four skeletal elements). \nThe authors explain that more wrist and ankle components may have facilitated greater wrist flexion and provided a biomechanical advantage which allowed later species to leave the ground cover and occupy the trees. SHH. Credit: Diaz and Trainor, BMC Evolutionary Biology 2015 \nThe chameleons with reduced numbers of wrist and ankle skeletal elements had a larger angle between their two bundles of digits. They appeared to move slower while climbing and take more careful steps in their environment of grasses and bushes, rather than living up in the trees. \nThe authors say that studying organisms in the lab with unique developmental characteristics complements biomedical studies of development and malformations in humans and other more broadly studied species . Conspicuous social signaling drives the evolution of chameleon color change January 29, 2008 \nWhat drove the evolution of color change in chameleons? Chameleons can use color change to camouflage and to signal to other chameleons, but a new paper published in the open-access journal PLoS Biology shows that the need ... Study shows male chameleons fighting prowess tied to color changing abilities December 11, 2013 \n(Phys.org) —Two researchers from Arizona State University have found that male chameleons use their color changing abilities for far more than hiding from predators. In their paper published in the journal Royal Society ... Chameleon reorganizes its nanocrystals to change colors March 10, 2015 \nMany chameleons have the remarkable ability to exhibit complex and rapid color changes during social interactions. A collaboration of scientists within the Sections of Biology and Physics of the Faculty of Science from the ... 11 new species come to light in Madagascar May 25, 2015 \nMadagascar is home to extraordinary biodiversity, but in the past few decades, the island's forests and associated biodiversity have been under greater attack than ever. Rapid deforestation is affecting the biotopes of hundreds ... Chameleons' eyes are not so independent July 8, 2015 \nFamed for their ability to change colour, chameleons have yet another mind-boggling talent: their eyes appear to swivel completely independently. This means that they can simultaneously track two completely different views ... Chameleons' swiveling eyes not as independent as once thought August 21, 2015 \nWell known among nature's best tricksters for their ability to change color to fit their background, chameleons have yet another talent up their lizardly sleeves – eyes that swivel around and appear to be looking in two ...

However, with advancing age the potential for regeneration in the brain dramatically declines. Scientists of the University of Zurich now identified ... Naturally occurring 'GM' butterflies produced by gene transfer of wasp-associated viruses September 17, 2015 \nResearch teams from the University of Valencia and the University of Tours have discovered that genes originating from parasitic wasps are present in the genomes of many butterflies.

These building blocks of life are constantly changing. They can spontaneously express different proteins and genes, change shape and size, die or resist dying, or become damaged and cancerous. ... Sponge cells build skeletons with pole-and-beam structure September 17, 2015 \nResearchers reporting in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on September 17 have found that sponges build their skeletons in a completely different way than other animals do.
