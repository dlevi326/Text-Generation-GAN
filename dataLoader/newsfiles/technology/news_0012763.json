Sales of the iconic smartphone contributed more than two-thirds of the Cupertino, California, company's $107 billion in revenue during the first half of 2015.\nThe newest product from Apple arrives as smartphone sales slow globally, with so many people already carrying them.\nBut researchers at IDC, an industry data provider, say that iPhone sales are growing faster those of its rival, Android. IDC expects iPhone shipments to grow by 16 percent this year, while it estimates Android phones will grow only 10 percent.\nAnalysts said demand is being boosted partly by China, which is being included in the initial launch for the first time. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said he expects China to add 2 million units to the opening weekend.\n\"We believe the takeaway is that the 6S is off to a solid start and should continue to gain share at the high-end of the smartphone market,\" he wrote.\nFBR analyst Dan Ives also said demand in China should help boost sales results, despite its volatile economy.\n\"While we are keeping a close eye on China given the macro backdrop and consumer worries, we believe Apple's 'white-hot momentum' in the country will continue in coming quarters,\" he said, since there is room to grow market share, growing demand for its App store and other selling opportunities there.\nShares of Apple Inc., based in Cupertino, California, rose $1.47 to $115.68 Monday.\n ", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-09-14T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T20:53:46.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
