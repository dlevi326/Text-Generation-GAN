He said he received a large 'goody bag' filled with Xiaomi items that he planned to try out. \nBoth posts were written in Chinese. A look at Rupert Murdoch's new Weibo account. \nMurdoch then issued a series of English posts on Weibo. In one, he said he was looking forward to flying home to be with his \"two beautiful Chinese daughters,\" children from his marriage to ex-wife Wendi Deng. \nAnd then he bemoaned the boring food in New York. \n\"Wonderful Chinese food in Beijing. Now back to boring diet in NY,\" he wrote. \"Any suggestions for places with real Chinese food?\" \nHis latest message complimented Beijing on its airport while taking a swipe at crumbling infrastructure in the U.S. \n\"Leaving great Beijing airport - reminder of abandoned third rate US infrastructure. Hopeless planning and wrong priorities.\" \nThe 84-year old billionaire is not the first high-profile Western executive to open a Weibo account. \nApple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) CEO Tim Cook published his first post on Weibo in May and has since racked up over 710,000 followers. \nMurdoch has spent decades building a global media empire that includes 21st Century Fox ( FOX ) and News Corp ( NWS ) . He recently elevated his sons -- James and Lachlan -- to top positions at 21st Century Fox. \nMurdoch is very active on Twitter and has roughly 618,000 followers. He frequently tweets about American politics and business issues. \n--Sophia Yan and Pamela Boykoff contributed to this report.
