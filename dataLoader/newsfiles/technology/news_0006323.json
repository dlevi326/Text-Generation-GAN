The film market in mainland China is the world's second largest, with box office receipts increasing by 36% last year to ¥29.6 billion. \n\"We look forward to working with CMC in this exciting new venture, as we gain additional insight into the Chinese film industry. Warner Bros has a proud legacy of making great movies, and we're excited to share that expertise with our colleagues in China. The country's incredibly rich history and culture provide a huge trove of great stories, and we want to help tell those stories for new generations of filmgoers, in China and around the world,\" said Kevin Tsujihara, chairman and CEO, Warner Bros . \nRuigang Li, founding chairman, CMC, added: \"CMC has been actively investing and operating throughout the ecosystem around the explosive content market in China and around the world. With the proliferation of platforms available to consumers, premium content is more valuable than ever. This partnership with Hollywood's most iconic studio will bring Warner Bros' deep experience in creative storytelling and unparalleled expertise in producing global titles to China's film industry. \n\"It will also further CMC's commitment to building a premier platform for making films that resonate with both Chinese and worldwide audiences, helping to enhance the cultural exchange between China and the rest of the world.\" \nFlagship Entertainment will be based in Hong Kong, with offices in Beijing and Los Angeles.
