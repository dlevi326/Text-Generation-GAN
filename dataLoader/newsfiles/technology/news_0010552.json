Gold also finds it easier to compete with interest-yielding assets, like Treasurys, when rates are pinned near zero.\nLooking ahead, more US data and the dollar are likely to direct the precious metal.\n\"With NFPs [nonfarm payrolls] at the end of the week, I suspect we will stay range bound until then,\" says David Govett, head of precious metals trading at Marex Spectron, in a note.\nPlatinum prices rebounded slightly from near seven-year lows, meanwhile, after prices tested a low of $US900.46 an ounce in the previous session.\nSpot platinum was trading up 1 per cent at $US923.11 an ounce.\nSentiment for the metal has grown increasingly bearish over the past fortnight as a result of the Volkswagen AG emissions scandal, which saw the German car maker admit 11 million of its diesel-engine vehicles were fitted with software to dodge strict US auto-pollution regulations. Some two million of these cars were sold in Europe -- the biggest diesel car market in the world.\nPlatinum is used twice as much as palladium in the autocatalysts of diesel engine cars, and fears that damage to the brand could see demand slump has led to a rush by investors to jettison some of their holdings.\nAmong the other precious metals, spot palladium continued to trade higher. It is almost exclusively used in gasoline engine vehicles, which could see an uptick in demand following the scandal.\nSpot palladium was up 1.3 per cent at $US662.70 an ounce, and spot silver was up 0.4 per cent at $US14.665 an ounce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T17:54:28.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
