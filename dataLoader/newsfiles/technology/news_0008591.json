Protection programs provided by wireless carriers and large retailers typically only cover new devices that were purchased in the past 30 days. Providing protection for pre-owned devices is an attractive product offering to the independent wireless retail channel because many of the devices that these retailers sell and service are certified refurbished or pre-owned.\nThe Mobilio Protection Plan is a prepaid PIN-based plan that allows retailers to use a process that they are already familiar with to sell a phone protection plan. Retailers simply select Mobilio Protection from WebPOS and print the prepaid PIN on a receipt containing the details of the plan with simple instructions for the consumer to follow and self-register. Registration happens either from their mobile device or from their home computer. The plan has simple pricing with a low one-time annual fee starting at $39.99.\nAbout epay\nepay, a Division of Euronet Worldwide, Inc.
