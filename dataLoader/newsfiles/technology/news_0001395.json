He also argues that the design of the tomb suggests it was built for a queen, rather than a king. \n\"I agree with him that there's probably something behind the walls,\" el-Damaty said. But he said if anyone is buried there it is likely Kia, believed by some Egyptologists to be King Tut's mother. \nNefertiti, who was famed for her beauty and was the subject of a famous 3,300 year-old bust, was the primary wife of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, who introduced an early form of monotheism. Akhenaten was succeeded by a pharaoh referred to as Smenkhare and then Tut, who is widely believed to have been Akhenaten's son. \nReeves argues that Smenkhare is actually Nefertiti. \n\"Nefertiti disappears... according to the latest inscriptions just being found,\" said Reeves, explaining his theory inside King Tut's tomb. \"I think that Nefertiti didn't disappear, she simply changed her name.\" \nAfter Nefertiti died, Tut was responsible for burying her, and then when he died someone decided to extend the tomb, Reeves suggested. \"I think since Nefertiti had been buried a decade before, they remembered that tomb was there and they thought, well, perhaps we can extend it,\" he said. \nAny discovery would provide more information about this turbulent time in ancient Egypt. \n\"Akhenaten's family is full of secrets and historical issues that have yet to be resolved,\" el-Damaty said.
