It’s an important question in a world of Digital Transformations . The traditional IT strategies that kept the network running and database licenses up to date will not drive competitive advantage in tomorrow’s world of industrialized IT. In Jonathan Murray’s view, ‘Time to Value’ is the new metric against which all IT organizations should be measured. Jonathan Murray is currently interim CTO for The New York Times and former EVP & CTO at Warner Music Group. He is a leading advocate for Time to Value strategies as the key organizing principle for Enterprise IT. I recently spoke with him about the world of industrialized IT, Time to Value and some related concepts he sees driving future IT strategy. Q: What is driving IT’s changing role in business strategy versus the traditional role of keeping the lights on and the network running? A: We are living through a time of radical change as businesses compete in an increasingly global and digitally transformed service economy. Companies used to exist in a pretty well defined world. Customer and market needs didn’t change that frequently and as a result IT was a fairly static function providing the plumbing to enable a range of large scale monolithic back office applications. We don’t live in that world anymore. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Uber and a long list of others changed the landscape and with it the way we think about IT enabling digital business model strategies. These radical new business models co-evolved with the enabling technology strategy and have been powered by a new generation of deeply automated – industrialized - cloud computing resources and Hybrid IT tooling. This approach empowers firms to build an optimal business strategy designed for change and to be constantly evolving the way value is delivered to customers. This type of highly adaptive, and responsive customer-driven engagement can’t be accomplished with traditional models of static enterprise IT. Q: If I gave you one word to characterize the value that enterprises can create from all these resources what would that word be? And how should IT people use that word to talk to senior management? A: The word is “Speed.” And speed can function on at least a couple of levels. At an execution level, any business rule or function that can be automated should be automated. In terms of IT strategy, IT organizations need to gear themselves to deliver business value every day. It used to be that we would design a project, specify the systems, install those systems, test the applications and, finally, we would deliver a project after 18 to 24 months. That’s a losing strategy in an era of constantly shifting markets and consumer needs. As to management’s concerns, the old saying that what gets measured gets managed is generally true. If you can give management a metric they understand, you can get their attention. Time to Value is a metric that I use. Time to Value is the time delta between demand coming in from the business and that demand being satisfied with new capability. We should also be aiming to enable the continuous delivery of value over time. IT’s job should be to shorten that window of time and to increase the continuous flow of value back to the business. Q: Are there downsides to moving so quickly? A: The downside to not moving quickly is very clear – you cede competitive advantage to someone else. Speed needs to be at the heart of the entire development model, rather than an excuse for making mistakes. Any IT project exists within a framework of three parameters: Cost, Time, and Value Created. As you prioritize speed, you need to accept that some decisions will be sub-optimal. This ‘Technical Debt’, is a set of things you have to go back and fix at some point in the future. Trying to build a 100% solution at any point in time is the antithesis of agile, continuous delivery. If you get the solution or service into the market first, you buy yourself the time to go back and optimize things in the future and you give the customer an experience that gets better all the time. You just have to build that continuous improvement into the plan, the budget and the conversation with management. Q: Last question. Where are the big opportunities for IT to create value in today’s enterprise? A: Data is the lifeblood of modern enterprises. It used to be that controlling certain data sets created power within organizations. Sales people had the sales data. Marketing had the marketing data and so on. But, in that siloed model, no one had the complete picture of what was happening. Successful enterprises cannot operate that way anymore. All of the organization’s data has to be available as a single body of information that is constantly growing, accessible to anyone that needs it and governed effectively to ensure quality and completeness. Data engineering is a key discipline required by every enterprise that aspires to compete in today’s global digital services economy. IT needs to have the expertise to be the data engineers of the modern enterprise.
