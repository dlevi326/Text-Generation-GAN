Telecom Company, Rebtel, (www.rebtel.com) recently collaborated with the ace actor and stand-up comic to create a series of videos surrounding their Unlimited Call Plan to India for $8 a month and the first month absolutely free. Vir has uploaded three of his conceptualized videos on Twitter so far and they’re nothing short of hilarious. Whether it’s his grandfather calling him to get the scoop on Game of Thrones, his niece boring him to death with never-ending gossip, or a confusion laden phone call from Harvard, Vir’s videos pack a punch that syncs in perfectly with Unlimited Calling.\n“Collaborating with Vir has been nothing short of a master stroke. His first 3 videos are not only relevant but entertaining, and we expect continued success from the rest of the series,” states US Marketing Manager, Varun Atrey. “We’ve been getting great feedback for Vir’s videos on Twitter and with the first few videos already up, users are eagerly looking forward to the remaining 5.”\nVir is slated to upload a total of 8 hilarious videos on Twitter. The videos will all be centered on Rebtel’s Unlimited Calling plan to India and can be found on (https://www.facebook.com/Rebtel/videos). The three that have recently hit are creating a frenzy amongst users. The first video features Vir’s grandfather calling him from the US to learn the ins and outs of ‘Game of Thrones’. The second video is a call from Harvard inviting him to speak at the university only to realize that it was a case of a wrong number and the third video is a call from an annoying niece who insists on boring Vir with the minute details of her friend’s love life. All of these videos have a comical spin and with five more to come, users can watch out for even more out-of-he box topics and themes.\nTo get all the scoop on Rebtel’s Unlimited calling plan to India, to learn more about Vir Das’ collaboration with Rebtel, or connect for media purposes, email eosborn@beautifulplanning.com.
