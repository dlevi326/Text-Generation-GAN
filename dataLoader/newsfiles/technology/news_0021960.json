Proper control of the control system on the air compressor is extremely critical for high performance and efficient system operations. A key objective of any air compressor control mechanism is also to shut down unwanted compressors or delay the inclusion of additional compressors to the air compression system until needed. Browse Full Global Air Compressor Controller Market Report With Complete TOC @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/air-compressor-controller-market.html Not a very long time ago, most air compressor controller systems used mechanical pressure switches, gauges and relays. Setup of these units is usually quite complicated and complex, especially during coordinating multiple air compressors. Modern day air compressor controllers use cutting edge electronic parts with advanced microprocessors that are programmed with suitable algorithms to make compressors work more efficiently. The efficiency of these modern day air compressor controllers can be further increased by incorporating more advanced features to the control algorithms. The global air compressor controller market is a billion dollar market, and the demand for increasingly sophisticated controller mechanisms is on a constant rise from the flourishing oil and gas, petrochemical, and energy and mining industries across the globe, which are the major end users of air compressor systems. Global Market for Air Compressor Controller Systems: Market Dynamics A report published by Transparency Market Research, covering the global market for air compressor controllers, states that the market will develop at a 5.8% CAGR over the period 2015-22 and rise to US$ 5.44 billion by 2022.
