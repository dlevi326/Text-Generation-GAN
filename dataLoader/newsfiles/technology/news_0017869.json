Everyone who works there rides around on bicycles. It’s so huge it has its very own weather system. If they closed the windows, it would literally rain inside.”\nEn route to Frankfurt, Kay was amazed to be the only photographer on-board. “All the economy seats were yet to be installed so there were these amazing angles that aren’t normally possible.\nSeeing the line of the sunset through the rows of porthole windows was just incredible. And then the pilot dipped the plane and waved goodbye to Seattle and everybody cheered.”\nChoosing art over sleep, Kay spent much of the overnight flight taking photographs, the results of which, combined with images culled from his years of shooting planes at Pearson, are now inspiring a unique line of clothing and housewares that Kay has dubbed Very Plane Clothes and Very Plane Home — both of which will feature limited editions of Kay’s aviation photography in ever-evolving new and clever forms.\nSays Kay, “I’m sure that plane nerds will love it, but I want it to be glamorous and fun.”\nAnd fun it is. On close inspection, a lacy, filigreed wallpaper reveals itself as a pattern of tiny white planes flying into formation on a sky-blue background which Kay calls “Air-gyle.”\nA zip-front aviation-styled bomber jacket features the sunset view from an airline’s porthole as a sort of bull’s eye at chest level, right where it hits even the most jaded traveller every time. Plans for porthole-print pillows and leather goods for travel are in the works.\nSays Kay, “planes transport people and so, in a way, does fashion. Put on a new jacket, and you can arrive at a different persona.”\nAnd of course the same applies to fashions for home — particularly when you’ve had the opportunity to hop aboard one of those great, sexy, engineered beasts, taken in the view and made it back again.\nMore on thestar.com\nNASA announces discovery of flowing water on Mars\nDoctors' Notes: It's time to turn research into tangible solutions", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T19:22:28.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
