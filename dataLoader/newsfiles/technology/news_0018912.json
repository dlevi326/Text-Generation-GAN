Tough foam from tiny sheets July 29, 2014 \nTough, ultralight foam of atom-thick sheets can be made to any size and shape through a chemical process invented at Rice University. Trapping vortices key to high-current superconductors July 2, 2015 \nIf we are to see the promised benefits of high-temperature superconductors, such as low-loss motors and generators or maglev trains, we will need superconductors that can carry very large currents. 'White graphene' structures can take the heat July 15, 2015 \nThree-dimensional structures of boron nitride might be the right stuff to keep small electronics cool, according to scientists at Rice University. Scientists use particle accelerator to visualize properties of nanoscale electronic materials July 16, 2015 \nA technique devised by UCLA researchers could help scientists better understand a tiny—but potentially important—component of next-generation electronic devices. A cost-effective solution to tuned graphene production July 29, 2015 \nGraphene has been called the miracle material but the single-atomic layer material is still seeking its place in the materials world. Now a method to make 'defective' graphene could provide the answer. Recommended for you Researchers characterize individual defects inside a bulk insulator using scanning tunneling microscopy September 3, 2015 \nNanoscale defects are enormously important in shaping the electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of a material. For example, a defect may donate charge or scatter electrons moving from one point to another. However, ... For 2-D boron, it's all about that base September 2, 2015 \nRice University scientists have theoretically determined that the properties of atom-thick sheets of boron depend on where those atoms land. Polymerization of carbon cage structures to linear diamond-like structures inside carbon nanotubes September 2, 2015 \nThe inner space of carbon nanotubes can act as a template for the synthesis of nanodiamond-like carbon chains. As a team of scientists from Japan, Germany, and the United States report in the journal Angewandte Chemie, this ... An engineered surface unsticks sticky water droplets August 31, 2015 \nThe leaves of the lotus flower, and other natural surfaces that repel water and dirt, have been the model for many types of engineered liquid-repelling surfaces. As slippery as these surfaces are, however, tiny water droplets ... Electrical circuit made of gel can repair itself August 25, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—Scientists have fabricated a flexible electrical circuit that, when cut into two pieces, can repair itself and fully restore its original conductivity. The circuit is made of a new gel that possesses a combination ... Scientists grow high-quality graphene from tea tree extract August 21, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—Graphene has been grown from materials as diverse as plastic, cockroaches, Girl Scout cookies, and dog feces, and can theoretically be grown from any carbon source. However, scientists are still looking for a ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T14:14:04.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
