As the number of journalists continues to shrink, PR firms are offering businesses a wide range of editorial media services that includes: creating and publishing online magazines; writing articles, columns and features; creating video news reports; etc. \nAlso known as “content marketing” it’s an attempt to try to plug the gaps in media coverage of companies that journalists once provided. It’s become a huge market. \nWeber Shandwick offers its media services through a business division called “ Mediaco - We Help Every Company Become A Media Company ”. [I worked with Mediaco last year on a client project.] \nForemski’s Take: \nThe subject of media disruption has been of constant interest to me ever since I left the Financial Times in mid-2004 and became an online publisher. I warned that the media industry was headed for a severe fall as it transitioned to a digital business because online ad revenues would be a fraction of print revenues. I also warned that this media disruption would change the PR industry. \nI saw that every company would have to become a media company to some degree, to help tell their own stories. And that’s what has happened over the past ten years as and now “Every company is a media company” is a well understood trend and is fueling an explosion of new business in “Content Marketing.” \nI’ve worked with giant companies such as Intel, which has several online media projects, most notably Intel IQ and Intel Free Press. It publishes a lot of high quality editorial content that emulates independent magazines. \nEvery company is a media company. However, many companies misunderstand what’s involved. It does not mean writing endless stories about yourself. \nMedia companies provide a service. The Financial Times and Wall Street Journal provide a financial news service and rarely write about themselves. \nCorporations need to find a media service they can provide to their target community. It is fine to publish content about yourself but that’s called marketing or PR. \nEditorial Media Is A Service… \nMy definition for “Editorial Content” is that it doesn’t look like marketing or PR content but provides a service to others — it is Media as a Service (MaaS). \nContent that is self-serving is called marketing or PR, which is fine and necessary but companies already have plenty of that type of content. Editorial content is different and it’s hard to do well. \nI was hoping Weber would share some of the lessons it has learned from its Mediaco operations. But maybe that’ll be the topic for the next event. \nHere’s some lessons I’ve learned over the past decade: \n- Editorial content often turns out looking like marketing or PR — even when former newspaper reporters are hired. This is often because they are led by a marketing or PR boss. Their new boss should be like their old boss. \n- Company organizations have to change. Editorial must be an independent department in the same way as HR, Finance, Engineering, Marketing, and PR are collaborative but independent groups with their own agendas. \n- Editorial content is journalistic in its look and feel and offers a service to its target community. It could be a calendar of events regularly updated; it can be interviews with key industry people not directly associated with the company; it can be a media service that fills a gap in news coverage that independent media once produced; , etc. \n- Editorial content succeeds when it is Media as a Service. The best media is MaaS Media. \nThe future of corporate media… \nI’d love to hear from a panel of people working to create editorial media projects within large corporations such as Ken Kaplan and colleagues at Intel, and similar pioneers at Cisco Systems and other places. These are the people on the front lines in trying to create a new form of corporate media and a future for journalism. \nWe know journalism is being disrupted but here’s what we don’t know: \n- Can corporate media can fill the void? \n- How will journalism be reborn? What will be the business model? Advertising can’t produce enough revenues and paywalls cut off the Internet’s best feature? instant mass distribution. \n- How does corporate editorial media create trust? \n- How do large organizations overcome internal barriers to producing editorial content? \n- How does a company create an effective editorial work process? It is not the same way PR or marketing is produced. \n-Should you hire former journalists or use PR professionals to produce editorial content? \nThere are a million questions about the future of media and corporations’ abilities to succeed in this role. I’m looking forward to figuring out some of the answers!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T07:44:15.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
