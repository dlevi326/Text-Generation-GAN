The tests drew an unusual amount of attention because the upper floors of the building were outfitted with equipment that's commonly found in the intensive care units and surgical suites of hospitals. \nThe following year, Colorado State University scientists used the shake table to study how earthquakes can affect wood frame \"soft story\" structures. The name refers to the fact that part of the first floor of such buildings are left open to make room for parking or for large windows.\nConte said future projects might including the construction of a 10-story structure to examine the seismic properties of cross laminated timber.\nGary Robbins   More from Gary Robbins UCSD wins $5.2 million for earthquake simulator Pope's plea on environment resonates in San Diego SDSU raises $121 million for research", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T08:49:42.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
