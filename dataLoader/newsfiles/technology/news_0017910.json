ControlByNet’s i-flashback CLOUD security solution enables schools to monitor multiple areas within the school or on the grounds with the most flexible CLOUD based video surveillance system on the market. ControlByNet donated a four camera surveillance solution to help document intruders and visitors to the property. Peachtree Ridge High School, in a suburb of Atlanta, has a softball field located in an isolated area which has become an easy target for vandalism. Incidents include frequent graffiti, as well as joy riders driving through the field in vehicles such as four wheelers and golf carts resulting in expensive damage to the field. The area also includes a concession stand with expensive equipment and desirable snacks which tempts break-ins by hungry mischief makers.\n“ControlByNet’s solution is a welcome addition to the ball fields where our kids play,” said Robby Fernandez, board member to the softball organization. “The ControlByNet surveillance solution allows us to know what is going on during games and after hours.”\nThe initial installation includes onsite solution with dual recording capabilities being utilized. As wireless becomes available from the school the cameras will be recorded directly to the cloud with clear digital video that is accessible at any time from any mobile device. In the meantime an onsite solution with dual recording capabilities is being utilized.\n“We are committed to supporting the youth of our community and helping keep their facilities in top playing conditions and reduce vandalism,” said Ryan Strange, CEO of ControlByNet. “We are thankful for the opportunity to give back to our community by providing access to our solution,”\nAbout ControlByNet ( http://www.ControlByNet.com )\nControlByNet provides the most flexible Cloud and managed IP-based surveillance solution on the market.
