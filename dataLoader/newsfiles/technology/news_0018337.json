Shanghai ended 0.38 per cent higher and Hong Kong added 0.30 per cent. Seoul put on almost one per cent and Sydney ticked up 0.46 per cent.\nWall Street stocks slid further after most having already fallen on Thursday in the wake of the Fed's announcement.\nNear mid-day Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.97 per cent, the S&P 500 0.64 per cent and the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index 0.34 per cent.\nThe Fed's decision followed widespread warnings about the dire impact a rate increase could have, with the World Bank predicting this week it would cause a \"perfect storm\" in financial markets.\nStruggling emerging market currencies, which had been rising this week on hopes the Fed would hold fire, rose further.\nThe South Korea won added 0.27 per cent, the Malaysian ringgit gained 0.64 per cent, India's rupee was one per cent higher and the Singapore dollar was up 0.06 per cent. The Thai baht and Taiwan dollar also laid on further gains.\nThe Fed decision also hurt the dollar against the yen sliding to 119.94 yen in European trading, compared with 120.90 yen in Asia Thursday.\nHowever, the euro slid to $US1.1365 from $US1.1436 a day earlier, after Benoit Coeure, a member of the European Central Bank's executive board, vowed the ECB would \"protect the eurozone from external financial shocks\".\nThe rate of return on eurozone bonds had already been falling as investors anticipated the Fed's decision might prompt the ECB to step up its QE stimulus programme of bond purchases.\nHowever stocks in Europe fell as investors saw the Fed inaction as confirmation of the global economic outlook .\n\"The Federal Reserve's fear over a global growth slowdown cast a shadow across the whole of the FTSE 100,\" said Lawler, with both commodities companies dependent on emerging markets and banks that would have done well from rising interest rates taking hits.\nStandard Chartered fell 2.48 per cent to close at 722.70 pence, trading, RBS sank 2.18 per cent to 318.90 pence, Barclays dropped 2.76 per cent to 253.25 pence, and HSBC reversed 2.36 per cent to 490.65 pence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:28:39.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
