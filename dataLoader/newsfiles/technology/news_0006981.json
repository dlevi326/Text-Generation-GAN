(ISC)² is pleased once again to celebrate the accomplishments of private and public sector industry leaders outside of U.S. federal government throughout the Americas who are inspiring change within the information security workforce. Recipients will be announced during the fifth annual (ISC)² Security Congress on the evening of September 30. Part of (ISC)²’s Global Awards Program, Americas ISLA aims to recognize the achievements of outstanding information security professionals who have led an industry workforce improvement initiative, program or project. The program recognizes professionals who are leading initiatives that result in a more proficient, resilient information security workforce in Central, North, and South America. The recognition categories include: Information Security Practitioner, Senior Information Security Professional, and Up-and-Coming Information Security Professional and Community Awareness.\n(ISC)² CEO David Shearer says, “Cyber, information, software and infrastructure security professionals do not always get the opportunity to be in the spotlight for the great work they do. It’s usually considered a behind the scenes type of role until a breach occurs – then they are in the spotlight for the wrong reasons. We believe in recognizing the workforce innovations that are driving information security professionals forward. I congratulate this year’s Americas ISLA finalists and look forward to celebrating with them at the gala in Anaheim.”\nThe 2015 Americas ISLA finalists are as follows:\nSenior Information Security Professional Category\nBob Cheong, CISSP, chief information security officer at Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) (U.S.A.)
