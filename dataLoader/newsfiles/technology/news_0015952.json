The atlas bolsters the chances for developing wind energy in the region. \nAccurate wind data lives in a disjointed and disjunctive world. The researchers have meshed these data to create a high-definition atlas, using information gathered from weather stations, buoys, QuikSCAT (a NASA satellite that collects wind direction and speed data over water bodies) and satellites equipped with synthetic aperture radar , or SAR. \n\"The techniques that we have employed optimize the strengths of each measurement type, allowing a longtime series of data to be combined with the exceptional spatial resolution of the satellites – corrected for gaps in data due to ice cover in the winter months – using a new algorithm,\" said lead author Paula Doubrawa, a Cornell doctoral candidate in the field of engineering. \nDoubrawa, her adviser Rebecca Barthelmie, professor of engineering, and others published, \"Satellite winds as a tool for offshore wind resource assessment: The Great Lakes Wind Atlas\" in the journal Remote Sensing of Environment (October 2015.) \nFor years, scientists, economists and environmentalists have touted the potential for wind-energy development in the Great Lakes region, as it features a large expanse of exploitable wind resources. The lakes – touching eight states and two Canadian provinces – extend over 150,000 square miles, creating about 84 percent of North America's surface freshwater and 21 percent of Earth's total surface freshwater. \nWind resources are difficult to quantify accurately, Doubrawa said. For example, surface ice formation during winter months precludes retrieval of wind speeds from satellites and warrants removal of buoys. Additionally, offshore observations are sparse, and sometimes wind data derived from satellite scatterometers (microwave radar sensors) and SAR may not be available either in time or at the required location \n\"The compilation and analysis of these datasets is very time-consuming – and now the work has been done,\" said Barthelmie, a faculty fellow in Cornell's Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future. \"Assembling this atlas and this kind of work helps agencies that plan wind farms or manage where wind farms will be located by identifying optimal locations.\" \nSaid Barthelmie: \"These maps can be integrated with other GIS-type databases – for example, mapping shipping lanes or recreational areas – to help plan where wind farms might be located as a balance between wind resource and existing constraints.\" Wind energy creating a problem with military and weather radar November 8, 2011 \n(PhysOrg.com) -- With the push for creating green energy, giant windmill farms are becoming more and more common for electricity production. However, the National Weather Service and the United States Air Force say these ... Just how green is wind power? March 30, 2015 \nWind power may have a positive image, but setting up offshore wind farms is complicated and energy-intensive. Because Siemens promises its customers and the authorities a high degree of transparency for the environmental ... Offshore wind farms, hurricanes, and sustainability August 4, 2015 \nBlock Island, which is located 13 miles off the Rhode Island coast, will soon be home to North America's first offshore wind farm. Late last month, Deepwater Wind, the company behind the $338 million project, installed the ... Researchers find way for eagles and wind turbines to coexist August 27, 2015 \nCollisions with wind turbines kill about 100 golden eagles a year in some locations, but a new study that maps both potential wind-power sites and nesting patterns of the birds reveals sweet spots, where potential for wind ... As wind-turbine farms expand, research shows they could offer diminishing returns August 31, 2015 \nRenewable wind energy is experiencing a boom, with more wind turbines popping up across landscapes in the U.S. and abroad. Indeed, wind energy accounted for 3.3 percent of electricity generation in the United States in 2011, ... Probing the limits of wind power generation September 2, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—Wind turbine farms now account for an estimated 3.3 percent of electricity generation in the United States, and 2.9 percent of electricity generated globally. The wind turbine industry is growing along all vectors, ...
