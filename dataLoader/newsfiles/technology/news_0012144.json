Overall, 12 percent to 14 percent of adults had diagnosed diabetes in 2012, the latest data available. Most of that is Type 2 diabetes, the kind linked with obesity and inactivity.\nAlmost 40 percent have pre-diabetes, meaning elevated blood sugar levels that could lead to full-fledged disease. Studies have shown lifestyle changes can delay or prevent diabetes in these people.\nWhites had lower diabetes rates than Hispanics, blacks and Asian-Americans.\nThe study is based on surveys involving in-home exams and questionnaires.
