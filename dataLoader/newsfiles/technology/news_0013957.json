Now Android fans are panning it.\nThe free app, called Move to iOS, is aimed at migrating important data such as contacts, calendars and photos from Google Inc. GOOGL +1.09% ’s mobile operating system over to Apple’s ecosystem with little fuss. “Everything about iOS is designed to be easy. That includes switching to it,” Apple says in the app notes for Move to iOS.\n“Do not install! Unless you want a lobotomy!” one review was headlined in Google’s Play app store. “I hope this app gets kicked out of the Play Store soon,” read a more charitable review. There are more than 7,000 reviews so far, mostly along these lines: “So bad.”\nApple will happily escort your Google Account over to iOS. Google Play\nIf Apple fans are rushing to the app’s defense, they are losing so far. The app currently has a rating of 1.8 in the Google Play app store. More than 5,600 have given Move to iOS a single star, the lowest possible rating. More than 1,300 people have given it a five-star rating. (It’s unclear how many times Android fans flagged the app as inappropriate. The app was, however, publicly recommended more than 2,000 on Google+.)\nThe app was first mentioned back in June during Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference keynote , and again at Apple’s big product event last week. Move to iOS went live in time for iOS 9 exiting beta.\nApple stuck a note at the bottom of the “transfer complete” screen letting new hardware owners know they can recycle their own Android phones at any Apple store.\nThis won’t be Apple’s only Android app. The company is also expected to release one for Apple Music . Google, on the other hand, has an entire army of its apps in Apple’s App Store, such as Maps, search and Drive. There is, too, at least one Android-flavored app: Android Wear.\nApple watcher John Gruber sought an answer to the essential question: Would Apple let a move to Android app in its store? According to Apple’s App Store guidelines , he finds … no.\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=GOOGL", "http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/06/30/apple-music-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-stream/", "http://www.macrumors.com/2015/06/08/move-to-ios-app/", "http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/16/move-to-ios", "http://blogs.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=GOOGL?mod=inlineTicker", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KI898_moveio_DV_20150917135744.jpg", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.movetoios&hl=en"], "published": "2015-09-18T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:23:58.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
