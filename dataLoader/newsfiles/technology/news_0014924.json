ClassLink now offers two editions of its platform, Free and Enterprise, giving schools a new way to explore, adopt, and grow with the technology. Additionally, ClassLink has introduced OneRoster into its platform for both editions, integrating education technology’s most effective and secure way to deliver data across a school district’s entire digital ecosystem. Introducing ClassLink's Two Editions\nWith the introduction of a no-cost edition for up to 50 users, ClassLink has given schools a new way to explore the benefits of its OneClick Single Sign-On technology. Users of ClassLink Free Edition enjoy streamlined access to their most important applications, websites, and files from any and every device.\n“The rapid adoption of ClassLink reflects the unstoppable shift from print to digital learning resources. At every hour of the day and night students and teachers are using ClassLink for instant access to all their apps and files,” said ClassLink CEO Berj Akian. “Now even more students and teachers can have OneClick access to all their school materials through our no-cost edition.”\nThousands of schools currently use ClassLink Enterprise, giving administrators, teachers, and students OneClick access to everything they need. Enterprise clients benefit from expanded access along with world-class support and training from ClassLink.\nIntroducing ClassLink OneRoster\nOneRoster™ is the IMS Global standard used by ClassLink for secure API delivery of class rosters, from any Student Information System to any 3rd party, decentralized and at no additional cost. ClassLink OneRoster offers a single way to streamline the delivery of class roster information to any publisher/platform application. Class roster information can be used to automate user account activations and populate student and teacher accounts into appropriate classes. ClassLink OneRoster uses open technology standards that has the endorsement of many large and small publishers.\nMatt Frey, Director of Instructional Technology for Brevard County Public Schools, hailed the announcement, saying, “We’ve thoroughly vetted ClassLink’s integration of open tech standards and its use of OneRoster. I think districts using this technology will usher in a new era of effectiveness for digital learning.”\nClassLink understands what districts go through in order to support more and more digital learning resources. ClassLink’s Chief Academic Officer, George Perreault, observed, “Multiple or missing logins and passwords and incorrect class enrollments are key reasons why most online resources fail in the classroom. With ClassLink OneRoster, schools can eliminate these problems before they happen.”\n“The burden of creating specifically formatted faculty and roster data for each provider falls on an already overburdened district IT staff, creating delays and jeopardizing accuracy,” continued Perreault. Akian added, “The schools and publishers that have been testing ClassLink OneRoster love it. It eliminates complexity, uses open technology standards and has no cost to publishers. With our ClassLink Free Edition, schools can use OneRoster at no additional cost as well.”\nClassLink was among the first to be OneRoster Certified by IMS Global Learning Consortium.\nAbout ClassLink\nClassLink provides OneClick Single Sign-On with OneRoster. Offering both Free and Enterprise Editions, ClassLink's OneClick technology enables single sign-on access to web, Windows, and Google applications, and instant access to files at school and in the cloud.
