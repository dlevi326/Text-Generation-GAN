Battery technology is having it tough to keep up.\nSolution came in the form of power banks, which kept coming in every now and then. There were large powerbanks that carried all the way up to 10,000mAh, but the size and weight are heavy-laden, which can make travels a pain. While the smaller powerbanks dance between the lines of 1,000 to 2,000mAh, which means there won’t be enough power — especially if the user needs all that juice to keep the device running. There is a distinct lack of balance between the two.\nMacpower Marketing solves this by introducing the Fluxmob Bolt.\nWHAT IS IT?\nThe Fluxmob Bolt is a small powerbank that has 3,000mAh. That’s as good as fully charging an iPhone or most Android phones these days. Even devices that runs on 4,000mAh and above will not cringe on the Bolt’s recharge features.\nWhat makes the Bolt a standout powerbank is that it doubles up as a wall charger — just flip the plug and charge both the Bolt and the mobile device at the same time. Thus, saving time by charging two devices with one plug.\nDESIGN PHILOSOPHY\nOur passion for simplicity led us to create a sleek and compact form factor. We set out to design a battery backup with a built in wall charger that is the smallest of its kind, yet still has enough power to withstand everyday life.\nEach one of these aspects could not be compromised. We needed a device that was small enough to put in your pocket that could still provide more than one charge for your phone and effortlessly be recharged.\nBolt can provide you with convenience and peace of mind by eliminating the worry of a low battery or dead device.\nWHY CHOOSE BOLT?\nUnlike other portable batteries, we built Bolt from the ground up to be a true grab and go solution. The built in wall charger allows you to charge the internal battery while you’re charging your mobile device. There’s no need to remember if you charged it.\nBolt comes in at the third of the size and twice the capacity of our competitors.\nUSER TESTIMONY\nA horror story from the past include the recent standstill in Makati, where motorists moved an inch per hour and commuters filling up the streets of EDSA waiting hours before a bus came rolling in.\nStuck in the traffic jam at night and battery running low on juice, a user used the Fluxmob Bolt to charge up their smartphone.\nThe Fluxmob Bolt comes with Crimson, Argon, Graphite and Stealth. Choose the right color, or colors for your various moods.\nIt is available in all Power Mac Center stores, Globe GEN3 stores, Landmark, Supplement Hub, Odyssey Next Store in SM Mega Mall and online in Lazada.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-09-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T18:00:50.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
