The HD PENTAX-D FA 24-70mm f/2.8 ED SDM WR lens offers a versatile focal length range and weather-resistant design that makes it ideal for a wide variety of applications--from wedding, portraiture and sports, to nature, landscape and travel. Its large f/2.8 constant maximum aperture reduces the need for a tripod in low-light conditions such as sunsets and indoor scenes while producing a desirable, soft defocus effect on the background throughout the entire focal-length range. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140718/128670 \nThe new lens is compatible with full-frame, 35mm image sensors, making it usable with both current and future-model PENTAX DSLRs. It effectively provides a 24-70mm focal-length range with full-frame 35mm image sensors (a PENTAX full-frame DSLR body is currently in development), and a 37-107mm range with current PENTAX K-series APS-C bodies. \n\"We've built our new 24-70mm lens to meet the rigorous demands of pro photographers for speed, sharpness and performance,\" said Jim Malcolm, president, Ricoh Imaging Americas Corporation. \"With its versatile focal length and constant f/2.8 aperture, we expect this to be the 'go-to' lens for many Pentaxians.\" \nBy incorporating three Extra-low Dispersion (ED) optical elements and four aspherical optical elements, the lens assures sufficient light levels even at the edges of the image field, and compensates for various aberrations to deliver fine-detailed images, rich in contrast and resolution. All elements are treated with a high-grade, multi-layer High-Definition (HD) coating that enables higher light transmittance and less reflection than conventional multi-layer coatings, providing high-contrast images free of flare and ghost images, even under demanding lighting conditions such as backlight. \nWeather-resistant construction with customized seals effectively prevents water intrusion into the lens interior. When paired with a weather-resistant PENTAX DSLR camera body, it assures superb performance in demanding conditions, including rain, mist or snow, or in locations prone to water splashing or spray. \nOther noteworthy features include a built-in Supersonic Direct-drive Motor (SDM) that provides quiet, high-speed autofocus (AF) operation; the PENTAX-developed Quick-Shift Focus system, which allows the user to instantly switch to manual-focus operation after the subject is captured in focus by the camera's AF system for fine tuning; and a zoom lock lever to prevent the accidental extension of the lens barrel when pointed downwards. \n| Pricing and Availability | \nThe HD PENTAX-D FA 24-70mm f/2.8 ED SDM WR lens will be available in October 2015 at www.ricohimaging.com and retail outlets nationwide for a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $1,299.99. \n| About Ricoh Imaging Americas Corporation| \nRicoh Imaging Americas Corporation is a subsidiary of Ricoh Company Ltd., a global technology company specializing in office imaging equipment, production print solutions, document management systems and IT services.
