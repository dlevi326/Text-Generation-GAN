For those unfamiliar with G-Technology's Evolution Series , it's a collection of flexible, interchangeable docking stations, external hard drives, and accessories, designed primarily for photo, video, and music editing. The new G-Speed Studio XL, an eight-bay Thunderbolt 2 storage solution, introduces cross-compatibility between the ev Series and G-Technology's high-performance Studio XL. This version of the modular Studio XL includes two ev Series Bay Adapters that can accommodate all ev Series G-Drives. With the G-Speed Studio XL, it's possible for creative professionals to use one of the G-Drives out on location to capture content like photos and then plug directly into the G-Speed Studio XL when returning to the studio. It's configurable in RAID 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10, and supports high volume data transfer rates of up to 1,200 MB/s. Pricing starts at $2,799.95 for 18TB and goes up to 48TB for $4,999.95. G-Technology's ev Series Reader RED MINI-MAG Edition was created in collaboration with RED Digital Cinema and lets RED camera users transfer content from a RED MINI-MAG media card to any standalone USB 3.0 drive, G-Dock ev docking station, or the new ev Series G-Speed Studio XL. Because it can be plugged into G-Technology's Thunderbolt docks, it's a good solution for RED camera users looking for a Thunderbolt-connected reader. It's priced at $199.95. The G-dock ev Solo is a simple USB 3.0 docking solution designed for shared environments like studios, computer labs, and classrooms. An existing ev Series hard drive can be plugged directly into the ev Solo, allowing users to transfer and edit files quickly. The G-Dock ev Solo is priced at $99.95. G-Technology's last product debuting today is the ev Series FireWire Adapter that lets ev Series drives be attached to an older computer that has a FireWire 800 port. It's priced at $49.95. All of the ev Series products being announced today will be available from the G-Technology website beginning in October, aside from the Firewire Adapter, which is available now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T13:09:38.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
