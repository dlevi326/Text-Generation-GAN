That's quicker than the 30-second forward feature found on previous Tivos. On the new TiVo Bolt, TiVo will tag the start and end of commercial breaks so that viewers can skip that section when watching their recordings. The feature will work with about 20 over-the-air and cable channels, including the major broadcast networks, mostly during primetime hours. \nSatellite TV provider Dish has had a similar feature on its Hopper DVR, which has prompting lawsuits from several TV channels. Dish has been settling them as part of broader agreements for rights to include the channels on Dish's lineup. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
