Yosemite Space contributed radiation shielding designs and mitigation strategies, structure designs and onboard computing. Team Miles will fly Yosemite Space's Resilient Affordable Cubesat Processor (RACP) as part of the NASA contest. \nThe NASA Cube Quest Challenge is a competition to build flight-qualified, small satellites capable of advanced communication and propulsion near and beyond the moon. Teams that achieve top performance at high-speed data communications, navigation and survival after achieving lunar orbit or a minimum long-distance range from Earth compete for an unprecedented $5.5 million prize purse in NASA's first ever in-space challenge. Cube Quest is part of NASA's Centennial Challenges Program, which accelerates technology by engaging non-traditional sources in competition. \nYosemite Space's RACP is a power-efficient high-performance space computer design for low-Earth orbit (LEO) and deep space missions. RACP's hybrid design delivers fault tolerance, data integrity, and scalable performance. RACP's physical dimensions and low power consumption make it ideal for vehicles as small as CubeSats. RACP can support processing data from multiple sensors and any needed autonomous processing and control. Processors will run a Linux operating system, which means that mission software can be built and tested with standard open source software tools. Finally, components of RACP will be screened through radiation testing to ensure that the computer will operate reliably. \nThe winning teams will be formally recognized Wednesday, Sept. 9, during a media telecom, and there will be an opportunity for media to interact with teams and challenge personnel.
