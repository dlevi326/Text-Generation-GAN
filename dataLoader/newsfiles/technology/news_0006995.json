Such an attack is known as a distributed denial of service, which is designed to crash a website.\nChurov blamed an actor in the United States. \"They failed and we have already established the culprit,\" Churov said. \"It's a company based in San Francisco.\"\nOfficials acknowledged a simultaneous attack on Russian President Vladimir Putin's official website. \"On Sunday, a very powerful hacking attack was made,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian media. \"Defense systems worked though it was not easy, the attack was rather strong.\"\nRussians voted Monday to elect 21 governors and 11 regional parliaments. However, the country's opposition party, Parnas, was permitted to compete in only one region.\nThe country has been cultivating some of the world's most proficient hackers and advanced cyber infrastructure in recent years. The U.S. has also fallen victim to Russian cyberattacks; in August, it was reported that Russian hackers penetrated email servers belonging to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T02:22:31.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
