The California-based company long downplayed Apple TV as a \"hobby\" after the original version was released in 2007.\n\"They are finally revisiting their hobby, the Apple TV,\" said Forrester analyst Frank Gillett.\nApple is dabbling with the idea of making online television programming, a move that would challenge established players such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, according to a recent report in show-business magazine Variety.\n\"Original programing is the only solution to Apple's biggest problem in the video world -- that is, that nobody wants to sell Apple content rights,\" said Forrester analyst James McQuivey.\n\"After watching what happened to the music business when Apple was given the keys to the kingdom, video producers and programmers are more than gun shy about handing the same power to Apple in the world of TV shows.\"\nApple became a power to be reckoned with in digital music sales due to the popularity of its mobile devices and iTunes online shop.\nWhile Apple was at the forefront of the shift to digital music, the world of Internet-streamed television already has powerful players such as Netflix and Amazon.\n- Watching for magic -\nThere is weaker speculation that Apple could introduce a new, bigger iPad in what would be a break from the company's tradition of unveiling tablet news at a separate event in October.\nTablet sales have cooled overall, and Apple faces the challenge of coming up with an innovation that re-ignites interest in iPads, according to analysts.\nOne way could be by tying iPads to more cloud services that better anticipate what users do using Apple products.\n\"I think they can make more magic happen,\" Gillett said of App. \"That is what I am going to look for.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:43:51.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
