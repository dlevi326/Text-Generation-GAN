As Senior Account Executive, Melissa will work strategically alongside CloudCover executives, Jeff Huggins and Roger Lindsay, to build relationships with VARs, and prospective clients. “When I heard CloudCover was looking to fill a Senior Account Executive position, I researched their website and was immediately enticed, ” stated Melissa McGee. “After listening in on a few demos and being blown away by a customer's positive response, I knew then that I would be a great asset to the team by using my sales skills to help grow the business!”\nBefore CloudCover, Melissa worked as an Account Manager for AT&T, maintaining and selling voice, data, wireless and software. With a drive to meet and exceed annual sales goals, one of her biggest achievements was winning an all-inclusive trip known as “Winner’s Circle,” which was only given to 2 reps in the country per year. Melissa’s new role at CloudCover will allow her to build on this success, helping many companies solve pain points when it comes to Maintenance Management.\nMelissa credits her success with her ability to not only research and study the product she is selling but also believe in it. Her most memorable sale was a mobile device management contract consisting of 1000+ users to a large Military Surveillance company.\n“Melissa is a wonderful addition to the CloudCover team,” said Tina B. Garcia – Vice President of Sales. “We knew in the first few minutes of interviewing Melissa that our customers would find Melissa to be a trusted advisor. We welcome Melissa to the CloudCover team!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:22:01.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
