As part of a special research focus on implemented EHR users, Black Book reveals industry trends and announced those vendors with the highest scores in client experience among primary care generalists. \n\"Product and vendor loyalty among primary care practices over six physicians is on the upward trajectory,\" said Doug Brown , Black Book's managing partner. \"The vendor's abilities to meet the evolving demands of interoperability, networking, mobile devices, accountable care, patient accessibility, customization for generalist workflow, and reimbursement are the main factors that the replacement mentality and late adoption are turning course.\" \nThrough Q4 2014 to Q2 2015, primary care has been one of the fastest growing market segments of new EHR implementations, according to Black Book polling; 94% of all primary care practices over six practitioners have either executed, are under implementation, or are in the process of selecting a system. \n\"Solo and smaller practices under five practitioners, particularly in urban, east coast locations, that are struggling with resources are this market segment's late adopters,\" said Brown. 79% of primary care doctors defining themselves in the survey as meeting these criteria have not yet implemented EHR. \nNotable findings include: \n70% of primary care physicians that implemented their first EHR prior to 2012 are considerably more satisfied than those with systems implemented within the past 24 months (14%). \n84% of primary care practics identifying as in some stage of replacing their current EHR are giving preference to vendors with fundamental population health tools and analytics. \nPrimary care user satisfaction has increased prominently in the last six months according to client responses of all practices implementing an EHR longer than two years ago. \n\"Users credit recent satisfaction gains to the efforts of vendors to improve workflow issues, delivering on promises, meaningful use achievements, demonstrated data exchange, and fortified US-based client support,\" said Brown. \nBased on the aggregate client experience and customer satisfaction scores on eighteen key performance indicators, Greenway Health ranked first across all surveyed primary care electronic health records systems. \nGreenway had ranked #2, close behind incumbent Practice Fusion, in both the 2014 and 2013 primary care surveys. \nGreenway, also achieved the highest customer satisfaction scores in the respective primary care subsets of General Practice and Family Practice. \nAmazingCharts ranked first in the primary care area of Geriatrics and PCC ranked first in Pediatrics. \nGreenway also scored best among all primary care physicians for system patient health data management and administrative processing as well as order entry and management. \nClients also praised Greenway's EHR communications and interoperability capabilities highest in primary care, particularly in family and general practices with six or more physicians. \nAbout Black Book ™ \nBlack Book Rankings, a division of Black Book Market Research LLC, provides healthcare IT users, media, investors, analysts, quality minded vendors, and prospective software system buyers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other interested sectors of the clinical technology industry with comprehensive comparison data of the industry's top respected and competitively performing technology vendors.
