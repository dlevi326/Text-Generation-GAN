For schools in bottom ranked grouping, the exposure of passwords with university email aliases is an all too common occurrence. \nThe 2015 Higher Education Security Report was conducted in late August from the leading security-risk benchmarking company, SecurityScorecard (TM), using data derived from its proprietary ThreatMarket(TM) platform. The patent-pending technology aggregates over 30 million daily security-risk signals and sensors across the entire Internet. The colleges and universities were selected based on digital footprint of each university, having at least 1,000 or more public-facing IP addresses. \n\"The nature of risk is that it is dynamic and not always in our own control; One key to reduce risk is for organizations to proactively collaborate to limit the impact from security issues,\" said Sam Kassoumeh, COO and co-founder, SecurityScorecard. \"It is only via continuous and rigorous information capture and analysis that balanced, benchmarked measurement and rational, risk-based decision making be made.\" \nOne of the most recognized engineering and computer science schools, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), ranked last out of 485 colleges and universities analyzed for IT security risks in the report. California's Merced Community College garnered the highest security grades. \nThe Cambridge, MA-based MIT received an overall \"D\" grade in the report, but has an \"F\" in four of the 10 categories scored. However, MIT also received three \"A\" grades in: Web Application Security, DNS Health, and Endpoint Security. \n\"We'll be watching closely to see how colleges and universities move forward to patch their vulnerabilities and other security issues in order to limit the damage from attacks targeting software and applications,\" said Dr. Sergey Fogelson, Lead Data Scientist, SecurityScorecard. \"We strongly suggest improved security awareness training and general security education, especially in regards to the epidemic of password exposure.\" \nAnother prestigious school - the University of Cambridge in England - received poor security grades, while MIT neighbor Boston University also ranked in the bottom grouping. On the other end of the spectrum, notable schools with high security scores include: the University of North Alabama and Pepperdine University, and others that can be found in the report. \nTo see the top and bottom school rankings, download SecurityScorecard's 2015 Higher Education Security Report here: http://info.securityscorecard.com/2015-education-security-report . \nAbout SecurityScorecard SecurityScorecard, the leading security-risk benchmarking company, allows organizations to continuously grade the security of any partner, competitor, supplier, vendor, any third party or company-- without requiring permission.
