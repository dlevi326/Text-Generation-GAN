Ted S. Warren Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe The unexpected announcement that China will introduce an emissions trading scheme markedly changed the tone for President Xi Jinping's historic visit to Washington. A day ahead of a formal welcome by President Barack Obama, including a 21-gun salute at the White House lawn, Beijing upstaged the host city by coming onside with climate change.\nBut even though the two economic giants are joining forces on one critical issue they remain bitterly divided on others and the official welcoming ceremony couldn't mask the deepening anxiety in the United States over its emerging rival.\nObama and Xi will make plenty of their shared determination to forge a climate change accord at crucial talks in Paris in December that will commit every country to curbing their emissions.\nBut on other issues there are substantial differences. A few blocks from the Whitehouse, the museum of news and journalism has large Chinese-language posters on its walls, demanding freedom for China's citizens. But human rights are far from the only tension point in the complex US-China relationship.\nPresident Barack Obama is under growing pressure at home to confront President Xi more forcefully over China's brazen and persistent cybercrimes against US multinational companies.\nMore broadly on the geopolitical and economic fronts, China's aggressive reclamation activities on disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea and questions about its recent sudden currency devaluation are adding to tensions.\nChris Johnson, a former CIA senior China analyst, describes the bilateral relationship as a \"little frosty\" and expected a \"difficult discussion\" between presidents Obama and Xi at the state dinner overnight.\nThe issue that is receiving the most attention is the alleged pilfering of US intellectual property (IP) by Chinese state-sponsored entities. American firms are fed up after years of attacks. Chinese hackers are also accused of stealing sensitive information about21.5 million Americans from the government's Office of Professional Management database.\n The typically abrasive US national security adviser, Susan Rice, laid down the gauntlet to China in a public speech during the week, pointedly saying IP rights and trade secrets should be \"respected, not stolen\".\n\"This isn't a mild irritation, it's an economic and national security concern to the United States,\" Rice said.\n\"It puts enormous strain on our bilateral relationship.\"\nUS business leaders are desperate to dive deeper into the huge Chinese consumer market, which boasts 1.3 billion people. So it was perhaps no surprise that Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, Microsoft head Satya Nadella, Berkshire Hathaway founder Warren Buffett, PepsiCo chief Indra Nooyi and The Walt Disney Company head Robert Iger were among the business leaders who met Xi in Seattle this week.\nThe Australian-born chief executive of US multinational Dow Chemical, Andrew Liveris, who attended a business leaders' meeting with Xi, says the cyber attacks and IP theft by Chinese entities were the \"number one, number two and number three concern\".\n\"Commercial attacks on companies like ours are real and they're from China,\" Liveris told financial news channel CNBC.\n\"The Chinese can no longer just turn a blind eye to that.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-09-25T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:32:50.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
