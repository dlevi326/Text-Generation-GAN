(NYSE: OUT), one of the largest out-of-home media companies in the US, has introduced the future of consumer engagement within out-of-home advertising: sleek, elegant, app-powered digital smart displays throughout the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority's all new 34th Street - Hudson Yards station. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150924/270607 \n\"OUTFRONT is proud to introduce our new digital displays platform that we believe will change both the way brands think about out-of-home and the way consumers interact with it,\" said Jeremy Male, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of OUTFRONT Media. \"We are delighted to be partnering with the MTA to introduce relevant, engaging and smart media in this world class station. This launch is very exciting and we look forward to working with our clients to create advertising that will break the traditional barriers of digital out-of-home.\" \n\"We are excited that this 21st Century station, projected soon to be among the busiest in the city, features state-of-the art digital screens,\" said Jeff Rosen, Director of Real Estate for the MTA. \"When the Second Avenue subway stations open, they too will feature all digital advertising; and over the next five to ten years we expect to see most if not all of our advertising inventory throughout the MTA system migrate from paper and vinyl to digital.\" \nThe 34th St-Hudson Yards station features 24 separate, 65-inch smart displays, all running on OUTFRONT's software environment and app ecosystem. This app-based approach delivers engaging digital content, management and synchronization functions, giving advertisers unprecedented control over their creative messages. These crisp, high-definition displays enable screen to screen interaction, whereby messages, images and video jump seamlessly between displays, delivering immersive content in an environment 10 stories below ground without connectivity. \nInitial OUTFRONT advertising partners in the 34th St-Hudson Yards station include Foursquare, Lionsgate, Turner, JetBlue, CBS and Coach. OUTFRONT worked closely with these brands to unlock the potential of this new media and reimagine what can be done creatively in the out-of-home space. The digital displays' capabilities will expand in the coming months and into 2016 as additional connectivity is added to the station. Connected displays will enable livestream feeds, and full remote advertiser content control, as well as real-time viewer data and analytics. This dynamic out-of-home technology will also expand outside of transit in the coming months to roadside displays, street furniture, and other markets adjacent to the out-of-home space. \nAbout OUTFRONT Media Inc. OUTFRONT Media (NYSE: OUT ), formerly CBS Outdoor, is one of the largest out-of-home media companies in the Americas and has a major presence in top markets throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and South America. With billboard and transit properties, a prime asset focus, and a growing network of digital displays , OUTFRONT Media gives advertisers both breadth and depth of audience across key geographies, as well as engaging ways to connect with increasingly mobile consumers. \nContacts: Investors: Media: Gregory Lundberg Carly Zipp (212) 297-6441 (212) 297-6479 greg.lundberg@outfrontmedia.com carly.zipp@outfrontmedia.com \nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements \nWe have made statements in this press release that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
