A recent Bloomberg expose suggests the answer dates back to 2006, when [entity display=\"Boeing\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"boeing\" ticker=\"BA\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/653\"]Boeing[/entity] shelved plans to build a network of satellites called Connexion, deciding to reallocate funding due to a post 9/11 crisis of confidence in the airline industry, and also because the project was well ahead of its time. Passengers weren’t demanding an on board Wi-Fi service back then, they had barely begun to install Wi-Fi in their own homes. It wasn’t expected, so why spend billions providing it?Boeing’s withdrawal left just one major player in the market, Gogo. Gogo did not use satellites but had installed a network of transmission towers, from the top of the Rocky Mountains, to the icy tundra of Alaska, which transmitted their signals upwards to the skies, rather than downwards to the cities. Gogo had the foresight to install FAA approved antennas on fleets of aircraft and when the demand for connectivity came, they were the only company capable of responding to it.The trouble was, Gogo’s monopoly was bad news for customers. Gogo targeted first and business class travellers, for whom money was no object (most pass the prohibitive costs Gogo charge straight to their employers via the company credit card), and poor connectivity less of a problem, since they mainly used the service to check emails and access presentations, rather than watch movies or check their social media accounts.So despite the fact that 66% percent of travellers in the US are able to access in-flight Wi-Fi, compared to just 22% in the rest of the world, most users spend the majority of their time furiously hitting the refresh button and competing with other passengers for the limited bandwidth available.Gogo, meanwhile, realising they had a monopoly on services, have pushed prices up and up, employed surge pricing, and placated the airlines themselves by handling all of the repairs, maintenance and pricing, and paying the airlines 20% of whatever they make. As far as the airlines were concerned, the cost of upgrading the technology on their planes were prohibitive.This kind of scenario could never have materialised in Europe because of the difficulty of installing transmission towers in different countries, so travellers have been forced to wait patiently for the price of sending up satellites to drop.Finally, it’s happening, and passengers are about to be rewarded for their patience. But, as is so often the way, this exciting new opportunity will come at a price; your personal data, and your attention.Unlike in the US, it’s the short haul, economy airlines that are leading the way, and the cynic in me suggests that it is advertiser's, not passenger's, best interests they have at heart. Nowhere are people more of a captive audience that when they are in the airport or on a flight, so get ready for an onslaught of highly targeted advertising messages before you are allowed access to [entity display=\"Netflix\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"netflix\" ticker=\"NFLX\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/6132\"]Netflix[/entity] or can check your [entity display=\"Facebook\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"facebook\" ticker=\"FB\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/15317\"]Facebook[/entity] account.Low Budget carrier Ryanair’s Chief Executive has already suggested that advertising will cover the costs of installing the technology required to provide on board Wi-Fi, but that does not necessarily mean the savings will be passed onto customers. It’s been revealed recently that airports don’t have great form for that kind of thing . Expect to pay for the right to stream.It looks likely that Gogo’s dominance in the US will be challenged also, as 2 companies, ViaSat and GEE are rolling out better and better satellite based services. Gogo, however has tied down most major airlines to long term contracts, but is due to unroll a new, faster service called 2KU which could supply speeds as fast as 70-100 Mbps.The situation in the US is a cautionary tale that Europe will do well to take note of. What’s needed is for airlines like Lufhansa, [entity display=\"Air France-KLM\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"air-france-klm\" natural_id=\"fred/company/109\"]Air France-KLM[/entity], Vueling and British Airways, satellite providers like Panasonic or Inmarsat, who plan to spend £270 million on in-flight Wi-Fi provision across Europe, including launching a new satellite called Europasat, advertisers, and entertainment providers like Global eagle, to work together to ensure that passengers are beneficiaries, and not victims, of the new technology.The idea that Wi-Fi is a basic right, rather than a chargeable service, will probably not cut too much ice with providers, or airlines, that is until advertisers can pay them enough to make them decide otherwise.Gogo’s prices for a full day’s airborne Wi-Fi access apparently start at $16, whilst Etihad, who have partnered with Panasonic in Europe are expected to offer 2 hours’ worth of access for $11.95, but that does not necessarily include streaming.If ever there were a space that needs disrupting with some truly game changing technology, entrepreneurs, it’s this one. Surely there are more inventive or more efficient ways to provide on-board Wi-Fi, or to make sure that the advertising passengers must endure is less of an onslaught and more of a service.
