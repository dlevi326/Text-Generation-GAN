Photo: Supplied\nYou need a special streaming video app to redeem the UltraViolet download codes bundled with some DVDs and Blu-rays.\nAustralian copyright law doesn't let us rip copies of movie discs to watch on computers, smartphones and tablets – although we ripped our audio CDs for years before it was legal. Instead with movies we're expected to rely on the free digital download codes bundled with some discs.\nWhen you buy a movie on disc, you don't have a choice when it comes to download codes. Some codes work only with Apple's iTunes, but UltraViolet is a Hollywood standard designed to work with Apple, Android and Windows Phone devices as well as PCs and Macs. Australian online video store EzyFlix was an early supporter of UltraViolet, but with EzyFlix's demise your best options are Flixster Video or JB HiFi NOW Video. UltraViolet movies redeemed via EzyFlix can still be transferred to these apps.\nYou can stream UltraViolet movies from the internet or download them to watch offline. Unlike iTunes, you can't download an UltraViolet movie to your computer then copy it to your mobile device – you need to download a separate copy for each device.\nVERDICT\nUltraViolet is hamstrung in Australia compared with the US, where you can stream movies to the Chromecast and other home entertainment gear like Smart TVs. For Australians, there is little to differentiate Flixster and JB HiFi in the eyes of Android users, but Apple fans will favour Flixster, thanks to AirPlay streaming.\nJB HIFI NOW VIDEO\nfree\nThe JB HiFi Apple/Android apps provide access to your UltraViolet movie collection but there are no other features. Unfortunately, there is no support for streaming to Google's Chromecast media player or an Apple TV via AirPlay. Apart from mobile devices, you can also watch your UltraViolet movies in a web browser on your PC/Mac or download a desktop video app.\nFLIXSTER VIDEO\nfree\nThe Flixster Video Apple/Android app lets you access your UltraViolet library and offers movie ratings and descriptions as well as local cinema times (Flixster's Windows Phone app supports UltraViolet in the US but not Australia). You can stream movies to an Apple TV, but Chromecast streaming is restricted to the US – a restriction which is difficult to bypass. You can also watch movies in a PC/Mac web browser or install the desktop player.\nCHECK THIS OUT\nA review of Australian copyright law is under way, but if you're prepared to take matters into your own hands you can use Windows software called AnyDVD HD to rip your DVD and Blu-ray movies just like you use iTunes to rip your music CDs. Use the HandBrake video conversion tool if you want to make copies to watch on your mobile devices.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T23:08:52.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
