UberStax are linkable ‘plates’ that allow the creation of card holders, token ‘racks’ or other game organization functions. \n“UberStax is a new twist on an old idea. For years table-top, card and token games have posed challenges for some players. We’ve all experienced Dominos with too many tiles,” David explains, “Children can struggle with the manual dexterity required to manipulate a hand of cards. Disabilities due to injury or illness can prevent some people from enjoying a simple game of cards.” \nUberStax makes your table-top gaming experience more enjoyable by solving some of these common issues, such as a small table or playing area, by helping to reduce clutter. Children and individuals with dexterity or physical challenges love using UberStax because it makes it easier to keep track of their game pieces, cards or tokens without struggling to hold them all. Plus, since your hands are now free you can munch on snacks and drinks! \n“With over 20 years in engineering (and much more in game playing!) our founder has worked on having the initial designs completed, getting many prototypes made using 3D printing, and play-testing each design iteration to arrive at the current design,” the team says, “This has been a long process for over a year and we are excited to now be ready for mass production by injection molding.“ \nIn exchange for pledging to the project, backers can gain access to a variety of rewards including a set of 12 UberStax pieces for $12, a set of 24 pieces for $24 and more. Backers can also pledge $99 for 120 pieces or $250 for a set of 12 3D-printed white prototypes shipped as soon as the campaign ends (with a storage bag, very special mention on the website and social media and 120 UberStax pieces sent when the injection molding is complete). \nDavid anticipates availability of the final product before Christmas 2015 should the project attain full funding, with additional color options available should goals be exceeded. \nFor more information please visit the Kickstarter page here or contact the creator below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:42:18.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
