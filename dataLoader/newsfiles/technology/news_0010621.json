The drivers currently pay those costs themselves.\nIn the ruling, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco said drivers could sue as a group on the question of whether they are employees or contractors, and over their demand for payment of tips that were not passed on to them. Drivers' attorneys must submit more evidence to sue as a group for reimbursement of other expenses.\nClass action status means the 2013 suit could cover more than 160,000 California drivers, according to court filings, and could give plaintiffs more leverage to negotiate a settlement.\nUber had argued that the drivers should not be allowed to sue as a group because they have little in common and relate to the company in different ways.\nHowever, Chen wrote that there is an \"inherent tension\" in Uber's argument.\n\"On one hand, Uber argues that it has properly classified every single driver as an independent contractor,\" Chen wrote.\nOn the other, Chen wrote, Uber argues that individual drivers are so unique that the court, \"unlike, apparently, Uber itself,\" cannot make its own determination.\nRepresentatives for Uber and the drivers could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe results of Uber's legal battle could reshape the sharing economy, as companies say the contractor model allows for flexibility that many see as important to their success.\nAn ultimate finding that drivers are employees could raise Uber's costs beyond the lawsuit's scope and force it to pay Social Security, workers' compensation, and unemployment insurance.\nIn June, a California labour commissioner ruled that an Uber driver was an employee, not a contractor. Uber has appealed that decision.\nIn arguing against class action status, Uber had submitted sworn statements from hundreds of drivers supporting the company. However, Chen rejected this evidence because the statements could have been the product of biased questions.\nThere is simply \"no basis,\" Chen wrote, to support Uber's claim \"that some innumerable legion of drivers prefer to remain independent contractors rather than become employees.\"\nThe case is Douglas O'Connor et al v. Uber Technologies Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 13-3826.\n(Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Tom Brown)\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-09-02T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:33:59.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
