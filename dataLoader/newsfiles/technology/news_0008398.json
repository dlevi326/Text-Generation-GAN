(NYSE: BKS), the nation’s largest retail bookseller and a leading retailer of content, digital media and educational products, today announced a new partnership with Maker Media, publisher of Make: magazine and producer of Maker Faire, to launch the first-ever Mini Maker Faire in stores nationwide. Barnes & Noble and Maker Media are “Calling All Makers” to participate at their local Barnes & Noble store the weekend of November 6-8 to share their inventions, ideas and more. \nA Maker Faire is a community-based learning event that inspires everyone to become a Maker and connect with people and projects in their local community. These events are for people of all ages and backgrounds who have a desire to create, learn and share, and who bring a DIY mindset to technology. \n“We are thrilled to host the first-ever retail Mini Maker Faire in partnership with Maker Media,” said Kathleen Campisano, Vice President, Toys & Games at Barnes & Noble. “Literacy is at the core of what we do, and rolling out the first-ever Mini Maker Faire in stores nationwide signals our commitment to what we believe it means to be literate in the 21 st century. Tech literacy and being tech literate is a huge part of engaging in everyday life and remaining connected to the world. No other retailer is more poised to serve the community in this endeavor. It is both a privilege and responsibility, which is why this partnership and hosting this Mini Maker Faire in stores across the country is so important to us.” \nBarnes & Noble’s Mini Maker Faire will offer authentic, credible experiences that Maker Faire attendees have historically come to expect; all the while introducing, educating and engaging others to what the Maker movement is all about. The Mini Maker Faire will feature hands-on learning and making opportunities in the areas of ideation, creative thinking, art, design, construction and innovation, as well as programming, coding and 3D printing – with activities for children ages five and up to adults. For information, customers can visit BN.com/MakerFaire , and Barnes & Noble and Maker Media will be announcing much more about the Mini Maker Faire in the coming weeks. \n“We’re so pleased to bring Making into the national spotlight through this exciting program,” said Sherry Huss, Vice President of Event Operations and co-founder of Maker Faire. “Barnes & Noble is one of our most important partners and the largest reseller of Make: magazine. Now Barnes & Noble customers who know us through Make: will be introduced to the Maker Faire experience. With access to tools and resources, they can learn new skills, discover their personal Making passion, and be inspired by local Makers in their communities.” \nThe Maker movement has boomed in recent years, as evidenced by the more than 130 worldwide Maker Faires that took place in 2014, including one at the White House 1 . In fact, Makers inject $29 billion into the economy every year and more than $116 million has been raised for over 1,400 technology-related projects on Kickstarter, most of them hardware gadgets, according to Atmel, a company that designs and manufactures semiconductors and microcontrollers 2 . \nThe Mini Maker Faire at Barnes & Noble will run throughout the weekend of November 6-8 and will consist of three main areas: The Make Workspace – where customers will experience the latest technologies in 3D printing, robotics, coding, programming and more. Meet the Makers – the place in store where customers will hear from leaders, top brands and local makers about the latest trends in designing, building, creating and making. Make & Collaborate – where customers can immerse themselves in the process of ideation, rapid prototyping, circuitry and more. \nBarnes & Noble and Maker Media will announce more exciting details over the coming weeks.
