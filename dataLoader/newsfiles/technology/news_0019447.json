They have built an Impact Community of employers, organizations, academic institutions, and individuals. They collaborate to train those soft skills and competencies that employers are desperately looking for, but that the education system does not provide. eYe gives young unemployed the space to learn, to prepare for a job, to grow their levels of self-confidence, gain relevant work experience through an internship and build a strong community of like-minded.\nAt the end of the six months program they connect the participants with job opportunities with employers in the eYe-Community. eYe can change the growing problem of youth employment. This is an opportunity to give someone hope, renewed self-confidence, a brighter future and a means of supporting themselves. However, before this program can solve the problem of youth unemployment, the European Youth Employment needs help. That’s why they launched this campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $70,000 by September 30, 2015. The funds raised will go towards the training and development program for their first 30 student cohort in Setubal, Portugal and provide their students as well food and accommodation and coaching for the training period.\nTo help bring this innovative program to life, please visit the IndieGoGo campaign or click here . Backers can choose from many attractive rewards such as participating in live webinars or in their networking events for students and business partners.\nDon’t miss out on this great opportunity to help young people get a job!\nKnow others that would love this?
