The total sum in question is about $100 billion, and many fear that it will be used to support terror organizations.\nThe app follows the viral video that Shurat Hadin launched last week, which has already received half a million hits on Facebook and Youtube. The video depicts a crowdfunding campaign in which three terrorists ask the American public to approve the nuclear deal so that Iran can receive $100 billion to carry out terror attacks. At the moment, the app is only available for Android phones.\n\"It is up to every citizen of Israel, the US, and free countries around the world to use the application and demand that their senators refuse to give Iran the promised billions,\" warned Shurat Hadin founder Nitsana Darshan-Leitner. \"Today [Supreme Leader Ayatolla] Khamenei said, 'Israel will not exist in another 25 years, and we will make certain that it will not have a quiet moment until then.' We must ensure that the US does not fund Iran's terror industry. We must prevent the next murder.\"\nTags: congress Shurat Hadin Iran deal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:03:31.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
