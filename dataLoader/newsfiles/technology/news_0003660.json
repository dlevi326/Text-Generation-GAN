This can increase the risk of complications and the possibility of reoperation.\" \nThrough high resolution CT data, the Anatomics team was able to create a 3D reconstruction of the chest wall and tumour, allowing the surgeons to plan and accurately define resection margins. \n\"From this, we were able to design an implant with a rigid sternal core and semi-flexible titanium rods to act as prosthetic ribs attached to the sternum,\" Mr Batty said. \nWorking with experts at CSIRO's 3D printing facility Lab 22, the team then manufactured the implant out of surgical grade titanium alloy. \n\"We built the implant using our $1.3 million Arcam printer,\" Alex Kingsbury from CSIRO's manufacturing team said. \n\"The printer works by directing an electron beam at a bed of titanium powder in order to melt it. This process is then repeated, building the product up layer-by-layer until you have a complete implant. \n\"3D printing has significant advantages over traditional manufacturing methods, particularly for biomedical applications. \n\"As well as being customisable, it also allows for rapid prototyping - which can make a big difference if a patient is waiting for surgery.\" \nOnce the prosthesis was complete it was couriered to Spain and implanted into the patient. \n\"The operation was very successful,\" Dr Aranda said. \n\"Thanks to 3D printing technology and a unique resection template, we were able to create a body part that was fully customised and fitted like a glove.\" ### \nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:34:47.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
