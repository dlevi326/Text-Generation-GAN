One of the most respected and longest-established private banks in the United Kingdom, Brown Shipley is now using SimCorp Coric to generate approximately 10,000 half-yearly client reports. The firm’s parent company, KBL European Private Bankers, heads a network of private banks with assets under management in excess of €44 billion. \nThe decision to implement SimCorp Coric is part of Brown Shipley’s continual commitment to client service and to providing tailor-made solutions in response to clients’ needs. As part of the implementation, Brown Shipley’s private client reports were re-designed and enhanced to present portfolio valuation data in a clear, professional and more readable format. \nSimCorp Coric is an end-to-end client reporting and communications suite used by buy-side firms to automate the majority of the client reporting process and empower business users to create and modify quality reports, without technical assistance. By automating the client reporting process, Brown Shipley has significantly reduced the manual effort required to generate and validate client reports, which in turn has increased operational efficiency and enabled client services teams to spend more time on client-facing engagement than reporting-related administration. \nMatthew Lucas, Head of Transformation at Brown Shipley, said: “Brown Shipley prides itself on the relationships it maintains with its clients and having a full appreciation of their needs. Our approach is about finding solutions to effectively accommodate changing client requirements, embracing technology innovations where appropriate to ensure those requirements are met. SimCorp Coric enriches our client experience and is also helping to drive significant efficiencies throughout our operation, ultimately improving our ability to be more responsive to our clients.” \nKlaus Andersen, Managing Director at SimCorp Coric, said: “Brown Shipley’s quest for innovation in client service is inspirational. We are very proud of the contribution that SimCorp Coric is making in terms of improving operational efficiency and enhancing client service.” Enquiries regarding this announcement should be addressed to: Nicola Cowburn, Vice President Global Marketing, SimCorp Coric, + 44 (0)1344 701988, nicola.cowburn@simcorp.com About SimCorp Since 1971, SimCorp has been providing investment and portfolio management software and services to the world’s leading investment managers, asset managers, fund managers, fund administrators, pension funds, insurance funds, and wealth managers.
