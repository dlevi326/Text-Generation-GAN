Played by millions of children for nearly a decade, the JumpStart world's most beloved feature - its Mythies - now serve as the core within this new mobile game. Filled with interactive quests, magic, flying, and epic battles, JumpStart: Magic & Mythies is designed to appeal to kids ages eight and up, who can now continue their JumpStart adventures via mobile devices. Characters from the longtime favorite Enchanted Sanctuary and Windy Hollows areas can also be seen in JumpStart: Magic & Mythies , which is now available to download for free via the App Store and Google Play(TM) - and is coming soon to Amazon® and Windows. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140902/141896 \n\"We've taken everyone's favorite JumpStart feature - Mythies - and have created an even more action packed experience with this new mobile game that appeals to a slightly older demographic - while also delivering the educational content that parents have come to know and trust,\" said David Lord, JumpStart CEO. \"This is a big move for the JumpStart brand, as Mythies & Magic is the largest release since the original launch of the JumpStart online world.\" \nWithin the game, players learn about the importance of nature conservation as a mysterious darkness begins to cover the mythical world of Terra, destroying the environment that has existed for thousands of years. Alongside the elves and wide-eyed Mythies, players must battle the shadows and harness the powers of nature to restore the balance. Players develop their magical powers, raise and train mythical creatures and learn about nature conservation - all while sharpening their skills in subjects like ecology to defeat the enemy shadows before it's too late! \nJumpStart: Magic & Mythies is now available to download in the App Store and Google Play(TM) and is coming soon to Amazon®, Windows, and online. While this enchanted mobile world is free to play, membership options starting at $9.99 and in-app purchases are also available to enhance the in-game experience.

The reality is that kids today seek entertainment through gaming, yet the vast majority of kids' games do absolutely nothing to inspire their minds through learning. JumpStart changes that paradigm and brings a learning edge through epically fun gameplay. Because of the company's long history of excellence in providing learning-based products parents and families trust, world-renowned brands like DreamWorks Animation partner with JumpStart to develop various educational mobile and web-based games. To date, the company has released several critically-acclaimed titles, including Madagascar Preschool Surf N' Slide(TM) and School of Dragons ®, the ever-popular educational massively multiplayer online role-playing game. A subsidiary of Knowledge Holdings, Inc., the company is privately held and based in Torrance, CA.
