As a photographer, he has made it his mission to preserve the vanishing treasures that are the landscape of Louisiana, and he shares those treasures in his photography show, \"Louisiana â€“ Close to Home and Close to Heart,\" currently on display at the park each Wednesday through Sunday from 9:30 a.m to 4:30 p.m.\n\"I'll be 61 soon, and I've met a lot of people, especially from Lafitte, fisherman and locals who talk about how time has changed things. With my photography I can capture these things before they are completely gone,\" Lefort said.\nThese vanishing treasures, in the form of plants, animals, and landscapes, are the focus of Lefort's photography exhibit at the park. Lefort says that he volunteered at the park in the past, and it's close to home, so it was a perfect venue to display his work. \"There's a connection. The park and the people there share the same values, preservation of what we have with regards to culture and environment,\" he said.\nLefort says the move from film to digital has been a good one for him. He is able to take photographs, and highlight or emphasize aspects that truly bring out the natural beauty so abundant in South Louisiana, but that he worries won't be around forever.\n\"It's disappearing, both the land and what lives on that land. When the land goes, the plants and wildlife that once lived there go as well. They either die off or move. I've been out on the waterways and I've seen geological survey markers long forgotten, and they're thirty feet from land. Those markers were once placed in dry ground,\" Lefort said.\nThe photography show will be exhibited at the park until Nov. 1 in the visitor center on Barataria Boulevard. Lefort's work is for sale, and those interested can visit his website, www.lanelefort.com for more information.\nLefort's work can also be seen in a traveling art show sponsored by the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act which brings a truly personal point of view to the loss that is happening daily. Hear the stories of people from across South Louisiana and view their portraits done by Lefort. For more information, or to hear the stories go to http://lacoast.gov/new/GetInvolved/OralHistory.aspx .\nHunting season on park land is just around the corner and Jean Lafitte National Park is one of the only national parks in the country that allows hunting on park land. Hunters wishing to apply for a permit may do so now until Oct. 1 at the Barataria Preserve Visitor Center. Applications are accepted each Wednesday through Sunday from 9:30 a.m to 4:30 p.m. Hunting will be allowed for feral hogs, squirrel, nutria, rabbits, and deer. Each has a specific season and information on those dates can be obtained by a call to the park or at the time of application.\nThe park also offers a weekly ranger-guided walk through the wetlands every Wednesday through Sunday at 10 a.m. Events are free and open to the public; for more information contact the park at 504-689-3690 ext. 10 or go online to www.nps.gov/jela .\nJean Lafitte National Park and Preserve gives so much to the community, and while many volunteer regularly, only once a year do they ask anything of the public in return. National Public Lands Day is Sept. 26 from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Volunteers are provided with the materials needed to complete their given task, and are never asked to do anything dangerous. Additionally, they are advised about any safety precautions necessary. Civic minded citizens and students in need of service hours are encouraged to volunteer their time at either the Chalmette Battlefield or the Barataria Preserve.\nTo reach Lafitte Lagniappe Columnist Lara L.
