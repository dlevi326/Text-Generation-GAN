Its Hong Kong stock surged more than 10 percent.\nOther carmakers BYD , BAIC Motor and SAIC Motor also rose sharply.\nHowever, analysts at fund manager Bernstein said the move was unlikely to lead to a turnaround in the overall market.\nCar sales in China, the world’s biggest market since 2009, were flat in the first eight months of the year and could contract in 2015 for the first time since the market took off in the late 1990s. In August, sales fell 3 percent from a year earlier to 1.7 million vehicles.\nMany analysts expect auto sales growth to hold in low single-digits in coming years and global carmakers are cutting production and reining in wages and other costs.\nLast month, China’s central bank provided support for auto financing firms by slashing the amount of reserves they need to hold by 3.5 percentage points. However many analysts said this move was unlikely to lead to any sharp rises in sales given the relatively low auto financing rate.\n 30, 2015 10:16 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:06:06.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
