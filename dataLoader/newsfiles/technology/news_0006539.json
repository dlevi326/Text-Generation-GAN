Reuters Eddie Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, takes the stage to discuss Apple TV \nThere's also a touchpad at the top of the control that can be used to control games. \nThe Apple TV will have its own dedicated app store and, according to CEO Tim Cook, is \"the future of television\". \nAn example of a game being played on the new Apple TV \nBut could it replace the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One the same way the iPhone has replaced the Game Boy and PS Vita for casual mobile gaming? \n\"Apple excels at making tech products for non-tech people,\" said Jason Kingsley, co-founder of Oxford-based games developer, Rebellion. \nShould the PlayStation be worried? \n“For Apple’s App store it might enable a much needed shake-up as whenever there’s a ‘new toy’ to play with, there are disruptive companies which rise to the top to capitalise on new gameplay styles and take over from previous platform titans.\" \nAt the moment, the Apple TV has a 200MB limit for apps and games. But the gadgets themselves have a choice of either 32GB or 64GB of storage - plenty of space if needed. \nCrossy Road is an addictive iPhone game - and now you can play it on your TV \n\"If Apple can release a £150 box that plays all the games normal people want to play when they get home from the pub, why would casual gamers shell out £400 for a Playstation 4?\" Asks Mirror Online's Mikey Smith. \nFIFA is currently available for the iPhone, but will it come to Apple TV? Mirror Tech has put this question to publisher EA and will update this story when we hear back.
