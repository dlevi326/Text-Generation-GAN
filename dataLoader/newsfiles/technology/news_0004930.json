Prior to this high volume texting was unavailable in the U.S. other than via short codes, which is a different type of opt-in messaging used primarily for one-way automated marketing campaigns. It has taken Zipwhip nearly two years to complete this direct connectivity. \nHigh volume texting is a must-have for customer service centers that deal with thousands of unique customers a day on their main toll free phone number. With the support of 1,000 SMS/sec, call centers can now promote CALL OR TEXT as their main call to action on consumer-facing toll free support lines. Businesses can finally address the growing demand of consumers preferring text over voice. According to the Harris Poll (1), 64% of people prefer text messaging versus placing a phone call for customer service, and 44% would rather send a text than stay on hold. \nIn addition to 1,000 SMS/sec throughput being available across the entire ecosystem, full handset delivery receipts are also now available. Handset delivery receipts are actual acknowledgements by the phone itself that the message was delivered. If the phone is off, no delivery receipt is returned until the phone is turned on and receives the message. Prior to this, handset delivery receipts were only available on short codes. \nBusinesses interested in adding text messaging to their existing toll free and landline phone numbers can visit Zipwhip.com or text 855 ZIPWHIP (947-9447) to sign up for a free trial. \nAbout Zipwhip Zipwhip, a Seattle-based text messaging software provider, pioneered the concept of utilizing the cloud to enable existing mobile, landline, and toll free numbers to send and receive text messages from any connected device. Additionally, Zipwhip offers a carrier-grade cloud texting platform to help mobile and landline operators modernize the texting medium. Its technology introduces trailblazing functionality while holding true to the distinct culture of texting that consumers have grown to love. \n(1)\"The High Demand for Customer Service via Text Messaging,\" Harris Poll 2014.
