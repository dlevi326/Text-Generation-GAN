The common industry term, Big Data, represents unstructured data sets that are large, complex, and prohibitively difficult to process using traditional management tools.In previous Leading Big Data Companies reports, Mind Commerce has covered larger, more well-known and evaluated Big Data companies. In this edition of Big Data Leader research, Mind Commerce evaluates smaller, less-known companies that have innovative solutions and great promise to solve the many challenges presented by huge datasets and generate information/insights from them with minimal delay time (sometimes in real-time). Companies evaluated in this report* includes: GridGain", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T02:12:59.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
