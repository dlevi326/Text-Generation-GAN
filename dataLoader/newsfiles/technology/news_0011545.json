Users can now pay school fees and dues, cafeteria bills as well as buy uniforms, books and merchandise through the Paytm Wallet. \n\nPaytm has tied up with several premium educational institutions in the country from pre-schools to colleges, including prestigious names such as IIT Mandi, Universal Education Trust, KN Modi University, Vidyamandir Classes, Made Easy, Career Launcher, Jamboree, Primus Public School, Bangalore, Swaminarayan Gurukul Vidyalaya and a few DPS to name some. \n\nPaytm is in advanced stage discussions with all leading IITs, IIMs, central and state universities and will be completing the formal tie-ups soon. \n\nVijay Shekhar Sharma, founder & CEO, Paytm said, \"We are committed to bringing all services that require regular payment on to the Paytm platform. School fees and educational expenses form a significant part of an Indian consumer's regular spends. Since this segment involves children, the advent of cashless purchases and payments obviates chances of theft and misplacement that often come with carrying cash.\" \n\nHe said, \"In line with our vision of a cashless economy and to serve the users well, we have enabled cashless payments in some of the most prominent educational institutions. Our aim is to grow this platform multifold in the next 6 months. Going forward, we will also aggregate and offer various online courses on Paytm.\" \n\nThere is immense potential in the Indian education space. As per a Fitch report, the Indian education sector's market size is estimated at $109.84 billion in FY15 which makes India the world's third largest market for education by size. \n\nWith over 1.5 million schools and more than 35,000 higher education institutes in India, the market in the country is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 34% during 2013-14 to 2017-18. Paytm aims to tap into this burgeoning opportunity and make regular purchases simpler and cash-free for students and parents.
