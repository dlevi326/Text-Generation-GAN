By introducing Anuta Networks’ self-service capabilities throughout its hundreds of geographically-dispersed departments, UBC will be better equipped to deliver critical campus services on demand, cost-effectively and in less time. \nUBC is one of Canada’s top 3 universities, and one of the top 20 public universities in the world. Its IT team supports 60,000 students across 300 buildings, and its network team has averaged 200+ hours monthly on change tickets for end-to-end segmentation. \nAfter evaluating multiple leading vendors, UBC has found that Anuta NCX for large scale, next-generation network services delivers exceptional business value. Anuta NCX offers an unmatched rich YANG model-driven architecture, and securely supports many deployments including campus, DC, MPLS, and WAN automation at production scale. \nThe NCX easy-to-use design will enable the UBC network team to rapidly design agile network services and publish them to self-service catalogs.
