Results show that Gen X (age 35-54) and Baby Boomers (age 55+) are digitally savvy: This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150831006092/en/ More than two out of three Gen X investors and more than half of all Boomers surveyed categorize mobile trading as “critical.” Half of all Gen X and one-third of all Boomers surveyed plan to use their mobile devices more often to manage their portfolios in the next year. More than a third of Gen X and about a quarter of Boomers surveyed use an investing and trading app at least once a week. \nFurthermore, the survey reveals that both of these generations prefer online tools over in-person advice when it comes to saving for the long term. More than three-quarters of Gen X and Boomers surveyed also prefer a broker that is more like R2D2, who comes to their aid with a variety of helpful tools, over one like C3PO, who provides a focused skillset and primarily offers advice. \n“The belief that only millennials crave digital solutions is dead,” said Kunal Vaed, SVP of Digital Channels at E*TRADE Financial. “Gen X and Boomers show significant digital savviness as well. Today, investors of all ages gravitate toward brokers that offer a full suite of digital tools — from desktop to smartphone, and now even the watches on our wrists.” \nMr. Vaed offered the following insights on the recent rise of Gen X and Boomer digital adoption: Investors crave the direct model. In the wake of the global financial crisis, older investors may be less satisfied with the value they have received from traditional broker relationships and now seek tools to help them manage their finances themselves. Investors interact with digital every day — in almost everything they do. As experiences like Facebook, Amazon, and Uber increasingly become a daily part of consumers’ lives, investors are demanding similar experiences from their broker. Today’s mobile and digital landscape offers so much more . Bandwidth has expanded exponentially, connecting consumers more than ever before. With greater processing power and bigger screens, smartphones have advanced to become a critical channel for rich investing experiences, including asset allocation tools, intelligent education, and complex trade executions. \nMr. Vaed continued, “Clearly, digital channels are critical for today’s investor, but that is not the end of the story. Investors now seek the hybrid model — one defined by an exceptional experience online and supported by guidance and help when they need it, either virtually or in person.” \nFor the full report of the Q315 StreetWise study results, click here . \nE*TRADE helps investors balance today’s needs with tomorrow’s goals, through pioneering digital tools and personalized, smart guidance online and from seasoned financial consultants.
