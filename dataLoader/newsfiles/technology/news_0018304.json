Jessica McCloughan, wife of Washington Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan, accused ESPN reporter Dianna Russini on Twitter of giving “BJs” to obtain stories about the team.\n2015 is already a disaster for the Washington Redskins. The Twitter account claiming to be “Mrs. McCloughan” with the Twitter handle “Rutherchevy” was deleted as soon as reports first emerged of the accusations made about Russini.\nOther Stories ‘My husband and I haven’t had sex in a year’ Relationships Greek model saves drowning refugee World 0 comments Take his name and you’ll be called ‘actor’s wife’ Rendezview 0 comments Fleeced!

Despite the team’s denials, she later admitted to making the accusations and apologised unreservedly.\nShe was also forced to apologise for a tweet on August 13 in which she replied to one of Russini’s posts, saying: “I’m pretty sure this info is coming from my husband to his new side chick (dianna) It’s confirmed”.\nRussini had reported the Washington franchise was divided over whether or not to play or trade its star quarterback Robert Griffin III.\nThe Washington Post published a transcript of the apology.\n“I deeply apologise for the disparaging remarks about an ESPN reporter on my personal Twitter account,” The Washington Post’s Mike Jones reported.\n“The comment was unfounded and inappropriate and I have the utmost respect for both the reporter and ESPN.\n“I regret that my actions have brought undeserved negative attention to the Redskins organisation and its leadership.\nScot McCloughan and his wife Jessica McCloughan have some explaining to do. “My comments in no way reflect the opinions or attitudes of the organisation and I regret that my behaviour has in any way negatively impacted the team or its fan base.”\nScot McCloughan joined the Redskins in January after previously working with the San Francisco 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks.\nHe and Jessica were married this year after his previous marriage reportedly fell apart during his battle with alcoholism, which ultimately led to him leaving the 49ers.\nESPN also issued a statement, declaring its full support for Russini.\n“Dianna is an excellent reporter who should never have to be subjected to such vulgar comments,” ESPN said in a statement.\n“We are obviously extremely disappointed by today’s developments.”\nRussini has not responded to the claims.\nThe Redskins begin their NFL season on September 13 against the Miami Dolphins.\nOriginally published as ‘How many did you have to give?’", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a6c4a36785d6ddd4d2609d8a280d4c5f", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7fa0097a20e799272d77cd2c8b80558b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/fa012985c4d476b379eb0dd75123dbb7", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d44c4993c64dc6391f5695005ea0ec1f?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5c53c73d99b90b7a98ca776b7c4e9b09", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ea1dace331a70f3aa0a184b199d36f89?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/637f4879d6e9a555c4641a22bb63c452?width=650", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/american-sports/nfl-wife-accuses-reporter-of-giving-sexual-favours-in-exchange-for-information/story-fnq2nnu6-1227511110191?sv=22684bda9a4d2bd365c786195c1754ac", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&maxRelated=6&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/afecf54f68d8799f8519418f0a9be08c"], "published": "2015-09-04T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T04:03:56.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
