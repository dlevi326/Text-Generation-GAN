Oil a 20 cm (8 inch) cake tin and line the base with baking paper. \nBeat the oil and sugar together until well combined. Add the yoghurt, orange blossom water, vanilla and orange zest and beat until incorporated. Set aside. \nIn a separate bowl, whisk together the ground pistachio nuts, the flours, baking powder, ground cardamom and salt. Gradually add the yoghurt mixture to the flour mixture, alternating with the milk and stirring between each addition until smooth. Be careful not to overbeat. \nPour into the prepared tin and bake for about 55 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. If the top starts to brown too much before the cake is cooked, loosely cover with foil. Let the cake stand in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool. \nMeanwhile, beat together all the icing ingredients until smooth and creamy. Chill until needed but remove from the fridge 10 minutes before using. When the cake is completely cold, smooth the icing over the top and side and sprinkle with the crushed pistachio nuts. \nEasy Vegan by Sue Quinn (Murdoch Books, £14.99) available on Telegraph Bookshop More vegan baking recipes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:23:58.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
