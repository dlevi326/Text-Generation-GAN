Then you might like to take yourself to Texas for the International Locate Rodeo 2016, to be held at a location and date yet to be determined by Texas 811, that state’s equivalent of the Dial Before You Dig service. Texas 811 takes over the event next year from Georgia 811 which started it and which has held it for the past 14 years. The Rodeo has been described as “The Olympics of the Locate Industry”. It was created to celebrate the art and science behind the craft of underground utility locating and to “serve as the cornerstone for promoting high quality and achievable standards in the industry.” So what’s involved? Participants compete to locate underground infrastructure. There are separate categories for power, gas and water, plus the, ‘Locate from Hell’ event, of which more shortly. In the main events, competitors have 12 minutes to locate the infrastructure (separate contests for each of the four) and must mark and measure the positions of the infrastructure, write them down and report back to the adjudicator within that time. You can see a video of a competitor in action here. In the Locate From Hell event, locators are not allowed to use their own equipment and have to locate a specific utility that may not be one they specialise in. They have just three minutes. The one who makes the most correct locates wins. It’s billed as an international event but at this year’s, held on the campus of the University of West Georgia, the only international representatives among the 81 competitors came from Canada. So, come on Aussies – show them what you’re made of in 2016. You’ll find information at http://locaterodeo.net . And if you want to read an independent report of the Locate Rodeo, check out this article from The Atlantic magazine where the authoer “spent a weekend at the International Utility Locate Rodeo”. She reported: “It’s a struggle to explain the 14th Annual International Utility Locate Rodeo to anyone outside of the utility-locator world. To begin with, most people don’t realise there is a utility-locator world—who utility locators are, what they do, and how they do it. They definitely don’t understand why it’s a skill to be celebrated.” PelicanCorp PelicanCorp’s technology and service suite has been designed and built around the network and asset design and construction processes.
