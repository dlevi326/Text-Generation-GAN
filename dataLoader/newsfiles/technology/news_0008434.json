Our Greek revenues in 2015 are estimated at between 6% and 7% of total revenue and we do not see any potential impact on our results for this year. The situation in Greece has now stabilised and our Greek operations continue to function as normal. \nPost period-end We have announced a €14 million proposed acquisition of a Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) and Mobile Security software provider based in Europe. The acquisition target offers a set of security solutions for the mobile industry with strong focus on BYOD and Mobile Applications Security. It has a successful track record with customers in the banking, finance and public sectors, and has built a strong reseller network including telecommunications companies, IT solutions providers and mobile technology players. This acquisition is intended to enhance the GO!Enterprise portfolio with certain aspects of security that are not covered in the current GO!Enterprise platform, and provide instant access to certain additional regulated financial markets. Globo expects the acquisition to be completed in October 2015. Globo has entered into a major partnership with I Love Velvet (ILV) Inc., based in New York, to address the mobile POS (mPOS) market globally. Our combined mPOS solution has been selected by a major International Bank to enable its more than 2 million small business and professionals customers. Official commercial launch is planned for Q1 2016 after the completion of a pilot programme scheduled for Q4 2015. \nOutlook Our positioning within the field of Mobile Enterprise creates strong momentum for further growth in enterprise customers and new project wins. Strong business momentum is expected due to the traditionally stronger second half of the year and continued US expansion. Our current cash position and cash flow covers all of our operating requirements and will enable us to pursue selective acquisition opportunities in the near term. In order to grow the business through more sizeable acquisitions, we continue our High Yield Bond discussions. Globo maintains a prudent view on the methods of financing its acquisition led growth. \nCommenting on the results, Costis Papadimitrakopoulos, CEO of Globo, said: \n“We are proud of the continued success of our growth strategy. Over the course of just a few years, Globo has been positioned as one of the leaders in the Mobile Enterprise space and our business continues to evolve in a number of different business areas. Our International operations and growing US presence are driving opportunities for our customers and the Enterprise transformation towards mobile systems and applications is accelerating. \n“We remain committed to increasing shareholder value, both through organic growth and strategic investments in technology, expertise and market reach.” \nA presentation to analysts and brokers hosted by Costis Papadimitrakopoulos, Chief Executive Officer, and Dimitris Gryparis, Financial Director, will be held at 10.30 on 29 September 2015 at 55 Old Broad Street, London, EC2M 1RX. \nTo join via conference call: \nUK dial-in: 0800 368 0649Overseas dial-in: +44 20 3059 8125Access Code: Globo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:42:13.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
