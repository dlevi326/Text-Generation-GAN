Andrew Meares Share on twitter by David Ramli Far from the savagery of Canberra politics, by the placid lakeside suburb of Belmont near Newcastle, a switch was flicked on Monday morning that could eventually decide how Australian history remembers its 29th Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.\nAs Mr Turnbull's new cabinet was being sworn in by the Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove, the national broadband network company was holding a small gathering of media to celebrate the launch of its latest technology – known as fibre to the node.\nThis is the key plank of the Coalition's NBN. And it will either save taxpayers billions of dollars and a decade of waiting for faster broadband or become the embarrassing albatross around the Prime Minister's neck that turns Australia into a digital backwater at the worst possible time.\nLabor had wanted to \"future-proof\" the nation by connecting 93 per cent of homes and businesses directly with fibre optic cabling – a technology previously reserved for business parks and office blocks. The idea was to make Australia a global broadband leader as the economy shifted online.\nTurnbull's legacy could be harmed if Australia is left as a global laggard - far behind hyper-connected nations like Singapore and New Zealand where fibred homes will be the norm. Alex Ellinghausen But it suffered periodic setbacks, delays and consistently missed targets. Staff morale plummeted and scandals arose with mishandled asbestos threatening workers and residents until NBN raised training standards.\nBlasting Labor's model As the Coalition's former communications minister, Mr Turnbull blasted this technology as a waste of time and money and created an alternative vision that shrank its reach from 93 per cent to just 20 per cent of the nation.\nIn its place he flagged fibre to the node technology, which will now become the phone and internet connection for 4.5 million homes and business – 38 per cent of the entire country.\n It runs fibre to roadside node cabinets before switching over to the existing copper phone lines to cut down on the need for tearing up front lawns and driveways. This in turn saves time and billions of dollars in costs.\nBut three key challenges now lay ahead of NBN in its use of the technology.\nAnd just as Labor's Senator Stephen Conroy will be forever wedded with fibre-to-the-premise, this is a plan that belongs to Mr Turnbull – no matter who the communications minister may be.\nThe first is the state of the copper phone lines, which Telstra refused to detail until after it signed the $11.2 billion deal to lease them for the NBN. Any line that fails to meet minimum speed requirements will be replaced in a process called remediation but the company cannot forecast how many will need fixing.\nAnecdotal evidence tells of bad waterproofing that has substantially degraded the copper lines. This would cause massive cost blowouts if replicated across the nation. NBN describes these reports as beat-ups.\nWiring homes The seemingly minor issue of in-home wiring could also pop up as a problem for customers. Of the 43 test subjects on the new technology in Belmont, at least one experienced slow speeds caused by the haphazard phone lines inside their home that required four or more visits from technicians.\nOver the decades many bodgey home wirers have added extra sockets with poor connections that will slow their broadband to a trickle.\nOn the surface this shouldn't be NBN's problem – it is only responsible for the internet speeds up until the base plate, which is the main phone socket. But rightly or wrongly NBN will cop the blame if users paying good money get bad broadband.\nThe third-biggest issue is a matter of speed. The vast majority of Australians today cannot use or afford the 1 Gigabit per second download speeds fibre optic cabling is technically capable of delivering.\nAs Australia shifts away from its dependence on base commodities into a brave new world of digital economies, however, it could be left as a global laggard – far behind hyper-connected nations like Singapore and New Zealand where fibred homes will be the norm.\nNBN's answer is that it will use gradual tech upgrades to keep Australia travelling at fast-enough speeds without burning through huge wads of taxpayer funds. And it also says getting faster broadband to more people is better than delivering super-fast speeds.\nBut through all this one thing is clear – depending on how the NBN's most controversial technology fares the Prime Minister will be remembered as either the efficient deliverer or the destroyer of Australia's digital future.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-09-21T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:24:17.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
