Marold’s artwork features 236 large beetle-kill spruce logs from the Del Norte forest in southern Colorado.\nEach log, weighing an average of 2,500 pounds, will be lifted into place by a large crane, then fastened to steel structures, which will hold the logs in place. The final sculpture, expected to be complete in October 2015, will arc around the train platform and create light and shadow patterning as visitors arrive to the transit center.\nSource:- Denver International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T07:14:43.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
