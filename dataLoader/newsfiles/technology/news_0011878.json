The Promira platform is the next generation of embedded tools, combining a host adapter and a protocol analyzer into a single serial platform. The introduction of I2C Active – Level 2 Application increases the capabilities of the Promira platform making it stronger, faster and smarter than any other single device on the market.\nThe I2C Active – Level 2 Application represents the fifth application to be released in the past eight months. Fulfilling Total Phase’s commitment to introduce new applications, extend the Promira platform feature set and provide new functionality for the currently supported I2C protocol; the I2C Active – Level 2 application makes the Promira platform one of the most robust and affordable I2C bus interfaces offered in the test and measurement industry.\nI2C Active – Level 2 Application features:\n Master Clock Speed: 3.4 MHz Slave Clock Speed: 3.4 MHz No inter-byte delays Memory Programing: EEPROM or other I2C memory GPIO(s): up to 12 Voltage Levels: 0.9-3.45, 5 Target Power: 2 independent, 1 programmable (0.9-3.45 V), 1 switchable (3.3-5 V), 100 mA each Connection Types: High Speed USB, Ethernet 10/100/1000\n“We are extremely pleased with our latest addition to the Promira Serial Platform application offering. The I2C Active – Level 2 Application addresses the needs expressed by our customers,” said Gil Ben-Dov, CEO of Total Phase. “Our customer’s asked for an all-in-one tool that supports multiple protocols, clock rates, voltage requirements, and offers scalability in a small high performance package; all without breaking their budget. The Promira Serial Platform will clear the engineer’s workbench removing clutter, deliver more functionality and save valuable time , while concurrently providing the exact capabilities they need, when they need them. The days when engineers need to ‘overbuy’ to address potential future requirements are eliminated with this revolutionary new platform.”\nThe new application in High-speed mode allows for 3.4 MHz data transfer per burst, that’s four times the speed compared to the Aardvark Host Adapter. The application auto selects Hi-speed mode based upon the requested transmit frequency and works with memory, sensor and data conversion products.\nThe Promira Serial Platform with the I2C Active – Level 2 Application will help engineers with design, development, end-of-line programming, manufacturing, memory chip programming, peripheral simulation, and test & measurement in any industry ranging from automotive and communications to health and manufacturing.\nAbout Total Phase\nTotal Phase manufactures powerful USB, I2C, SPI, and CAN development tools for the embedded systems engineer.
