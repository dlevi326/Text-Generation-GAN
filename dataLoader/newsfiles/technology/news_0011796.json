How such a device can be \"powered\" so that it moves across a surface without sticking to it and how its movement can then be tracked are questions tackled by the group of James M. Tour in their latest report about the design of a new nanocar in Asian Journal of Organic Chemistry . \nThe nanocar was built by at Rice University, Houston, Texas, and has a rotary motor , which provides \"power\" for the vehicle through light-induced isomerization. The isomerization causes the \"motor\" component to flip its chemical configuration and propels the nanocar with a \"paddle-wheel\"-type motion. The second important feature is a fluorophore based on 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY), which allows the movement of the nanocar to be tracked by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy while not interfering with the motion of the car on the surface or the function of the motor. \nConstruction of the nanocar is now complete and Tour says of the work: \"We are now at a stage where we can begin the tracking experiments in these motorized nanocars!\". The team is presently testing how the cars move on glass surfaces, which they expect to be in circles, and how the tracking system performs. Nanodragsters hit the street: Scientists roll agile hot rod out of micro-garage (Update) January 6, 2010 \n(PhysOrg.com) -- Chemists are getting better at building nanomachines, but Rice researchers continue to race ahead of the pack. Researchers discover bacteria propelled by a kind of rotary driver March 31, 2015 \nHarvard researchers, probing the mystery of how some bacteria move across surfaces, have discovered a kind of rotary motor in the bacterium Flavobacterium johnsoniae. Researchers identify movement of droplets on soft surfaces August 5, 2015 \nResearchers from the University of Twente have succeeded in clearly identifying why droplets on soft, squishy surfaces react differently than on hard surfaces. A water droplet, for example, moves very differently over jelly ... Molecular motors: Pirouetting in the spotlight September 29, 2015 \nGerman scientists have developed a new class of molecular motors that rotate unidirectionally at speeds of up to 1 kHz when exposed to sunlight at room temperature.
