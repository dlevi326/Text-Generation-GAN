It's not a great part of our world.\" \nSorkin seemed to take exception to the \"opportunistic\" accusation. \"If you've got a factory full of children in China assembling phones for 17 cents an hour, you've got a lot of nerve calling someone else opportunistic,\" Sorkin said, according to the Hollywood Reporter . \nNow Sorkin says he's sorry. \n\"You know what, I think that Tim Cook and I probably both went a little too far. And I apologize to Tim Cook,\" Sorkin told E! News . \"I hope when he sees the movie he enjoys it as much as I enjoy his products.\" \nSorkin's film, \"Steve Jobs,\" is set to be released next month.
