( http://pyrogenesis.com ) (TSXV: PYR) (OTCQB: PYRNF), a TSX Venture 50® clean-tech company (the \"Company\" or \"PyroGenesis\") that designs, develops, manufactures and commercializes plasma waste-to-energy systems and plasma torch products, announced today that it received an order from Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion & Repair (\"SUPSHIP\") to train US Navy sailors on its Plasma Arc Waste Destruction System (\"PAWDS\") Engineering Design Model at its manufacturing facility in Montreal. The first group of sailors are expected to arrive in the fall of 2015. PyroGenesis will offer three (3) distinct training programs, including mechanical maintenance personnel, electrical maintenance personnel, and system operators. The training will take place on an existing full scale system which is developed and installed at PyroGenesis' manufacturing facility in Montreal . The first group of sailors have been contracted to be trained under this new program for approximately US$ 100,000 and will arrive in the second half of 2015; the training will last for a period of approximately four (4) weeks. Separately, following the sale of two PAWDS Marine systems for the latest generation of US Navy aircraft carriers, PyroGenesis continues to provide technical support to Newport News Shipbuilding Huntington Ingalls. Since the beginning of 2015, PyroGenesis has received contracts for technical support totalling over US$ 100,000 and expects this to exceed US$ 200,000 by year-end. As previously announced, PyroGenesis is also pursuing discussions with the US Navy to provide technical support and spare parts throughout the ships' expected 50-year lifespan, as well as developing an ongoing educational/certification program in PAWDS Marine system operations. \"This order to develop and implement a training program is one of several support services that PyroGenesis is proposing to the US Navy,\" said Pierre Carabin , Director of Engineering at PyroGenesis. \"We are very proud of the fact that the US Navy recognises PyroGenesis' skills and expertise not only in the design and manufacture of high-tech plasma waste destruction systems, but also in our after-sales support services\", stated Paul Simmons , CFO of PyroGenesis. \"Training US Navy sailors in the operation and maintenance of our PAWDS Marine systems will be an honor that we look forward to fulfilling.\" About PyroGenesis Canada Inc.
