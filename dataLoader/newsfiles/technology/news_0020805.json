Photo: Peter Wells\nSamsung's latest smartwatch is a bold move on many levels. But after spending some time with the watch at IFA in Berlin, it seems most of the company's decisions have paid off.\nThe hardware design of the Gear S2 is easily one of the best I've seen on a smartwatch. The device combines the best of the current smartwatches available: the clean lines and smaller footprint of the Apple Watch, with the traditional rounded watch face found on the Moto 360 and LG Watch Urbane.\nThe device is impressively svelte. It's two millimetres thicker than the Apple Watch but, like the Apple Watch, it hides its weight behind curved lines. It's also very light on the wrist, and is one of the few smartwatches that doesn't look ridiculous on my tiny wrists.\nSamsung has opted for its own Tizen operating system over Android Wear. Photo: Peter Wells\nSamsung have chosen their in-house Tizen platform to power the device, over Android Wear. Tizen comes with a few real and perceived benefits for Samsung.\nAdvertisement First, it allows Samsung to add new features that other Android Wear manufacturers cannot. Google explicitly bans customisation of the interface and controls of Apple Wear devices, leaving manufacturers with little room to differentiate their offerings, beyond custom watch faces.\nBy choosing Tizen, Samsung was able to implement an innovative rotating bezel interface, which the company has dubbed \"Circular UX\" to set the Gear S2 apart. During the launch, Samsung made fun of Apple's \"itty bitty\" digital crown, preferring their more tactile design.\nApp icons are arranged around the edge of the circular screen. Photo: Peter Wells\nIt was a cheeky moment, but I think Samsung have a point. Using the bezel is incredibly fast, and twisting the bezel feels a lot more satisfying than Apple's crown. The animations between screens is beautifully smooth.\nIf Samsung's claims of two to three days of battery life are correct, then it seems Tizen is less power hungry than Android Wear as well.\nBut Tizen has its disadvantages. Android Wear is a much larger ecosystem than Tizen could hope to be, and Android Wear is by all accounts already the No. 2 watch platform, behind Apple. As fans of Windows Phone will tell you, getting apps on the third-largest platform is a struggle.\nThe Gear S2 also comes in a more modern-looking design. Photo: Samsung\nFor Tizen to succeed, Samsung must convince developers to write apps for it too – and that's a big ask. Samsung showed off apps from Uber, Nike, and Yelp – but Twitter and Facebook were missing. Then again, there is no Facebook app for Apple Watch, either.\nOne surprising but welcome announcement was that the Tizen-based Gear S2 will now support all Android devices running 4.4 or above. This opens up the Gear S2 to a much larger user base than previous Tizen devices, which were locked to Samsung phones.\nThe built-in apps are great, messaging and calendar apps are as good as those found on Apple Watch and Android Wear, with interactive app notifications.\nOne feature that will have Apple-centric tech press talking is the round app icons. Of course, they seem very close to Apple's own Watch apps, but they make sense in the context of the round screen. Unlike the Apple Watch, the App Icons surround the watch face, as the numbers on a traditional watch would, rather than being bunched together from the centre outward. In terms of touch targets, this gives the Samsung product the edge over Apple, which normally leads the industry in these \"ease of use\" features.\nThe watch comes with all the features you'd expect from a smartwatch. Fitness tracking is of course central to the device (the circular progress bars are familiar to say the least). The watch has a number of fitness-based watch faces to choose from, including a cute little sparkling face that twinkles the more you work out.\nSpeaking of watch faces, the Gear S2 ships with a bunch of well-designed faces to choose from, and Samsung are opening up the watch to third party watch faces. Another point of difference from Apple the company was happy to underline.\nWith the Gear S2, Samsung have unashamedly borrowed features from other successful smartwatches to create a device unique to Samsung. Doubling down on Tizen was a bold choice, but they've tempered the decision by opening up the platform to all of Android, and have benefited from a UX all their own.\nThe Gear S2 is due to launch in October. No price has been announced.\nThe writer travelled to Berlin as a guest of Samsung.\nFollow Digital Life on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/digitallife_au"], "published": "2015-09-04T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T05:29:59.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
