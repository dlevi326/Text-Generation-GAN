The parties become quickly embroiled in litigation over the misappropriation of trade secrets, sometimes with only bare-bone allegations of those trade secrets having been pled in the first place. Defendants, in many cases, are left trying to defend against claims that are vague and uncertain, putting them at a distinct disadvantage early in the case, especially when they are defending against morphing allegations of what was misappropriated. Plaintiffs resist the prompting to provide more detail out of concern over inadvertent disclosure and the fear that providing such detail may cut off discovery of the extent of the defendantsâ€™ transgressions due to a lack of knowledge of the full extent of the misappropriation. The stakes on both sides of a misappropriation case are high, and the pressure is on the courts to find the right path forward. \nOriginally published by the ABA Section of Litigation, Business Torts & Unfair Competition Litigation Committee, in the Business Torts Journal, Summer 2015, Vol. 22, No. 4. \nPlease see full Article below for more information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T20:54:41.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
