And it is against this backdrop that Copa Airlines, one of Latin America’s leading carriers, has launched its new customer loyalty program – ConnectMiles – enabled by a variety of IT solutions from the Amadeus Loyalty Suite.\nPrimarily, Amadeus Loyalty Management will help Copa Airlines improve communications, and launch targeted promotions in order to create strong relationships between the airline and its loyalty program members. At the same time the solution aims to enhance personalization capabilities leveraging the wealth of information it captures, and thus deliver an improved and tailored experience to the traveler while boosting the airline’s revenues.\nIn addition, tier and miles management functionality means program members benefit from flexibility and ease of upgrade, miles exchange, and purchase. Amadeus offers rich partner integration and management capabilities that can assist ConnectMiles in extending its partner network.\nCopa Airlines will also take advantage of the Amadeus Partner Management Service, which facilitates the data exchange between the loyalty program itself and Copa Airlines’ partners, including those within the Star Alliance.\n“After studying the market and listening to our customers, we have decided to build a programme tailored for the customers of our network. Having our own loyalty programme will give us the tools to better understand our most valuable customers and offer them a better service, with the features and benefits that our members told us they value, such as personalised offers and communications,” said Russ Hinckley, Loyalty Program Vice-president for Copa Airlines. “We needed a partner with proven expertise in the airline industry and with loyalty programmes. We were also looking for the required technology that will give us the flexibility to serve the needs of our growing member base in a timely and accurate manner. This way Copa Airlines consolidates its leadership in the region by maintaining the highest operational standards and world class service in order to provide the best experience to its customers.”\n“Our Loyalty Suite enables our customers to bring their products and services and their partners’ products and services together in a rich loyalty ecosystem. By retaining details of every interaction with the customer, from travel or partner activities to website logins, which supports personalization and innovative marketing strategies, our customers receive a more rewarding global travel and shopping experience”, said Julia Sattel, Senior Vice President Airline IT at Amadeus. “We are delighted to be working with Copa Airlines in building ConnectMiles, a complete customer loyalty program that will allow it to boost traveler engagement, work effectively with its partners and enhance ancillary revenues.”\nThe Amadeus Loyalty Suite, which is used by over 30 airlines worldwide includes three solutions: Amadeus Loyalty Management, Amadeus Loyalty Partner Management Services, and Amadeus Customer Service Center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T12:43:17.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
