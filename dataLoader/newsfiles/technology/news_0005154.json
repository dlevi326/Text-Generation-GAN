The DAB radio, provided by Visteon, picks up Mediamobile's V-Traffic data broadcasts in a standardized DAB-TPEG format and transfers the content via a Bluetooth® connection to the driver's smartphone or tablet for decoding. The traffic information is displayed on the smartphone screen, via an application that switches seamlessly between DAB and the Internet, to ensure the best service delivery at all times.\nUsers benefit from reduced mobile data communication costs and avoid roaming fees when traveling abroad. Moreover, they receive traffic and safety information even when their mobile phone network is saturated or out of range. For automakers, this hybrid solution delivers a fast and cost-efficient way of bringing new data services to the market, such as traffic and weather, alongside traditional radio programs. It adapts seamlessly with entry-level as well as high-end DAB radio and smart devices.\nVisteon brings decades of experience in digital radio receivers to the partnership, being first to launch the DAB+/DMB-A technology on a line-fit car radio. Visteon has also premiered several hybrid-radio technology prototypes which combine broadcast and IP-content.\nAs a subsidiary of TDF – an industry leader in terrestrial broadcast – Mediamobile develops expertise in traffic information, broadcasting DAB traffic services in Germany and Norway and supports partners in the UK, Benelux and Italy , with the aim of offering DAB-TPEG services across Europe.\nSupporting visuals:\nImage: http://visteon.com/media/multimedia/images/visteon_dab_radio_in_car.jpg Infographic: http://visteon.com/media/multimedia/images/visteon_dab_radio_w_v_traffic.jpg About Visteon\nVisteon is a global company that designs, engineers and manufactures innovative cockpit electronics products and connected car solutions for most of the world's major vehicle manufacturers.
