Market research suggests digital screens can generate at least 15 percent boosts on promoted items.\nThen, when in the aisle, shoppers can touch interactive touch-screens, or scan the bottle’s barcode, to hear professionally recorded audio, giving compelling details about the beverage's taste, food pairing suggestion and other information .\n“Store reps may be able to tell you a bottle’s price, but not too many will know how to make a Mango Margarita; or what wine or craft beer to serve with Lobster,” Merideth said. “OnCue’s on-demand info provides contextual and reliable information to builds shoppers’ confidence, encouraging them to try new brands. This often results in larger shopping baskets.”\nThe platform also includes metrics about products scanned, helping retailers make buying decisions, and marketers determine the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns, Merideth said.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12941548.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://expertoncue.com/product-overview", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12941548.htm"], "published": "2015-09-08T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:57:59.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
