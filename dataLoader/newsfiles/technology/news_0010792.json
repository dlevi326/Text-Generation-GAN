The device is part of Google’s Pixel lineup, a series of high-end laptops that struggled to find widespread market adoption. The new gadget will be available in time for the holiday shopping season, he said.\nGoogle, while traditionally focused on consumers, is stepping up efforts to introduce products tailored for business customers. Although the Pixel C is a tablet, with a touch screen, it’s also designed to replace a traditional laptop. Microsoft was one of the first major technology companies to embrace that configuration when it introduced the Surface tablet computer in 2012. And earlier this month, Apple took the wraps off the iPad Pro, a bigger version of its tablet (also with a detachable keyboard) aimed at corporate users.\nWhile Google’s Pixel laptop was part of the Chromebook family of computers and used the Chrome operating system, the Pixel C is based on Android, Google’s mobile software platform. The keyboard, which costs $149, attaches to the tablet via magnets and links to the device with a Bluetooth connection.", "external_links": ["http://pixel.google.com/\\", "https://www.google.com/chromebook/pixel/\\"], "published": "2015-09-30T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:52:13.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
