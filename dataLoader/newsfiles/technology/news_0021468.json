Safe Systems' white paper presents five best practices that community banks should have in place to effectively manage information technology. \nCommunity banks' IT teams are stretched thin and oftentimes do not have the capacity to maintain systems and compliance standards. More institutions are turning to third party technology service providers and automation to assist them. \n\"In today's changing IT environment, it is critical for community banks to deliver the same quality of service as the big banks and financial institutions in their regions,\" said Darren Bridges, president of Safe Systems. \"Partnering with the right technology services provider can bridge the gap between new initiatives and everyday administrative functions and your bank's longer term goals for maintaining compliance.\" \nAbout Safe Systems \nSafe Systems was founded in 1993 to provide compliance-centric IT and security solutions exclusively to financial institutions.
