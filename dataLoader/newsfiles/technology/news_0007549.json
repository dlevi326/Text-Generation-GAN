Number one on the list is the popular messaging app WeChat, followed by the app of the Chinese Uber competitor Didi Kuaidi. Other affected apps include Baidu Music and a game called CarrotFantasy.\nNews of a iOS security breach surfaced a few days ago : Hackers had added malicious code to a collection of software development tools called Xcode and tricked iOS app developers into downloading the compromised version. Any app built with those tools includes malicious code, and dozens of infected apps made it onto the App Store before security researchers were able to notify Apple.\nThe hack mostly targeted developers within China, and most of the affected apps have also been developed for the Chinese market. However, some apps, including WeChat, also have a large user base outside of China. Apple has removed some of these apps from the App Store, while others have received official updates from their developers to remove any malicious code. \"If users have one of these apps, they should update the affected app which will fix the issue on the user's device,\" Apple said.\nHere are the 25 most popular apps affected by the recent malware exploit:\nWeChat DiDi Taxi 58 Classified - Job, Used Cars, Rent Gaode Map - Driving and Public Transportation Railroad 12306 Flush China Unicom Customer Service (Official Version)* CarrotFantasy 2: Daily Battle* Miraculous Warmth Call Me MT 2 - Multi-server version Angry Birds 2 - Yifeng Li’s Favorite* Baidu Music - Music Player with Downloads, Ringtones, Music Videos, Radio & Karaoke DuoDuo Ringtone NetEase Music - An Essential for Radio and Song Download Foreign Harbor - The Hottest Platform for Oversea Shopping* Battle of Freedom (The MOBA mobile game) One Piece - Embark (Officially Authorized)* Let’s Cook - Receipes Heroes of Order & Chaos - Multiplayer Online Game* Dark Dawn - Under the Icing City (the first mobile game sponsored by Fan BingBing)* I Like Being With You* Himalaya FM (Audio Book Community) CarrotFantasy* Flush HD Encounter - Local Chatting Tool How to buy the new iPhone...
