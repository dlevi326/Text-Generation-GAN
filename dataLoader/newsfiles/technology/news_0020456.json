These material types include adhesives, agrochemicals, cement, ceramics, colloids, cosmetics and personal care formulations, food and drink, mining and mineral slurries, paints, inks and surface coatings, pharmaceuticals and polymer systems. \nThis 'Ten Ways' guides you through some of the fundamental properties of the dispersed system, and demonstrates how these affect the rheological properties. Whereas it in interesting to understand the bulk material properties, such as rheology, which are associated with the changes in the particle size, shape and zeta potential, these examples will also demonstrate how this understanding can allow the rheology of the material to be controlled. \nPlease download this free white paper to read more.
