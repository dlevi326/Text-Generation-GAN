Really? I have AdBlock also how is this even possible?\" \nSeveral Twitter users claimed that people were effectively being \"punished\" for using advert-blocking software. \nBut Ben Williams, from AdBlock Plus, says the adverts only appeared because of an \"issue in Chrome\" which it expects Google to fix. \nSky News has contacted Google for a comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:39:25.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
