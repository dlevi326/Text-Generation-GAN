It’s designed to sit unobtrusively on a wall or ceiling and constantly monitor your house for any sign of alarm. \nThe Nest is designed to be attached to a ceiling or wall in any room of your house \nWhat makes it different from your garden variety smoke detector is its interactivity and the ability to be informed via the smartphone app. Even if you’re on the other side of the globe. \nWhile an average smoke detector may set you back roughly £30, the Nest Protect costs £89 . \nFor the majority of us, having that cool factor just doesn’t justify the extra expense. Nest protect: Design and features \nThe central ring of light indicates status - blue for setup, green is for OK and red is a warning \nAs you would expect from the man behind the iPod, the design of the Nest Protect could almost be classic Apple. \nThe white plastic body (it also comes in black) curves away at the edges while the centre of the alarm is taken up with a glowing circular ring of light. \nThis indicates the different statuses – blue for setup, green for OK and red for warning. \nThe alarm itself is shrill, piercing and hits 85 decibels; you’re not going to mistake it for anything else. \nThe Nest logo in the centre is a giant button you can press to test out the alarm. It comes with six AA batteries that Nest says will last for five years. \nIf it detects any smoke in your house, as well as setting of the alarm, you will instantly get an alert sent to your phone – giving you the best chance of calling the emergency services and saving your house. Nest protect: Ease of use \nThe Nest app guides you through setup and is easy to use \nA big part of the appeal of the Nest Protect is its ease of use. \nOnce you’ve downloaded the app, it’s simply a case of following the step-by-step instructions on screen or the automated voice alerts from the gadget itself. \nThe app will require you to scan the QR code on the back of the alarm with your phone’s camera to establish the link between the app and the Protect. \nIt uses your home wi-fi signal to talk to your phone, but even if this goes down it will issue a loud warning if it detects a build-up of smoke or carbon monoxide. \nLike many other Internet of Things products, you can buy multiple Protects (or Nest’s other home gadgets which include a thermostat) and simply pair them together. \nIn the same way as a Sonos system, the alarms will recognise each other through the wi-fi and you can control them all through the app. Nest protect: Conclusion \nThe Nest alarm is just one of the company's high-tech home products \nIf you’re a die-hard technology fan then the Nest will really appeal. \nIt’s an attractive gadget that’s both reliable and simple to use. \nThe app is beautifully designed and nervous holidaymakers will appreciate the peace of mind that comes with being able to check on their abode from afar. \nHowever, it’s also a clear luxury device and it’s not hard to balk at the extra £50 or so you’ll be spending on the Nest . Even more, if you decide to daisy-chain several throughout your home. \nRegardless of that, Nest has managed to take a boring appliance like a smoke alarm and turn it into a bona-fide gadget. \nThe Protect is a luxury investment but, unlike many gadgets, a sensible one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:52:09.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
