Established in 1995, Universal Rx started with a vision to provide companies with pharmacy benefit solutions that offer business value alongside unsurpassed customer service and improved outcomes. \nAs the health insurance marketplace continues to change, Universal Rx recognizes that adaptive and distinctive solutions are paramount. These solutions include: customized prescription benefit management for self-insured and fully-insured clients such as employers and insurance companies; a national discount prescription program, called Points of Care ; and Expatriate Prescription Services , an international prescription concierge service for overseas residents. \nIn 2005, Universal Rx identified a market shift in healthcare — a rapidly growing expatriate population for U.S. corporations. As a result, Universal Rx pioneered an innovative solution designed to provide expatriates convenient access to high quality, low cost prescription medications. Expatriate Prescription Services (EPS) focuses on group prescription plans that have United States based employees along with expatriates living overseas. Universal Rx tailors plans to meet the needs of those in the U.S. and outside. \n“Universal Rx has been able to service a variety of plan members over the last twenty years and we are fortunate to have seen success during each year in business.
