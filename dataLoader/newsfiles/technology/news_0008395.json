Last month, Oracle said it was buying Maxymiser Ltd., a maker of cloud-based mobile marketing software.\nIn the latest period, ended Aug. 31, cloud revenue rose nearly 29% to $611 million.\nOverall, Oracle reported a profit of $1.75 billion, or 40 cents a share, down from $2.18 billion, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding stock-based compensation and other items, profit was 53 cents a share, compared with 62 cents a year earlier.\nTotal revenue declined to $8.45 billion from $8.6 billion a year earlier.\nAnalysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, on average, had projected a profit of 52 cents a share on $8.53 billion in revenue.\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com\n 16, 2015 16:55 ET (20:55 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T03:15:47.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
