The video is part of a monthly video series called “Ask Hytrol” focused on specific topics to help maintain conveyor systems and learn about new technologies.\nThe video guides end users to follow proper lock-out tag-out procedures, locate the welded adjustment nut which is used to move the sheave assembly to and from the inside radius of the curve. This action will tighten or loosen the belt as needed for proper tension. Then using a wrench, rotate the welded adjustment nut counterclockwise to tighten the belt and clockwise to loosen the belt until proper tension is achieved.\nHytrol provides a tension indicator gauge on the bottom of the take-up assembly. When tensioning the belt, this will offer visual confirmation that the belt is tensioned properly and provide longer belt life for the LRC conveyor.\nTo view the video, go to: http://bit.ly/1VVST7O\nHytrol Conveyor Company, Inc. is celebrating Manufacturing Day October 2, 2015.
