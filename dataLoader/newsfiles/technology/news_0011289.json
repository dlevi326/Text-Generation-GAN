The project is entitled Multiple bubble propagation modes in elasto-rigid models of airway reopening and is funded by the Leverhulme Trust. Understanding the mechanics of pulmonary airway reopening is fundamental in designing ventilation strategies that minimise damage to the lungs. The mechanical problem is particularly complex because airways change shape in response to internal fluid flows and external forces (bronchoconstriction). Recent breakthroughs indicate that initial (static) airway geometry strongly influences the reopening mode, but the importance of dynamic (fluid load-induced) geometric changes remains unclear. We propose to investigate a novel elasto-rigid system that allows detailed investigation of both static and dynamic geometric variations. Most importantly, the elasto-rigid channel can easily be integrated into network geometries to address the dynamics in the branched pulmonary tree. \nYou should have, or be working towards, a PhD or equivalent in a relevant area of Physics, Applied Mathematics or Engineering. Expertise in fluid and solid mechanics and knowledge of finite element methods and object-oriented scientific computing techniques are essential. Knowledge of free surface flows, instabilities, and of the mechanics of thin-shells is also desirable. You should be capable of working under your own initiative and leading a small research team, so excellent communication and organisational skills are required. \nThe School of Physics and Astronomy is committed to promoting equality and diversity, including the Athena SWAN charter for promoting women’s careers in STEMM subjects (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine) in higher education. The School received a Bronze Award in 2013 for their commitment to the representation of women in the workplace and we particularly welcome applications from women for this post.
