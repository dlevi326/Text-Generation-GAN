The Canon imageSPECTRUM Image Management System software (v5.0) 1 is designed to instantly capture, store, query and display all patient studies from a single database, whether in the exam room next door or across the country, 2 putting concise information at the eyecare professional’s fingertips. \nOne example of how teleretinal technology is being effectively used comes from Canon Consultant, New Jersey-based Director of Applied Vision Research & Ophthalmic Telemedicine at Rutgers University, Dr. Ben Szirth, who recently performed retinal screenings using a combination of Canon Eye Care solutions at the Children with Diabetes Friends for Life conference in Orlando, Florida. Although the children’s eye exams were performed in Orlando, Dr. Szirth was able to remotely transmit data requiring follow-up back to Ophthalmic retinal specialists in his Newark, New Jersey office— more than one thousand miles away, thanks to Canon imageSPECTRUM software. \n“The health of the eye can indicate the health of the body as a whole, and retinal exams can allow physicians to detect early cases of diabetes retinopathy and other diseases. Early screening can often help patients and their healthcare providers prevent conditions from worsening, but not every individual is located within a short distance from a hospital or nearby physician. The cohesive relationship between Canon digital retinal cameras and portability-enhancing software allows me to bring the latest technology to remote communities, and in doing so, I am able to provide patients with more opportunity for early detection, which can lead to prevention,” said Dr. Szirth. \nWhen used as a teleretinal system, imageSPECTRUM software, the CR-2 PLUS AF Non-Mydriatic Retinal camera, RK-F2 Full Auto Ref-Keratometer and TX-20 Fully Automated Tonometer can help provide clinical efficiency with its advanced software modules such as RGB channel separation, side-by-side Color/FAF comparison, Stereo Image, Emboss, AutoMosaic and Advanced Tools. The system is fully DICOM® 3 compliant for increased interoperability, communicates well with most EMR systems, and can safely connect to most third-party legacy instruments 2 across a network. Additionally, imageSPECTRUM software is an excellent communication tool and EMR complement for today’s Meaningful Use, HIPAA regulated and Coordinated Care team environment. \nAttendees will have the opportunity to interact with Eye Care solutions from Canon at Vision Expo West, including: CR-2 PLUS AF Non-Mydriatic Retinal Camera: With the press of a button, users can switch between auto and manual focusing for ultimate control and ease-of-use. The Autocapture function determines the appropriate moment to capture an image by analyzing when exposure and alignment are ideal. CR-2 AF Digital Non-Mydriatic Retinal Camera: The newest addition to the Canon digital non-mydriatic camera lineup delivers stunning, high-resolution, 20.2 megapixel images – the highest resolution available in any digital retinal camera today – with extraordinary detail, contrast, color fidelity and speed. Enhanced from the previous CR-2 Digital Non-Mydriatic Retinal Camera, the new CR-2 AF features contrast enhancement technology never before offered to emphasize the differences in “redness” and “brightness” of blood vessel structures relative to their surroundings. RK-F2 Full Auto Ref-Keratometer: Including a Full Auto Mode which allows professionals to automatically align, focus, and acquire a reading for one eye and continue to the opposite eye to perform the same function – all with one touch of a button. This feature contributes to a comfortable, efficient screening process for the patient. TX-20 Full Auto Tonometer: Designed to be compact and lightweight, the non-contact tonometer is easy to transport and install. With soft air puffs, the TX-20 tonometer easily measures Intraocular Pressure (IOP), enhancing patient comfort and allowing doctors to perform simple eye exams efficiently. \nFor more information about Canon ophthalmic and optometric devices and solutions, please go to www.usa.canon.com/eye-care . \nAbout Canon U.S.A., Inc. \nCanon U.S.A., Inc., is a leading provider of consumer, business-to-business, and industrial digital imaging solutions to the United States and to Latin America and the Caribbean (excluding Mexico) markets.
