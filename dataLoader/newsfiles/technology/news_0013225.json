As a spokesperson for GliderGloves.com noted, the timing for this announcement is perfect; winter is just around the corner, and people are starting to think about how they can keep their hands warm while still using their mobile devices outdoors. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150914/266059 \nThe founders of Glider Gloves know how cumbersome it can be to constantly remove traditional gloves in order to use a smartphone or tablet to text or look something up on the internet. This inspired them to launch their company and offer shoppers the best touch screen gloves money can buy. \nTo ensure that their smartphone gloves are fully responsive, the e-gloves contain copper-based conductive yarn that is woven into the entire glove. This innovative yarn lets the wearer's own electrical current to pass through the touchscreen winter gloves and interact successfully with today's array of handheld electronic devices.

The gloves also include an anti-slip grip feature, which will help keep the smartphone or tablet safe in the palm of the wearer's hand. The gloves are so durable and warm, they can even be used for skiing or snowboarding--this will allow users to check their email while on the chairlift before zipping down the ski slope. \nAs the company spokesperson noted, the Black Winter Touch Screen Gloves for $29.99 are already a huge hit with shoppers; the gloves are extra thick to protect the wearer from the frigid cold, and they are double lined with a soft brushed interior. The comfortable and attractive gloves are made for both kids and adults and let the wearer touch, tap, swipe and pinch their interactive screens with ease. \nTo learn more about the new winter collection of touch screen gloves, people are welcome to visit the Glider Gloves website; there, they can browse through the available products and place an order. \nAbout Glider Gloves: \nGlider Gloves sells the best touch screen friendly gloves in the world.
