Credit Photograph by Eric Risberg/AP That carpeted stretch of real estate beneath our television sets has plummeted in value of late. It was here that, once upon a time, the DVD player would straddle the video-game console, which in turn rubbed up against the digital TV receiver. Recently, however, the television has been trying to break free from these devices and their tethering wires. Most so-called smart TVs now come with Wi-Fi and an onboard gallery of familiar squatter apps. Through these portals, we are able to stream films, watch live music and old television, and, increasingly, play video games without groping and fumbling for the distant connectors around the back of the television. The set-top box is beginning to look like an anachronism. Dust mites rejoice: the occupation is nearly over.\nNot so fast, said Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, at the company’s event on Wednesday . Onstage at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, in San Francisco, the company revealed the latest iteration of its Apple TV, a device that, like its younger, pricier cousin, the Apple Watch, has hitherto struggled to identify the problem to which it offers a solution. Apps may be revolutionizing television, as Cook claimed, but that doesn’t mean that it’s time to discard the box under the box just yet. Apple TV is, he said grandly, a “revolution.” It is, in fact, “the future of television.”\nThis was an overstatement. The Apple TV demonstration débuted with an (admittedly handsome) animated screensaver, of all things—that digital curtain that drops whenever your back is turned, whenever, in fact, you’re not interested in Apple TV. And behind the drape? We saw a host of features that are already familiar to Google Android users: the ability to search and filter films or television shows by director or actor, for example; or to rewind and fast forward via voice control; or to connect to streaming-music services. This was a repositioning as much as a redesign, and certainly it was much less than a revolution. The Apple TV is presenting itself as the next generation of set-top box, a video-game-enabled microconsole that can also play movies and music.\nOn the gaming front, the new device is a cheaper yet capable alternative to the heavyweight machines, Sony’s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One. It comes not with a traditional game controller but with a simple motion-sensing remote, an idea borrowed from Nintendo’s Wii; this will lower the physical hurdle between human and screen, but at the cost of flexibility. The Apple TV also has the advantage of familiarity: it comes preloaded with the App Store, a digital shop that is laden with preëxisting games for iOS, the operating system that is used by iPhones and iPads. Those of us who are already invested in Apple’s ecosystem will have a readymade library. It makes for an attractive proposition, even if, in reality, people tend to play these kinds of games idly, with half an eye on an episode of “The Wire” or “Sherlock.”\nThe disruption that the App Store has caused to the game industry since it launched, seven years ago, is profound. Throughout the nineteen-nineties and early two-thousands, it was prohibitively difficult for an independent game maker to reach a wide audience. In most cases, you would need a license with a major hardware manufacturer such as Sega or Nintendo for permission to legally manufacture cartridges or discs. Apple changed all of that by opening access to its platform. For a seventy-thirty revenue split (in favor of the developer) and a license fee of less than a hundred dollars, anyone could make a game and release it to the world’s waiting phones and tablets. With the Apple TV, the company is trying to repeat that trick in the living room.\nBut the market has changed, or at least become crowded. Sony has been proactive in supporting small independent creators with its PlayStation. Steam, PC gaming’s equivalent to iTunes, now acts as a global storefront for both professional and amateur game makers. It, too, will come to the living room later this year, with the launch of the Steam Box, a video-game-oriented console with which every one of the hundreds of thousands of PC games currently available is compatible. And NVIDIA, one of the world’s leading chip manufacturers, is pioneering a game-streaming service that will likely end up as a smart-TV app, the so-called Netflix for games that so many Silicon Valley companies have been chasing. There are, in other words, already many projects bringing democratized game service to the home.\nAs a move to capture the video-game-playing public’s imagination, Apple TV’s proposition was rather vanilla. As Atsushi Asada, Nintendo’s former executive vice-president, said in 2001, “No matter how good the hardware, it is no good if there is no interesting software.” This is a lesson that Apple should already have learned through experience. The Pippin, its little-remembered attempt to enter the console business, in the mid-nineteen-nineties, disappeared almost without trace, in part because of a lack of notable software.\nWhen it comes to games, Apple certainly has volume. But it has very little that’s exclusive. Unlike Nintendo or Sony, the company doesn’t make its own games to demonstrate the potential of its hardware. On Wednesday, the company showed off a multiplayer version of Crossy Road, the hugely profitable, Australian-made modern riff on the arcade classic Frogger. And there was mention that Guitar Hero, Activision’s forthcoming attempt to reinvigorate the music-game genre, will début simultaneously on Apple TV and the traditional consoles. These are hardly system sellers.\nThe App Store flourished because it was an integral and essential part of the iOS experience. It was the gateway through which you broadened the capabilities of your mobile phone. With a few swipes, it could become a compass or a torch, a radio or a metro guide. In the TV context, the App Store cannot have the same urgency or centrality. Most consumers will feel satisfied once they have downloaded the apps that show them their favorite television shows. And, in the long term, the App Store or something like it will inevitably come installed on the menu screen of every smart TV that rolls off the production line. The set-top box will become redundant. It is in this way alone that Apple TV will participate in “the future of television.”\nOn Wednesday, I asked Siri, Apple’s human-voiced algorithmic assistant, “Why do we need set-top boxes?”\n“I don’t know,” she replied, with unexpected candor. “Frankly, I’ve wondered that myself.”\n“Will we need set-top boxes in the future?” I asked.\n“Interesting question, Simon,” Siri said. We left it there.\nWatch: How Aaron Chase, a professional mountain biker, films his daredevil feats.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:24:23.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
