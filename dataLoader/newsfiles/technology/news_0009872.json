The Acer Predator 15 and 17 lines have been designed with gamers in mind, including some advanced connectivity and cooling, along with built-in audio with Dolby surround sound. \nThe new Predator line will be sold in 15.6-inch and 17-inch screen models, with options for either Full HD or 4K (3,840 x 2,160) Ultra HD panels. \nAcer's Predator notebook PCs help players keep the visuals dialed up with up to an NVIDIA GeForce GTX980M graphics card, 64 GB of DDR4 memory and a 6th Gen Intel Core i7-6700HQ processor. The laptops run Windows 10 and will come equipped with up to a 512 GB solid state drive (SSD). \nBoth the 15-inch and 17-inch models are able to support up to three displays in total, providing more immersive gaming or enhanced multi-tasking. \nAcer also threw in an online-gaming enhancement feature called Killer DoubleShot Pro, which is aimed at letting Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections work in concert. Along with the Killer Network Manager, which evaluates and determines which programs should run on each connection, users can play online with less worry about background apps interrupting the flow of visuals or game data. \nTo help maintain the Predator notebooks' longevity, Acer also implemented enhanced cooling and dust protection systems. Users can optionally remove the notebook's optical disc drive and swap in a special Cooler Master fan module. Each notebook also has speed-adjustable fans with reverse rotation to help avoid dust build-up. \nThe notebooks also have built-in speakers that support Dolby Audio surround sound. The company says the Predator 17 line delivers 12 watts (W) of sound via four speakers and two subwoofers; the Predator 15 models has half that amount with one pair of speakers and a single subwoofer, capable of a total output of 6 W. And for those who want a little more privacy, the Acer notebooks support headphones up to 600 Ohms of impedance (studio quality). \nThe Acer Predator 15 and Predator 17 notebook lines will be available for North America and EMEA sometime this November. Prices for the Predator 15 and Predator 17 notebooks will start at US$1,499.99 and $1,599.99, respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T23:27:06.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
