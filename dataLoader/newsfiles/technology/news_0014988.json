(Photo courtesy of the Japanese Ministry of Defense)\nAmid domestic resistance to new security legislation introduced by the government of Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, which would allow the country the right to collective self-defense, the administration has been playing up the China threat in the East China Sea, according to Wen Wei Po, the Chinese government’s mouthpiece in Hong Kong.\nThe article cited a Sept. 15 article in Tokyo-based Kyodo News which stated that Japan’s foreign office had lodged protests with China over resource development in the East China Sea, as well as posting photographs of all 16 of China’s facilities on the foreign office website.\nShanghai-based New Outlook cited Kyodo News as stating that the Japanese foreign ministry believes that four of the 16 oil platforms that China has built on its side of the boundary line between Japanese and Chinese maritime territory as asserted by Japan — though not recognized by China — are currently in operation and have expressed dismay that the Chinese side is exploiting resources in the “undefined waters” near the boundary.\nJapan has lodged complaints with the Chinese ambassador to the country and demanded that Beijing adhere to the 2008 Japan-China Agreement on Cooperation for the Development of East China Sea Resources and instigate negotiations.\nThe foreign ministry posted a link to the photos on its main page and stated that the four new facilities were constructed after June 2013. The photos suggest they are newly constructed facilities used for drilling for natural gas. The other 12 facilities are all still in the construction phase.\nIn recent months, the Abe administration has attempted on several occasions to ramp up tensions over East China Sea resources, according to Wen Wei Po. In July, Japan made photographs of facilities around China’s oil and gas fields in the region public and demanded that China halt activities there, but clearly China hasn’t heeded the calls, according to the website.\nJapan’s Jiji Press published a report on Aug. 6 stating that Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi met with his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida in Kuala Lumpur on that day for talks. During the talks, Kishida demanded that China cease “unilateral exploitation” of oil and gas fields and expressed concerns over current trends in the South China Sea, where Beijing has territorial disputes with several other countries.\nThe Chinese foreign ministry had previously issued a statement on the facilities, stating that they were in Chinese maritime territory and that China had the right to exploit resources there. Wen Wei Po called Japan’s response unconstructive in building relations between the two countries. China said it would continue to communicate with Japan over issues in the East China Sea.\nReferences:\nWang Yi????\nSource Get a briefing & SMS alert service of maritime issues which really matter!", "external_links": ["http://Asia.us2.list-manage1.com/subscribe/post?u=8b0255d591085d1f5c2356475&id=6d9617d27d"], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:08:29.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
