Today, the two companies announce that they are expanding with overnight service in Chicagoland and a five-state Midwest region (120-mile radius from Chicago) in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio serving 25 million people. \nClick to Tweet \n“Our same-day and overnight services, combined with the buy online in-store pickup option made available at all PetSmart stores nationwide in the fall of 2014, offer delivery options for pet parents when and where they want to shop for their various pet food and related pet-supply needs,” said Eran Cohen, executive vice president of customer experience, PetSmart, Inc. “Our on-demand store-to-door delivery gives pet parents the comfort that PetSmart can deliver on their immediate needs to keep their beloved pets happy and healthy – even at a moment’s notice.” \nFor both same-day and overnight service options, shoppers can purchase items for store-to-door delivery via the PetSmart-branded store on the Google Express website or the Google Express mobile apps for Android and iOS. Nearly all items available in PetSmart stores can be purchased and delivered through both services, giving pet parents expanded delivery options to meet their more immediate needs. \nGoogle Express membership is $95/year with benefits including unlimited free delivery on eligible orders and the ability to share the membership with a household member. Non-members can also enjoy Google Express benefits by paying a $4.99 per store-to-door delivery fee on orders totaling $15 or more per store with a $3 small-order fee for orders under $15. \nGoogle Express brings the speed of the web to shopping by helping people shop their favorite stores online — in a single place. When customers can’t make it into their local PetSmart store, the same-day and overnight services makes it easy for customers to order the items they need via mobile or desktop devices with on-demand delivery directly to their homes. \nAbout PetSmart® \nPetSmart, Inc. is the largest specialty pet retailer of services and solutions for the lifetime needs of pets.
