September 28, 2015 ST. LOUIS, Mo. — June Van Klaveren, owner of Compelling Communications , announced that the second edition of her book, “The Edge Up,” has been published and is available as a Kindle book on Amazon . The book is FREE on Oct. 1 only, in recognition of National Customer Service week (Oct. 5-9). “The Edge Up” explains to small businesses how to get the “edge up” on their competition with great customer service. From the book, Van Klaveren said, readers will receive a deceptively simple message: “Take good care of your customers and they’ll take good care of you.” The book includes such important topics as The Impact of Customer Service; Customer Service Secrets; Employees, Management and Customer Service; Real Life Customer Service Stories and Lessons; Conflicts and How to Handle Them; and Customer Service Techniques. Van Klaveren suggests that companies make the week of October 5-9 a special week in their organization by boosting morale, motivation and teamwork; rewarding frontline customer service reps; raising company-wide awareness of the importance of customer service; thanking customer service employees; and letting customers know about your commitment to customer satisfaction. “The Edge Up” can be ordered from Amazon.com in a Kindle book and it also can be read on your tablet or laptop using Amazon’s Kindle app. Group Provides Heat Stress Prevention Tips June 24, 2015 \nThe Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs’ (AFOP) Health & Safety reminds outdoor workers of three simple tips for staying safe in extreme heat: water, rest and shade.
