While hardware can come in many different shapes and sizes, connected hardware—or more specifically a device that provides data on a construction jobsite—can offer big value on a project, saving both time and money. The good news for construction companies is the technology is continuing to advance. Now it is a matter of identifying the best products in the market. This was the impetus for the Constructech Connected Hardware Award, which is designed to recognize a connected product that targets the construction industry.\nLaura Black, editor, Constructech, says, “Construction companies have leveraged software and apps, but now connected hardware is proving it has a place in the industry. We are excited to launch this awards program, as the market is trending toward more connectivity on the jobsite.”\nTechnology companies were invited to submit products for this award, which were judged by a panel. In the inaugural year, there was one product that stood out above the rest, as the fastest growing connected hardware on the market, with exceptional usefulness and uniqueness to the construction industry and good customer use and case studies. With that, the first Constructech Connected Hardware winner is OxBlue Construction Camera from OxBlue Corp.\nPeggy Smedley, editorial director, Constructech, says, “OxBlue Construction Camera is the epitome of a truly connected hardware, offering a turnkey solution to monitor the jobsite. We identified this product as the fastest growing connected hardware on the market, and are eager to see what new hardware will be leading the way in the years ahead.”\nTo nominate for the 2016 Constructech Connected Hardware Award, please complete the survey online: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CommCH16\nFor more information on the 2015 Constructech Connected Hardware Award winner, check out the Sept/Oct issue of Constructech magazine.\nAbout Constructech magazine\nConstructech magazine is where construction and technology converge.
