The company used its own site ratings to compile the celebrity list.\nSearches for Dutch trance DJ van Buuren carry the most risk: users have an almost 18 percent chance of landing on a web page with potential for online threats. Bryan, Usher, Britney Spears and Jay-Z round out the top five. A Katy Perry search carries a nearly 15 percent chance of connecting with a tainted site.\nAlso on this year's list: Amy Schumer , Nina Dobrev , Lorde and Betty White .", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-29T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T07:44:46.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
