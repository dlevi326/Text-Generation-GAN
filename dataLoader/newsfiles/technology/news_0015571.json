The top leadership in Delhi has dropped enough hints in the past few days that it will be Ambika Soni who will head the state party. This has triggered a chain reaction in rival camps headed by Amritsar MP Capt Amarinder Singh and current party chief Partap Singh Bajwa. At least two senior party MLAs from Malwa — both considered close to the Captain — are learnt to have “welcomed” the move to appoint Soni. The two MLAs were quick to clarify that while they respected Soni, they also have a long association with the Captain. There are others as well with similar neither-here-nor-there stand. But this would only indicate they can switch to either side once the central party leadership announces a new chief. At a mass contact rally in Dirba of Sangrur district today, Capt Amarinder clarified his stand saying: “Anyone other than Bajwa will be welcomed as the Punjab Congress chief. With this change in leadership, factionalism in the state unit will be put to rest.” Capt Amarinder had consolidated his position with almost three-fourth of the 43 Congress MLAs in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha siding with him when he launched “Oust Bajwa” tirade earlier this year. It appears the delay in announcement of the new state party chief has meant that several “fence sitters” among the MLAs and other senior party leaders will not reveal their loyalties for now. This is not new in the faction-ridden Congress as many MLAs and senior party leaders had earlier “deserted” Capt Amarinder and shifted their loyalties to Bajwa when he was appointed the state Congress chief in March 2013. Capt Amarinder and his key loyalists are trying to ensure the MLAs and senior party leaders remain united in their choice of the state party president. After the Dirba rally, Capt Amarinder reportedly visited Brahm Mohindra, senior party MLA from Patiala Rural — a move being seen as an effort to keep his men together. He said though reshuffle was the prerogative of the Congress president, the high command was seized of the matter. “The sentiments of the common party workers on the issue have already been conveyed to the party president,” he said. Soni’s appointment will not be acceptable to Capt Amarinder, who has reportedly conveyed to the party high command that he would not settle for anything less than completely taking over the reins of the party. His loyalists point out that in a series of discussions held after his meeting with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, he has conveyed to his loyalists his anguish at not being appointed as the party chief, especially after he has conveyed to the party top brass that the only way to rejuvenate the party would be to let him handle the party, as he enjoys support of both party leaders and party workers. Meanwhile, Soni may be successful in uniting faction-ridden Congress leaders, but getting mass support may not be easy for her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T02:10:08.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
