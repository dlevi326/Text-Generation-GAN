This will lead to websites that load faster and it also offers lower latency.\" \nThanks to the distributed DDoS protection, the colocation services in Los Angeles and Dallas ensure that DDoS attacks are distributed to ensure that their clients' internet services stay online. \nIn addition, when clients colocate in Los Angeles and Dallas, the content is protected against natural disasters and network failures. For example, if the Los Angeles datacenter is affected by an earthquake or other disaster, the Dallas datacenter will continue to server data and keep services online. \nAs the company spokesperson explained, with the addition of the Ashburn datacenter scheduled for November, Psychz will expand their Anycast feature, along with the better protection against DDoS attacks, natural disasters and network failures. \nEven before the new features were added to Psychz's colocation packages, the company's Los Angeles and Dallas colocation services were already excellent. For example, at the company's datacenter in Los Angeles, the cooling equipment is independently dual-powered, and the fault-tolerant site infrastructure offers electrical power circuit storage and distribution facilities. The Los Angeles datacenter can provide 100-plus gigabit of internet capacity to a meet-me room located at One Wilshire. \n\"The service offers multiple fiber wavelengths and can be used on all major providers, including Hurricane, China Unicom, Tinet, Comcast, PCCW, China Telecom, China Next Generation, Zayo, Telia and more,\" the company spokesperson said. \nAnybody who would like to learn more about Psychz's new colocation package features is welcome to visit their user-friendly website; there, they can read about the newly added services. \nAbout Psychz: \nPsychz has been in the web hosting industry since 2001 and now operates its own infrastructures, networks, and in-house staff.
