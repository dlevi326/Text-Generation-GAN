This dual low-dropout (LDO) regulator has been designed to provide the power and I/O supplies for fingerprint recognition modules used in smart phones, tablet computers and similar consumer electronic products. The device’s low quiescent current and high efficiency under light loads minimizes power consumption in these types of portable battery-operated equipment, while a tiny 1.2mm x 1.2mm footprint package with a height of just 0.4mm saves space. \nA wide 1.7V to 5.25V input voltage range allows the regulator to operate over a full Lithium-ion battery charge/discharge cycle and provides an output voltage between 1.2V and 3.6V in fixed 0.1V steps, accurate to 1.5% over the temperature range -40°C to +85°C. The AP7346 also features a high accuracy current limit of 157mA ±25mA and a low quiescent current of 35μA, which helps extend standby and use times. In addition, an enable input allows the output to be turned off if required. \nThe regulator’s high power supply ripple rejection ratio of 75dB and low noise performance of 60μV RMS makes it particularly attractive in more noise-sensitive audio, video and RF communications applications.
