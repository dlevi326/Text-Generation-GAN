The increased reliance on connected devices has also led to a rise in off-hour and weekend mobile use by on-the-go consumers.\n“We are seeing significant growth of mobile across industries and geographies,” said Dean Weinert, director, mobile products at ThreatMetrix. “Recent data from The Network shows that mobile now makes up one-third of the transactions analyzed by ThreatMetrix each month. As the holiday shopping season nears, mobile will inevitably become a top target for fraudsters looking to cash in on consumers’ digital identities.”\nThe move to mobile is a trend that will continue as more consumers embrace digital commerce and as new players enter the space offering innovative solutions, like Android Pay. Following Android Pay’s launch on September 10, fraudsters will be on the lookout for ways to exploit this new mobile payment system, just as they did shortly after the launch of Apple Pay . Leading up to the biggest shopping season of the year, cybercriminals will be focusing their efforts on accessing mobile wallets through attacks such as targeted malware and NFC hacking for wireless Android payments.\nAccording to the “ ThreatMetrix® Cybercrime Report: Q2 2015 ,” Android has shown strong growth, especially in emerging markets, but iOS devices account for nearly two-thirds of total mobile transactions. Despite Android’s dominance in the market and browser share, iOS generates nearly twice the number of payments, logins, and authentications than all other mobile operating systems combined.\n“Jailbroken devices are more of a concern than the industry previously realized. iOS has always been viewed as a ‘safe harbor’ for mobile operating systems, but the latest mass-scale attack on more than 225,000 Apple accounts calls to light the fact that jailbroken devices pose a real threat to consumers,” said Nick Blievers, director, mobile R&D at ThreatMetrix. “Once a device is jailbroken, malware has free reign.”\nThe risks associated with bypassing security controls, as seen in jailbroken and rooted devices, are amplified when those devices contain payment information and log-in credentials. The prevalence of stolen identities and tools to enable cloaking/spoofing is causing a continued increase in the attacks targeted at mobile devices.\nOrganizations need to define and implement policies regarding the use of jailbroken and rooted devices to access their services. The first step is implementing a detection strategy to fully comprehend the population of hacked devices in their userbase. It is then possible to implement acceptable terms of use and safeguards in mobile apps to govern if these devices can access their services. Another sensible strategy is to offer limited app functionality for jailbroken and rooted devices.\n“Apart from jailbroken devices; businesses are also susceptible to their consumers inadvertently downloading malicious apps”, said Blievers. “There are tens of thousands of malicious apps on the leading app stores that consumers use on a regular basis.”\nThreatMetrix stays up to speed with the latest changes across iOS and Android to continually offer customers the best possible protection in modern mobile operating systems, including malware detection, application integrity evaluation, and jailbreak and root detection. The Network analyzes more than one billion transactions each month and offers the only frictionless cybersecurity solution that combines enhanced mobile identification, location-based authentication, endpoint intelligence, behavior intelligence and real-time trust analytics into a powerful, context-based authentication and fraud prevention solution.\nThreatMetrix Resources\nShare this news on Twitter: .@ThreatMetrix announces spike in mobile volume as mobile wallet usage grows http://goo.gl/Nz27Ln Press Release: ThreatMetrix Announces World’s Largest Digital Identity Network at RSA Conference Press Release: ThreatMetrix Advances Cybercrime Prevention With Extended Mobile App Reputation and Device Analysis eBook: ThreatMetrix Cybercrime Report: Q2 2015 ThreatMetrix Cybercrime Prevention Summit 2015\nAbout ThreatMetrix\nThreatMetrix offers market-leading advanced fraud prevention and frictionless context-based security solutions leveraging a global shared digital identity network and real-time, customer-driven analytics platform.
