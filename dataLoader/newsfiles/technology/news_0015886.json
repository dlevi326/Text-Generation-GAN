Dalian Wanda Group, China's largest commercial property developer, said in June that it raised 5 billion yuan ($784 million) from investors online and that it would continue to raise money from the public.\nBut reports have highlighted some of the risks of the unregulated market. A Beijing court earlier this month ordered a restaurant in the capital to pay a fine of 15,000 yuan for deceiving public investors about its intended use for 700,000 yuan raised online, according to a local media report.\nThe cabinet document give no details about how to address risks but promised that the government would grant easier market access to startups by cutting red tape.\nIt also called for the development of third-party credit rating services and a standardised system for collecting, evaluating and sharing credit information.\nChina's securities regulator said last month that it would soon begin inspecting online equity financing platforms to address risks from illegal activities in online equity financing platforms.\nUnder draft rules drawn up by the Securities Association last year, equity crowdfunding projects must have no more than 200 investors. Investors must have at least 3 million yuan in financial assets or 500,000 yuan in annual average income for the previous three years.\nChina could account for half of the developing world's crowdfunding by 2025, or $50 billion, according to a World Bank forecast.
