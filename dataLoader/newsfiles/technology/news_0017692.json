Amazon’s service is available only in parts of Seattle for now, though the e-commerce giant said that it plans to expand in the city in the coming days.\nIt’s likely other cities will soon get restaurant delivery as well. Amazon often tests in one or more metros at first before expanding broadly.\n The delivery service is live for Prime members, who pay a yearly $99 subscription fee for services such as two-day shipping, streaming videos and music. The company launched Prime Now in Seattle last month, offering (through the Prime Now app) one-hour delivery for $7.99 on selected items, or at no added cost in a few hours.\nItems from restaurants will be driven to a customer’s door from the same Prime Now delivery drivers who deliver other Prime Now products. The drivers are a mix of contractors and full-time employees, Amazon said.\nFor now, a limited number of restaurants are offering delivery through the app, including Skillet Diner, Re:public and Green Leaf Vietnamese Restaurant. Amazon promises there will be no menu markups. The company is taking a commission of each order, though it is not disclosing the percentage.\nAmazon said the service is being offered at no added charge for a limited time in Seattle. Each order must be from a single restaurant.\nThe tech giant’s movement into the market offers big competition for a growing startup founded by Amazon’s own former employees. Peach, a food delivery service launched by Amazon vets, delivers pre-set lunches each day to large office buildings. The startup raised an $8 million round last month from Madrona Venture Group and Vulcan Capital.\nPeach CEO Nishant Singh said not much will change for the company after Amazon’s announcement Tuesday, noting that Amazon already had some restaurant delivery services through Amazon Local.\n“Peach is in the lunch curation business,” Singh said. “We exactly know what a customer sitting in Amazon Ruby building (would) like to eat for lunch on a Tuesday.”\nAmazon may be entering a crowded space, but the company has a clear advantage above other players. It has a loyal following of millions of Prime members that are already accustomed to Amazon’s customer service and can bypass the logistics of signing up for a new service.\nRachel Lerman: rlerman@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter @rachelerman .", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/rachelerman"], "published": "2015-09-08T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T23:50:51.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
