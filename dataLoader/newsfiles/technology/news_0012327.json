RELATED NEW DELHI: Successful startups are moving out of India due to unfriendly regulatory framework for such ventures, according to Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan, who has been devoting a third of his time to the startup ecosystem since leaving the company and is working on spreading the startup culture beyond centres such as Bengaluru and Gurgaon. \"India's rural people have strong execution skills. We want to give them tools that people in cities are familiar with, and take entrepreneurship beyond Gurgaon, Bengaluru and Mumbai,\" Gopalakrishnan, chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) entrepreneurship council told ET. Gopalakrishnan is leading a CII initiative to set up a National Startup Centre that will handhold aspiring rural entrepreneurs through the entire process â€” from business idea generation and raising seed capital to post-incubation mentoring and guidance, be it for business strategy or future fundraising. The startup centre is expected to launch operations in one or two states, whose chief ministers are said to be excited about the prospect, in the next couple of months, but will eventually scale up to build a hub-and-spoke model across the country with a central office coordinating statelevel efforts based on local needs and resources. Gopalakrishnan said the centre will also engage with the states and the Centre to advocate policies for encouraging new enterprises and regulatory reforms needed to prevent an exodus of successful startups. \"Regulation needs to be streamlined due to which there are problems in getting seed capital, and later, valuation issues for startups. As they grow, they move their offices outside India. That's very sad,\" he said. There are issues with crowdfunding too making it difficult for startups to take off, he said. Prime minister Narendra Modi said in his I-Day address last month that the government is looking at enabling startups and each bank branch would back at least one Dalit, tribal or woman entrepreneur. \"We must be number one in startups... Startup India; Stand up India,\" the PM had said. While the government's initiative would open doors for bankrolling startups, Gopalakrishnan said CII's centre could generate business plans for easily replicable local businesses like last-mile logistics and food delivery, and train interested youth in operating the ventures and raising funds. The aim is to provide end-to-end support to entrepreneurs and create businesses that create high employment. \"We want to help youth move from being job seekers to job creators and create an ecosystem of such enterprises in rural areas. You could call it startup villages,\" he said, adding that each startup may need around Rs 2-3 lakh initially. \"Once there is a buy-in for the idea, money will come,\" he said. Gopalakrishnan said in tier-II, tier III cities and rural areas, the Centre can create business plans for various types of businesses, make them available to budding entrepreneurs, train them and work with the government and investors to organize seed funding. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=National Startup Centre,Narendra Modi,Kris Gopalakrishnan,Infosys  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:29:03.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
