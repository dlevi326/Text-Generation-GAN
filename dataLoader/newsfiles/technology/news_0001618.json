For those looking to go a step further, TrueCrypt offered full-disk encryption... at least it did until it was abandoned by its developers. Since the software was dropped, researchers have discovered that it contains numerous security vulnerabilities, and two new flaws have been found that allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges. As part of Google's Project Zero, security researchers have been probing the encryption software -- which is still widely used -- for additional problems. The severity of the newly-discovered problems has led to renewed calls for remaining… [Continue Reading] »", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsserve.net/i/20150930/895-If-you-re-still-using-TrueCrypt-more-security.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T15:14:35.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
