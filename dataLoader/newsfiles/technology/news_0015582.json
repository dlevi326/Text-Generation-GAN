Its newly empowered Apple Watch can monitor a baby's heartbeat and send it to the doctor. And Siri is moving into the living room. \nIn a two-hour extravaganza, Apple on Wednesday unveiled a veritable bounty of new and at times mind-boggling products, including two new iPhones and a new larger iPad Pro, that should keep every fanboy busy for months. \nGrabbing top billing amid a chorus line of shimmering new designs and powerful technologies was the souped-up and Siri-controlled Apple TV, which CEO Tim Cook unveiled with a rousing set-up reminiscent of the stagecraft of the guy whose job he took, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.

(Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) ( Karl Mondon ) \n\"TV plays a huge role in our lives and an important place in our homes, but the TV experience hasn't changed that much in decades,\" Cook said, slowly warming up the crowd of 7,000 analysts, journalists, employees and guests. \"It's been virtually standing still while innovation has been thriving in the mobile space. Today, we are going to do something about that.\" \nAnd here's what they suggested: \"Our vision for TV is simple and perhaps a little provocative,\" Cook said. \"We believe the future of TV is apps.\" \nNew apps to watch HBO and Showtime. Apps to instantly see the best play in that Giants game. Apps to shop for clothes from that fashion-show dressing room on your TV screen. And apps to book an Airbnb room or buy a house on Zillow.

There's the new larger iPad Pro, which Cook called \"the clearest expression of our vision of the future of personal computing.\" There's the two new iPhone models, the 6S and 6S Plus, both featuring new 3D Touch that allows user to push the screen harder or softer to pull up different layers of information and detail. And there's the new Apple Watch models, gussied up with striking new bands and cases and now carrying more than 10,000 apps designed specifically for the wrist-bound device. \nYet it was the new Apple TV, introduced by Eddy Cue, Apple's head of Internet software and services, that stole the show. After years of hinting about the promising future of Apple TV, Apple has finally begun to deliver the goods. The new and improved remote control aloneis worth the price of admission, with a new user interface that turns the remote into a magic wand that can scan through movies, pull up background data and control video games. Rounding it out is the new and improved Siri, which brilliantly can call up obscure TV shows and helps the user pick out movies to watch -- \"What are some new comedies that would be good to watch with the kids?\" -- or find that one \"Seinfeld\" episode with the Ed Norton cameo. \n\"The new user interface brings the same touch-screen experience of the iPhone to your television,\" Cue said. \nWhile Apple traditionally unveils its new products at smaller venues, such as the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, Wednesday's event took place at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, a larger concert hall that can hold 7,000 people. Built in 1915 as part of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, the auditorium's selection as the site for Apple's latest announcement had the rumor mill running even hotter than it normally does. \nWhile Apple tried to build more and more buzz, much of the news had already either been leaked or was so obvious that it wasn't really a surprise. That included widespread expectations of a new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6 Plus S, the introduction to the iPhone of Force Touch technology, which can differentiate between various types of finger pressure, as well as a souped-up Apple TV. \nJosiah Humphrey, co-founder and co-CEO of Appster, a San Francisco-based app developer company, said the developer crowd was especially excited by the news about 3D Touch technology and \"we're excited to see how Apple will incorporate the technology into the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. \n\"The display technology may pose a pretty big challenge for developers, as they'll have to find creative ways to incorporate the technology into their apps without disrupting controls, menus and other triggers,\" Humphrey added. \"Developers will have to listen closely to user feedback as the Force Touch rolls out, and act accordingly. If done correctly, one touch could replace three, and triple the productivity rate within applications.\" \nEven though Apple managed to wow the crowd with one new feature after another, some analysts wondered whether the lack of a new blockbuster product could mean the company's successes in recent years are slowing. John Jackson with ICD said that \"while there were a lot of good things to take away from the event, there were no real surprises. As an investor, you're looking at the iPhone, which powers three-quarters of their business, and everything else that isn't the iPhone, to see if there's a there there and perhaps a new category poised to pick up the mantle. \n\"What they announced today was not the iPhone 7, but a 6 derivative,\" Jackson said. \"And while it has some fantastic user-centric touches, thoughtful touches alone don't move the needle the way it needs to move.\" \nApple shares fell nearly 2 percent Wednesday, along with the rest of the market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T01:54:47.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
