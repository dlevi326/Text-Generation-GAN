Getty Images by Lex Apple is cursed with making the world's most successful item of consumer electronics.\nThe iPhone has sold 220 million units at $US650 apiece over the past year. Nice trick; how on earth to repeat it?\nIt will not be easy. Assume the iPhone replacement cycle is two years, that a cheery 95 per cent of buyers from two years ago recommit to the brand, and that prices are steady. For Apple to hit analysts' revenue growth targets over the next 12 months, it must sell something like 80 million iPhones to first-time customers. That is the population of Germany. This model is crude; it ignores how product releases delay demand (or pull it forward), but it points to the scale of the challenge.\nThis, naturally, makes investors nervous. So does the fact that trends shift rapidly in handsets. BlackBerry's hardware revenues peaked at $US16 billion in 2012 and fell to $US7 billion two years later. So shareholders will be watching closely on Wednesday, when Apple is expected to unveil the latest iteration of the iPhone.\nAt this point in the cycle Apple usually makes improvements rather than a brand new handset. It is placing bets on other devices, too, including the watch and a TV box, and experimenting with cars. But it needs to keep expanding iPhone sales in order to keep its share price up.\nThe meat of recent iPhone growth has come from China. When, in 2011, Apple started splitting out results for \"Greater China\", revenues were 9 per cent of the whole. Now they are well over 20 per cent and climbing.\nYet there are other big markets. Buried invisibly within the \"Europe\" line on Apple's results is India, a market of more than 1 billion people.\nIn China, the iPhone accounted for 13.5 per cent of smartphone sales in the first half of the year, according to Gartner. The corresponding statistic in India is 1.8 per cent. Indians favour Samsung and homegrown brands such as Micromax. Persuading more of them to switch would give Apple a bit more diversity to soothe the worrywarts.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:33:36.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
