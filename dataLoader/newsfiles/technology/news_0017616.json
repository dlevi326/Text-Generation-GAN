The spacecraft's next destination is an object called 2014 MU69 or PT 1. (Steve Gribben/Southwest Research Institute/Johns Hopkins University /NASA) Related Stories NASA news release (Note: CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) \nA spacecraft that made a historic flyby of Pluto in July has a new destination — an icy rock that may reveal what the outer solar system was like shortly after it formed 4.6 billion years ago. \nNASA's New Horizons spacecraft's next target is 2014 MU69 and nicknamed PT 1 or \"potential target 1,\" the U.S. space agency announced Friday afternoon. The mysterious icy object is less than 45 kilometres across — a tiny fraction of the size of Pluto, which is 2,370 kilometres wide. PT 1 is 1.6 billion kilometres farther away than Pluto, which was itself 4.7 billion kilometres from Earth when the spacecraft flew by. \nBeyond Pluto, New Horizons hopes to hit another Kuiper Belt destination \nBoth Pluto and PT 1 are in an outer region of the solar system known as the Kuiper Belt, which contains thousands of icy objects, some very small and others that are large enough to be considered dwarf planets, such as Pluto. 2019 arrival \nNew Horizons will begin changing direction to target PT 1 in late October or early November and is expected to arrive on New Year's Day 2019. If all goes well, it will take measurements and detailed images of a type of celestial object that has never been seen before. \n\"There's so much that we can learn from close-up spacecraft observations that we'll never learn from Earth, as the Pluto flyby demonstrated so spectacularly,\" said New Horizons science team member John Spencer of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., in a statement. \"The detailed images and other data that New Horizons could obtain from a KBO flyby will revolutionize our understanding of the Kuiper Belt and KBOs.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T01:37:21.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
