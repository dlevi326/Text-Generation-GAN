Analytics using multiple data sources and structures has become the norm, and businesses are challenged to tap into their data assets without incurring significant engineering and infrastructure costs. Zoomdata 2.0 is the first business intelligence solution that enables hybrid cloud on-prem deployments, delivering maximum flexibility. \nTo support this new \"Analytics Anywhere\" requirement, Zoomdata has addressed the difficult challenge of delivering analytics as services that can literally be deployed anywhere: Enabling Cloud Deployments -- Through a series of joint development initiatives, Zoomdata has expanded the number of ways that Zoomdata can be deployed to major cloud offerings. Joining Zoomdata's public cloud partnerships on ClouderaLive on AWS , in the Databricks Cloud , and with Cisco to deliver Zoomdata on an Apache Mesos-based containerized architecture for Cisco Intercloud, today Zoomdata is announcing availability on Microsoft Azure which includes support for, HDInsights and Cloudera. Bringing Speed to Big Data Analytics -- Zoomdata has developed patented data-sharpening and micro-query technologies to address the speed requirements for modern analytics. Where the most popular desktop BI tools impose unacceptable load and processing times for large queries, Zoomdata gives users sub-second response time on queries of even billions of rows of data. As organizations increasingly move their big data workloads to the cloud, Zoomdata AnyCloud delivers this level of analytic performance across the broadest range of cloud platforms. Data Fusion -- With Zoomdata Fusion, businesses can virtually join and analyze data across an increasing variety of data stores. Zoomdata's patented smart connectors can combine and analyze data from multiple sources without moving or copying the data from the original sources. For example, users can leverage Fusion to virtually join transactional Big Data with customer or other dimensional data stored in a traditional relational database or data warehouse, to calculate metrics combining a new Big Data source with metrics from your existing enterprise data warehouse, or to correlate real-time data feeds with historical data across backend platforms.
