In the past year, 100 million people in India started using the Internet for the first time,\" Google's India-born CEO Sundar Pichai said in a blog post yesterday after his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nThis means there are now more Internet users in India than in every country in the world aside from China. But what's really astounding is the fact that there are still nearly one billion people in India who aren't online, he noted.\nPichai said Google would like to help get these next billion Indians online so they can access the entire web and all of its information and opportunity. \"That's why, today, on the occasion of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to our US headquarters, and in line with his Digital India initiative, we announced a new project to provide high-speed public Wi-Fi in 400 train stations across India,\" he said. Working with Indian Railways, which operates one of the world's largest railway networks, and RailTel, which provides Internet services as RailWire via its extensive fiber network along many of these railway lines, Google's Access & Energy team plans to bring the first stations online in the coming months.\nThe network will expand quickly to cover 100 of the busiest stations in India before the end of 2016, with the remaining stations following in quick succession, he announced. Pichai said even with just the first 100 stations online, this project will make Wi-Fi available for the more than 10 million people who pass through every day.\n\"This will rank it as the largest public Wi-Fi project in India, and among the largest in the world, by number of potential users,\" he said.\n\"It will also be fast many times faster than what most people in India have access to today, allowing travelers to stream a high definition video while they're waiting, research their destination, or download some videos, a book or a new game for the journey ahead,\" the Google CEO said. \"Best of all, the service will be free to start, with the long-term goal of making it self-sustainable to allow for expansion to more stations and other places, with RailTel and more partners, in the future,\" he said.\n technology latest google Sundar Pichai Also Read Jaguar to cut prices on three models in response to China's auto probe Google Hangouts has a new version Google acknowledges 11 accidents with its self-driving cars More than 30,000 people to lose their jobs from Barclays", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150928/technology-latest/article/google-set-wi-fi-400-indian-railway-stations-india", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Google_0_0_0_0_0_2_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Google_0_0_0_0_0_2_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T07:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:13:43.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
