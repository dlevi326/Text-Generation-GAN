Pallante’s opinion dated Sept. 18 was e-mailed Monday by the rate-setting Copyright Royalty Board.\nTaylor Swift performs in The 1989 World Tour at Ziggo Dome on June 21, 2015 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Beat 1 is an Internet radio station from Apple that began broadcasting on June 30. Apple via The New York Times Multimedia Sure, Apple Music has Taylor Swift, but it’s not perfect Pallante’s opinion reduces the chances that Pandora would suffer a “devastating loss,” Matthew Schettenhelm, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a note. The opinion lets Pandora offer a pricing model lower than those offered by SoundExchange, the nonprofit that collects digital performance royalties and distributes them to artists, he said.\nPandora jumped 5.7 percent to $20.83 at 4:15 p.m. in New York after rising to $22.60 for the biggest intraday increase in almost a year. Through Friday, the shares were up 10 percent this year.\nPandora, the largest Internet radio service with more than 79 million listeners, has struggled to turn a profit in its 10 years of operation, due largely due to the cost of licensing music from record labels and publishers. Content costs represented 46 percent of the revenue in the second quarter.\nThe company is trying to grab advertisers from traditional terrestrial radio while it faces pressure from Web rivals Spotify Ltd. and Apple Inc. It’s also been battling record labels and other rights holders over how much it pays to play music.\nPallante agreed with Pandora that judges can consider its deal with Merlin, a global rights agency that represents more than 20,000 independent music labels and distributors. Pandora says those rates are reasonable and should be a benchmark. SoundExchange had argued the judges shouldn’t take into account the Merlin deal.\n“We are pleased that the Copyright Office affirmed the admissibility of Pandora’s agreement with Merlin as a valid benchmark,” said Dave Grimaldi, director of public affairs for Pandora. “We look forward to the certainty that December’s decision will bring.”\nPallante’s decision is “a significant, positive catalyst for Pandora,” said Thomas Claps, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group LLP. The Copyright Royalty Board will reach its decision around Dec. 17, Claps wrote in a note to investors.\nCurrent copyright royalty formulas rest on a legal framework that dates back to the early part of last century, and “the time is ripe to question the existing paradigm,” Pallante said in a February report on “Copyright and the Music Marketplace.”\nPandora’s position on the role to be played previous agreements was shared by IHeart Media Inc. and the National Association of Broadcasters, Pallante wrote in her Sept. 18 opinion.\n More Related to this Story Strong U.S. auto sales lift Sirius XM’s revenue\nSpotify value tops $8-billion as investors bet on streaming\nNew Apple features a familiar game of catch-up to competitors\nComments A A", "external_links": ["http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/104/report-on-business/article25210426.ece/ALTERNATES/w140/web-applemusic-0630.jpg", "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/b5d/report-on-business/article25066985.ece/ALTERNATES/w140/folio-streaming22nw2.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-22T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:07:41.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
