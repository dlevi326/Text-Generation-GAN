Run by the National Association of Professional Services, some 425 attendees are expected to attend this year's event, which will give attendees an opportunity to learn best practices and understand how to improve their businesses through case studies, while expanding their professional network. At this year’s NAPS Annual Conference, Gordon Burnes, the CMO of cloud-based CRM provider Bullhorn , will lead a lunch and learn session titled “Engaging to Win: Customers, Talent and Employees.” As technology, mobile devices, and social media develop into increasingly vital components for communicating with applicants, clients, and colleagues, the job of staffing and recruiting agencies is growing more and more complex. These technologies, which were intended to facilitate communication, can end up burdening it instead. The solutions for managing communications across various platforms and roles within the organization can bring just as much complexity as the technologies themselves – they often require cumbersome IT infrastructure, involve outdated and productivity-reducing user interfaces, are difficult to use on mobile devices (on which candidates and sales reps rely), and their adoption can be disruptive to employee workflows. In this session, Gordon will discuss the technological and social barriers to effective communication both internally and externally, and best practices for overcoming them and driving business growth. He will highlight real world case studies of staffing firms that have done this effectively. \nAbout Bullhorn \nBullhorn provides cloud-based CRM solutions for companies in business services industries.
