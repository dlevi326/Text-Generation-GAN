Globys , the leading innovator in contextual marketing, today announced a major release of its Amplero solution. Now marketers can achieve 300% better churn prediction accuracy and up to 400% better retention marketing than when using traditional modeling techniques. Integrated into Amplero's closed-loop performance marketing system is a new approach to churn modeling that provides marketers the ability to more accurately predict at-risk customers within a window of time that allows for deliberate action. As a result, marketers achieve a significant lift in retention impact.  \"With traditional tools, marketers usually get a churn explanation – why the customer left – rather than a true and actionable prediction of churn risk,\" said Dr. Olly Downs , chief scientist and CTO at Globys.  \"With a modeling approach that's based on customers' behavioral sequences, Amplero provides marketers with the opportunity to interact with and influence customers through personalized retention efforts that are based on highly accurate churn prediction that's within a window of actual actionability.  For any subscription-based business focused on retaining customers and boosting overall customer lifetime value, the impact of this technique in enabling a sustainable retention capability is significant.\"\nThe problem with traditional churn models \nThe issue with the traditional approach to churn modeling is that meaningful signals that indicate customers may leave are frequently lost. Currently, most retention models rate customers with a \"churn score\" that depends on a highly manual and time-intensive process during which analysts create aggregate attributes in a data warehouse and test their impact in improving the lift of a static churn model.  The process can take several months, from analyzing customer behavior through deploying retention marketing tactics.  And since marketers typically update customer churn scores on an infrequent e.g., monthly basis, rapidly emerging customer signals are not taken into account and retention marketing is often too late to influence the customer.  \nWhat Amplero's churn modeling means to marketers \nUnlike traditional churn modeling techniques, Amplero monitors sequences of customer behavior on a dynamic basis, automatically discovering which customer actions are meaningful. This means that a marketer is no longer reliant on a single, monthly score indicating whether a customer is at risk of leaving the company. Instead, the dynamic behavior of each individual customer is analyzed on a continuous basis.  The results of the time-based modeling are constantly fed into Amplero's closed-loop marketing platform which then uses machine learning to discover and execute optimal retention marketing actions on a per-customer and contextual basis.  \nAll of this happens automatically. The frequent scoring of customers and retraining of the model results in always-current churn scores that dynamically update with new data.  In addition, the volume and variety of data explored by Amplero allows for the detection of personalized patterns around purchases, consumption, and other engagement signals and automated discovery of granular, non-obvious signals at massive scale. \nWhat this means for marketers is more accurate churn prediction, and ultimately more relevant and timely context-based marketing actions that are continuously optimized against long-term performance indicators.  The right messages reach the right customers at the right time. As a result, marketers experience dramatically improved retention rates, and customers experience more value in continuing an ongoing relationship with their brand of choice.\nFor more information on Amplero or to request a demo, please visit http://amplero.com/ .
