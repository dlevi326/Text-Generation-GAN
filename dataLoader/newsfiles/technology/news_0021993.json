Published on : Tuesday, September 1, 2015\nThe World Congress of the International Measurement Confederation (IMEKO) returns to Prague after 28 years. This time it will be held in the Prague Congress Centre from the 30th of August until the 4th of September. It is expected to host more than 1000 metrologists, scientists who study weights and measures. Among others they are working on a new method for measuring kilograms.\nThe International Measurement Confederation was founded in 1958, and it is a non-governmental federation of about 40 member organizations individually concerned with the advancement of measurement science.\nThe IMEKO congress is organized by the Czech National Committee IMEKO with cooperation of Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Czech Association of Scientific and Technical Societies. After long-term cooperation with the Czech Technical University in Prague, the C-IN company was appointed as the official organisational agency.\nThis year, the motto is “Measurement in Research and Industry” to highlight the practical and immediate applicability of scientific achievements in measurement. Measurement science is also quite interdisciplinary and requires a wide variety of knowledge, therefore, interpersonal contacts and team collaborations are essential for successful development.\nThe technical programme is organized in five plenary sections and 24 technical sessions. A total of 413 oral and poster contributions which have been submitted by authors from 47 countries will be presented.Prof. Jaromír Volf, the General Chairman of IMEKO 2015, on the highlights of the scientific programme: „I would recommend to dedicate attention to the plenary lecture led by Prof. Frank Härtig, Dr. Dan Mihai Stefanescu, and Dr. Philippe Richard “The SI quantities and units a universal language bridging over the 24 IMEKO Technical Committees. It is interesting because the ongoing activities of top metrology institutions are leading to a new definition of SI quantities and units.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T10:20:33.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
