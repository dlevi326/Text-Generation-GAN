Popular tactics include e-mails from individuals in your address book that include links or download.\n\"People trust the link and click, and their software gets infected with malware. The criminal can then take over their machine. Now people on that (affected) person’s contact list will be exposed to the criminal as well,\" says Sabric GM of the Information Hub Susan Potgieter.\nThe two were speaking at the Consumer Goods Council Summit held in Johannesburg on Friday.\nCybercrime is a growing concern as more South Africans are getting internet connectivity and transacting online.\nSouth Africa had 2.4-million internet users in 2000, and 24.9-million last year, according to Internet World Stats. The country had 51.5% web penetration.\nA PricewaterhouseCoopers consumer survey — titled Total Retail: Retailers and the Age of Disruption — reported that the value of online retail spend in the country had grown to as much as R5.3bn last year, although this figure made up 1% of total retail sales in the country.\nOf the R5.3bn, R1bn was lost to cybercrime, according to Department of Justice and Constitutional Development estimates.\nLast month the department released a draft CyberCrimes and Cybersecurity Bill for public comment.\nThe draft bill deals with the use of the internet for terrorist purposes, criminalises computer hacking and the unlawful acquisition of confidential data, and makes the unlawful interception of data a criminal offence.\nIt also deals with \"malware\" such as viruses, worms, logic bombs and Trojan horses, making it a criminal offence to create, obtain, sell, purchase or use it.\nCurrent legislation makes it difficult to prosecute cyber criminals.\nSouth Africans have until November 30 to submit comments on the bill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:58:27.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
