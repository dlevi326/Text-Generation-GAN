Leon ruled in 2013 that the mass collection of phone records is likely unconstitutional. \nCongress approved a measure in June that phases out the Patriot Act and replaces it with one in which phone companies retain the records and allow the government to search them with a warrant. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
