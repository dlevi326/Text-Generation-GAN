According to Dr. Hamilton, “the move to ICD-10 meant upgrades to the EHR system to ensure our practices could smoothly and successfully transition. It was a short leap to recognize the billing challenges ICD-10 would unleash and the need for specialized billing services with OB/GYN and ICD-10 Certified coders.” The service is clinically-driven – a unique feature that integrates billing with the clinical system to improve documentation and coding leading to optimal reimbursement. Add to that a billing and coding team with specialization in OB/GYN and the value is unparalleled. digiChart added Medical Billing in May to implement practices who wanted the additional services before the October 1 ICD-10 deadline.\nIn the midst of ICD-10, CMS has identified OB/GYN as one of the first specialties to be moved from traditional fee-for-service to value- based payments early in 2016. This will require providers to deliver care according to specific guidelines in order to receive maximum payment. Additionally, there will be new reporting and quality requirements. “This new payment system will require physicians to manage the care of their patients beyond the office setting, says Sustin Anderson, Vice President, Strategy and Analytics for digiChart. Physicians will have to know more about their patients and outcomes for reporting. Additionally, identifying key performance metrics and continuously measuring and monitoring their performance will be vital to ensuring their continued success.”\ndigiChart has developed a practice scorecard using publicly available data combined with the data it is able to aggregate from its national network of OB/GYN providers. This analytics tool allows practices to continuously monitor and improve clinical, financial, and operational performance. Practices can set their own goals, or measure their success against peers in the area or even against national benchmarks.\n“Our overall goal with this expansion of tools and services is to provide OB/GYN practices with comprehensive resources and knowledge to manage their whole practice,” explains Dr. Hamilton. “The combination of specialty-focused EHR, medical billing, and the analytics we can derive from those systems means physicians can now know how their practice is performing, act quickly to adjust the way they do things, and see improvements that strengthen their overall practice performance.”\nAbout digiChart\ndigiChart delivers tools, services and knowledge to OB/GYN practices helping providers manage the whole practice.
