Picture: PUXLEY MAKGATHO Related articles Radebe to head commission tasked with driving development plan Treasury’s Jobs Fund aims for more agriculture sector jobs ON THE MONEY: NDP set for welcome renaissance In this article Topics: National Development Plan People: Jeff Radebe MINISTER in the Presidency Jeff Radebe on Friday claimed that the government was making \"steady progress\" in the implementation of the National Development Plan (NDP), despite the tough conditions resulting from the global economic crisis.\nBriefing the media on this progress on Friday, Mr Radebe said the global crisis had promoted a deceleration in the economic growth rate and this was coupled with the continuing underperformance of the domestic economy, which had prompted the government to lower its own gross domestic product expectations.\n\"Besides low global demand, significantly low commodity prices and the global steel oversupply, our economy is facing several other challenges including decades of underinvestment in economic infrastructure; an exchange rate that tends to be too volatile; rising administered costs; high port and freight charges, with port charges among the highest in the world; too fast and (too) deep trade liberalisation; and electricity supply challenges, among others,\" he said.\nHe said the Department of Monitoring and Evaluation’s latest quarterly progress reports were a \"mixed bag\" of both successes and challenges.\n\"In the areas of education and skills development, the government is on course to achieve most of the targets set out in the medium-term strategic framework.\n\"However, as widely reported in the media, the writing of the annual national assessment (ANA) exams has been postponed ... Basic education remains a priority area of focus. ANA is critical for diagnosis and measuring the literacy and numeracy of learners, addressing identified weaknesses and ensuring that we lay a good foundation for our children’s education.\n\"Government and labour are committed to strengthening ANA and teacher development,\" Mr Radebe said.\nHe claimed good progress in the provision of healthcare, including the scaling up of interventions to combat new HIV infections and increased access to anti-retroviral treatment.\n\"In rural development and land reform, progress on land acquisition for small-holders has been slow, and on utilisation of newly allocated farms and communal land for production.\n\"There are indications that this is partly due to inadequate support services, prevailing drought conditions and the use of fallow communal land for livestock grazing purposes,\" he said.\nMr Radebe said progress was being made with regard to the reduction of overall levels of serious crime.\nNotable successes included achieving 67.3% of case dockets for contact crimes that are ready for trial against a target of 65%.\nConviction rates for sexual offences stood at 71.1% against a target of 68%, while the conviction rate for trio crimes (house robbery, car-jacking, business robbery) was at 85%.\n© BDlive 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:35:20.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
