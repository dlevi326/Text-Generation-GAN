The back and forth of the email process is just not cutting it with your busy schedule, so why not rely on an artificially intelligent assistant that can do the job for you, effectively and efficiently? Genee and Toi launched an app called Genee , a scheduling platform that will find the best meeting time for all parties involved. \n\nThe Genee app is currently in public beta, where over 10,000 users have tried the app and have given the Genee team and Toi their feedback to improve the app further. \nHow does the Genee app work? There are specific commands that you just type on your mobile phone to let Genee know that you want a meeting set up. You can also command the specifics like the location of a meeting, its duration, type and other timing phases. \nImmediately, Genee will go through your calendar and if possible, look through the other party’s calendar to find the right time. If Genee cannot access the other party’s calendar, it will just send a message notifying him or her about the supposed schedule. \nWhat about rescheduling? Genee will also take care of that. It’s like having a personal assistant. \n“Everyone is looking for a way to save time and energy. That is what we set out to do for users. We wanted to make their entire experience simple, easy, and intuitive. We were really responsive to this need, optimizing user flow and cutting out additional steps in order to streamline the appointment scheduling process,” Nathan Ryan of Toi said. \nThe Genee team’s need to make an app is based on the growing number of mobile phone users today. In fact, that’s a bit of an understatement as everyone is practically doing anything and everything on their mobile phones. Giving people the power to command an app to book meeting and schedules is another way digital tech has made carrying out daily tasks more convenient. \nThe Genee app is currently available on The Play Store. You can use it across different platforms like email, SMS and even Twitter. \nOther AI scheduling platforms have already been launched in the past, such as Amy by x.ai. However, what makes Genee special is its availability on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T15:50:17.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
