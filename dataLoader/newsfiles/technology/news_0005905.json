Mark Leno , D-San Francisco, an author of the bill, said in the release.\nHe said the legislation is meant to strike a balance between people’s privacy and law enforcement’s ability to solve crimes.\nTo that end, while the act does require police to get a warrant before accessing a person’s electronically stored information, there are exceptions in the event of “emergencies and other public safety needs,” the release said.\nThe bill was co-authored by Leno and Sen. Joel Anderson , R-Alpine (San Diego County).\nSean Sposito is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
