Federal authorities have charged Dotcom and the others with conspiracy to commit copyright infringement, racketeering and money laundering. Sometimes they worried about protection, and pondered what action they should take to, and I'm quoting here Mr. Dotcom's words, 'counter the justice system.' The defense has yet to present its case, but Dotcom has long argued that plenty of people used his site to legitimately store files, and he can't be held responsible for those who elected to use it for illegal downloads. Some of the money he made from Mega helped fund his political ambitions, which came to nothing after his party failed to win any seats in the election. Dotcom's U.S. lawyer Ira Rothken said the defense has been disadvantaged because authorities seized more than $60 million belonging to Dotcom and the others and have refused to release some of it to pay legal bills outside of New Zealand. »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T15:39:11.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
