Insight+ enables users to test and evaluate source strengths and transfer functions and contributions on a system level, taking into account an entire vehicle’s interactions with its environment. The software makes it possible to listen to and analyze proposed engineering changes in the appropriate context in order to evaluate and rank design alternatives to assist NVH test and CAE engineers in sharing and developing ideas.\nFluiDyna has also joined the APA, adding nanoFluidX and ultraFluidX to its software portfolio. Both packages are said to offer unique capabilities to HyperWorks customers. nanoFluidX is based on a particle-based method for fluid flow simulation, and ultraFluidX applies the Lattice Boltzmann Method to study external aerodynamics. Both technologies utilize graphics processing unit (GPU) technology for fast, large-scale computation.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/Taurus_CAE.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T11:43:41.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
