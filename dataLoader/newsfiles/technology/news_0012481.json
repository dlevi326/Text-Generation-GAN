Taxi passengers in New York began hailing with an update to Way2ride in February 2015, giving them access to nearly 14,000 yellow taxis and green cabs across all five boroughs of the city when over 30,000 licensed drivers began receiving trip requests through their existing Verifone in-taxi equipment. The pilot phase featured driver training, usability testing, and consumer research to ensure the best experience for passengers, drivers and medallion owners. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150910006443/en/ \nWay2ride™ is available today for both iPhones® and Android® phones and can be downloaded right now from the Apple® App Store® and Google® Play®. \nWAY2RIDE™: THE EASIEST WAY TO HAIL AND PAY FOR TAXIS \nUsing Way2ride to hail a cab is as simple as pressing the “hail” button and confirming your pickup location. There’s never any surge pricing; you only pay what’s on the meter, plus a nominal flat fee for hailing with the app. \nWhen the ride is over, payment is automatic. And whether you’ve hailed with Way2ride, or simply used the app for payment, the tip is up to you, and 100 percent of it goes to your driver. \nWay2ride’s hailing feature is made for those moments – such as rainy days or late nights –when finding and hailing a cab on the street isn’t easy. It’s also a great solution for the NYC boroughs, where taxis aren’t as easy to find, and more than 70 percent of green cabs are Verifone clients. \nBACKED BY VERIFONE, THE WORLD LEADER IN PAYMENT AND COMMERCE \nWay2ride is backed by Verifone, the world leader in payment and commerce solutions; the world’s leading provider of technology that powers taxis; and the trusted brand for payment security. Verifone powers over 85,000 cabs in more than 100 cities across the globe with secure payments, cloud-based dispatch systems and fleet management tools, mobile apps, digital media and much more. \nVerifone was the first to introduce credit card terminals linked to the taxi meter – ensuring what a passenger paid was the actual metered fare; the first to introduce digital entertainment and advertising inside the cab; the first to offer digital, geo-targeted advertising outside the cab; and the first to deliver a taxi payment application with the launch of Way2ride™ two years ago. Verifone was also the first to enable the option for consumers to pay with their American Express Membership Rewards points in New York City taxis, as well as provide the option to pay with Apple Pay® or Google Wallet®. And, earlier this year, Verifone added support for PayPal® using Way2ride™. \n“Traditional taxis are safe, reliable, and the heart and soul of New York City transportation,” said Amos Tamam, Senior Vice President, Global Taxi Systems for Verifone. “Verifone is committed to delivering the security and innovation that passengers, drivers and medallion owners need to enjoy the best experience imaginable. Demand for this groundbreaking technology has been amazing, which is why we decided to be the first to deliver e-hail for taxis in New York.” \nFIRST IN NEW YORK; COMING SOON TO ADDITIONAL MARKETS \nFollowing its formal introduction of Way2ride™ in New York City this week, Verifone will roll out its e-hail app in Boston, Miami, Washington, DC, and Las Vegas, and will launch in all U.S. Verifone markets in 2016. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES: Way2ride e-hail video on YouTube: https://youtu.be/OnF7GMc2kRg Download Way2ride for iOS: http://apple.co/1KarWon Download Way2ride for Android : http://bit.ly/1KarYNc \nSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for VeriFone Systems, Inc. \nThis press release includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
