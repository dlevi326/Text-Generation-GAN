Port shipments of the next-higher-speed, 16 Gbps rose to more than half of the overall market. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20101012/SF80035LOGO \n\"The Fibre Channel SAN market has some bright spots, although it is in a long-term slow decline. Users continue to adopt new 16 Gbps FC products pushing total 16 Gbps FC SAN ports to over half of total ports shipped during the quarter compared to less than 40% one year ago,\" said Casey Quillin, Director of SAN research at Dell'Oro Group. \"Fibre Channel networks are reliable, and users continue to invest in them. We expect adoption of 16 Gbps to accelerate in the back half of 2015, as it moves onto servers. Another trigger will be the new multi-protocol ports that support 16 Gbps FC entering the market,\" Quillin explained. \nAbout the Report The Dell'Oro Group SAN Quarterly Report provides complete, in-depth coverage of the market with tables covering manufacturers' revenue, average selling prices, and port shipments by speed 1 Gbps (historical data), 2 Gbps (historical data), 4 Gbps, 8 Gbps and greater than or equal to 16 Gbps) for Fibre Channel switches and adapters.
