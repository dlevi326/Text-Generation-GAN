The rare and important visit was one of the largest attended public/private gatherings on the East Coast. \nPope Francis' monumental visit yielded an unprecedented number of tickets for the thousands of attendees who all gathered in Philadelphia to see him. Organizing seating at multiple events for so many influential guests could have been a logistically-complex and time-consuming process. Instead, organizers were able to utilize Zengine, WizeHive's cloud-based database software, to collect, prioritize and process the seating assignments. \n\"The team at WizeHive was truly honored to be asked to help make the Pope's sold-out visit a success. We used Zengine to configure a database in just a few hours that was able to collect and manage the ticket requests. Then, using Zengine's open architecture we were able to create plugins that seamlessly integrated with a seating assignment tool, as well as the barcodes from the printed tickets. The Zengine platform provided the flexibility and security, and our extensible technology allowed us to build a system to spec in a fraction of the time it would have taken to build it with a traditional IT approach,\" according to CEO, Michael Levinson. \nAbout WizeHive and Zengine \nWizeHive makes it easier for business people to configure and deploy cloud-based solutions that help them organize, automate and streamline their business processes. \nZengine(TM) is WizeHive's extensible cloud-based platform that empowers a non-technical person to quickly build custom business applications while allowing developers to add integration and workflow functionality.
