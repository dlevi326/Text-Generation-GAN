Real-time digital reporter Megan Crouse checks out one of the interactive displays. Regional director of sales Stacey Morris watches a video on another interactive display. Sam reviews a white paper on still another display... ...and then gets more information on a particular product. Regional director of sales Pat Venezia configures a connector for a project he's working on...apparently.", "external_links": ["http://www.harting-usa.com/home/", "http://hartingroadshowtour.com/"], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T23:45:25.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
