Determining where and which devices are used by the individual is difficult and cumbersome,” said one IT professional who participated in Exterro’s survey. Legal Doesn’t Know Who to Talk With in IT: “I represent various entities [within my organization] and it may not always be clear which entity or which department houses the universe of documents,” stated an associate general counsel at a large energy company. Keeping Track of Data Sources with Departing Employees: Between turnover, layoffs and changing positions in a large company, finding the individuals who know where the information may be is difficult,” explained an attorney from a Fortune 500 organization. \nShawn Christen, Sr. Director at Huron Legal, sums up the problem legal has nicely by stating, “Legal teams have a firm understanding of the various email systems, how they are managed, preserved and collected from but this understanding tends to drop off a bit when it comes to locating data beyond home shares or user shares.” \nTo help solve this problem, legal and IT teams can develop processes and leverage technology for streamlining these data source identification activities. Kevin Smith, Sr. E-Discovery Forensic Analyst at Biogen, offered these simple words of advice, “A playbook or binder that is shared and collaborated on between IT and Legal really gives the requisite e-discovery knowledge to everyone involved in the process.” \nBeyond Kevin’s tip, here are 5 more tips to help you improve your current process for identifying and accessing data sources for e-discovery collections. \nTip #1 -- Standardize Your E-Discovery Process: Since IT serves the business as a whole, it may be nearly impossible to entirely centralize your IT infrastructure. However, IT and Legal need to collaborate to standardize policies, tools and techniques for identifying responsive data. \nTip #2 -- Understand the Value of Data Mapping: A data map can provide a competitive edge when defending against litigation. Data maps are centralized, summary catalogs that provides a listing and a description of each data source in your data infrastructure. As a result, legal teams are given a roadmap for quickly locating potentially responsive data. \nTip #3 – Create a Data Map: Here’s how… Gather key stakeholders across the organization to determine goals and legal/risk/compliance drivers. Assess whether the data map is going to contain all data sources or just data sources that may be potentially responsive to litigation. Define the underlying data elements (i.e. exporting formats, length of time data sources maintained, information retention requirements, etc.) that you are going to capture for each data source. Leverage a software solution to help catalog and track these data sources. \nTip #4 – Assign an E-Discovery Liaison: Collaboration is key. Identify someone in legal or IT to work as the intermediary between the two departments. Keep in mind that this person must understand both the IT and Legal worlds to make this liaison position effective. \nTip #5 – Develop Policies for Tracking Employee Movements: Work with IT to define policies that enable legal team members in charge of managing your legal hold process to be alerted via your HR system when custodians leave the organization, transfer or undergo another status change that might result in their data being deleted. \nTo learn more e-discovery tips for reducing legal spend and increasing defensibility, attend the 1 st Annual E-Discovery Day, December 1 . E-Discovery Day will bring together a diverse set of professionals to share experiences, discuss key trends and offer best practices over a variety of mediums (complimentary CLE webcasts, whitepapers, infographics, etc.) with the goal of facilitating and promoting e-discovery education to the entire legal and business community. \nLearn more about E-Discovery Day by clicking here or going to www.e-discoveryday.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T17:13:36.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
