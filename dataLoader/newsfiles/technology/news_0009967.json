When a new Mayor is elected in 2016 would the need once again be to replace the vehicle to suit to needs of the new incumbent?\nExpenditure of this nature should not be condoned and or being applicable and or preference over service and infrastructure development and the lack thereof as it currently stand.\nWhat now makes the situation even more bizarre is that Fleet Horizon (yes the infamous company) was already asked to Quote: on a replacement vehicle in April of 2015, 4 months prior to it being tabled in Council for recommendation and action to be followed. This cost of the vehicle then being over R 950 000 which has now escalated to over R 1.2 million which is money that could have been spent most wisely on infrastructure development than to transport the Mayor in sumptuous luxury around for maybe just another 9 months!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T20:04:17.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
