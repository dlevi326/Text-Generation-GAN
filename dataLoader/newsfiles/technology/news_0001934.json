Collision tests showed that the inflatable modules reduced the peak force of frontal impacts by 32-52 percent and side impacts by 26-37 percent. \n\"Humans interacting with robots in everyday environments is no longer just science fiction,\" said Joohyung Kim, associate research scientist. \"Making them soft is particularly important for robots that will interact with children, the elderly, or with patients.\" \nKim and his Disney colleagues, Katsu Yamane and Alexander Alspach, will present their findings at the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2015) on Sept. 28 in Hamburg, Germany. \nThe air-filled skin modules can absorb unexpected impacts. By monitoring pressure changes that occur when the airtight, but flexible chamber is deformed, it also can serve as a contact sensor, providing feedback for touching, grasping and manipulating. \nThe researchers built soft skin modules that were cylindrical with hemispheric ends, a little less than 5 inches long and about 2 ½ inches in diameter. In addition to the air-filled outer skin, each module included a rigid link at the center. The modules thus could employ a variety of material properties, from flexible to rigid. \nIn experiments using only the rigid link, with the outer, inflated skins removed, the researchers were able to use them to grasp a disposable cup. But without the pressure feedback provided by the soft skin, the cup ultimately was crushed. With the soft skins attached, the researchers obtained sufficient pressure feedback to grip the cup, and hold other delicate objects, without damaging them. \nThe same design concept used to produce the modules can be employed to make other modules of varying geometries, they noted. 7 hours ago 1 DARPA-funded inflatable robotics helps spark idea for silver screen star November 14, 2014 \nThe giant, balloon-like inflatable robot named Baymax in Disney's Big Hero 6 has its roots in real-world research conducted by iRobot Corporation, Carnegie Mellon University and Otherlab under DARPA's Maximum Mobility Manipulation ...
