Absolutely. But we want to go everywhere. And if you want to go everywhere, then you need to dramatically lower the cost of space.”\nTo achieve that goal, Seattle-based Blue Origin expects to start construction soon of a “21st Century production facility” for building rocket stages and components at Exploration Park, just south of Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island.\nUSA TODAY\nBezos defends working conditions at Amazon\nThe company ultimately plans to employ 330 people here and invest more than $200 million into launch and manufacturing facilities, assisted by at least $18 million in state and local incentives.\n“Another week and another job announcement on the Space Coast,” said Florida Gov. Rick Scott, making his third stop in the area this month following announcements by aerospace firms Boeing and Embraer.\nAmazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos announced at a Tuesday press conference that his space company, Blue Origin, will manufacture their rockets at Exploration Park, and start launching “later this decade” from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station’s Launch Complex 36.

But the last launch was in 2005.\n“The pad has stood silent for more than 10 years — too long,” Bezos said to applause. “We can’t wait to fix that.”\nBezos offered no detailed timeline, saying Blue Origin hoped to launch “later this decade.” Initial test flights would carry research payloads before the rockets are deemed safe for people.\nAmazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos announced at a Tuesday press conference that his space company, Blue Origin, will manufacture their rockets at Exploration Park, and start launching “later this decade” from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station’s Launch Complex 36.

Another New Shepard test flight is possible this year, but it is not part of the company’s plans in Florida.\nHere, Bezos said residents would “hear us before you see us,” starting with test-firings of its own BE-4 engine.\nThe methane-fueled engine will power the first-stage of Blue Origin's orbital rocket. It is also the front-runner to boost United Launch Alliance’s planned Vulcan rocket, potentially ending ULA’s reliance on Russian-made engines and making Blue Origin a player in launches of national security satellites.\nBlue Origin is like no other space company to fly from the Cape: It has no government or commercial launch contracts, and doesn’t need any in the near-term, thanks to its billionaire backing.\nThat backing, Bezos said, allows Blue Origin to operate according to a Latin motto that translates to “step by step, ferociously,” and not fret about short-term funding pressures that even NASA struggles with year to year, causing programs to start and stop.\n“That kind of steadiness, I think is unbelievably valuable,” he said. “One of the things that Blue brings is just a very stable approach, and that comes because in large part we don’t need government funding.”\nUSA TODAY\nJeff Bezos' space tourism company completes test flight\nWhile focused on human spaceflight, Blue Origin might eventually compete for contracts to launch government satellites, or people to private space stations.\nBut Bezos appears not to worry about competing with SpaceX or ULA, which occupy four pads further up the coast. He said he brings a long-term perspective that envisions space as an enormous market where millions of people will one day live and work.\n“Space is pretty big,” he said. “There are a lot of opportunities, and there’s room for multiple winners.”\n“Space is pretty big. There are a lot of opportunities, and there’s room for multiple winners.”\nJeff Bezos, Blue Origin Like SpaceX, the standard-bearer so far for the emerging commercial space industry, Blue Origin considers reusability central to making spaceflight more affordable.\nThe company’s orbital booster and engines are intended to fly multiple times. The booster would land on a barge, similar to what SpaceX has attempted recently with its Falcon rockets — so far unsuccessfully. The crew capsule also would be reused.\n“You cannot afford to be a spacefaring civilization if you throw the rocket away every time you use it,” he said. “We have to be focused on reusability, we have to be focused on lowering the cost to space.”\nWith that emphasis on lowering costs, Blue Origin early on wasn’t interested in launching from the Air Force Station.\nIt preferred instead the state’s proposed Shiloh commercial launch complex at the north end of KSC and the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, and considered options in other states that would take longer to be ready.\nUSA TODAY\nRocket crashes spur demands for review of NASA program\nBezos said Blue Origin reviewed detailed bids from five states before committing to Florida, which won out because of its ideal location for orbital launches and the skilled workforce that will be needed to build and launch the missions.\nHe credited the Air Force with taking important steps to build confidence that Blue Origin's commercial business would be welcomed alongside high-priority national security missions.\n“We had to really get comfortable that the Air Force was serious about leaning forward and making this a great place to operate commercially, and I’m convinced they are,” he said.\nBlue Origin is known for being secretive, and Tuesday's celebration offered little new information about its flight plans, though Bezos showed off an artist's concept of the orbital rocket blasting off from Cape Canaveral.\nHe promised more detail about the rocket next year, and asked guests to “please keep watching.”\n“The vision for Blue is pretty simple, which is we want to see millions of people living and working in space, and that’s going to take a long time,” he said. “But we’ll do it step by step.”\n1 CONNECT 31 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1FetIcf TOP VIDEOS", "external_links":
