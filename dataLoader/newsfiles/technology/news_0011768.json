It is particularly adapted to producing short videos and it will seduce companies or universities willing to start creating dynamic video content for eLearning and communications. \nThe videos are delivered in HD quality, fully branded and automatically edited for a dynamic viewing experience. Automation : the user interface is limited to a Start and Stop button. The rest is automated. Customisation : the video output appearance is based on pre-defined templates for layout, pre and post-roll video clips, logos, etc. \nThe Podcast Studio is available from 5990 €HT through a European reseller network.
