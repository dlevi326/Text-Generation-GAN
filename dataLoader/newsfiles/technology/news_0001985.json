The notification will ease import and use of such devices,\" international telecom regulatory expert SN Gupta told PTI.\n\nThe WPC, which is under the Department of Telecom, has exempted use of short range radar systems in a frequency band of 76-77GHz which are generally used as sensors in automotive vehicles to implement safety features such as collision warning, lane change assistance, blind-spot detection and pedestrian protection.\n\n\"These devices are not being made in India at present but the rule with ease of doing business will facilitate in building eco-system around these devices,\" Gupta said.\n\nThe new notification eases use of contact less smartcards, microwave oven in 302-351KHz frequency band, he added.\n\nAs per the notification, equipment including the Radio Frequency Identification Devices operating in 433 to 434.79MHz will also be exempted from licensing.\n\n\"Shopping malls use RFID tags and equipment to detect movement of products. This will also help free use of near field communication technology which we have seen in some smartphones. NFC technology is also used at toll plaza for automatic deduction of toll tax from cars without stopping them,\" Gupta said.\n\nThough the products will not need licence to operate, they will have to get approval once from WPC for their use.\n\nThe exemptions, however, will not apply in cases where \"specific service licence is required from the central government\" and \"wherever the use of this band for airborne devices or applications is required\".
