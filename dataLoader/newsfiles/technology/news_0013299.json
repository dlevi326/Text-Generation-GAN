As for today’s match-up, we have Lenovo Vibe Phab Plus and Huawei Honor 7i that fits the bill perfectly. - Advertisement - \nBut let’s take a background check on both of them first. The Vibe Phab Plus seems to be blurring the line between a phablet and a tablet. The term loosely means that anything that is 5.5-inch and above is referred to as a phablet while anything 7-inch and above is considered to be a tablet. But is 6.8-inch still considered a smartphone or tablet? Won’t you face difficulty in making and answering calls? \nAt least with the Honor 7i, we can understand where it is coming from. We noticed that there are now more manufacturers who are focusing on producing the best selfie smartphone. This seems to be the latest model to be catching the buzz, just that they are not taking the usual route for it. Sure we have Oppo, who started off the trend last year with a primary camera that can be rotated and turn into a secondary camera. But this time around, Honor 7i improves on a bit more to make it a better selfie smartphone. What is it then? We will find out soon enough. \nHaving a body measurement of 186.6 x 96.6 x 7.6 mm (7.35 x 3.80 x 0.30 in), the Vibe Phab Plus sure is thin for its size. As for the weight, it comes weighing in at 229 g (8.08 oz) which is alright for its size. But will there be a serious demand for it? You would have to use both hands as a single-hand operation is nearly impossible. But at least there’s a metal unibody makes for a premium look and feel and elevates its status by a lot. \nAs for the Honor 7i, there’s no metal body to begin with. It has a body measurement of 141.6 x 71.2 x 7.8 mm (5.57 x 2.80 x 0.31 in) and weighs just 160 g (5.64 oz), which is good. Then there’s the fingerprint sensor which can use it to unlock the device and for more serious stuffs like authorizing payment as part of a biometric system. \nThe Vibe Phab Plus looks good with its metal finish and an incredibly thin body to boot. The Honor 7i, on the other hand, has the advantage of a fingerprint sensor instead. \nMoving on to screen, the Vibe Phab Plus will be sporting a 6.8-inch Full HD IPS capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~324 ppi pixel density. At this size, anything short than a Full HD screen could well be a disaster. You will love its sharpness and the knowledge that you can probably share the phablet with a friend or two thanks to its IPS technology. \nMeanwhile on the Honor 7i, it is sporting a 5.2-inch Full HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~424 ppi pixel density. Maybe not as huge as, but it definitely looks great on the eyes indeed. \nYou can’t be serious to compare the huge 6.8-inch versus 5.2-inch, there’s no competition to begin with. Unless you are really into that huge of a screen, then Vibe Phab Plus is the obvious answer. \nPerformance-wise, we would have thought that its huge body might be bogged down by its sub-par internals. But that’s not the case with the Vibe Phab Plus though, as it has the Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising a Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 405 for its graphics and 2GB RAM. Quite satisfying and if it were to have an additional 1GB memory, then it would be great. \nAs for the Honor 7i, we have the Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising Quad-core 1.7 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53 and Adreno 405 graphics. There are two variants available, with 2GB memory tied with 16GB storage and 3GB memory with 32GB storage. Obviously you should go for the higher-end model since the extra 1GB memory will be very helpful. - Advertisement - \nNow let’s move on to the fun things in life which is the camera. On the Vibe Phab Plus, it will be powered by a 13MP-5MP camera setup that is considered to be the mid-range these days. You should be able to capture a lot of photos and selfies as you seek to upload them to your favorite social media. \nBut that is nothing compared to what the Honor 7i is capable of delivering. Featuring a 13 Megapixel rotating camera with 4208 x 3120 pixels, autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama; you can rotate its lens at many angles until it is facing you and becomes just like a secondary camera. Produced by Sony, it has an f/2.0 aperture and a 28mm wide-angle lens, plus it’s covered in sapphire crystal which makes it scratch-resistant. Remember the fingerprint sensor that we mentioned earlier? It is placed at the side instead of the back of the device as usual, and this could also double up to snap a photo. \nIn terms of storage, a rather generous 32GB internal storage is there on the Vibe Phab Plus for you to install all of your favorite apps and games. Should you feel you need more space, then just put in a microSD slot, and the Vibe Phab Plus can take in up to 64GB space. Just a word of caution, though, if you do use the expansion slot; then you will lose the capability of the 2 nd sim slot. Might not be a big deal right? \nAnd as we mentioned earlier, the Honor 7i has two variants when it comes to storage – 16GB and 32GB. Not to fret, though, as it also has a microSD slot that can take in up to a maximum of 128GB should you need to expand further. In case you do so, you will also have to sacrifice the 2 nd sim slot that is still acceptable. \nNormally what people would do under these circumstances is to take high-resolution photos and save it on an SD card and later transfer it to your PC or laptop. Then you won’t miss than 2 nd sim slot a lot anymore. \nAndroid Lollipop 5.0 is there accompanying this massive Vibe Phab Plus. This is the perfect complement as it will be bringing with it a host of optimizations to give an increase to the performance. \nAs for Honor 7i, it comes with the latest Android Lollipop 5.1 together and Emotion UI 3.1 which further enhances the user experience in handling the device. \nTo round it all off, the Vibe Phab Plus will be powered by a non-removable Li-Po 3500 mAh battery that technically should be enough to power up the phablet for at least a day. Based on Lenovo’s own data, they are saying it could last up to 48 hours but let’s wait and see for the actual results to come in. \nWhereas on the Honor 7i, it is powered by a non-removable Li-Po 3100 mAh battery that should have no issues supplying enough juice to it for at least a day or two in between charging. \nBoth have 4G LTE and dual-sim capability which is a nice feature and adds more value to both of them. - Advertisement - \nHaving a huge screen makes the Lenovo Vibe Phab Plus a stand-out among the crowd. It does have the necessary hardware to boot and the metal unibody does a lot to make it even more attractive. If you are comfortable with handling it with both hands, then it might be the right fit for you. \nAll said and done; Huawei Honor 7i is also a great device. If you love to take photos, then its 13MP rotating camera should serve you well. \nThe Lenovo Vibe Phab Plus is expected to be available by this month for $279 USD, and it will be available in Gunmetal Grey, Titanium Silver, Champagne Gold. \nHuawei Honor 7i is currently available in China for $299 for the 16GB model. It is available in black, white and gold. News From", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T17:36:30.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
