The teachers union countered with a 10.5 percent increase over two years. \nTeacher salaries range from about $44,000 to more than $86,000 for more experienced educators with advanced degrees, according to the district. In comparison, tech workers can easily draw six figures. \n\"There's a giant tech surge here in Seattle, with Google and Twitter opening offices,\" said Tom Leung, co-founder and CEO of Seattle-based Anthology, which connects professionals with employers. \"Apple. Cisco. Ebay. It's a who's who of tech.\" \nThe companies have run out of workers and space in the San Francisco Bay Area, so they're looking to the Northwest as a key region to add staff, he said. \n\"It has created an intense amount of competition for highly skilled tech workers,\" Leung said. \"A typical tech engineer can make $150,000 without trying very hard. That does create an impact on the rest of the city.\" \nRents have ballooned by more than 37 percent since mid-2010, according to Apartment Insights Washington. The median rental price for homes in Seattle in July was $2,354 a month, Zillow reports, compared with a national average of $1,376. \nThe city is having a housing crisis because more than 40 percent of the new jobs in the region are with Amazon or Boeing, and their starting salaries are twice as much as a teacher who has been on the job for years, Seattle City Councilmember Nick Licata said. \n\"They're bringing in tons of people, but affordable housing is disappearing,\" he said. \"That means the people who are educating our children are finding it difficult to live in the city where the children they teach live.\" \nWages and affordability have dominated the political landscape in Seattle recently. After a strong push from labor activists, the city last year adopted a phased-in $15-an-hour minimum wage. \nLily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, said that besides stalled cost-of-living increases, teachers have gone five years without a boost in funding for health care costs. \n\"Seattle needs to attract and keep caring, qualified educators in one of the most expensive cities in the United States,\" she said. \nWith the strike entering its third day Friday, the district and union remained stuck on pay raises, teacher evaluations and other issues. \nThe sides failed to reach an agreement on a contract Tuesday, delaying the start of school for some 53,000 students. \nSeattle Public Schools spokesman Stacy Howard said Thursday afternoon that both sides are continuing to meet with mediators, but negotiations have not resumed. \n___ \nFollow Martha Bellisle at https://twitter.com/marthabellisle .
