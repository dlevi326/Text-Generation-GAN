The High Quality mode 3D prints models with superior surface finish and intricate, delicate features required for precise fittings on crown, bridge, and prosthetic models (in 16-micron layers). The High Speed mode 3D prints at accelerated speeds to produce orthodontic models and surgical guides with increased productivity (in 28-micron layers). Together, these two print modes enable smaller labs to produce a wide range of dental and orthodontic appliances in-house - changing the economies for smaller dental labs by increasing productivity, shortening delivery times and improving patient satisfaction. \nThe Objet30 Dental Prime's can print in a choice of three PolyJet 3D printing materials including; VeroDentPlus (MED690), a dark beige material that offers excellent strength, accuracy and durability to create intricate models; Clear Bio-compatible (MED610), medically approved for temporary in-mouth placement for producing surgical guides and investment castings for chromium cobalt removable partial denture (RPD) frames; and VeroGlaze (MED620), an opaque bio-compatible material with A2 shading designed to provide accurate colour matching. Ã— Expand \nCrown and bridge stone models produced with MED690 material. \nBy enabling smaller dental labs to produce their own models and appliances in-house, the Objet30 Dental Prime 3D Printer reduces the need for outsourcing and enables smaller labs to be more competitive. Key applications include crown and bridge models, RPD casting patterns, diagnostic wax up, surgical guides, veneer try-ins and clear aligners. \n\"The introduction of the compact, versatile Objet30 Dental Prime 3D Printer continues Stratasys' commitment to providing a variety of solutions to meet the different needs of dental and orthodontic labs, small and large. This addition to our entry-level desktop family brings superior-quality 3D printing available to all dental labs who want to provide competitive digital dentistry services to their clients,\" said Steffen Mueller, General Manager, Dental Solutions at Stratasys. \nVisit Stratasys on stand E14 at TCT Show + Personalize 2015, 30th September - 1st October, NEC Birmingham.
