We have been blunt in our assessment that that has significant consequences for our economy and for our national security,\" added Earnest, speaking aboard Air Force One as Obama was flying to Iowa.\nThe official's visit, ahead of Xi's trip, showed the Chinese government understood the United States was serious about its concerns, Earnest said.\nThe Obama administration is considering targeted sanctions against Chinese individuals and companies for cyber attacks against U.S. commercial targets, several U.S. officials have said.\nChinese hackers have also been implicated in the massive hacking of the U.S. government's personnel office disclosed this year. Two breaches of security clearance applications exposed the personal data of more than 20 million federal employees.
