By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press \nNEW YORK — Microsoft got a chilly reaction from a federal appeals court Wednesday to its claims that the United States should not be able to touch data it stores for customers overseas. \nMicrosoft lawyer E. Joshua Rosenkranz told a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan that “global chaos” could result if it failed to overturn a lower-court judge’s ruling last summer. That judge ordered the Redmond company to turn over a customer’s email account that it stores in Dublin, Ireland, for a narcotics probe. \n“If we can do it to them, then other countries can do it to us,” Rosenkranz said. \nCircuit Judge Gerard Lynch seemed unfazed by Rosenkranz’s predictions that other nations would react negatively if the U.S. was permitted to get the records.

Microsoft turned over the customer’s address book, which was stored in the United States. \nDozens of organizations and businesses submitted written arguments to the appeals court, including 29 major U.S. and foreign news and trade organizations. They said journalists and publishers worldwide rely on email and cloud-storage services provided by Microsoft and others to gather, store and review documents protected by the First Amendment. \nA ruling in the case is unlikely for months.
