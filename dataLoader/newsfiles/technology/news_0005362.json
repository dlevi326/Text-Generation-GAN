One was age 30, the other age 24,\" said Percy Jeronimo, the oral surgeon running the emergency room in the local health clinic. He said four of the wounded were in critical condition.\nPolice apparently opened fire on the protesters when they entered part of the Las Bambas mine where the plant that separates copper ore from rock is under construction.\nThe local health director, Jose Soplopuco, told The Associated Press that ambulances can't reach Challhuahuacho, the town of about 20 000 residents where the clinic is located, because police had shot at a vehicle carrying doctors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T12:03:33.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
