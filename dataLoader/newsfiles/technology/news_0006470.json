Yes consumers may be given the grace and not have their services suspended for now, but in the run up to the elections will use the services and just add to their arrears, and when the ANC are well back in the ‘cushions of power’, nothing will then stop them to disrupt and or suspend services for all those that are in arrears as they are then safe for another 5 year in office.\nThey have fooled them to once again be elected but don’t think that the window of writing off such debts would ever be, as the SALGA Act clearly states that Council’s should ensure that all outstanding debt, government or not need to be recovered in a good administrative and accountable manner.\nYes some of these debts outstanding have been outstanding for more than three years and it would be a contravention of both the Consumers Protection Act (PCA) and the Prescription Act to pursue customers with debt older than three (3) years as there can be no attempt to recover arrears older than three (3) years, and any attempt to do so will result in a R 1 million fine per account or 10% of the annual turnover of the one that is trying to pursue the collections thereof.\nBut at the end of the day someone and in this instance, the loyal taxpayers would be paying for the services that have been rendered as ESKOM has to be paid for bulk supply and with consumers not paying, ESKOM would disconnect the Metropolitan Councils for failing to pay their dues, so once again the taxpayer’s become the sponsors for all those ones that refuse and or cannot pay their respective bills for service delivery that they enjoy.\nAnother ingenious way of ‘cushioning voters’ with voters not realizing that ultimately they would have to pay, and that is a fact, as much as the fact that the ruling party has to make every possible attempt to retain the voter support and would most probably come up with more ingenious ways to retain the support base in the months leading up to the elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T09:15:14.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
