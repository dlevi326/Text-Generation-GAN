STX said Friday that Kathy Savitt will become the president of its digital business in October. Savitt started at Yahoo in September 2012. Before that, she worked for Amazon.com Inc. and founded the online commerce service Lockerz. Three years into the tenure of CEO Marissa Mayer , Yahoo is still trying to turn its business around and reverse a slide in its revenue. The company wants to spin off its most prized asset, a stake in Alibaba Group , but it's not clear if Yahoo will be able to make that move without paying a hefty tax bill. Film producer Robert Simonds and TPG Capital executive Bill McGlashan founded STX in 2014.
