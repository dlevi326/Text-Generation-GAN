You don’t have to wait long it will be available this month. - Advertisement - \nJudging by the huge response that they got during the launching, Axon Elite is all about being a high-end flagship. There are a whole lot of features and functions that awaits the buyers out there. As long as you have the cash to spend that is. \nAt the point of launch, we only got to know that it will have a 154 x 75 x 9.3 mm (6.06 x 2.95 x 0.37 in) body which might not be slim but feels just nice. The metal body further boosted its image somewhat and that’s a great thing indeed. \nAs per its other brother Axon Lux that was also launched during the same event – it is the first smartphone to feature three biometric authentication options to unlock the phone. You can opt for a fingerprint scanner, eye scanner, and voice recognition. \nScreen-wise, it will be sporting a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~401 ppi pixel density that will display great-looking images. You will be able to enjoy watching your favorite videos and browsing websites with this smartphone. \nUnder the hood of the Axon Elite is the Qualcomm MSM8994 Snapdragon 810 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2 GHz Cortex-A57, Adreno 430 graphics and 3GB memory. You can expect top-class performance that would have no trouble swallowing anything that you throw at it; with a lot more to spare. - Advertisement - \nWith great hardware, you will also be getting great camera as well. Featuring a primary camera with 13MP+2MP dual lens and an 8MP secondary camera, be prepared to take lots of high-quality photos. With two primary cameras you will have access to a true re-focus tool, rather than a digital augmented version. This means you can adjust the focus of your photos after you took it. Want to switch focus to the rear? Just a click and it will change accordingly. Now that’s something truly cool indeed. \nBy snapping tons of photos, there’s 32GB of storage built-in which should be enough to install all your apps and store all your high-resolution photos. If you feel that’s not enough, you can then pop in a microSD card up to a maximum of 128GB. How about that? \nWith such power, there will be a non-removable Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery supplying juice to it. You can at least get a day of battery life out of it. It also comes with fast battery charging feature that can bring it up to 60% in just 30 minutes via the Quick Charge 2.0. \nIn terms of OS, there’s Android Lollipop 5.0 that comes right out of the box. Not sure whether or when it will get the update to the latest Lollipop 5.1. - Advertisement - \nZTE Axon Elite is great and you can be sure of great performance. The biometrics is top-notch as you can unlock the smartphone in 3 different ways. The primary camera adds a twist to it and you will surely be able to capture better photos with it. \nThe ZTE Axon Elite is expected to be released by this month and is estimated to cost below the 400 USD range. It will only be available in Ion Gold, though. News From", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T17:37:40.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
