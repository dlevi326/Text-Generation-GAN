The company said core items like the Big Mac, McNuggets and fries will still be available at all of its locations. \nThe company has been testing an all-day breakfast menu in San Diego for months. It has been looking for a boost, because sales at established U.S. stores have fallen for seven straight quarters and the company hasn’t replaced its Dollar Menu with anything equally compelling. \nMcDonald’s is also working to improve its food by toasting buns longer and searing burgers to improve taste, and it’s looking for a way to shake up its image. \nTaco Bell began selling breakfast items in 2014 and has said the biscuit taco and other items have lifted its sales. \nMike Andres, president of McDonald’s U.S., acknowledged that the company has struggled with an overcomplicated menu, and that restaurants would remove some items to make room for the breakfast offerings throughout the day. \nCore menu items such as Big Macs will remain national. The items that are removed will vary by region. \nIt’s the largest operational change since McDonald’s introduced the McCafe coffee and espresso drinks in 2009, Andres said. \nConvenience stores \n7-Eleven adds \ndelivery cities \n7-Eleven expanded its delivery service to three cities Tuesday, but Slurpees aren’t on the menu for now. \nCustomers in Chicago, Los Angeles and parts of New York can order other items from the chain through the app or website of DoorDash, the online delivery company that 7-Eleven has teamed up with in those cities. \nSlurpees are “best when consumed immediately,” said 7-Eleven spokeswoman Margaret Chabris. But DoorDash said it is testing ways to get them delivered without melting. \nIn July, 7-Eleven teamed up with Postmates to offer delivery in San Francisco and Austin. Postmates said it delivers Slurpees using insulated bags. \nDoorDash, based in Palo Alto, charges a delivery fee between $5 and $7. Prices of items in 7-Eleven stores and on the DoorDash app and website are the same, the companies said. There’s no minimum order, and goods are delivered within 45 minutes. \nMedia \nBloomberg \nNews layoffs \nBloomberg News began layoffs Tuesday. As many as 90 people were expected to be cut throughout the company and across bureaus, people familiar with the plans said. News of the layoffs was first reported by the New York Post. \nAbout a dozen positions will be cut in Bloomberg’s 200-person Washington bureau, and about 20 in New York, people familiar with the plan said. The rest of the cuts will come in global newsrooms. \nEditor in chief John Micklethwait plans to refocus coverage on business, finance, economics, technology and politics. \nBloomberg is expanding in other directions, hiring dozens for a commentary site. \nFounder Michael Bloomberg returned in September 2014 to the company he founded, after three terms as mayor of New York, and has made a number of changes to the operation. \nChronicle News Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:59:55.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
