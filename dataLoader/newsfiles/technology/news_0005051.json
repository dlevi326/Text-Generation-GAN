Thus, the effects of load-shedding shall be minimised and the competitive culture shall be reinforced.\nAs an example, Northcliff may elect to play from the same venue as Hyde Park. In this way, a greater camaraderie ins engendered as well as the work-load is shared by the Educators.\nThis system too relieves the inordinate work-load placed on Educators. Instead of Educators having to chase up teams over a period of over 5 weeks, the entire championship is done on one Saturday from 9H00 to 18H00.\nSouth African National LAN Championships.\nSuch championships is scheduled to be played in Cape Town on 30 & 31 July 2015.\nIt is planned that directly after play the top teams shall be selected to play against test matches against other nation's school teams.\nThus the SA National LAN Championships shall afford gamers the opportunity to earn SA National High School Colours as well as Junior Protea Colours.\nSouth African On-line Championships.\nSuch championship shall be played in the same manner as the on-line provincial championships except that any school in South Africa will be able to participate.\nAgain such championship shall be played on one Saturday with schools playing in a controlled environment.\nThus the three championships added to the calendar of events shall add a further 15 competitive games per title.\nWhen added to the existing calendar of Regional, Provincial, and National championships, it should be relatively easy, and cheap, for gamers to reach a total of 24 competitive games which will increase the overall standard of play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:08:00.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
