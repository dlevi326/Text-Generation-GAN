I thought it was a hoax as the weather was very pleasant and we were enjoying the last of the weekend on our sunny stoep.\nAt about lunchtime, dense clouds started to come in from the south accompanied by almost instant colder weather. Our guests were very surprised when it started raining rather heavily and they even considered driving back to Cape Town via the longer Sir Lowry's Pass road using the N2.\nAt this stage I started to wonder about the sms message I had received earlier that morning and realised that it might not have been a hoax message at all.\nLater yesterday afternoon and into the evening I saw how much the swells had picked up and how choppy the sea had become. I told my wife that I had never in 21 years seen the sea turn so rough so quickly and remarked that there would probably be some boats at sea which could get into serious difficulty.\nSo, reading about the fishing trawler off the Hangklip coast which started to take in water and whose crew had to abandon ship did not surprise me. The sea was dreadful and the visibility was also not good. I would not have enjoyed being at sea yesterday and offer my condolences to those who have lost loved ones in these conditions.\nThe sea along our coast can become treacherous and yesterday was one of those days when it did exactly that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T01:25:48.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
