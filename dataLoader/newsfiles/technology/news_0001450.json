With a capacitance stability over temperature and voltage lower than ±0.5% the UBSC capacitor series from IPDiA features excellent performance through 60+GHz in compact standard-size SMT components. Modelithics and IPDiA have recently collaborated to characterize three UBSC capacitors and develop s-parameter file-based models that extend to 67GHz.\nThe s-parameter data files for the UBSC 935 151 423 510 (0201, 10nF, 11V), UBSC 935 151 424 610 (0402, 100nF, 11V) and UBSC 935 151 723 510 (0201, 10nF, 30V) are now available for download from the Modelithics website. S-parameter models for all three new parts will be added to the “SPAR Library,” included with Modelithics COMPLETE Library for Keysight ADS, Keysight Genesys, and NI AWR Design Environment, as new versions are released.\nEach SPAR model has an associated model datasheet containing measurement and fixture details, and plots of the s-parameter data. Visit the IPDiA MVP page on the Modelithics website to download s-parameter files, access model datasheets and find more information about the capacitors (http://www.modelithics.com/mvp/IPDiA ).\nFor questions about the IPDiA SPAR models or the Modelithics COMPLETE Library, contact Modelithics at sales@modelithics.com.\nFor questions about IPDiA product lines, contact IPDiA at sales@ipdia.com.", "external_links": ["http://www.modelithics.com/mvp/IPDiA"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T11:57:21.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
