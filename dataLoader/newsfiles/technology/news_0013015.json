Whether employees are on their computers, tablets or mobile phones, they need access to the information and resources that will enable them to make important business decisions in real-time and complete tasks efficiently, wherever they are. This is the type of access that only cloud-based business tools can provide. \nIn addition to ease of access, cloud-based tools help businesses do more with less. They help reduce costs, allow for flexibility and scalability as a business grows, and enable automation, removing the need to invest in IT support to keep information updated and maintained. There has never been a better time than now to take advantage of the cloud. This is because the cloud is becoming a data warehouse on its own and much of the new data being created is generated online and processed through the cloud, making it easier for cloud-based tools to communicate, resulting in more business benefits. \nOften newer businesses are more likely to adopt innovative cloud-based technologies than older companies, such as banks and insurance companies. In older companies, the marketing or sales departments will frequently be the first to adopt cloud-based tools due to the need for the teams to be able to work on the go, before wider adoption takes place. Companies are usually less afraid to adopt cloud-based tools when they have a chance to start small, for example, by using cloud-based resources like Google Docs. Once they get their feet wet and realize the benefits that cloud-based services offer, they become more willing to quickly adopt more cloud-based tools. For example, by enlisting a pure cloud business intelligence software as a service like BIME Analytics that can process large amounts of siloed data and draw out valuable business insights. \nThe mistake of failing to benefit from the use of cloud-based tools is surprisingly common among businesses. Sometimes it’s due to a lack of knowledge of the technology available and other times it’s because companies are too anxious to try it. While there are possible risks with cloud-based software, there are also plenty of risks in the on-premise world. For example, an employee could accidently leave the office with a USB key holding valuable company information or a computer could be stolen. ‘Zero risk’ when it comes to technology in the workplace doesn’t exist. \nIn conclusion, there may always be on-premise and cloud-based business tools on offer. However, cloud technology is being rapidly adopted by modern businesses that want the best chance of success in this new cloud-first, mobile-first world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T20:26:13.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
