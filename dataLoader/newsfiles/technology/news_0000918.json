Those sectors produce \"a substantial percentage of China's climate pollution,\" one official said. \nCap-and-trade sets an annual limit on the amount of pollution that can be produced, then requires firms to obtain permission to pollute by purchasing credits from less polluting industries. \nOther parts of China's announcement will include prioritizing low-carbon and efficient electricity production. \nUnder last year's groundbreaking agreement, Obama set a goal to cut U.S. emissions between 26 percent and 28 percent by 2025, compared with 2005 levels. \nChina, the world's biggest polluter, relies heavily on coal for power generation. It will set a target for its emissions to peak by about 2030 or earlier, after which they would then start falling. That marks an unprecedented step for Beijing, which has been reluctant to be boxed in on climate by the global community. \nThe European Union has also said it would cut its emissions 40 percent by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. Taken together, the U.S, China and the EU account for more than half of global emissions. \nFriday's announcement will also commit Beijing and Washington to aligning their views on key negotiating positions at Paris, along with providing greater funding for research and development on low-carbon technologies and financial assistance to help poor countries build low-pollution infrastructure. \nChina, one of the world's biggest builders of infrastructure, will also offer a \"very substantial financial commitment\" to help poor nations transition to low-pollution technologies, the U.S. officials said, without releasing the exact figure. \nThree decades of breakneck economic growth have left China's cities clogged in dense smog and sent cancer rates soaring. That's prompted it to drop its insistence that developed nations bear most of the responsibility for reducing carbon emissions, producing a rare area of cooperation with Washington. \nLu Kong, the spokesman for Xi's delegation, declined to discuss the joint statement, but said climate change was \"an area where China and the U.S. could work together and we did make some good progress in our joint efforts. \n\"Maybe this time we could make further progress in demonstrating to the outside world at large that China and the U.S. are committed to further efforts in dealing with climate change in a comprehensive way,\" Lu said.
