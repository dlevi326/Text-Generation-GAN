With Android Pay, U.S. Bank customers with eligible consumer and small-business Visa credit or debit cards will be able to use their Android mobile phone to make fast, simple and secure payments in-store—all without pulling out a wallet. \nIn order to keep a customer’s card details safe, Android Pay does not send actual credit or debit card numbers to merchants with payment. Instead, through tokenization, Android Pay uses a virtual account number to represent a customer’s account information. U.S. Bank and Elavon merchant customers can accept Android Pay at the point of sale using terminals enabled with Near Field Communication (NFC). \n“Adding Android Pay as a mobile payment option for our cardmembers and merchant customers is one more way we make it convenient for our customers to do business with U.S. Bank and Elavon,” said Dominic Venturo, chief innovation officer at U.S. Bank. “Android Pay aligns with our commitment to innovation that leads to better experiences for our customers.” \nFor more information about Android Pay and U.S. Bank cards, please visit usbankgomobile.com/wallet/#/androidpay .
