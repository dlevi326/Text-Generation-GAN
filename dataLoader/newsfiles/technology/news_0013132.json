The new course will combine both traditional and emerging technologies to make students aware of the career opportunities available in new engineering sectors, like industrial 3D printing. \nLPW Managing Director, Dr Phil Carroll said “LPW are looking forward to seeing an emergence of prospective engineering apprentices in the Halton area. With the rapid growth we are experiencing, it is important to continue building the good working relationship currently in place with Riverside College.” \nRiverside College Head of Skills and Enterprise, Jayne Smith commented: “There has been a rapid expansion of demand for innovation and new technology skills by local employers. It will be invaluable having a prestigious company as LPW to help us shape the curriculum to ensure our students increase their employability opportunities by providing them with the skills employers need.” \nIn addition to this, LPW will be taking a group of 40 Riverside College engineering students to TCT Show + Personalize where they will take part in the Inspired Minds workshop. TCT + Personalize, 3D Systems and Black Country Atelier will partner for a third successive year to provide students with first-hand experience of CAD and AM technologies in a workshop environment. \nTCT Show + Personalize takes place on 30 th September – 1 st October at NEC, Birmingham.
