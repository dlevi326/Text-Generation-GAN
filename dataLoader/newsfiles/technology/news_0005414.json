With the greater adoption of cloud-based applications, mobile and BYOT solutions and IoT products, this complexity will only increase. Focus Point Technology, Inc. is a new Managed IT Services and Solutions provider that has been designed from the ground up to address this complexity by bringing high-quality, fully-vetted software and service providers into a single client advocacy consortium. Focus Point Technology (FPT) is proud to announce that Blue Hill Research ( http://bluehillresearch.com/ ) is publishing a Market Alert today on the benefits to enterprises and vendors of partnering with FPT on Technology Lifecycle Management (TLM) initiatives.\n“Telecom expense management, enterprise mobility management, IT asset management, and IT service management all exist in their own silos, making it difficult for CIOs to gain true visibility into the overall financial, technical, and operational management of their IT ecosystems,” states Hyoun Park, Chief Research Officer of Blue Hill Research. “By bringing together service providers focused on client retention, aggregating this data into a single view for management and payment, and providing benchmarking tools, Blue Hill believes that Focus Point provides enterprises with a unique opportunity to optimize their technology environments\".\nThe white paper discusses the challenges in this space faced by Enterprise IT organizations, and how FPT is addressing those challenges. FPT has combined a select group of best-of-breed vendors, sharing one set of ethics, a centralized portal called FPT360, a self-assessment tool called Technology Control Quotient (TCQ), a robust vendor payment solution called OnePay and a strong service infrastructure. Blue Hill Research sees FPT approaching client engagements not as a standard integrator or aggregator, but as an independent client advocate, helping select the best service and software options in the TLM space.\nThe whitepaper can be downloaded directly from the Blue Hill Research web site at http://bluehillresearch.com/focus-point-technology-develops-a-new-standard-for-technology-management/ .\nFocus Point Technology, Inc.
