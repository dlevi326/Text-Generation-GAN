Non-Members can get a preview of the Island before the full experience becomes available on October 6 – the same day the fourth book in the series from “New York Times” best-selling cartoonist Stephan Pastis, “Timmy Failure: Sanitized for Your Protection,” is released.\nWhen kids explore Timmy’s new Poptropica Island, they will see that danger lurks and criminals hide around every corner. To solve this mystery, they are going to need the best detective money can buy. However, that detective is not Timmy Failure – but don’t try to tell him that. In this new book-based quest, Poptropica Players will come face-to-face with the virtual world’s craziest cast of characters ever, including his sidekick Total, the polar bear; Rollo Tookus, Timmy’s best friend; and Corrina Corrina, his elusive nemesis. And when they solve the mystery of Timmy Failure’s missing pants, they will embark on a madcap adventure through the Island.\n“Timmy is always confident in his abilities to solve a mystery – but in truth, he is not smart and can't solve a thing,” said his creator Pastis. “It will be so exciting to see Timmy and his polar bear Total come to life on Poptropica.”\nPoptropica Members who play Timmy Failure Island with Early Access will receive a flapping “Greatness flag,” and anyone else who helps Timmy find his pants will receive a detective hat for their avatar.\nExcitement for the launch of Timmy Failure Island began last month when kids got a sneak peek of the new quest with the debut of its Main Street. All month long there were weekly prizes and giveaways, including a free Timmy Failure Island poster customized with the user’s avatar, a Timmy Failure scarf and a Total the polar bear costume.\nHundreds of millions of kids have visited Poptropica since its launch eight years ago, and the number grows every day. Poptropica players come from more than 200 different countries and territories and have their web browsers set to more than 100 different languages.\nKids can stay up to date on news about upcoming new Islands and other exciting developments in the world of Poptropica on the official Poptropica blog .
