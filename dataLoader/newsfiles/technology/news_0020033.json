At IFA today, Toshiba is revealing the Satellite Radius 12 convertible. The name might sound a little boring, but the specifications certainly aren't. Toshiba claims it's the \"world's first 12.5-inch Ultra HD 4K convertible.\"\nToshiba's Satellite Radius 12 will be released in Full HD (1920 x 1080) or 4K (3840 x 2160) displays. Inside there's Intel's latest Skylake processors up to the Core i7, and up to 8GB of RAM. Toshiba is really pitching this at the ultimate convertible, with a hinge that transforms this ordinary laptop into a tablet very much like Lenovo's Yoga. »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:02:46.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
