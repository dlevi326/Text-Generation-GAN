So you get some of these top predators, things like marine mammals, whales and dolphins. \n\"These robots will be collecting continuous data there, and that's something you can only get through this sort of technology, alternatives would be research ships, which tend to just take moments of information rather than a long-time series through using this type of technology.\" \nTo capture information, the robots are covered in a range of different sensors and cameras. \nThomas has marine acoustic monitors on board to pick up any underwater noises of marine mammals communicating. \nThe submarine glider, also known as a Slowcum, is equipped with sensors capable of measuring the water temperature and acoustic 'pingers' to detect plankton and shoals of fish. \nSouthampton-based marine scientist, Lavinia Suberg, said she hopes the technology will help them discover much more about marine life. \n\"Thomas is fitted with sensors that provide us with information mainly on the surface of the water column, whereas the underwater submarine provides us with information on the water column itself - the physical characteristics and productivity. \n\"We then combine this information with the purpose of finding biodiversity hotspots in the ocean. What we want to find out is: are there certain areas that are particularly diverse and if so, why.\" \nThe three-week mission is expected to end later this month. \nHowever, the smart vehicle has the ability to harvest solar and wind energy, meaning it could potentially remain offshore, delving into the depths for answers, for several months yet.
