We help brands transform complex and boring information to very simple and attractive infographics for Marketing and Sale. Founders: Ochawin Chirasottikul (Win) Inspiration: In 2012, after we launched our first mobile application, we used infographic media to promote our application - but somehow people were more interested in our infographic media than the actual application. That's when the lightbulb switched on. We made some infographics and tested them out, and the result was very impressive. We saw many shares and likes of our infographics on social media continuously. We saw some room for this product to grow so we decided to focus on making awesome infographics - and that is how the company started. Records: Award Runner-up Award from \"AIS Startup Weekend 2011\". This is what I mentioned earlier about our mobile application. It started from an app, then we shifted it to the 1st Infographic Publishing Service in Thailand Transaction. We have created more than 3,000 Infographics Active users. We have worked with more than 200 big corporates in Thailand. 124k Facebook organic 'likes'. Current move: We're going to make Infographic Thailand the first choice for people when it comes to infographics (Think of infographics, think of Infographic Thailandâ€¦ kind of feeling). Next move: We received some funding from an angel investor to establish the company. But after we decided to focus on making infographics, we bought all the shares back from the angel investor and now we run the company by ourselves. Fun fact: Extend to other types of content creation service for marketing and sales. Goal: To create long-lasting value infographic propositions for customers. 90 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:04:34.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
