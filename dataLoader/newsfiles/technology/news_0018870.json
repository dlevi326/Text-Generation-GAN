Date:9/3/2015 \nNEW YORK , Sept. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- About artificial organsArtificial organs are human-made bio-artificial devices, which are implanted or integrated into individuals to replace or support natural organs. These include artificial heart, kidney, pancreas, and cochlear implants. Biocompatible materials such as polymers (polyurethane, polysulfone, and porous polypropylene), biologics, ceramics, and metals are used to develop artificial organs. These organs are incorporated with different technologies like sensors, biomaterials, and innovative delivery systems. Artificial organs perform the function of the natural organ and help in extending a patient's lifespan. In few cases, artificial organs are capable of eliminating the need for organ transplantation altogether.Technavio's analysts forecast the global artificial organ market to grow at a CAGR of 7.99% over the period 2014-2019.Covered in this reportIn this report, Technavio covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global artificial organ market for 2015-2019.
