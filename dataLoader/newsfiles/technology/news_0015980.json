Environmentalists and beekeepers cheered when the court reversed the EPA's approval of sulfoxaflor, which Dow sells under the brand names Transform and Closer.\nThe judge said approval was based on flawed data and that sulfoxaflor is part of a classification of pesticides that are said to be highly poisonous to honeybees.\nThe EPA said it was reviewing the court's decision. Dow said that while it disagreed with the judge, it would work with the EPA to implement the court order.\nScientists say pesticides have played a large part in a massive die-off of honeybee hives across the U.S. in recent years.\nBees are essential for pollinating crops.\nThe chemical industry has disputed the link between bee deaths and pesticides.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T04:24:51.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
