We believe these decisions send a strong message to other potential infringers.\" \nThe Federal Circuit not only upheld the ITC's finding that Mentalix directly infringed Crossmatch patent '344, but that \"Suprema performed market research on its competitors' patents and products, then actively encouraged Mentalix's activities while willfully blinding itself to the infringing nature of those activities.\" Crossmatch successfully obtained exclusion and cease and desist orders from the ITC against Suprema's infringing devices. \nAbout Crossmatch Crossmatch helps organizations solve their identity management challenges through biometrics.
