But the awards, now in their 25th year, have gained their own prestige within the scientific community, with each individual 'Ig' presented to winners by a Nobel Laureate. \nProfessor Enfield and his co-authors Dr Mark Dingemanse and Dr Francisco Torreira of the Max Planck Institute for Pyscholinguistics in the Netherlands were recognised for their 2013 PLOS ONE paper revealing 'Huh' is a universal word. \nIn a major cross-linguistic study, they sampled 31 languages and found all have a word with a near-identical sound and function as 'Huh' in the English language; evidence, they proposed, that 'Huh' is an indispensable tool in human communication. \n\"We are delighted that our research has been recognised with an Ig Nobel Prize, because it lives up to the awards' mission to celebrate research that first makes people laugh and then think. It's fitting because misunderstandings themselves can so often do this,\" said Professor Enfield, Chair of the University of Sydney's Department of Linguistics.

And on average, no five minutes of conversation go by in any language without someone attempting to fix a misunderstanding. \nThe researchers studied the Aboriginal language of Murrinh-Patha in Northern Australia, Mandarin Chinese in Taiwan, Argentine Sign Language, and Siwu in Ghana, among others. The findings suggest that the universal foundations of language are in human social cognition. \n\"We humans excel at monitoring each others' states of understanding, and we are masters of the kind of cooperation and collaboration that mutual understanding requires,\" said Professor Enfield. \nLanguage scientists have historically laboured over the study of conversation, but the research of Professor Enfield and his colleagues provide further evidence for a long sought-after finding: a universal principle in how humans communicate in conversation. \n\"Our findings could help computers to communicate in more 'human' ways, for instance when they don't understand voice commands. They also have applications in language teaching and cross-cultural communication: knowing how and when to use these tools can help people to secure mutual understanding quickly and effectively,\" said lead author of the PLOS ONE paper, Dr Dingemanse. \nThe research is part of a five-year European Research Council (ERC) project led by Professor Enfield. \nThree talking points on human communication 'Huh' and its variants appear in 31 languages People stop for clarification in conversation once every 90 seconds People share the burden of fixing misunderstanding in conversation . \nMore information: Info about the study (published in PLOS ONE in 2013) which has just won an Ig Nobel Prize: huh.ideophone.org \nInfo about the new PLOS ONE study published on 16 September 2015: repair.ideophone.org/frequently-asked-questions/", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T05:04:33.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
