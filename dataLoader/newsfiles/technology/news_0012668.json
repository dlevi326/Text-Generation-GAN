It is claimed to be the world’s smallest sensor capable of operation up to 180°C.\nModel HT356B01 uses the same 6.35mm cube titanium housing as its Model 356A01 predecessor. It features improved strain relief with a larger, stronger crimp tube and is compatible with an ICP (IEPE) signal conditioner or readout device. Its high temperature capability makes it ideal for use in a wide range of applications.\nAdditional product highlights include 5mV/g sensitivity, measurement range of ±1,000g peak and the highest overload limit – 10,000g – compared with competing devices. An integral 1.5m cable to 4-pin connector and supplied mating cable assembly terminating in BNC plugs complete the Model HT356B01 package.\nTechnical specifications encompass frequency range of 2 to 8,000Hz (y and z axes) and 2 to 5,000Hz (x axis) all ±5%, frequency range on x axis above 8kHz at ±1dB, resonant frequency above 50kHz and weight without cable of 1.0grams.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/PCB_P4478-%20PCB%20Piezotronics%20launches%20smallest%20triaxial%20ICP%20accelerometer.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T11:43:13.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
