He will return to his job as governor of Wisconsin, where his term runs through 2018.\n\"Today, I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top,\" Walker said in a news conference. \"I encourage other Republican presidential candidates to consider doing the same so the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive conservative alternative to the current front-runner.\"\nWalker said that is \"fundamentally important to the future of the party and more importantly to the future of our country\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:03:16.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
