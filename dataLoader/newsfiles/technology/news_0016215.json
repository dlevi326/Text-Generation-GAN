Location tracking pinpoints the user’s location on campus, and his or her profile, complete with photo and personal information, appears onscreen for campus security. In addition to a direct line to authorities, the device can also activate a silent or audible alarm function. \nThe POM’s compact size makes it easy for students to carry at all times – in a pocket, purse or keychain – so users are not fumbling to find a cell phone or app in an emergency, when every second counts and staying focused on the situation at hand is paramount. Although the device is discreet, it can also be personalized and worn like an accessory with school colors, mascot or logo. Designed around busy lives, the POM only needs to be charged every 10-14 days. When the charge gets too low, the POM automatically puts itself to sleep to preserve battery life, ensuring the device is still able to make an emergency call lasting up to 8 minutes. \n“All parents are apprehensive about sending their child off to college,” said Lukas Lampe, co-founder and director of POMCO. “Knowing that their son or daughter has a direct line to campus security through the POM gives parents some comfort and peace of mind.” \nJust as the device’s portability and low maintenance make it ideal for students, the POM system’s streamlined implementation process is designed to be easy for universities to adopt. The cloud-based software requires no installation or set-up, allows for easy upgrades and utilizes existing cellular networks to connect users. \nUpon move-in in September, The Sage Colleges handed out complimentary POM devices to more than 1,400 students. \nThe response from students receiving the device was strong. “Students appreciated Sage making this investment on their behalf, and many said they plan to carry the device at all times,” said Trish Cellemme, vice president for student life. \nThe POM system is available to colleges and universities through flexible pricing models, and can be tied into existing student fees or offered on an individual subscription basis. The low annual subscription fee tailored to students and parents includes the POM and the POM app, and at $30 - $45, is less than the cost of most textbooks. \nAbout POMCO Based in Clifton Park, N.Y., Peace of Mind Company is dedicated to solving personal safety problems and providing peace of mind for parents, students and families. Our company was founded on the belief that we can do something greater to protect the people that we love. The POM device is our first step in fulfilling that vision.
