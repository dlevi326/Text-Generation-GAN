Dougherty has been named Chief Executive Officer of the Secure Identity & Biometrics Association (SIBA) . Dougherty joins SIBA from the Raytheon Company, where he worked for 6 years as a Director of Business Development in Homeland Security Programs. \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150921/268691LOGO \nDougherty has over 20 years of legal and policy experience in the federal government. At the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), he was appointed Ombudsman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services where he led an office of 27 professionals with a $6.5M budget. Dougherty served as Legislative Counsel to Senator Jon Kyl on the Senate Judiciary Committee and prior to that, as a Senior Policy Advisor at DHS Headquarters. He also served as an appellate litigator with the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Immigration Litigation, and as a Special Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. \n\"SIBA is a strong organization that represents some of the best companies in the identity management, biometrics and cyber marketplace,\" remarked Dougherty, \"and I'm very pleased to lead it. I'll be working with our members to engage with government, the private sector and stakeholders on the advantages that flow from identity assurance. There is deep subject matter expertise here, and we mean to leverage it.\" \nDougherty added, \"I think that Janice Kephart and the Board of Directors have performed brilliantly in conceptualizing and leading SIBA to this point - SIBA's sponsorship of the BORDERPOL International Security Meeting on Terrorist Travel last week that featured key Congressional, executive branch and international stakeholders alongside leaders in identity management capabilities is just the most recent example of activity that is valuable to the public, government, and industry.\" \n\"Michael has sat on the SIBA Board of Directors from its inception,\" said Janice Kephart, former CEO and founder of SIBA. \"He has remarkable leadership experience in business and in government. Michael will assure continuity and growth at SIBA, promoting our mission to assist government and private sector entities in implementing sound solutions to their identity management challenges. I look forward to our continued momentum.\" \nMs. Kephart, currently Director of Homeland Security Solutions for MorphoTrak, LLC, will remain on the SIBA Board of Directors along with Chairman Troy Potter (L-3 National Security Solutions), former Chairman Paul Schuepp, and Board Members Ernest Baynard (Meridian Hill Strategies), Michael Petrov (Vision-Box), Lester Quintana (Cellucci Associates), Catherine Renner (Abanacle Corporation) and Teresa Wu (MorphoTrak, LLC). \nContact:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T17:50:47.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
