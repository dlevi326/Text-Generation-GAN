Will those responsible for ‘creating the fictitious employees’ ever be brought to book, will the money ever be recovered, and all those involved charged with fraudulent criminality in the worst possible way – I very much doubt!\nAnd this is exactly how the people of the province are suffering at the hands of the ruling party, where their wallets are more important to stuff to its maximum capacity than to ever even worry about service delivery and for that matter the lack of service delivery that exists.\nHow can any voter in the upcoming elections of 2016 trust the government of the day with anything when it cannot even see how it fraudulently infringed on service delivery, all at the cost of personal greed.\nThat the government should be lifted out of their comfort zone, and stand on the winner’s podium of the ‘golden medal winners of corruption, theft and fraud’ is not even a doubt it is a fact.\nThat they can be trusted after 2016 – an unequivocal no, no and another no – don’t let them fool you once again by stealing and not even being ashamed of the extent and magnitude of this debacle – an embarrassment par excellance to say the least.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:15:34.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
