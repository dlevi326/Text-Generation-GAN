The list represents the most comprehensive look at the most important segment of the economy—America’s independent entrepreneurs. Companies such as Yelp, Pandora, Timberland, Dell, Domino’s Pizza, LinkedIn, Zillow, and many other well-known names gained early exposure as members of the Inc. 5000.\n“We’re honored to be included in the Inc. 5000 again in 2015”, said Brad Windecker, President of Orchestra Software. “It’s an amazing achievement for the team at Orchestra. We’re innovating across our verticals and bringing exciting new solutions to market that solve the customers’ problems.”\nFounded in 2008, Orchestra Software has fostered a rapidly-growing customer base of small and mid-size businesses seeking industry-specific, cloud-based ERP software packages to replace off-the-shelf book keeping and inventory management.\nOrchestra Software generated $3 million in revenue in 2014, with a three-year growth increase of 207%. Orchestra Software’s revenue growth and job creation has also made a local impact, ranking among Oregon’s top 40 fastest-growing companies and top 10 fastest-growing employment rates for 2015.\n“The continued growth at Orchestra is a testament to the truly great products we have”, said Orchestra Software Vice President, Reshad Kazimee. “A growing company not only requires a successful sales strategy but also a solid customer foundation that continues to find value in our offerings. Retaining our customer base is equally important to our continued growth strategy.”\nWindecker attributes such growth trends to a combination of stellar talent and strategies that constantly drive Orchestra to the bleeding edge of innovation:\n“Orchestra’s performance comes from the people here and their dedication to constantly improving the way we deliver value to the customer. This team is deeply passionate about our customers and their challenges, so they work hard every day to deliver extraordinary results.”\nThe 2015 Inc. 5000 is the most competitive crop in the list’s history with listed companies averaging three-year growth of 490%, aggregate revenue of $205 billion while generating 647,000 jobs over the past three years.\nMore about Orchestra Software\nLocated in Beaverton, Oregon, Orchestra Software is an enterprise software company that creates industry vertical solutions that are scalable for large companies, but affordable enough for small growing companies.
