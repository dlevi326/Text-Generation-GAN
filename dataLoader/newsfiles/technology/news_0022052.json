Tshabalala was stabbed in the pelvic area as they struggled over a knife which she had used to stab his hands. Sebolai is accused of murdering her.\n\"I did not see any possible causes of death. This wound did not convince me of a possible cause of death because of its location,\" Dr Paul Morule told the High Court in Johannesburg, sitting in Palm Ridge. \"That part of the body does not have vital organs or tissues.\"\nOn Wednesday, Morule said he had to make an incision down the front of Tshabalala's body to do a proper examination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:06:12.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
