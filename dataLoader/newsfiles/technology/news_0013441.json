The Watch apps are about to be quicker, better and more featured. \nBut just not yet. \nLast week, at the “monster” Apple event in San Francisco, Apple announced the watchOS 2 would be released on September 16 — the same day as the iOS 9 update for iPhones and iPads. \nBut just before the software was due to go out, Apple released a statement saying it had been delayed to another time. \nIn the lead up to the launch of the software, app developers working with pre-release versions of the Watch operating system complained that the software was draining the Watch’s battery at an extraordinary rate. Some said the software wasn’t ready for release. \nThe reaction from fans was disappointment, outrage and disbelief, all expressed in tweets of 140 characters or less. So angry #WatchOS2 won't be here today — Jd Williams (@jdwilly99) September 16, 2015 Really Apple?! How do you discover a bug at the last minute causing delay of release? Thank goodness you've been beta testing! #WatchOS2 — Tracy Bolte (@balthazar2k4) September 16, 2015 wtf they delayed the WatchOS2 update :(", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T20:10:39.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
