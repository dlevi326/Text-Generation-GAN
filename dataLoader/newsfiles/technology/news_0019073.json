The donations occur on a rolling basis through 2015 to September 2016, and are distributed among nine different ReStore locations throughout the nation. Those outlets then sell the home products at a fraction of the retail price, with the proceeds going to help fund home construction and repairs within the community.\n“This partnership is a growing component of the ATGStores.com ‘All That’s Good Deeds’ program, which began with Habitat for Humanity,” said Michelle Newbery, President of ATGStores.com. \"Community outreach is a big part of our program's focus, and now we're helping this great organization benefit even more communities.\"\nATGStores.com is committed to continuing its support of Habitat and its mission of creating affordable housing for low-income families. Habitat families must qualify for and purchase their homes, as well as commit 250 hours of sweat equity toward the construction of their home or other Habitat homes in their community.\n“We are grateful to ATGStores.com for its renewed commitment to Habitat this year,” said Sue Henderson, Vice President, U.S. Operations, Habitat for Humanity International. “Because of this product donation, more families will have access to safe, decent, affordable housing.”\nIn addition to the ATGStores.com partnership with Habitat for Humanity ReStores, Lowe’s has a five-year commitment with Habitat for Humanity International that will bring its total contributions to more than $63 million since 2003.\nATGStores.com, a Lowe’s Company since 2011, specializes in home improvement and home furnishing products and has been serving its customers since 1999. The company features more than 3.5 million products in a host of different categories ranging from lighting and plumbing to furniture and hardware.
