Patterns, colours, fabrics and material are experimented with to present collections at New York, Paris, Milan, London and India’s fashion weeks. The pattern seeped into the décor segment long time back, but remained limited to soft furnishings, that is bed sheets, and artworks. Only recently, with increase in demand of services of interior designers and opening of décor stores, a lot has changed. Floral fabrics for upholstery and drapes, wallpaper, and floral-inspired accessories like cushions, lampshades, mirrors, artifacts, carpets, there is a lot on the platter available. Keep it formal\nDrawing room and entrance are the formal or guest areas in a house. Printed upholstery often lends a sense of comfort and casualness to the surroundings; however, using fabric with embroidered-floral motifs defines a formal-seating area. The key is to use florals sparingly, maybe on an accent chair or just one couch. Floral drapes and wallpaper should be avoided in formal areas. Floral cushions and artifacts break the monotony of plain interiors. A beautiful silk flower arrangement is welcoming in the lobby area. On the other hand, vibrant floral fabrics lend warmth to lounges and bedrooms. Dine with flowers\nFloral paintings and botanical prints go well with the decor of dining rooms. Silk-flower arrangements, candle stands with floral candle rings accessorise a dining area perfectly. Plates on walls or a shelf in floral prints are other options to go for. Plates have been used as a décor element in various eating joints, but these are an apt décor item in the dining area of the house as well. By your bedside\nExperiment by using a mix and match of floral prints. Coordinated floral bedding and curtains, flower prints on the wall, printed lampshades, pretty photo frames make it a pleasant morning to wake up to. If the size of the room is large, floral wallpaper completes the décor. Keep the colors light. Pale blues and greys, peaches and pinks, moss green, whites and creams work best in a bedroom. Ensure that you judiciously pick elements; do not go for an overhaul. Take another step\nOur washrooms are usually about printed tiles and fancy bathware. Though you can’t introduce a lot of changes, try placing a small floral topiary on the counter to bring a dull bathroom to life. Floral-printed tiles, shower curtains or blinds are some of the easy choices. At your liberty\nOpen verandahs or glass rooms are perfect settings for anything floral. Here going overboard is a welcome move. Cane sofas with English floral prints, floral rugs, pots of natural flowers, creepers and vines, roll all of these together to make the verandah look inviting. An interesting alternative\nIf you are not fond of floral prints, try prints of birds and leaves on curtains and bed sheets. Birds print is classic and renders a touch of old-world charm to the surroundings. In the words of interior designer Billy Baldwin, “Stick to the things you really love.
