Officials did not reveal their identities or say which firms they worked for. \nThey could face up to 15 years in jail and heavy fines if found guilty of breaking Indonesian laws that ban starting forest fires. \nTens of thousands have fallen ill in parts of Indonesia as the haze thickened over the past fortnight, and the smog has led to unhealthy air quality and reduced visibility in neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia. \n\"The president's instruction is clear -- law enforcement must be firm so that this will not happen again next year,\" Haiti told reporters late Wednesday, announcing the arrests. \nPresident Joko Widodo pledged this week to crack down on companies and individuals behind the fires, and hundreds of extra police and investigators have been sent to haze-hit areas to hunt for those responsible. \nThey joined military personnel and water-bombing aircraft sent to tackle the fires. \nIn addition to the seven arrested, 133 people have been named suspects, Haiti said. This is a legal step in Indonesia that means investigators have enough evidence to consider filing charges against someone. \nIndonesia has come under pressure from its neighbours to halt the smog outbreaks, an annual problem in Southeast Asia during the dry season. \nThe situation has been made worse this year by an El Nino weather system, which produces tinder-dry conditions in Indonesia and increases the risk of fires. \nThere were also fears that the haze could affect this weekend's glitzy Formula One night race in Singapore, but organisers have insisted the event will go ahead. \nSoutheast Asia has been enveloped in choking haze from agricultural fires in Indonesia over the past fortnight, prompting flight cancellations, closing schools and raising fears this weekend's glitzy Formula One night race in Singapore could be affected. \nThe haze is a regular occurrence, with the region wheezing through outbreaks every year during the dry season. Here are some questions and answers about what causes the outbreaks and why they keep happening. \nWhy do the outbreaks happen and when did they start? \nThe main cause is illegal fires started in peatland and forest on Indonesia's Sumatra island and the Indonesian part of Borneo to quickly and cheaply clear land for palm oil and pulp and paper plantations. They increased in number as plantations expanded, in particular due to rising global demand for palm oil, a key ingredient in everyday goods such as shampoo and biscuits. \nThe outbreaks started in 1997, with what is still regarded as the most serious haze on record. It followed rapid expansion of plantations in the preceding years, and coincided with an El Nino weather system that made conditions drier than usual in Indonesia. \nWho is affected by the haze? \nThe haze has a devastating impact on daily life every year on Sumatra and the Indonesian part of Borneo. This year, air quality has hit hazardous levels, tens of thousands have contracted respiratory illnesses, many flights have been cancelled and schools closed. \nFrom Indonesia, the smog is blown over Southeast Asia, and fouls the air in neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia. Schools were closed in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur and neighbouring states on Tuesday, while dense clouds have shrouded the skyline of financial hub Singapore. \nHow bad is it this year? \nMore than 2,000 fire \"hotspots\" -- either areas already on fire or very hot and likely to soon go up in flames -- were detected by satellites on Sumatra and Indonesian Borneo Tuesday, with the situation exacerbated by an El Nino weather system that has made conditions tinder-dry. \nBut the crisis eased in the past two days, and the haze has been much worse in the past. The most serious recent outbreak was in 2013, when air quality deteriorated to the worst level for years in Singapore and Malaysia. \nWill the Singapore Grand Prix really be cancelled? \nIt's unlikely. Organisers of Formula One's only night race have acknowledged the situation is volatile but so far insist the event, which is coupled with pop concerts, will go on. \nStill, Lewis Hamilton may find himself battling through smog in reduced visibility on his way to a third world title, as mask-wearing spectators watch him race along the narrow street circuit which snakes past iconic landmarks. \nWhat is Indonesia doing to stop it? \nWater-bombing helicopters and planes have been deployed to fight the fires, and aircraft are also \"cloud-seeding\", which involves using chemicals to induce rain. \nAbout 3,000 extra military and police personnel have been sent to Sumatra to help fight the fires and catch those responsible. The national police say that 133 people and seven companies are being investigated over the illegal blazes. However, environmentalists note that few convictions have resulted from such probes in the past. \nBut why is it still happening after all these years? \nAlthough starting fires to clear land is punishable by long jail terms and hefty fines in Indonesia, law enforcement is weak and corruption rife. \nMajor companies have \"zero burn\" policies, meaning they have vowed not to clear land using fires. But activists are sceptical that all firms are sticking to their pledges, and small landowners have also been blamed for starting fires to clear land. \nIndonesia's neighbours -- in particular Singapore -- have been calling for years for more to be done to stop the outbreaks. Jakarta agreed this week to share information with the city-state on companies accused of starting fires, which could lead to prosecutions there. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T16:17:41.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
