Duarte Garrido reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nEver wondered what it feels like to be rocket launched at the speed of 1000 miles per hour with the very real possibility that your vehicle could sudenly burst into flames? Meet the Bloodhound. A half jet plane, half racing car built to be the fastest, most advanced land vehicle in the world. At its official unveiling in London Thursday, one of its engineers explained all the bits and pieces - even the missing ones - like the hybrid oxidized rocket. (SOUNDBITE) (English) KEVIN MURRAY, SYSTEM ENGINEER, SAYING: \"That's an integral part of the car. Once the car get up to roughly 350 mile per hour on the strip, the rocket will provide the rest of the thrust to get the car up to somewhere in the region of a thousand miles an hour.\" The Bloodhound has three power sources: A supercharged jaguar V8 engine A cluster of hybrid rockets And this Rolls Royce EJ200 Jet straight out of an Eurofighter Typhoon. Its intricate carbon fibre, steel and alloy exterior guarantees it will withstand deceleration from 1000 miles an hour to zero, in less than a minute. The car can go from zero to 1000 miles per hour in 55 seconds. It's jet engine could suck all the air out of an average sized house in less than 3 seconds. So, apart from the general WOW-factor, project director Richard Noble hopes it will drive students to become future engineers. (SOUNDBITE) (English) RICHARD NOBLE, PROJECT DIRECTOR, SAYING: \"We have a really big problem in Britain in terms of the shortage of scientists and engineers. And the problem actually can be traced right back to the primary schools, simply because there's not inspiration provided.\" The ten million pound vehicle will eventually be transported to the desert in South Africa. Where Jet pilot Andy Green will take the wheel. and attempt to break the World high speed record But he'll need to be patient ... with testing still necessary in the UK and South Africa next year.
