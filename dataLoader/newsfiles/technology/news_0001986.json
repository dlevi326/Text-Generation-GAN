The 1.73MW-output \"Mobara Solar Utopia\" is a mega- (large-scale) solar power plant financed by six leading local companies and constructed on an idle site owned by Mobara City (Fig. 1). Local related companies led the project, provided engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services and structured project financing with the Chiba Bank Ltd loaning the money.

(source: Toyo Chemical Engineering) \nWith a view to promoting solar power generation, which is locally produced, as is gas, and effectively using its idle real estate, Mobara City called for solar power plant proposals based on its land in June 2013. Mobara City had acquired the 38,035m 2 area of land with the aim of developing a residential estate; however, the site had been unused for more than 30 years with no clear idea of beginning the development. The land included some farmland as well as forestland. \nOut of the five projects filed in response to the city's request, Toyo Chemical Engineering Corp's (Minato-ku, Tokyo) proposal was selected in July 2013. Toyo Chemical Engineering has grown since its establishment for the plant construction and maintenance of Mitsui Chemicals Inc's Mobara Factory. Despite the location of its headquarters in Tokyo, its largest business foothold is in Mobara City. \n\"Our proposal was highly appreciated because it gave priority to returning profits to local society by, for example, commercializing the project with the funds provided by the local enterprises that agreed with our goal to make a contribution to local society through the solar power generation project,\" said Takashi Kitamura, project manager at Energy Business Dept, Toyo Chemical Engineering.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:43:25.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
