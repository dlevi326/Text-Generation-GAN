This is the first step of many more to come.”\nThe building will be located near the Museum of the Future, launched earlier this year in Dubai, and will act as temporary headquarters for its staff. It will be approximately 2,000 square feet and will be printed layer-by-layer using a 20-foot tall 3D printer, then assembled on site in a matter of weeks. All interior furniture, detailing, and structural components will also be built using 3D printing technology. This will make it the most advanced, fully functional 3D printed building to date.\nAbout Us:\nTechnology’s impact on commercial real estate is moving at an exponential rate.
