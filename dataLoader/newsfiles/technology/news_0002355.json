We are pleased that our research work and facilities are acknowledged by NATO and this week’s meeting cements Lancaster’s reputation as the leading centre for Wireless Broadband Communications research. \n“The results of this exercise will be presented at the 2015 international conference for military communications in America, opening new opportunities for research collaboration with leading European and North American partners.” \nRather than relying on a central hub, as in most Wi-Fi systems, the technology operates using computer systems which are connected to each other via the Internet, allowing them to transmit multimedia, such as audio, video and data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T13:23:55.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
