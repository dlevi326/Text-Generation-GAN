Available now for download through Google Play and iTunes, the SelectHealth member app incorporates selected modules from RxEOB’s innovative personal mobile pharmacy benefits application, emWellics®. “Mobile technology is now a major member engagement tool in the health care industry, and with our partnership with SelectHealth, we continue to make strides in advancing mobile access health to those who it benefits the most – health plan members,” said Robert S. Oscar, CEO of RxEOB. “Just like RxEOB’s pharmacy benefits app emWellics, SelectHealth’s new pharmacy benefits app provides members with the information they need about their pharmacy benefits faster and more effectively than ever before.”\nLaunched earlier this year, the SelectHealth app uses configurable mobile modules from RxEOB’s emWellics® app, designed to help members save on their medication purchases. Additionally, the app allows SelectHealth members to view their ID cards, find in-network doctors and pharmacies based on location, as well as look up claims and their most affordable drug options. These features are similar to those of RxEOB’s emWellics®, which grants users the ability to find drug pricing estimates and therapeutic medication options that allow the user to save money when purchasing their medications.\n“Our mobile team benefits from RxEOB’s experience in mobile applications as we launched the SelectHealth app earlier this year, and to date, we’ve had a great response from users who have downloaded and used the mobile pharmacy benefits app,” said Eric Cannon, PharmD, Chief of Pharmacy, SelectHealth, “Their staff worked closely with our mobile design and technical teams to assist with the development, integration and implementation of selected emWellics® modules into the SelectHealth app, and judging from the positive reviews we’ve received already, we know the app will be a huge benefit to our members for the foreseeable future.”\nThe SelectHealth app is available for Android and Apple mobile devices now.
