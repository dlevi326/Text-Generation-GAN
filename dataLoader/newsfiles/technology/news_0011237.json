Approximately 100,000 brick-and-mortar stores in China, such as Suning, and Intime, will establish strategic O2O collaboration agreements with Alibaba Group, which will cover marketing, customer management, post-sales management, logistics, and more. Through these omni-channel initiatives, customers will be able to participate in the 11.11 shopping festival no matter if they are online or offline. \n“Globalization is a critical priority for Alibaba Group’s strategy in 2015, as evidenced by the very encouraging growth in the number of international agreements and activities over the past several months,” said Mr. Zhang. “We are working closely with international brands, foreign governments, trade associations, and global retailers to make this year’s 11.11 shopping festival a truly and unprecedentedly global shopping experience for consumers, and a gateway for new brands and companies trying to reach the China marketplace and our 367 million active users.” \nThe 11.11 shopping festival began in 2009 with just 27 merchant participants as an event for when it was known as Taobao Mall for merchants and consumers to raise awareness of the value in online shopping.
