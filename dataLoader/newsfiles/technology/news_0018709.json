Achieving and maintaining optimal blood sugar and insulin sensitivity are the most important steps to protect oneself against the disease. \nDiabetes and Alzheimer's disease share biochemical similarities, like oxidative stress and damaging advanced glycogen end products (AGEs). Thus, strategies to prevent or manage insulin resistance may hold promise in protecting against Alzheimer's disease. \nAvoiding saturated fat, increasing consumption of monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids, instituting a program of regular exercise and utilizing natural therapeutics promote a healthy blood sugar. \nDr. Audrey Jones states that consumption of food, like vegetables, salmon and other cold-water fish, berries and dark-skinned fruits, coffee and chocolate, extra virgin olive oil and cold-pressed virgin coconut oil, plays an important role in preventing diabetes and Alzheimer's.
