Credit: NASA/Desiree Stover \nA critical part of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope successfully completed acoustic testing during the week of Aug. 3. The Integrated Science Instrument Module, or ISIM, passed all of the \"severe sound\" tests that engineers put it through. \nThe Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) is one of three major elements that comprise the Webb Observatory flight system. The others are the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) and the Spacecraft Element (Spacecraft Bus and Sunshield). \nThe ISIM was subjected to the acoustic test at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The ISIM was tested at five different sound levels to demonstrate it could survive the noise and vibrations it will experience when the Webb telescope is launched in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket. The sound experienced during launch comes primarily from the solid rocket motors of the launch vehicle. \nAt Goddard, the engineers use the Acoustic Test Chamber, a 42-foot-tall chamber, with 6-foot-diameter speaker horns to replicate the launch environment. The horns use an altering flow of gaseous nitrogen to produce a sound level as high as 150 decibels for two-minute tests. That's about the level of sound heard standing next to a jet engine during takeoff. \nDuring the acoustics test, the speakers can still be heard outside of its insulated massive metal doors. \nFollowing the acoustics test, the ISIM was pushed back into the Spacecraft Systems Development and Integration Facility (SSDIF) clean room so it could be un-bagged, and inspected. Once engineers made sure the ISIM passed the acoustics test, it was re-bagged and moved to the Electromagnetic Interference or EMI facility for electromagnetic interference testing. \nThe ISIM is just one of the many Webb telescope components that continue to be tested as the observatory begins to come together this year. The 6-foot-wide horns in this 42-foot-tall chamber can produce noise at levels as high as 150 dB.

Finding ... NASA provides a super-speed look at Webb Telescope progress March 27, 2013 \n(Phys.org) —NASA released a new sped-up, 32-second video that shows engineers working on some of the James Webb Space Telescope's flight components to integrate them together to ensure they will work perfectly together ... New video reveals NASA is 'spinning a Webb' July 11, 2013 \nNASA is spinning a \"Webb,\" and it is not about a spider, it's about a part of the James Webb Space Telescope that is being \"spin-tested\" in a centrifuge to prove it can withstand the rigors of space travel. Image: NASA clean room gets a heart-full of Webb November 28, 2013 \nThe James Webb Space Telescope's team welcomed back the \"heart\" of the observatory, known as the Integrated Science Instrument Module or ISIM, to the world's largest clean room at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, ... Webb's fully integrated 'heart' lowered into the chamber (w/ Video) June 17, 2014 \n(Phys.org) —Engineer Jack Marshall held his breath. The \"heart\" of the James Webb Space Telescope hung from a cable 30 feet in the air as it was lowered slowly into the massive thermal vacuum chamber at NASA's Goddard Space ... Image: NASA's Webb Telescope NIRSpec instrument September 3, 2014 \n(Phys.org) —A NASA photographer recently captured a \"NIRSpec-tacular\" photo of an instrument that will fly aboard NASA's James Webb Space Telescope when it launches in 2018. Recommended for you Move over Milky Way, elliptical galaxies are the most habitable in the cosmos September 2, 2015 \nThe search for extraterrestrial life is surely one of the most important tasks we humans can undertake. However, the cosmos is vast and we don't really have any idea which bits of it are actually habitable. But what if we ... What happened to early Mars' atmosphere? New study eliminates one theory September 2, 2015 \nScientists may be closer to solving the mystery of how Mars changed from a world with surface water billions of years ago to the arid Red Planet of today. At Saturn, one of these rings is not like the others September 2, 2015 \nWhen the sun set on Saturn's rings in August 2009, scientists on NASA's Cassini mission were watching closely. It was the equinox—one of two times in the Saturnian year when the sun illuminates the planet's enormous ring ... New Horizons team selects potential Kuiper Belt flyby target August 29, 2015 \nNASA has selected the potential next destination for the New Horizons mission to visit after its historic July 14 flyby of the Pluto system. The destination is a small Kuiper Belt object (KBO) known as 2014 MU69 that orbits ... Prawn Nebula: Cosmic recycling September 2, 2015 \nDominating this image is part of the nebula Gum 56, illuminated by the hot bright young stars that were born within it. For millions of years stars have been created out of the gas in this nebula, material which is later ...
