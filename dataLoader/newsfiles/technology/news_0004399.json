Short-term, our response is the only rational response and that is to take capacity out. \n“We will continue to drive costs down by deploying bigger ships and filling them,” while adding that its 2M alliance “gives us an advantage as it allows us to fill the ships in a sustainable way.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:19:05.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
