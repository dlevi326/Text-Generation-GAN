CEO Dr. James Hayward said the botanical-DNA based authentication company has only begun to make its mark. Shares of Applied DNA Sciences have risen over 45% in the past month and are up 80% year-to-date. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) is down 15% in the past month and 4% so far this year over worries about valuations and price-gouging. The company’s solutions and its SigNature DNA mark protect products, brands, entire supply chains, and intellectual property of companies, governments and consumers from theft, counterfeiting, fraud and diversion. The company’s products provide a forensic chain of evidence and can be used to prosecute perpetrators. Last week the company announced a pilot program with printer Creative Labels to help its customers protect their respective products with anti-counterfeiting technologies, offering them an entry level opportunity to prove the value of this technology before developing their own SigNature DNA. For those not ready to make changes to their main label, Creative Labels will offer a SigNature DNA Seal of Authenticity that cannot be duplicated. 'We can put that mark on virtually anything, we have yet to fail,' said Hayward.
