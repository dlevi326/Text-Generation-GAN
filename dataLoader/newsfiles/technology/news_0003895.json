David McKinley (R-WV) and Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT) for introducing legislation that would give more students access to the internet at home.\n“The Digital Learning Equity Act of 2015 (H.R. 3582) addresses the growing ‘homework gap’ by putting measures in place that would ensure high-speed home internet access in all communities – specifically in rural areas. It would provide support to develop, implement and evaluate innovative strategies to increase out-of-school internet access and calls on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to conduct a national study on the educational trends and behaviors associated with access to digital learning resources used outside of the classrooms.\n“According to a study by the Pew Research Center, 70 percent of teachers assign homework that requires students to have high-speed internet access at home, yet a third of homes do not subscribe to broadband services. During efforts to modernize the E-Rate last year, many ISTE members wrote to the FCC about students who could not complete homework, take online quizzes or collaborate on projects with peers because they lacked a home internet connection.\n“ISTE believes all students deserve access to on-demand digital learning wherever they are, and we applaud Representatives McKinley and Welch for their leadership on this issue. We believe addressing this homework gap will ensure learning is not interrupted for students who should have the opportunity to thrive, achieve and contribute.”\nAbout ISTE\nThe International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE®) is the premier nonprofit organization serving educators and education leaders committed to empowering connected learners in a connected world.
