From best practices to industry data, this weekly communique reports on trend data, process improvement, and technology evaluations about picking, packing, shipping and profitability.\nSteven Page, reported in National Products Insider, that natural health products have become increasingly popular in Canada, and as Canadians continue to purchase items that restore and maintain their health, they are teaching younger generations similar habits to preserve their quality of life. Canada is a lucrative market and represents an opportunity for U.S. brands to generate additional new revenue-likely 5 to 25 percent more. However, in order for brands to succeed, they should understand the marketplace and the nuances that coincide with selling natural health products in Canada.\nDoing business in Canada appears to be a natural extension for those already doing business in the United States because these countries share a large border, a free trade agreement and no language barrier. Canada currently imports more than US$2 billion worth of U.S. goods and services per day. Cross-border spending will reach US$300 billion a year by 2018, and Canadians represent a high percentage of e-commerce shoppers contributing to this growth. Canadian consumers often behave like American consumers and frequently receive information through similar channels.\nAbout Pcdata USA\nBased in East Granby, CT, Pcdata USA (www.pcdatausa.com/about-us/about-pcdata-usa) is a global logistics systems leader for supply chain automation.
