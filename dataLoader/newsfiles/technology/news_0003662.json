But surely a little innovation and creativity would not go amiss. And while I don’t have the answer, I think this is an opportunity lost\nIf we are honest, most of the comments are 80% drivel, with the good content often being drowned in the flood of - first come first serve - garbage. And when reading the comments it often is obvious that there are clear agenda’s left right and center.\nEven NEWS24 finds itself guilty of bias at times. As reflected by the tone and headlines of certain articles. Ranging from attempts at click bate to stirring the pot or clear support from one side or the other. Not always mind you, but in specific instances one can clearly see where loyalties lie, rather than being a platform of impartial balanced reporting. But then again that does drive clicks and add revenue does it?\nSo what does News24 do? It throws out the baby with the bath water. Why, because it’s too hard!\nPersonally I wonder if this decision is not ultimately just one of expedience. Not willing to make the hard yards and actually actively manage something that has been a big part of the platforms success. Maybe deep down inside there is a fear of being held to direct account, or an unwillingness to accept divergent views and thereby protecting fragile egos. It surely will make life far more cozy for journalists to simply put things out there and not be questioned directly. And of course not having to deal with it, is far easier than actually doing something proactive, innovative and creative. Sure, knowing you are dammed if you do and dammed if you don’t.\nI am not defending trolling, but in this world of tech there has to be a decent approach that will remove that element. Unfortunately I think News24 is taking the easy way out, showing a lack of … ahem… courage.\nTo borrow a Quote: Robin Williams’s in Robots (2005) “ Rodney Copperbottom: This is our moment to shine, to show them what we're made of.
