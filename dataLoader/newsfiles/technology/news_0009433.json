The company will be located at Hall 7.1, Stand B-026, under the theme \"Manage the Digital Transformation.\" This is BrandMaker’s first time exhibiting at this event. \nA leading provider of marketing technology whose platforms are used at companies such as Audi, Bayer, and Hewlett Packard, BrandMaker will present integrated solutions that companies can use to plan and control their marketing across all channels and to publish relevant content on all digital channels, social media, and mobile devices. BrandMaker’s main focus will be on its Marketing Efficiency Cloud and the Digital Marketing Center integrated into it. \nThe Digital Marketing Center integrates digital marketing into higher-level marketing planning and creates a complete overview of the various disciplines, including search engine marketing and display advertising. With interfaces to leading tools and platforms such as Google AdWords or Google Analytics, the solution brings together link management and success monitoring in a central place. A component used to automatically publish on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube helps users to clearly control and handle activities on these channels. \nAnother innovation that will be introduced at dmexco is Media Pool Mobile . Companies can use it to make specific content available on mobile devices directly at the point of sale. In retail outlets, during customer visits, or at trade fairs, sales representatives can display the most relevant media, such as videos or data sheets, online or offline and can then digitally pass them on to their customers immediately. Through transparent tracking and evaluation of the media usage, the sales department gains important clues that tell them at what stage the customer currently is in the buying process. \nThe integration of the Marketing Efficiency Cloud with Salesforce CRM, the globally leading system for customer relationship management, also ensures closer collaboration between marketing and sales. By comparing the profile and interests of a customer with the metadata of the centrally available media in the Media Pool, sales representatives can use most appropriate content from the CRM system and attach it to an e-mail, for example. This shortens the sales process and immediately raises sales success because the media used is more relevant. \n\"Since ever-new channels have continued to appear and ever-larger volumes of data have become available, the number of tools, teams, and responsibilities has increased drastically,\" explains BrandMaker CEO Mirko Holzer. \"However, with a complete overview one can use available resources across channels in a targeted way. The same applies to the communicated content: One central repository for everything guarantees that messages are consistent across all communication channels. The digital transformation presents major challenges to companies. Our platforms and dashboards provide transparency, which has been lost in many cases. This helps users to keep on top of things and stay in control.\" \nAbout BrandMaker \nBrandMaker is the leading provider of Marketing Resource Management (MRM) systems in Europe.
