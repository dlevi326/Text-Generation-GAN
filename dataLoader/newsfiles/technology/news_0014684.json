The blend of proprietary technologies behind the laboratory and clinical development of this product empowers these bioactive molecules to such a level that one 7.5g piece of the chocolate delivers flavanol activity equivalent to 100g of dark chocolate, and astaxanthin to the level of 300-400g of wild Alaskan salmon.\nThis chocolate is able to not only suppress markers of sub-clinical inflammation in blood, but also reverse age-related depression of microcirculation and blood supply to such peripheral tissues as subcutaneous fat and skin. This can consequently result in a boost of oxygen delivery to these tissues and restoration of their respiration - the essential physiological need in controlling and supporting skin health.\nDr. Ivan Petyaev, the inventor of the technology, said that he is delighted by the independent validation by the jury of leading beauty experts from the cosmetic, beauty and fashion industry.\nTheir recognition of the company’s scientific evidence, skin health benefits and sensory properties of the chocolate endorses it not only as a leading nutra-cosmetic but also best new beauty product.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12984672.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12984672.htm"], "published": "2015-09-25T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T12:06:16.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
