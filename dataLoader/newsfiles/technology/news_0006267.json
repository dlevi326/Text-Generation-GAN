This certification benefits Verifone clients worldwide that are eager to accept contactless payments from our cardholders.” \nSPEED, EASE AND SIMPLICITY \n“Verifone has been a leader in the world’s migration to the EMV standard and solving payments challenges for merchants,” said Steve Aliferis, president of Asia Pacific for Verifone. “Certification from JCB helps us continue this leadership by enabling our merchants to be the first to accept the latest version of this convenient form of contactless EMV—furthering their ability to reduce checkout times and improve the customer experience.” \nJ/Speedy provides a simple, fast, and convenient way for consumers to pay, particularly in environments where throughput speed is critical, such as supermarkets, convenience stores, and fast food restaurants. The program enables consumers to pay by simply tapping their card or mobile phone on a certified terminal or J/Speedy reader. \nVERIFONE FIRST TO IMPLEMENT J/SPEEDY GLOBALLY \nVerifone is making its newly certified payment application software globally available, and merchants in China, Taiwan, Thailand and other markets in the Asia Pacific region will be the first to have the ability to update their Verifone terminals to accept J/Speedy contactless payments from consumers. Interested merchants can contact their acquirers or terminal providers to learn more about how they can receive Verifone’s J/Speedy software update. \nSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for VeriFone Systems, Inc. \nThis press release includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
