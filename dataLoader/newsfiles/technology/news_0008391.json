Responses also indicate that mentoring should continue indefinitely. Most survey respondents in their mid 30's-40's suggested that networking is the best form of encouraging and ensuring that mentoring opportunities are available. \nKey survey findings include: -- Most-influential mentors (in order) were parents, bosses, sought-after mentors and teachers. -- First inspirational or mentor-based interactions occurred between the ages of 6 and 16, with early years seen as most important. -- Key areas of mentoring included strong personal branding, business ethics, persistence, clear communication and exposure to new experiences. -- 94% of respondents said they go out of their way to mentor others. -- Mentors cited goal setting, problem solving, boosting self-esteem and public speaking as common areas of mentoring they provide. -- Responders identified seven factors that can help a child be mentored successfully. -- 75% of responders confirmed that gender-based factors limit women's rate of success, regardless of mentoring support. \n\"Mentoring has long been recognized as an essential relationship that leads to long-term success, both professionally and personally,\" said Sinan Kanatsiz, Chairman, IMA. \"As our survey indicates, it should start at a young age to be most effective. And it can come from many sources. The key is to be an active participant throughout life to maximize its benefits and to pass those benefits along to others.\" \nA copy of the complete survey can be downloaded at http://imanetwork.org/monthly-reports/ . \nFor complete information on the Internet Marketing Association, visit www.imanetwork.org . \nAbout the Internet Marketing Association IMA is one of the fastest growing Internet marketing groups in the world, with more than 1,000,000 professional members in fields including sales, marketing, business ownership, programming and creative development.
