(Playdots) 07 AM Follow @htsuka Two Dots is a puzzle game — the follow-up to Betaworks’ other game, Dots — in which players are asked to join strings of colored spots on a grid. But it’s so much more than a simple game of connect the dots. Each level comes with objectives of how many dots of a certain color you should collect and other goals you must complete in a set number of moves. Some levels have obstacles or other twists. So while the basic mechanic is simple, it does require strategy.\nTwo Dots gives players a finite number of lives, which regenerate over time. But you lose lives only if you fail a level, so with a good run, you can keep going for a long time. And of course, if you want a little help or some extra lives, you can buy those.
