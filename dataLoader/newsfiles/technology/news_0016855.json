The Global Precipitation Measurement or GPM core satellite analyzed rainfall rates and saw the eyewall was eroding. \nThe eyewall of a hurricane contains a storm's most damaging winds and intense rainfall. It consists of a vertical wall of powerful thunderstorms circling a hurricane's open eye. \nGPM is a joint mission between NASA and the Japanese space agency JAXA. GPM captured data on Jimena on Thursday, September 3, 2015 at 10:01 UTC (6:01 a.m. PDT). At the time Jimena, which began to recurve to the northwest yesterday, steering it away from the Hawaiian Islands, was located about 750 east of Hilo, Hawaii and was moving slowly towards the northwest at 3 mph with maximum sustained winds estimated at 110 mph by the central Pacific Hurricane Center. GPM shows that Jimena's eyewall continued to erode away on the southern side. Most of the rain bands south of the center have also greatly diminished. \nJimena is forecast to continue to weaken and take a more north-northwest track over the next few days. NOAA's Central Pacific Hurricane Center noted that large swells from Jimena will produce hazardous surf along east facing shores of the main Hawaiian Islands. Surf produced by these swells will build and continue through the weekend of September 5 and 6. This video is not supported by your browser at this time. On Sept. 3, GPM showed that Jimena's eyewall (dark red semicircle indicating intense rainfall) continued to erode away on the southern side. Most of the rain bands south of the center have also greatly diminished.

Suomi NPP satellite sees rapidly intensifying Hurricane Jimena August 28, 2015 \nNASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite flew over Hurricane Jimena in the Eastern Pacific and saw the strongest thunderstorms building up quickly, especially in the northern quadrant of the storm. Jimena intensified rapidly overnight ... GPM satellite shows double eye-wall in Hurricane Jimena September 1, 2015 \nThe Global Precipitation Measurement or GPM core satellite showed a double eye-wall in Hurricane Jimena on September 1 as it moved through the Eastern Pacific and into the Central Pacific Ocean. GPM sees Hurricane Jimena's intense eyewall September 2, 2015 \nNASA's Global Precipitation Measurement or GPM core satellite passed over Hurricane Jimena and saw an intense eyewall with heaviest rainfall occurring in the northern and eastern sides of the storm. Aqua Satellite sees Ignacio in a trio across the Pacific September 3, 2015 \nThe tropical trio of tropical cyclones continued on September 3 when NASA's Aqua satellite passed over the Pacific Ocean.
