Prepares for the Launch of the Sonoran Enterprise Management (SEM) Front Desk Product\nSEM Front Desk brings the powerful tools of Sonorans large corporate users to small and medium sized businesses, attractively priced to fit their smaller budgets. Front Desk features tools for managing a Help Desk, customers, appointments, supply chain, inventory, distribution channels, and employees work efforts.\nDaytona Beach, FL, August 30, 2015 --( PR.com )-- SEM Front Desk is built on and derived from Sonoran System’s fifth generation carrier grade ArTrac G5 product line used in the wireless and telecommunications industries for decades. Front Desk includes a Micro PC or small server depending on the size and needs of the client. It is fully tested and delivered turnkey as a plug-and-play product. It inherits its modular, integrated feature set; distributed architecture; and scalability as well as SOX, HIPAA and PCI compliance standards from its ArTrac G5 foundation.\nFront Desk will be offered in three versions - Standard, Advanced and Deluxe to provide each small to medium size business the feature set that fits their current organizational and business needs. As their business and needs grow they can easily change to a Front Desk version with additional features. SEM Front Desk will be available for sale on the Sonoran web store when it opens in the near future.\nSEM Front Desk consolidates features that bring efficiency to all businesses by maintaining customer information, appointments and scheduling work using a rich outlook style calendar. Tickets can be triggered by the Scheduler module or created manually. The Ticketing module notifies correct resources of work assignments and the escalation engine keeps management apprised of the status of the assigned work. Front Desk also includes an optional multi-site Asset Management barcoding module to manage inventory. Best of all, every feature in SEM Front Desk is tightly and seamlessly integrated so you can focus on your business and not on trying to integrate systems from different vendors, leaving frustrating and costly gaps, inconsistencies, incompatibilities, and confusion in your tool sets.\nAbout Sonoran Systems, Inc.\nThe leadership within Sonoran Systems is comprised of telecom industry veterans dating back to the 1980's.
