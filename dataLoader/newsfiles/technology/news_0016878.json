Jason Glass, Executive Vice President, HAYSTACKID, will be moderating the session titled \"ZEALOUS ADVOCACY AND COOPERATION: NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE CONCEPTS IN DISCOVERY\" where industry renowned General Counsel, Magistrate Judge, and eDiscovery Counsel will participate. The session is focused around one of Mr. Glass' areas of expertise - Rule 1, which counsels the bench and bar to pursue the \"just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\" The panel will discuss this rule and how it is stretched to its breaking point when counsel becomes embroiled in discovery disputes that should have been avoided, or otherwise when counsel does not handle eDiscovery in a collaborative way. \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150903/263502LOGO \n\"I look forward to a lively discussion on this all important and very hot topic,\" said Jason Glass from the company's Boston, MA corporate headquarters. \"We have a terrific group of well renowned industry leaders and these discussion points are generating more and more buzz and interest.
