Texting works only sporadically.\nAnd making calls? Service is spotty and the fine dust, poison to electronics, is everywhere.\n\"This week is a carte blanche excuse to tell people that I have no service and I can't be reached,\" said Mike MacHenry, a software engineer from Massachusetts.\nLike many Burning Man participants, MacHenry is young, highly educated and happy to set aside technology for the week. At his camp, visitors are given postcards so they can mail themselves handwritten notes to be delivered in six months. It's a way of helping people remind themselves of what they were thinking at the moment, no Timehop necessary.\nJen Billock, the CEO of CouchSurfing, is a first-time Burning Man attendee who said she loves that people are disconnected from the Internet for their week here. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY)\n\"I'm totally addicted to my phone, except at Burning Man,\" said Presley Pizzo, a software engineer who just got her PhD in linguistics. At least she thinks she just got her PhD — the email telling her she qualified came out after she entered the encampment, and she doesn't actually know yet for sure.\n\"I love being connected, but this is such a great vacation from that,\" she added.\nWhile most Burning Man participants are off the grid, technology and the people who are at its epicenter are intertwined with the event.\nTech titans have long had a major presence here. Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, a regular at Burning Man, gave a TED talk in the desert earlier in the week. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, and Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google have shown up over the years.\nUSA TODAY\nBurning Man organizers explore sites for permanent home\nTechnology underlies major portions of the event itself. Every entry ticket gets scanned, and vehicles leaving and returning during the week are tracked via QR codes. Event organizers organizers have a microwave link linking their computer systems to the Internet, although most communications are done either face-to-face or via radio.\nThe crowd here is the kind accustomed to always-on Internet access, and based on their demographics (70% have at least a bachelors degree and 90% are aged 19-60), this is probably one of the densest clusterings of iPhones on the planet.\nA Burning Man attendee checks an event map, which participants use instead of GPS on their smartphones. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY)\nWith phones off, participants, well, participate. At weddings and dance parties, they're not standing in the back taking cellphone videos to send to their friends, and there isn't a selfie stick in sight. Burning Man organizers say they've deliberately chosen not to provide Internet service to ensure participants remain present, instead of focusing on outside distractions.\nAnd it works. Strangers eat communal dinners and wander from camp to camp, taking classes in knife throwing and meditation, and learning how to make medallions from smelted beer cans. Whiteboards are how you leave messages, and paper maps replace GPS for the week.\n\"I have no reason and no expectation of being contacted,\" said computer scientist John Vilk.\"It's my favorite part of Burning Man.\"\nFor those willing to pull their phones out in the near-constant dust, one app that is working for communication within Burning Man is Firechat, which uses phones' Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities to create a network without Internet access. Users can share photos and messages with each other, even if they're on different sides of the camp, because the app hopscotches the information between their phones via anyone else using the app.\nFirst-time attendee Jen Billock, who is the CEO of Couchsurfing, says she's impressed by how many of her colleagues have chosen to stay disconnected. Billock has a young daughter, so she brought a satellite phone so she could stay in touch, although only two other people have the number.\nCouchsurfing was inspired by Burning Man's culture of gifting, and Billock said she's enjoying the chance to experience this community without distractions from electronics.\n\"It's an alternate universe and it really allows you to disconnect in a way you sometimes can't on vacation.\"\n\"It's nice to see people come out of their habitual selves.\"\n41 CONNECT 69 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1UyA1Jz TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635770176737210436-image1.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635770187786605265-billock.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a714a18d4e94f4152173913133f77582c7c1352c/c=44-0-1721-1261&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635770176737210436-image1.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7680bd234e495a8eeb60fa40a2f538b8f36ba6e5/c=92-0-1188-824&r=x383&c=540x380/local/-/media/2015/09/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635770188547578143-IMG-4863.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f0b6b2d198964a02bc98c061c1f297b7187c1258/c=85-0-595-510/local/-/media/2015/09/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635769278017912464-635768170671574686-Burning-Man-2015-67.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1UyA1Jz", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635770188547578143-IMG-4863.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UyA1Jz&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ed854fdbc54506d7275bee9dffc949748808a53/c=34-0-994-1280&r=183&c=0-0-180-238/local/-/media/2015/09/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635770187786605265-billock.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UyA1Jz&text=Burning%20Man%20is%20where%20cellphones%20go%20to%20die&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-09-05T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T17:55:09.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
