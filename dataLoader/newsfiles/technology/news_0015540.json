We will stand firm to protect IPR.\" \nRecalling the genesis of Walt Disney Co.'s Shanghai theme park in the late 2000s, Xi said other officials were pushing for a more Chinese culture-based project. \n\"I voted yes for Disney,\" he recounted, \"because China needs a diverse-culture-based entertainment market.\" \nNoting that Chinese companies will invest $1.25 trillion outside the country over the next 10 years, Xi underscored their importance to the US economy, as the employers of hundreds of thousands of Americans. \nSome 100 Chinese companies have invested in the depressed economy of Detroit, he noted, before voicing an often-made request for a loosening of US import restrictions. \n\"Chinese companies also hope to see substantive steps by the US to ease restrictions on exports of civilian high-tech items to China, and create a level playing field for Chinese investment in the US. \n\"We count on the US business community to play your positive role and help make this a reality.\" .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:57:36.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
