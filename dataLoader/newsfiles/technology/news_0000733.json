Unlike devices that merely monitor and report sleeping data, such as the Sleepace RestOn , the nuyu Sleep System takes a more active approach under the covers, by automatically changing bed temperature through the night. \nUnveiled by Florida-based Health o meter at CES 2015 and currently the subject of a crowdfunding campaign , the Bluetooth-connected nuyu (pronounced \"new you\") is designed to mimic the temperature changes caused by the body's circadian rhythm. It consists of a washable, torso-sized (2 x 3 ft, 0.6 x 0.9 m) mattress pad that rests under fitted sheets. Unlike products that work like an electric blanket, such as the Luna smart mattress cover , the nuyu Sleep System uses a hose and water tank to control the temperature of the pad. \nAfter a person gets into bed, the system warms up the body to help it relax and fall asleep faster. Then it gradually cools down to match the body's temperature for comfortable, deep sleeping, before warming back up with the body to help users wake more naturally. \nThe mobile app, which is compatible with Bluetooth-enabled iOS and Android devices, will automatically adjust the temperature of the mattress pad based on a person's age, weight, temperature goals and the ambient temperature of the room. While the patent-pending algorithm will do it's best to implement the best temperatures, settings can also be customized and fine-tuned for optimal comfort at any time. \nHealth o meter also offers additional products that are designed to work seamlessly with the nuyu Sleep System and app. An activity monitor keeps track of sleep and activity, while downloadable coaching plans and a wireless scale help guide users toward meeting personal goals. \nThe nuyu Sleep System is currently funding on Indiegogo, having raised more than twice its US$20,000 goal with 18 days left to go. A pledge of $249 gets you one nuyu Sleep System, saving 50 percent off the retail price, and a pledge of $279 bundles in an activity/sleep tracker. If production goes according to plan, backers can expect shipments of the nuyu Sleep System to start sometime this November. \nThe device is introduced in the video below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T06:21:09.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
