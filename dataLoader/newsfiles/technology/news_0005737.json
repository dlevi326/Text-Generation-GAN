With nGenx and Google Compute Engine, customers gain global IT workspace availability, including the desktop, applications, and data, regardless of location or computing device. The solution is being highlighted this week during the Cloud Partners conference at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston. \nWith nGenx nFinity nWorkspace and the option to select Google Compute Engine for cloud infrastructure, nGenx partners and their customers have increased flexibility in how they implement a cloud application, desktop as a service, or other broader cloud workspace environment. This provides the option to increase solution performance, simplify deployment and management, and build solutions based on the reliability of Google Cloud Infrastructure. nGenx provides operational support for custom installations built on any selection of cloud infrastructure, including Google Compute Engine, and addresses a full range of deployment scenarios that include platform and application provisioning, administration, and workspace management. \nGoogle Compute Engine provides high performance Linux virtual machines for consistently performant, scalable, highly secure, and reliable services. nGenx partners using Google Compute Engine may connect with machines in data centers and to other Google services using Google's private fiber network. All data is written to persistent disk and encrypted on the fly and then transmitted and stored in encrypted form. Google Compute Engine has completed ISO 27001, SSAE-16, SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 certifications, demonstrating the organizations commitment to information security. \nFull spectrum support for Google Compute Engine will be formally announced at the Cloud Partners conference this week in Boston, which takes place September 16-18.

First, the use of flash storage in Google Cloud Infrastructure provides crisp performance with improved response times. Second, service delivery by Google Compute Engine allows for pre-defined workload levels to be catered to quite effectively without the requirement for complex programming. Finally, there is trust in the Google name which provides assurance for many customers transitioning to a cloud workspace for the first time.\" \n\"Support for Google Compute Engine signifies our commitment to partners to provide best-of-breed cloud infrastructure options that meet the business requirements of customers,\" said JD Helms, president, nGenx. \"It is a continuation of our efforts to be flexible enough to meet the demands of customers today and in the future.
