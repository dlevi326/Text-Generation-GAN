It's a major update for the Gatineau, Canada-based startup, all of which are available today on iOS and Android devices. In previous versions, content sharing had been limited to photos and private groups were exclusive to internal company use. Introduced in the latest version are private live broadcasts and link sharing as well as general access to create and participate in private groups.\n“Foko has often been called the ‘Instagram for business,’ but we’re about much more than that now.” says Marc Gingras, the company’s CEO. “Many of our customers use Foko as a method of internal communications among their employees. Because of that, privacy is extremely important to our users. As always, all Foko groups will remain private and secure.”\nFoko, founded in 2013, has seen significant traction and adoption in the last 12 months. Over one thousand companies use the app across a wide range of industries that include consumer packaged goods, retail merchandise, real estate, and professional services. Counted among their customers are Whole Foods, Maxim Integrated, Trend Micro, Gartner, and One Medical.\n“We have been able to quickly and productively bring Foko right into our business,” Arndt Brockmann, Managing Director Germany and board member of global retailer Esprit, explains. “The Foko offering is helping us audit our merchandise displays, making sure our standards are upheld across our stores.”\nThe app is now available for download on Android and iOS\nAbout Foko: Foko is a private mobile and web visual communication platform for the enterprise. Foko strives to provide a simple yet powerful tool for communications and project collaboration.
