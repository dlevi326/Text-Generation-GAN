But they eventually bowed to pressure from TEPCO, which is struggling to find space to store tainted water. \n\"We have confirmed this underground water contains contaminants since it includes rainwater that has been exposed to rubble at the site. But its radiation levels are much lower than the water kept in the reactor buildings,\" said a TEPCO spokesman. \nMonday's move is a milestone for the company, which has been struggling to handle some 300 tons of dirty water it has been extracting from the ground every day. Previously it was just added to huge tanks on site. \nTEPCO has also previously pumped clean water from the ground and released it into the sea to stop it becoming contaminated. \nBut it has yet to find a solution to deal with the other 680,000 tons of highly radioactive water stored on site. \nThis includes water used to cool reactors when they were knocked out by a towering tsunami on March 11, 2011. \nLocal fishermen have still not agreed to any discharge of water collected from the reactor buildings even after it is filtered. \nThe tsunami, following a 9.0 magnitude quake, triggered the world's worst nuclear disaster in a generation and prompted Tokyo to shut down the 50 reactors nationwide used to generate electricity. \nDecommissioning of the crippled Fukushima reactors is expected to take decades. The compensation bill for residents—excluding the cost of the site's cleanup—now top $57 billion.
