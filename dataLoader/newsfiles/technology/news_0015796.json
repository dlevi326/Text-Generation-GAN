Aniwaa, a 3D printing data company, has the answer to that - a new website that enables users to easily search, compare and purchase hundreds of products from across the 3D printing spectrum.\n“This release marks a huge step towards our mission to deliver relevant 3D printing knowledge to help our users make the right choices for their 3D printing projects” said Aniwaa’s co-founder Martin Lansard.\nBuilt on an extensive database spanning more than 1,300 products (including 855 3D printers), the website will help users find the right match for their projects - be it 3D printers, scanners, printing sites, software, and even printing services. Users can easily browse through an unparalleled selection of 3D printing products, helping them make the right choice in an ever evolving sector.\nAniwaa’s holistic approach to developing this unique 3D printing resource gives it an edge over other similar services in the market and makes it a global leader.\n“As more and more people are looking to embrace and use this new technology, Aniwaa is focused on helping them find the right products”, said Pierre-Antoine Arrighi, co-founder of Aniwaa.\n“Our database is also a great resource for researchers and journalists. We’ve done our best to improve the site’s usability for all of our users, without compromising on data quality”, he added.\nAbout the company: Aniwaa was started in 2012 as a side project by childhood friends Pierre-Antoine Arrighi and Martin Lansard. Using their passion for 3D printing, the pair launched the first version of the website in June 2013 and quickly gained traction from among industry insiders. They also launched a French version of the website in January 2014. After quitting their jobs in 2014 to focus solely on Aniwaa, Martin and Pierre-Antoine are now running the company from Cambodia and Japan, respectively. Aniwaa is also a member of the 3D Printing Association, a global forum of manufacturers and service providers.\nFor press inquiries, please contact Martin Lansard: martin(at)aniwaa(dot)com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T10:47:15.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
