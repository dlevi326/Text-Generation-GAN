Like most of the technology we build at @WalmartLabs, we plan to apply what we build for Sam’s Club to Walmart’s other businesses, including Walmart.com,” explained Jeremy King, head of WalmartLabs and Jamie Iannone, President and CEO, Samsclub.com, in the announcement. \nThis marks the 15 th tech acquisition for Silicon Valley-based WalmartLabs since its creation four years ago, each part of an effort to improve site search, data analytics, ad technology, and other areas. \nAs part of the acquisition, founder Ranjith Kumaran, co-founder Mehdi Ait Oufkir and several other PunchTab technologists will join WalmartLabs. The technology will be used to enhance Walmart’s existing customer relationship management tools. \nPunchTab allows companies to create a customer loyalty or engagement program, and then collect real-time data based on purchases in-store. Communicating with customers on multiple channels, \nWalmartLabs also recently added technology from site-speed optimizer Torbit , data analytics and predictive intelligence startup Inkiru , adtech startup Adchemy , mobile agency Small Society , cloud computing startup OneOps, and many others., according to Tech Crunch. \nThe unique factor in the PunchTab deal is that it focuses not on improving the Walmart.com website experience, but will be tasked with optimizing how Sam’s Club can better personalize and target offers to its members. \nPunchTab was founded in 2001 by Ranjith Kumaran and Mehdi Ait Oufkir, and has worked with Kroger, Arby’s Nestle, and The Yankee Candle Company, among others, to help these companies achieve deeper understanding of their customers’ behaviors in physical stores. According to CrunchBase , PunchTab was backed by $11.5 million by Mohr Davidow Ventures, Chamath Palihapitiya from The Social+Capital Partnership, CrunchFund, Venky Harinarayan, and Anand Rajaraman. \nUsing PunchTab, companies could create loyalty and engagement programs that collected real-time data by offering users a reward whenever they uploaded a receipt showing that they purchased a particular product.
