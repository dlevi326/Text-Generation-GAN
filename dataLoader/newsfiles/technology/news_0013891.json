Iron.io products and solutions are architected to power workloads at scale for a wide range of application use cases through industrial-strength message queuing and asynchronous task processing. \nWith the rise of Internet of Things applications, and the popularity of the microservices architectural style, more and more communication and computing occurs asynchronously. Users of Azure can now directly leverage Iron.io within their applications to respond to application events, decouple components as independent services, offload individual workloads, and schedule regular occurring jobs. \n\"Azure is an Enterprise-grade cloud computing platform,\" said Chad Arimura, CEO, Iron.io. \"The combination of Azure and Iron.io brings flexibility, scalability, control and security -- all the things Enterprises are seeking for their applications.\" \n\"We are excited that IronWorker and IronMQ are now available in the Azure Marketplace,\" said Nicole Herskowitz, Senior Director of Product Marketing, Microsoft Azure. \"Our customers will benefit from building applications with IronWorker and IronMQ.\" \nBy using Azure and Iron.io, developers and operators can move individual components to the cloud, while maintaining safe application environments through improved security. Iron.io can also act as a key processing gateway to Azure component services including storage, queues, mobile services, and more, making it easy to create hybrid solutions of existing client-server applications and cloud-based microservices. \nGetting Started With Iron.io on Azure \nToday, users of Azure are able to add IronWorker and IronMQ as a service by visiting the Azure Marketplace . Developers can then write and package task code for deployment to IronWorker's processing environment within Azure. The Iron.io dashboard built into Azure provides detailed insight into the state of tasks for monitoring complete application activity and performance. \nIronWorker and IronMQ are currently available in the West US region of Azure, and support multiple languages with native SDKs including Go, Java, Ruby, PHP, Python, Node.js, and .NET. \nAbout Iron.io Iron.io 's event-driven computing architecture delivers and processes 100s of millions of messages and tasks through IronMQ and IronWorker . Its asynchronous workloads operate in public and private clouds, on-premises, or hybrid environments. Iron.io's messaging queuing, task processing, and job scheduling solutions are used for event processing, transaction processing, mobile and IoT compute, microservices, and other asynchronous computing patterns within modern cloud applications.
