NEW YORK Sept. 3 2015 /-... Date:9/3/2015 \nNEW YORK , Sept. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- About dry eye syndromeDry eye syndrome usually results in dryness of eyes due to deficient tear production or quick tear evaporation or deviation in tear uniformity. This syndrome is of two types: aqueous tear deficient dry eye and evaporative dry eye. In aqueous tear deficient dry eye, lacrimal glands do not produce enough tears, whereas meibomian gland dysfunction results in evaporative dry eye. Meibomian glands secrete lipids to slow tear evaporation and maintain tear stability. The symptoms include pain, redness, burning, and fatigue in the eye and decreased tolerance to continuous visual activity. Dry eye syndrome cannot be cured, but symptoms can be controlled. Teardrops and anti-inflammatory drugs are used in the treatment.
