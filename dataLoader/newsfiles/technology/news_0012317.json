Returning for its 15 th year, Black Hat Europe will welcome the world's brightest information security professionals and researchers to reveal vulnerabilities that impact everything from the latest mobile and consumer devices to critical international infrastructure. This year's show will run November 10-13 at the Amsterdam RAI. For more information and to save €200 on your Briefings Pass by this Friday, September 4 , please visit blackhat.com/eu-15/ . This fall, the global information security community will descend on the Amsterdam RAI for two days of intensely technical Trainings followed by two thought-provoking days of the infamous Black Hat Briefings. Bringing in the brightest regional and international minds in the industry, attendees will experience a lineup packed with the latest InfoSec insights from all corners of the world.\nA few highlights of Black Hat Briefings selected so far include:\nInsecurity of stored mobile data: researchers found that they were able to access more than 56 million sensitive user records stored in the cloud by heavily misconfigured BaaS solutions. Threats to banking infrastructure: with 38 of the top 50 banks relying on Temenos to process daily transactions of more than 500 million banking customers, how does this critical software stand up against the security of today? Hint: It's not as secure as you think. Exploiting self-driving vehicles : the next evolution in transportation, autonomous automated vehicles are equipped with multiple sensors and like all digitally connected things, they can be hacked. These researchers have found how to execute remote attacks (as well as the appropriate countermeasures) on the camera-based system and LiDAR using commodity hardware. Cracking oil and gas stocks: researchers will shed light on this highly critical and very dark area of oil and gas vulnerabilities, discussing specific attacks as well as guidelines and processes on how to avoid them. Black Hat Trainings:\nIn addition to the world-class Briefings schedule, Black Hat Europe 2015 will offer 10 deeply technical hands-on Training sessions led by some of the most sought after security experts in the field. Running November 10-11 , the Trainings offer a separate set of courses for attendees on everything from penetration testing and infrastructure hacking to OSINT for social engineers and even the latest in incident response.
