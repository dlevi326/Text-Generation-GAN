The report dismissed past suggestions that most gets illegally shipped to African nations, such as Nigeria and Ghana, and repaired to get a new lease of life.\n\n\"Most of the illegal e-waste trade is taking place next door rather than far away in Africa,\" said Jaco Huisman of the United Nations University, scientific coordinator of the project that included police agency INTERPOL and other partners.\n\n\"Mismanagement is occurring everywhere,\" he told Reuters. In Europe \"there is a lot of theft, scavenging \" and quite a significant amount going into the waste bin.\"\n\nA broken fridge, for instance, is valuable scrap mainly because of copper in its compressor. Often the compressor get ripped out and the rest dumped.\n\nSuch theft of valuable components means compliant processors in Europe lose up to 1.7 billion euros (1.90 billion) a year, the report estimated.\n\nOverall, it said 3.3 million tonnes of 9.5 million tonnes of e-waste generated in Europe in 2012 was properly discarded and recycled. Only about 1.3 million were exported, with the rest recycled in Europe outside regular programmes or dumped.\n\nIoana Botezatu, an environmental expert at the international police agency INTERPOL, said prosecutions were rare although some nations have strict penalties for environmental crimes.\n\nThe report's recommendations include better police cooperation, more education of consumers about recycling, and a ban on cash transactions in the scrap metal trade.\n\nOne problem is making people aware of recycling centres.\n\n\"Consumers don't know where to find them,\" said Pascal Leroy, secretary-general of the Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment Forum which also contributed to the report.\n\n(1 = 0.8946 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Alister Doyle; editing by Andrew Roche)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T05:19:35.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
