Infrastructure has thus become an issue for both the world’s largest and second largest economies. \nTim Wickmann said of Asia: “The volumes haven’t been there this year, which is why there has not been much congestion, but port and infrastructure is the biggest worry. \n“We are already seeing congestion for various reasons. Sometimes because the ports are full as it is, some have poor road systems, trucking issues or government measures, but if that is already happening now and we are still adding millions of moves to the ports every year, looking ahead it can be hard to serve the customers in the way they expect and are used to.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T13:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T15:44:24.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
