The former Latin patriarch of Jerusalem Michel Sabbah denounced the work that began earlier this month. “This land belongs to us” he said. \n\n“Whatever they do whatever their courts say this land belongs to us and it will return to us one day. You are stronger with your guns but you are not the strongest when it comes to humanity.” \n\nIsrael began building the barrier of walls and fences inside the occupied West Bank in 2002 at the height of the second Palestinian intifada saying it was crucial for security. The Palestinians see it as a land grab aimed at stealing part of their future state and call it the “apartheid wall”. UN figures show that around two-thirds of the barrier is so far complete. \n\nThe network of towering concrete walls barbed-wire fences trenches and closed military roads will extend 712km when finished separating the West Bank from Israel 85 percent of its length running through Palestinian land. \n\nOne of the most iconic symbols of the occupation it will cut off more than nine percent of Palestinian territory in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:09:34.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
