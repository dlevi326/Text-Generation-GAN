Then there is a pillow especially for you. This pillow known as the ‘Hibr pillow’ is the product of a successful Kickstarter campaign. It is basically a memory foam pillow that promises a cooler sleep. And how does it do this? It is made of a special material which regulates your body temperature while you are sleeping and it achieves this feat with the help of certain capsules embedded in the foam of the pillow. These are basically bidirectional thermo-regulating capsules,that change their phase when heated up. Depending on what kind of microclimate is around the pillow, it either absorbs or releases heat. There is a gel of layer that keeps the surface of the pillow cool. The pillow comes covered in a soft, zippered pillow case probably to help regulate the airflow. Only one side of the pillow has the cooling function: the blue side. The other; white side is just like any other normal pillow. It comes in three varieties: simple (which is actually just like a traditional pillow), side (bit like a neck pillow you see at airports) and the silhouette (the contour is dipped in the middle to aid those who have sleep disorders). The pillow also gives a faint chemical like smell when you sleep on it. It is priced at $79 dollars- a pricey one! But what not would you pay to barter a good night’s sleep?
