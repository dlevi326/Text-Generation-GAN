The customers are doing more of their shopping online and luxury brands stand to miss out if they do not adapt to the situation. \nAccording to McKinsey, while overall sales of luxury goods increased just 2% in 2013, online luxury sales jumped 20%. The consulting firm projects that online sale will more than double to approximately USD 22.5 billion in the next five years. \nMcKinsey also reported earlier this year that nearly half of luxury goods buying decisions are already influenced by what consumers hear or see online. \nBy securing the top music job at Apple, Rogers seemed to have reached the top of the industry. His new task will be to help LVMH's brands develop their e-commerce channels.
