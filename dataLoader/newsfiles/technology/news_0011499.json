However, as the couple frequently changed their cell numbers and used pre-active sim cards we could not locate them,\" said a senior crime branch official. \n\nTop police officials said the couple even changed their locations and used to do petty jobs to earn their living and stay in rented premises. \"After their names figured, they had travelled to Haridwar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. They sometimes used to stay at some Sadhaks house also,\" added a senior crime branch official. \n\n\"Recently we questioned a person for suspicion of him being very close to Asaram and his son Narayan Sai, who is now in judicial custody in the rape cases lodged against them by two sisters of Surat,\" said a crime branch source. \n\nSenior police officials said they got a number from his cell phone, which had calls received and dialed from Surat, Ahmedabad and Uttar Pradesh. \n\n\"We were not able to get the name of the person holding the cell number as it was pre-active sim card illegally procured. We then put the number in the true caller app and to our surprise \"Sejal Bengaluru\" was the name which propped up. \n\nCrime branch sources said immediately a team comprising of inspector Bhavesh Rozia, Sahil Tandel and two sub inspectors RI Jadeja and HP Karan were dispatched to Bengaluru. \n\n\"We located Basavraj at a local cable operator's office and arrested him. Basavraj led us to his one-bedroom house located in congested lanes of central Bengaluru. We then arrested his wife Sejal ,\" said a crime branch official. \n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T05:16:52.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
