We can potentially achieve a better centration of the lens, and therefore a better refractive stability, as well as prevent rotation, which is crucial for toric IOLs. The increased biomechanical stability is also linked to refractive results because a more stable lens leads to better refractive outcomes,” Malyugin said. Boris Malyugin \nBasic questions, however, are still open with femtosecond laser cataract surgery. More studies are needed to prove whether this technique is significantly superior to phacoemulsification and whether the higher cost is compatible with widespread adoption. \n“Not having a clear answer to these questions is what has prevented femtolaser cataract surgery from having a faster takeoff — nothing to do with lenses. The lack, at present, of specifically designed IOLs is not in any way retarding the adoption of this technology. However, new IOLs specifically designed for the femtolaser procedure may eventually help the technology to spread. Femto and IOL technology have the potential to move together synergistically,” Malyugin said. – by Michela Cimberle \nDisclosure : Malyugin is a consultant for Bausch + Lomb and MicroSurgical Technology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T02:07:45.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
