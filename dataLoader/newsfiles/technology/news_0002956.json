The newspaper said Apple has set a “ship date” of 2019, although that could just be a target for engineers to sign off on the design — not when a car would be available for sale. \nApple declined comment Monday on the report, which cited unnamed sources. \nIn recent months, Apple Inc. has hired experts in automotive and battery technology. Officials at an automotive testing facility located east of San Francisco have also confirmed that Apple requested information about using their site.
