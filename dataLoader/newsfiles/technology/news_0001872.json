However, as Andrew Trench admitted, these comments came from a minority of users.\nFurther to this, News24 has failed to accept their own part played in the level of comments on their news articles that gain large readership and stir up emotion. Firstly, there is no denying that News24 sensationalize breaking news headlines. This is common practise used by most major news outlets, but often the headlines are completely misleading.\nOnly after commentators have gone tooth and nail with one another with their opinion on the news, does News24 publish the actual facts that were more than likely available to them at the time of the \"breaking news\".\nSecondly, News24 have always been extremely selective of articles that they open to public opinion and discourse. That in itself, as far as I am concerned begs the question of who decides what articles we have previously been allowed to add to and which aren't?\nTake this as an example - The articles covering the student representative at Wits University, who champions Hitler and racism, were never left open for commentary.\nCall me a conspiracy theorist if you will, but had the tables been turned, the comments section would have been left wide open and all hell would have broken loose.\nNews is read by people who are interested in the current events that impact them directly or indirectly. By taking away a feature of their platform, that has been a huge attraction for many so many years, is like having used Skype only for the developers to disable your microphone.\nWhile I can sympathise with News24 with the volumes of content posted on their platform everyday, knowing that it is impossible to moderate each and every comment, perhaps they could have tweeked the use of the comment section to reduce, or even eliminate abusive commentary.\nCan I honestly say I will stop making use of News24 as a source of daily affairs? No. But I will always find a way to be part of and contribute towards things taking place in South Africa and the world.\nCare to comment News24?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T19:03:04.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
