We need practical solutions to make those ideas a reality.\nI would like to outline what I see as the three basic building blocks for encouraging technological innovation and success - entrepreneurship, agility and education - and examples of how the government could embrace them.\nEntrepreneurship is the outcome of a culture where investment is welcomed, incentivised and rewarded.\nThe government can help to foster such a culture by reducing the perceived risk of investment. The sensible way to do that is to provide risk capital.\nThere are two forms of risk capital, one longer term, such as R&D funding, and a second one more immediate - co-investing in start-up innovation, whatever the sector.\nWe have literally fallen to the bottom of the list of OECD countries in terms of investing in R&D as a percentage of GDP.\nWe must ask ourselves - why aren't Australian businesses investing in R&D? Why do we have the lowest investment in high-tech manufacturing, even as our manufacturing industry is being decimated?\nUntil this is reversed, our firms will never be competitive outside our national (and protected) borders.\nWhen it comes to investment in start-ups, the government should be matching or even bettering private funds. It is not a crazy idea. It is good policy.\nIn Israel, the government puts in $7 for every $1 of private investment in a start-up. That means 85 per cent of investment in tech risk capital comes from the government.\nThe result is that Israel saw a $25 billion growth in exports, and a high return on its investment.\nNow let me apply that thinking to a real-life example closer to home.\nI believe the Department of Employment is looking for new software to manage unemployment services, and its budget for the project is between $2 and 3 billion.\nRather than paying that money to an overseas company to provide an “off the shelf” service which is modified to fit the Australian system, we could use it to develop our own from scratch.\nThat sort of money could employ 10,000 IT professionals on $100,000 a year for three years and result in a better final outcome.\nIt would be an investment that would foster Australia’s technology ecosystem and build on IP knowledge created by Australians for the rest of the world, not the other way around.\nThe second building block is agility, a word we are hearing more and more of in business and political conversations. But what does it actually mean?\nPut simply, agility means adapting and innovating on the fly. It means making continuous small, incremental improvements, experimenting and adopting a “now, not later” approach.\nWhat the federal government, the highest IT spender in Australia, would need to do to support agility in business is trust companies to iterate and adapt on the job.\nSmaller companies which do not meet all the requirements for a government contract may be able to evolve to meet them and implement the necessary protocols as the job progresses.\nIn fact, the government could even help them do it.\nImagine if the government’s approach to awarding tenders was not to swamp applicants in red tape, but ask them what support they needed to succeed?\nSuch an approach could breed an unprecedented amount of engagement between government and business and lead to opportunities we haven’t even imagined yet.\nFinally, the last building block we need is one of the most obvious and important - education.\nAustralia has a shortage of workers skilled in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), the area in which it needs them them the most.\nTo fix this problem in the short term, we must come up with a way to attract as much talent from overseas as we can in the fields of engineering, coding and IT.\nFixing the skills shortage problem will need investment in teaching our children the skills they will need to succeed in the 21st century.\nSome steps toward this goal were made this month, with the endorsement of the new Digital Technologies curriculum at a federal level. The curriculum will hopefully see all children introduced to technical and coding skills at an early age if it is adopted by the states.\nBut the government also needs to invest in more IT-focused international exchange programs for tertiary students with countries such as China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and the US.\nJust one of the students who embarked on such a program could go on to create the next Uber or Facebook. That alone would be worth it.\nTo some people, these ideas may sound like blue-sky thinking. But that’s because our national debate has been so backwards for so long.\nThese things are already happening right now in other nations which are embracing the building blocks of technological success - entrepreneurship, agility and education - and will also reap the benefits.\nWill Australia join them? I certainly hope so.\nAntonluigi “Gigi” Gozzi is the co-founder and Managing Director of online labour marketplace LiveHire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T04:15:31.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
