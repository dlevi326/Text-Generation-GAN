The company improved its previous record of 10 million iPhones sold in the first weekend of 2014, benefiting from the inclusion of the Chinese market, where the gadget's debut was delayed last year by regulatory issues. Analysts had expected the company to sell 12 million to 13 million phones during the first weekend. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said in a statement, “Sales for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any previous first weekend sales results in Apple’s history.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:43:34.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
