In concluding his first broadside Wilberforce asked his pro-evolution opponent Thomas Huxley, \"was it through your grandfather or grandmother that you claim descent from a monkey?\" to which Huxley after a great build-up of anticipation replied that he would rather claim descent from a monkey than be connected with a man who uses his great gifts to prostitute the truth.\nThe ensuing hullabaloo is now legend. Soapy Sam had of course posed his argument as a 'strawman' logical fallacy, a staple in the bag of tricks of ropey politicians to this day. He misrepresented the theory of evolution to make it easier to attack.\nThe theory of evolution as it applies to humans is of course saying the opposite, that an ancestor as close a grandparent would not be any more similar to an ape or monkey than we are but that over many, many generations the mechanism of natural selection causes new species to gradually emerge through the selection of characteristics that offer an advantage to survival and reproduction.\nThe comparison to modern baboons is another strawman as clearly we have evolved in parallel with them and more appropriately chimpanzees with which we share a much closer genetic link. We share an evolutionary tree with modern apes and monkeys but we are not 'descended' from them.\nEvolution remains as politically problematic as ever it seems and one can't help but speculate that Mr Vavi's motives may be as egregious as Soapy Sam's in that it suits the dominance of his ideological edifice as much to feed an enmity to scientific knowledge that challenges the logic of a blind traditional allegiance to kith, kin and faith and even the primacy of human interest in all things.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:03:44.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
