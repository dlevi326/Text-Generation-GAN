We are decentralizing, personalizing, and mobilizing the next generation of healthcare. Our Gene-RADAR literally puts Your Health in Your Hands ™.” \nDr. Pardis Sabeti, an infectious disease genomics expert from the Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA, remarked, \"Gene-RADAR ® , with its ease of use and highly quantitative results, represents the next generation of clinical diagnostics. Once Gene-RADAR ® has been widely deployed, outbreaks like Ebola could be stopped well before they become global pandemics.\" \nDr. Goel further explained: “Our commitment to stop Ebola in West Africa is the first step to building a democratized digital healthcare system, powered by Gene-RADAR ® , that fundamentally transforms the way health care is delivered globally. It is a big vision for the future and a great testament to President Clinton’s legacy that this nanotechnology healthcare revolution is unfolding here at CGI.” \nAbout Nanobiosym Nanobiosym Diagnostics (NBSDx) is commercializing Gene-RADAR ® to bring real-time mobilized diagnosis of global health infectious diseases to the nearly four billion people today who have no access to centralized diagnostics labs. By providing next-gen tools that decentralize, personalize, and mobilize the delivery of healthcare, NBSDx empowers each person to take ownership over their own health. Gene-RADAR ® delivers gold standard accuracy and does not require running water, constant electricity, or highly-trained personnel.
