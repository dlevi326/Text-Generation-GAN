Decision Net is offered through the ISO ClaimSearch ® platform, providing claims and fraud investigators fast access to new DRN vehicle location data and insights for claims research and fraud detection. ISO is a Verisk Analytics (Nasdaq: VRSK ) business. \"DRN has a long-standing relationship with ISO as the provider of vehicle location reports, and we look forward to extending that relationship to offer the benefits of Event Links to our insurers — giving them faster, easier access to DRN's vehicle location data for investigating fraudulent claims,\" said Carlos Martins , vice president and general manager, ISO ClaimSearch Solutions. Through a single logon, ISO ClaimSearch Decision Net users will be able to access Event Links and conduct both license plate and address searches to investigate claims. Using this data, investigators can evaluate possible rate evasion, preexisting damage, commercial use of private vehicles, personal injury protection (PIP) claims, staged accidents, and garaging and theft fraud. \"We're excited to work together with ISO to take the existing vehicle location report to the next level. The addition of Event Links as a robust investigation solution adds insights to Decision Net — such as ranked vehicle locations, dates, times, and vehicle pictures — that can't be found anywhere else,\" said Chris Metaxas , chief executive officer at DRN.
