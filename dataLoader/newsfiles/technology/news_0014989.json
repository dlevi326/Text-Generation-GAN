The first of what is hoped to be many solutions, Unity Secure Firewall and Unity Secure Gateway are both automated and managed by experts who will monitor the systems for each client. \n“Unity Connected Solutions is launching a suite of new network security products to better protect our customers,” says Craig Sherry, Product Manager at Unity Connected Solutions. “Security threats are a big deal for even the most sophisticated networks, and right now, the most effective means of dealing with these threats is to have an automated system in place to react once these threats strike.” \nEach of these products comes with two options. For Unity Secure Firewall, there’s Firewall Essential, wherein a secure router is installed between the Internet connection and local network. The second option is Firewall Ultimate, in which additional services such as antivirus protection and content filtering are included in the package. \nUnity Secure Gateway also comes in Essential and Ultimate packages. The Essential option runs all traffic through the Unity Secure datacentre, cleans it, and then delivers the traffic through the Unity Secured Network back to the local router, while the Ultimate package features the above, plus even more security options. \n“With over 40% of companies experiencing some kind of network breach over the past year, 60% of those breaches happening in one minute or less, network security is a concern organizations need to take seriously,” Sherry adds. \nUnity Connected Solutions will be launching more security solutions in the future, including Unity Secure SIP and Unity Lync Integration. Both are expected to be ready soon. \n“Our goal is to provide better network security services at lower costs to help supplement our communication based products. This is just beginning of that commitment and our clients can expect a lot more in the very near future.” \nFor more information on Unity Connected Solutions and its Unity Secure Solutions product line, visit www.UnityConnected.com or www.unityconnected.com/solutions/network-security/network-security-services/ \nFor more information about us, please visit http://www.unityconnected.com/ \nContact Info:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T11:57:01.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
