Nor it is trying to track terrorists on behalf of the US government like Palantir, founded by a number of ex-PayPal executives. More Infineon could be bid target, says CEO \nBut Yelp’s task of persuading small businesses to ditch the old-favourite Yellow Pages telephone directory, flyers and local radio spots to advertise on its site is proving almost as difficult. \nMr Stoppelman, a former vice-president of engineering at the payments company, is facing a stock price that has fallen more than 70 per cent in the last year, competition from Google and a new documentary film that accuses the company of acting like the real mafia. \nShares fell more than 25 per cent in one day , after it missed earnings expectations last month, gave guidance to Wall Street to expect revenues that were lower than the average analyst forecast and announced that chairman Max Levchin was stepping down. Sales were up more than 50 per cent year on year to $133m in the quarter, but the market was expecting a juicier meal . \nMr Stoppelman admitted Yelp’s 2015 has not gone “as smoothly as we anticipated”. \nRobert Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, says Yelp had been a “painful stock”. At its height it had almost hit $100 last year, so when it came down to $60, the analyst recommended it — and then watched it slip even further to the current price in the mid-$20s. \n“We’ve been wrong each quarter and each quarter it has felt like there was a different story,” he says, explaining the reasons for underperformance had ranged from problems with the mix of advertisers to more recently, slow growth of its salesforce. “Last quarter it was just capitulation. Wall Street said enough is enough and after three quarters, threw the towel in.” \nYelp earns just one star as sales outlook cut and chairman quits \nShares slump as reviews website swings to loss and cuts forecasts. \nContinue reading \nMr Stoppelman founded Yelp back in 2004, when he was suffering from a cold and wanted a recommendation for a doctor. Since then, other larger companies have recognised peoples’ desires to read user opinions on local businesses from reviews on Facebook pages to Google’s inclusion of ratings and reviews in search results and Google Maps. \nA key problem for Yelp is that Google is a competitor and the gateway many users depend on to find search results. Yelp has even filed a complaint against the group in an EU investigation. \nYoussef Squali, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, adds that Yelp appeared to have lost 30 to 40 per cent of its traffic outside the US “overnight” after the Google algorithm was updated. “Generally Wall Street gets really, really, really nervous when a company’s destiny is controlled to a certain degree by Google and for good reason,” he says. \nYelp says the increasing shift to mobile is decreasing its reliance on Google, as users can access reviews directly through the app rather than via a browser and a search engine. But while mobile usage is growing — up 50 per cent in the last year — the app is on 18m devices, far fewer than the almost 80m users that use the desktop site and the 64m that use mobile browsers. \nGoogle also may not be the only competitor the company should worry about. The move to digital assistants including Apple ’s Siri, Microsoft ’s Cortana and Facebook ’s M could sidestep the need for users to visit the site and therefore see adverts. \nBut Yelp points to the size of the local advertising market overall, arguing that it has a total addressable market of $6bn-$8bn and up to 5m businesses that it needs to persuade to choose digital over traditional advertising. \nThe market — defined as anything that is not targeting the whole of the US — is growing, driven by digital marketing that can target ever more specific locations. Digital local advertising is forecast to increase by almost a third year on year to hit $66m in 2016, while traditional local advertising remains flat at about $70bn a year, according to estimates from research company Borrell Associates. \n70% \nfall in Yelp’s stock price in the last year \nBut transforming small businesses’ marketing strategies is labour intensive , with many needing help to use the new platforms. Last quarter, Yelp said the main reason it was lowering its guidance was because it had not been able to expand its salesforce as fast as expected in the competitive jobs market of San Francisco. Yelp has recognised the need to leave the expensive Bay Area and is opening sales offices in Scottsdale, Arizona, New York and Chicago. \nCorey Elliott, vice-president of research at Borrell Associates, says Yelp may be suffering from being one of a myriad options in the market. In a recent survey carried out by the research company, Yelp was the fourth most popular site for companies after Facebook, Google and Twitter but there were thousands of others from LinkedIn to Flickr. \n“Poor Yelp — they could just be taking the brunt of general frustration with the mystery of online advertising from a small business point of view,” he says. \nBut after reports that Yelp could be looking to sell itself to a larger internet company such as Yahoo , Amazon or Priceline earlier this summer, many investors were disappointed when no deal materialised. Local advertising reviews, they reasoned, might be better as a feature of a product rather than a standalone company. Yelp has not commented on any deal speculation. \nMr Squali adds: “Investors were disappointed when Jeremy pulled the plug on a potential transaction because after all the negative things reflected in the stock price, there was a premium put on the shares in case of a potential deal. \n“When it became clear there was not one coming, they moved on.” Documentary targeting Yelp funded by upset business owners \nYelp is not only facing a hostile Wall Street, but also stands accused of being a “billion-dollar bully” by small businesses that have clubbed together to fund a documentary of that name, warning that the tech company engages in mob-like tactics. \nIn the programme, due out this autumn, film-maker Kaylie Milliken films business owners claiming that when they did not take out an advert after calls from Yelp sales people, positive reviews disappeared from the ”recommended reviews” section and negative ones appeared instead. \nMs Milliken says her documentary shows Yelp engaging in “shady business practices, extortion and pay-to-play tactics”, which had upset local businesses so much that she had raised $90,000 in a Kickstarter campaign to make the film. \nThis is not the first time Yelp has faced such criticism. The FTC, the US regulator, has investigated the issue twice, most recently for a year, and closed cases without taking action. In late 2013, a Harvard study said Yelp did not treat advertisers differently from those who do not pay for their presence on the platform. \nYelp says the allegations are “completely not true” and that people can find plenty of five star-rated businesses that do not pay them a dime. They filter results only because they want to prioritise real, frequent users over spam, it adds.
