The incident marked a new point in the industry since it was the first recall to be issued based on a cybersecurity threat.\nFiat Chrysler's latest recall involves tweaking the software in certain Renegade radios equipped with 6.5-inch touch screens. More than half of the vehicles are still in U.S. dealer hands and haven't yet been sold.\nFiat Chrysler said it is unaware of any injuries related to software issue. Customers will receive a USB device to upgrade the vehicle software.\nWrite to Jeff Bennett at jeff.bennett@wsj.com\n 04, 2015 17:35 ET (21:35 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T03:08:21.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
