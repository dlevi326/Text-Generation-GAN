Both sides are committed to serious discussions and trying to achieve something productive. Both sides want to do the right thing. Both sides understand the circumstances and don’t want a repeat of what happened out west.” \nMarlon Jones, Manager, International Distribution, at International Paper, said: “I think it would send a strong message. It’ll give a lot of confidence to our company in seeing that the East Coast is where we want to be.” \nIf the contract can be extended to 2025, it would be the longest that the ILA has ever negotiated and may have an influence over the ILWU negotiations with Long Beach-Los Angeles employers next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:01:23.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
