(\"Pericom\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: PSEM) concerning the proposed acquisition of the Company by Diodes Incorporated (\"Diodes\") (NASDAQ: DIOD). \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20120215/MM54604LOGO \nPericom designs, manufactures, and markets high-performance digital, analog, and mixed-signal integrated circuits; and frequency control products used in electronic systems worldwide. \nUnder the terms of the proposed merger, each share of Pericom will be converted into the right to receive $17.00 in cash, without interest. The aggregate value of the transaction is approximately $400 million. The boards of both companies have approved the transaction, which is still subject to approval by Pericom's shareholders, as well as other customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. \nOur investigation concerns whether the Pericom board of directors is fulfilling its fiduciary duties, maximizing the value of the Company, disclosing all material benefits and costs, and obtaining full and fair consideration for Company stockholders. \nIf you own Pericom shares and wish to discuss this matter with us, or have any questions concerning your rights and interests with regard to this matter, please contact: \nJames G.
