Subsequent to the end of the quarter we also completed the sale of certain assets of Volt Telecommunications Group, which will further enhance our operational focus on our core staffing business and improve profitability in the future. In addition, our efforts to improve our balance sheet and strengthen our liquidity position continue to bear fruit with the closing of a new one-year, $150.0 million short-term financing program with PNC Bank. I am also pleased with our ongoing initiatives to reduce expenses and improve our cost structure, as evidenced by the decrease in selling, administrative and other operating costs of $3.8 million, or 7.0%, compared to the third quarter last year.\" \nMr. Dean concluded, \"We are actively pursuing advanced technologies and improving business processes to support our core staffing business. Our management team is energized, excited and working with a sense of urgency to address the challenges that face us and to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead.
