Just thought I'd add my opinion.\nThere are many of these blogs, sites and headlines which should not and must not be taken seriously. Just read the source and you will see! While I completely agree that things in our country are worrisome - if you read the comments made by many of the people - you will understand why so many people have become so intolerant and extreme in their views. The comments are disgusting! I am embarrassed to be white when read what people say. Now more than ever we need to unify not divide. Racism is something well and truly destined for the history books, yet some people just can't let go. Get over it - this is 2015.\nBut the agenda is not just black against white - the deeper problem is there are no jobs, poor leadership , poor education and certainly a lot of resentment towards the wealthy. This is simply being directed at whites more often than not as the simple truth is that white people were the recipients of an entire countries' fruit at the expense of the rest for many years. This has fuelled the angry masses and unfortunately has resulted in much of the crime being directed at whites not because of color but because of this wealth gap. We all need to realize that the killing in SA is not only of white people - it's of everyone of every color. White people are very quick to say crime is directed at them - however the black on black crime in the townships and poor areas is most instances far, far worse. There is a crisis in SA and everyone is being affected.\nMany South Africans have been able to set up home comfortably outside of SA. For most of us we cannot (and don't want to) and it is therefore our duty to fix what we can but to also realize we need to ignore a lot as well as this noise on social media just spreads the hatred and fear unnecessarily.\nSouth Africa and many other emerging economies are facing unprecedented hardship due to poor leadership, global resources which have collapsed and the after effects of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. What we need more than ever is strong leadership and a unified SA, leadership willing to make tough decision and some hard sacrifices in order to make things better.\nI don't know what the answer is but I do know that the countless Facebook posts going around and racist trolls on News24 hiding behind fake names isn't going to help our cause.\nFor one we need to understand why things are what they are - so called \"second degree\" thinking - and realize it's not doom and gloom and the opportunities for everyone in SA are abundant. Africa is an amazing continent with amazing people all of who have been given God given talents. It is up to all of us to help unlock these talents that Africa can rise to its potential and not languish in poverty and crime. As Gandi\nsaid, we need to \"Be the change we want to see in the world\" but also ensure we vote in the right leaders. Therein lies most of the problem. Problems start from the top and without a moral compass and leadership we can trust and admire - sadly we will not come right.\nBut I have faith and I believe things are changing. We are at a crossroads in SA history and the next 5 years are going to be as important as early 90's. Let's be positive and let's please not encourage or spread the comments and hatred we read on social media. Cowards hiding behind a fake name won't move us forward. We need positive thinking more than ever - and perhaps a new president too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T16:10:19.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
