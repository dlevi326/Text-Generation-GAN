LOUIS, MO--(Marketwired - September 24, 2015) - Keystone Technologies, an industry innovator in senior care technology solutions, today announced that it has teamed with Iowa-based Western Home Communities to publish a guide detailing the future of value-based care within the senior care space. The e-book, The Senior Living Operator's Guide: Making the Shift to Value-Based Care, is available for free download at http://www.keystone-technologies.com/making-the-shift-to-value-based-care-guide . \nOver the past few years, value-based care -- a pay-for-performance approach that aims to reduce costs by emphasizing preventative care and efficiency -- has emerged as a driving force in the future of healthcare payment structures. However, the move to value-based care is so new that predicting how it will affect the senior care industry is difficult. The new guide from Keystone Technologies and Western Home Communities examines this rapidly evolving strategy and how senior care operators can successfully prepare for the inevitable adoption of value-based care. Among the e-book's features: Why the established approach of volume-based care is inefficient in today's environment An explanation of the \"triple aim\" that is at the heart of value-based care The role of accountable care organizations, or ACOs, in the future of value-based care How value-based care compares with volume-based care Four key considerations when shifting to value-based care \n\"For certain, value-based care will impact how senior care will be provided in the future,\" says Andy Belval, President and CEO of Keystone Technologies. \"This pay-for-performance approach likely will be required by federal and private payers, and will carry penalties for those organizations that do not participate. We have teamed with Kris Hansen from Western Home Communities to offer important information to senior care operators on the inevitable change to value-based care. Our guide will help operators make the most of this opportunity to position their organizations for success immediately and into the future.\" \nFor more information about this new e-book or Keystone Technologies' innovative senior care solutions, visit the company's website at http://www.keystone-technologies.com . \nAbout Keystone Technologies Keystone Technologies provides solutions to help senior care communities offer the highest quality of life and care to their residents.
