The full game will also not use Battlelog , the web-based multiplayer service regularly used with DICE's other hit series Battlefield. \nServer browsers have featured in DICE's Battlefield games, and given the close links between that multiplayer focused military shooter and the Battlefront series the Swedish developer is now rejuvenating it is perhaps a sign of them trying to differentiate the two series as much as they can. \nEverett was responding to a question about the console versions with his comment on matchmaking, so server browsers may yet feature on the PC version of Battlefront. However, the wording of his comment does suggest that won't be the case. \nThe Star Wars: Battlefront beta will run at some point in \"early October\" on PS4, Xbox One and PC and feature three game modes â€“ the 40-player Walker Assault mode, the Survival Mission mode and a new Drop Zone mode which will be detailed shortly. \nStar Wars Battlefront will be released fully on 20 November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T10:15:12.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
