But now, a new machine, called “Giraffe,” has reportedly mastered chess in just three days, and is good enough to beat 98 percent of international tournament chess players. Giraffe, which is described in a new paper uploaded to the pre-print site Arxiv, is the brainchild of researchers at Imperial College London. They set out to create a system that plays chess in more human-like ways. To date, chess-playing programs have taken a so-called brute-force approach, in which they scan millions of possible moves until they find the best option for a particular stage in the game. It’s an effective process, but a time-consuming one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T09:23:13.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
