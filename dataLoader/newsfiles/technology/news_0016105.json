He had been fatally bashed. \nA 33-year-old mother of three, Peta Lorang-Goubran, and her 28-year-old partner Mark Dayney, both from the Gold Coast suburb of Coombabah, were later charged with murder. They are currently in custody. \nSuperintendent David Hutchinson said Mr Spencer had responded to an ad which purported to be for the woman’s sexual services. \nPolice alleged when Lorang-Goubran turned up to meet Mr Spencer she was with Dayney and they assaulted Mr Spencer with a baseball bat. \n“They would advertise on Craigslist online and they would advertise in a manner which reflected an offering of sexual services,” Superintendent Hutchinson told Fairfax at the time. \n“They then had a plan to go to the client’s residence and actually rob that person. \n“We believe that this has probably occurred on a number of occasions and because of the circumstances the victims would have been very reluctant to report that to the police.” Queensland man Mark Emmanuel Spencer was murdered after he responded to an ad on Craigslist. Source: Supplied \nIn a separate incident, a Darwin man who used Craigslist to find a sex partner found himself a victim of severe violence when he was abducted on a hook up gone wrong. \nNews.com.au understands the male victim drove to pick up a 19-year-old man for prearranged sex but was instead abducted, robbed, bashed and had both his hands broken by the attacker. \nThe alleged offender was charged with armed robbery, deprivation of liberty and arson, following the incident on January 24. \nThe case will go to trial in the NT Supreme Court on October 12. \nPolice will allege the man used a 15cm, black knife to threaten the victim, and that he bashed, abducted and robbed him. \nAustralian sections on Craigslist were today heavy with posts from users featuring photos of genitalia and requesting encounters with those willing to perform sex acts on each other. \nCraigslist, which turns 20 this year, has reported that more than 60 million people use the classifieds site every month in the United States alone, and claimed “the incidents of violent crime is extremely low”. \nAustralian state and territory police do not record data based on how murder or assault victims met their attackers so couldn’t determine how many people in that situation had met with foul play. \nBut it’s not just Craigslist used by online predators, with Facebook and other sites also proving popular when it comes to connecting potential attackers and victims. \nA Hobart court last month heard Victorian man Jason Ralph Jay, 33, who attacked and threatened to kill a Hobart woman in her own home after meeting on Facebook, was a serial abuser of women. \nActing Director of Public Prosecutions, Daryl Coates, SC, told Chief Justice Alan Blow the defendant and the victim met through a depression support group on social media before beginning an online relationship. \nWhen the defendant flew to Hobart, the woman picked him up from the airport before driving him to her home where the pair engaged in consensual sex. \nBut when a request for further physical interaction was turned down the next afternoon, Jay responded: “I might as well go back to Melbourne as I don’t want to stay with someone who doesn’t want to have sex with me.” \nFlying into a violent rage, the defendant began to punch, kick and pull the hair of his 35-year-old victim, before throttling her and threatening to kill her during an ordeal that lasted up to half an hour. \nWhen asked to stop his attack, Jay replied that he “understood why your ex-boyfriend hit you”. From Facebook to Craigslist, dating sites and depression support group forums, some of the most violent predators have found their victims via the web.

I will never make sense of this attack,” the statement read. \n“But dying was never an option for me. I fought to live.” \nThe woman said she accepted she had been naive, but could never accept what was done to her. \nThe court heard of the man’s significant record of violence against women, having been jailed on the mainland for similar crimes to that perpetrated against his Hobart victim. \nHe was remanded in custody and this month sentenced to seven years in jail, starting from March 2015. \nActing Superintendent Scott Manley, from the Sex Crimes Division, told news.com.au it was important to use caution when meeting up with prospective partners. \n“Responsible and respectful social networking, including meeting new people online for dating, is not discouraged by police however caution is recommended when transitioning to the non-virtual world,” he said. \n“Circumstances or people may not be as they appear online and criminals can use this to dupe unsuspecting victims into parting with money or placing themselves in a vulnerable or unsafe position. \n“We would ask people to use caution if you intend to meet with somebody you have only met in an online environment. \n“Make sure you advise others such as friends or family and take other measures to ensure you are safe such as ensuring you travel and meet in public and visible places.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:03:57.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
