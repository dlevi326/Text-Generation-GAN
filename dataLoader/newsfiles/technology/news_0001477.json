The playbook isn't working this time.\nApple is expected to unveil yet another iPhone update Wednesday. Typically, the media circus leading up to this event has been enough to get the stock going. But in the 30 days leading up to the iPhone 6S' expected announcments, shares of Apple have dropped more than 6%. It's the first time the stock has fallen ahead of an announcement since the unveil of the original iPhone in eight years ago.\nSome think the low expectations for the iPhone 6S going into the unveil could reduce the letdown on the actual news. Shares of Apple have fallen by an average of 0.9% on the day the latest iPhone was announced in the previous seven launches and have sunk further in the following 30 days. But since Apple's stock didn't run up ahead of the 6S - some investors hope the subsequent selling after the announcement will be smaller, says Bespoke Investment Group. Analysts, too, still see 32% upside in the stock in the next 18 months. Bears think the story is getting boring. Wednesday will be a telling day.\nUSA TODAY markets reporter Matt Krantz answers a different reader question every weekday.
