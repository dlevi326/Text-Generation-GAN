Consumer smartphones have been the only business open to it, though it has struggled for recognition in that business. More Yahoo presses on with Alibaba spin-off \nOn Tuesday, Google unveiled a 5.7 inch phone from Huawei, called the 6p, as part of its annual Nexus line of new Android phones. Nexus devices are intended to act as showcases for the latest Android software, with Google switching between different manufacturers each year. For the first time the search company also announced a second Nexus phone, a 5 inch device from LG. \nThe new devices were part of a spate of phone, tablet, TV and music announcements, as Google laid out its latest family of consumer electronics devices in competition with Apple . The mobile and home devices were unveiled at a small media event in San Francisco that was a far cry from Apple’s splashy launch of the iPhone 6s earlier this month, while also pointing to key differences in strategy as the companies fight for the upper hand with consumers. \nSundar Pichai , who was recently named chief executive of Google’s internet business, said that 1.4bn Android handsets were in use around the world, up from 1bn in June last year. That is roughly double the number of iPhones, iPads and iPod touches running Apple’s iOS software. \nIn one sign of how competition has intensified between the tech giants, Google revealed that it has closed the gap with Apple in the living room, after selling 20m of its Chromecast devices that are used to stream internet video to TV sets in two years. By contrast, Apple said earlier this year it had sold 25m Apple TV boxes since sales began in 2006. \nMr Pichai said that Google had bet on making its smartphones the centrepiece of its connected TV experience, in contrast to Apple, which this month came up with a new remote control for its TV box. The different approach has enabled Google to hold the price of its Chromecast gadgets at $35, while Apple has more than doubled the price of Apple TV to $149 as it expands into gaming and other areas. \nGoogle also followed Apple in announcing a tablet with a detachable keyboard. Both companies have moved to catch up with Microsoft , whose well-reviewed Surface hybrid device has found a foothold in the office market. \nGoogle’s tablet, called the Pixel C, relies on strong, self-aligning magnets to attach the screen to a bluetooth keyboard. It also sports a narrow keyboard that has had its outer keys shaved off and displayed onscreen instead. \n$35 \nPrice of Google’s Chromecast streaming devices \nIn another push to expand its influence in the home, Google said a software update later this year will bring the ability to synchronise music playing across multiple rooms simultaneously, posing a low-cost challenge to Sonos’ high-end wireless speaker systems. \nEarlier this week, Sonos revamped its top-line Play:5 wireless speaker, increasing its price by $100 to $499, and launched new “TruePlay” audio calibration software that automatically adjusts sound based on the speaker’s position in any room. \nSonos customers must use the company’s own app to listen to most music streaming services. But Google has struck a deal with Spotify for the streaming music market leader to support Chromecast directly within its own app. \nThe partnership with Huawei comes as Google has been seeking to re-enter China with a local version of its Play mobile app store, five years after it pulled out of the country in protest at a cyber attack that involved the theft of some of its more sensitive software. \nGoogle also abandoned sales of the Nexus phones through carriers in the US, but said it would sell the devices in its online store instead. The move echoes its initial plan with the Nexus brand in 2010, when it tried to break the power of the mobile operators by selling a device on its own that could easily be transferred from one network to another. \nThe new phones are the first Android devices to include fingerprint readers to unlock them and authorise mobile payments, something Apple introduced two years ago. They are also a showcase for Google’s latest advances in artificial intelligence, including a feature that analyses what users are doing on their devices and suggests things they may want to do next. \n21% \nof Android devices using the most recent software \nDespite the advances it announces in the Android software each year, Google has consistently failed to match Apple’s success in getting users of older devices to upgrade to its latest operating system. \nOnly 21 per cent of Android devices use the most recent version, known as Lollipop, which was released last November. In contrast, Apple says that more than half of all iPhones and iPads are already running its iOS9 software, which was only released two weeks ago.
