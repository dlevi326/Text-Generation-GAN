In March 2002, Henry Bath paid a $7 million dividend shortly before being sold to Sempra Energy.\nLast year's dividend was the only one returned to JPMorgan, suggesting the sum was an accumulation of profits during its four-year ownership.\nThe bank sold its physical commodities unit, including Henry Bath, for $800 million last October to energy trader Mercuria, ending a four-year foray into the lucrative business of handling oil, gas and metals amid rising regulatory and political pressure to retreat to the bank's core business of lending.\nTrafigura and JPMorgan's rival Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), which also got into metals storage in 2010 lured by the fat margins, also exited recently.\nGoldman Sachs sold its Metro warehousing last year and in August, Trafigura pulled out altogether.\nLast week, China's CMST Development Co Ltd ( 600787.SS ) said it planned to buy a majority stake in Henry Bath from Mercuria for $60 million.\nFACTBOX on Henry Bath:\n(Reporting by Josephine Mason; Editing by Alan Crosby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:57:56.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
