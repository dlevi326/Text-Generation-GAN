Date:9/8/2015 \nDUBLIN , Sept. 08, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- \nResearch and Markets ( http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/9fzd77/metered_dose ) has announced the addition of the \"Metered Dose Inhalers to 2022\" report to their offering. \nMetered dose inhalers have been around for more than thirty years, and while the underlying technology is relatively straightforward and mature, device developers and their inhaled drug partners have been able to add improvements and/or new features that address MDI limitations and advance ease-of-use. Because of the underlying physiology of the human respiratory system, inhaled drug pharmacodynamics, and marked variations in the use of inhalers across patient populations, inhaler design presents unique challenges to device developers. Recent improvements in the control of the inspiry event have reduced the need for add-on devices designed to help regulate patient administration. Growth in upper airway therapeutics will help to push MDI unit demand to high single digits between now and the end of the decade.
