Establishing a credible deterrent requires agreement on norms of cyber behavior by the international community, he said.\nHowever, they said attributing a cyber attack was far more difficult than determining who launched a missile.\nClapper said the current environment was like \"the Wild West\" and the world needed to deal with the evolving threats.\nOne key question, he said, was whether to limit spying activity, such as the incident that compromised personal data of 21 million individuals in a database maintained by the Office Of Personnel Management.\nDeputy Defense Secretary Robert Work told the committee that the U.S. response would be \"vigorous\" if another incident on the scale of the OPM breach was firmly linked to China. He said the Pentagon was finalizing a broad cyber warfare policy that was supposed to have been shared with Congress over a year ago.\nHe said the response could involve a variety of tools, including economic sanctions and criminal indictments, as well as potential use of offensive cyber weapons.\nU.S. officials have linked the OPM breach to China, but have not said whether they believe its government was responsible.\nClapper said no definite statement had been made about the origin of the OPM hack since officials were not fully confident about the three types of evidence that were needed to link an attack to a given country: the geographic point of origin, the identity of the \"actual perpetrator doing the keystrokes,\" and who was responsible for directing the act.\nSeparately, the four-star general leading the U.S. military command that transports troops and cargo told Reuters that he was concerned about cyber attacks on its contractors and industry partners.\nAir Force General Darren McDew, who heads the U.S. Transportation Command, said that while efforts had been made to improve the command's cyber security, his \"concern is outside of that sphere\". He added that the protection of U.S. defense contractors \"is not as robust\".\nA little over a year ago, a Senate Armed Services Committee report said the Transportation Command's computer systems had been breached at least 20 times in a year and cast doubt about the security measures being undertaken.\n(Additional reporting by Idrees Ali and Megha Rajagopalan in BEIJING; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Clarence Fernandez)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:51:31.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
