(ASTI) \nSAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Adaptive Sound Technologies, Inc. (ASTI) today launched novo(TM), the world's first wearable personal audio device that adjusts your volume up or down based on ambient noise. \nTo learn more, visit the novo IndieGoGo campaign ( http://bit.ly/1Kk8qJm ). \nnovo uses patented Adaptive Audio Technology(TM) to automatically monitor and adjust headphone volume based on your surroundings and adapts your audio in real time by either boosting or reducing the volume to provide you with a seamless listening experience. -- \"Boost Mode\" automatically increases headphone volume to drown out the sounds around you, and then decrease volume when the noise around you subsides. For instance, when listening to audio on your headphones in environments such as crowded streets or on public transportation. -- \"Reduce Mode\" reduces audio volume automatically if an outside noise needs attention, such as a coworker approaching to speak with you or riding your bike in traffic. \n\"We created novo to give you the ultimate listening experience,\" said Sam Nicolino, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASTI. \"Using the same patented technology found in our best-selling Sound+Sleep Therapy Systems, we redefined the science of smart volume control. Aside from the convenience provided to users, we wanted to create a product that valued safety when utilizing headphones - combating ear-fatigue and providing volume only as loud as it needs to be for healthy listening.\" \nnovo contains a state of the art MEMs microphone integrated with a hardware platform and synced with software algorithms to intelligently listen to your environment and adapt audio based on noise levels.
