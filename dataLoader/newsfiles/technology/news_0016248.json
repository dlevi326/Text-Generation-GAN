It is also set to showcase the latest Android dubbed Marshmallow. - Advertisement - \nNot sure why all the secrecy surrounding its release but with a spec this great, it won’t be short on takers. The fact that it comes with the latest Android OS makes for an unbeatable proposition. It would take many more months before any other flagship from other manufacturers would be able to have their version – if it could be updated at all. That alone is the X factor for this new Nexus. \nFor the time being, there’s no detailed information about the Nexus 6P's measurement and weight. We just have to wait until its official release. \nEquipped with a 5.7-inch Quad HD AMOLED capacitive touchscreen that displays 1440 x 2560 pixels or ~515 ppi pixel density, it surely is the best out there. Feast your eyes on the amazing quality of the images on-screen. There will also be a fingerprint sensor at the rear that is a nice touch. In terms of protection, you can depend on its Gorilla Glass 4 to give you a piece of mind. \nIn terms of performance, you can expect nothing but solid from the Nexus 6P. It comes with the Qualcomm MSM8994 Snapdragon 810 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising Quad-core 1.56 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.82 GHz Cortex-A57, Adreno 430 graphics, and 3GB RAM. This would put it right up there with other flagships, and you only wish that it would have an additional 1GB RAM. There won’t be any issue for this device to eat up everything that you can throw at it. - Advertisement - \nThe camera has never been a great strength point for most Google devices, and the Nexus 6P is no different. Still, it has a pretty decent 13 Megapixel primary camera with 4128 x 3096 pixels, autofocus, optical image stabilization, dual-LED (ring) flash, dual recording, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, photo sphere, panorama and HDR. As for the secondary camera, it has a 5 Megapixel camera for your selfie shots. \nThere will be 3 options available – you can choose 32GB, 64GB or 128GB. Just remember to choose wisely (or the maximum that your budget allows you), as it does not have an expansion slot. It has always been this way anyway, so you better learn to adapt to it. What’s the point of having Google Drive right? \nAs for the battery, you can expect great life with its 3450mAh battery. It should be more than enough to power up the device for a day or two in between charging. You can also capitalize on wireless charging as a means of keeping it up and running. \nBut the best part of the Nexus 6P is the latest OS from Android called Marshmallow. This plain vanilla Android OS includes better power efficiency and better security and much-improved app permissions. In plain simple terms, it will be much faster and even more optimized for all devices. Let’s see how the latest OS can help to prolong a device’s life by upgrading to Marshmallow. But we probably have to wait months before it makes its way to other manufacturers – even then you expect it to be rolled out to flagship devices and a small fraction of mid-range devices. Or you can go to the famous modding community for help in updating. - Advertisement - \nThe Huawei Nexus 6P is nothing short of brilliant. Prepare yourself for the latest Android Marshmallow come September 29 th and let’s see for ourselves what it can do. If you want the bragging rights for the next few months, than this device will give you that. Plus it has a great screen, great hardware, and great battery as well. \nThe Huawei Nexus 6P is available for $499 USD and is available in Silver, Black, White, and Gold.
