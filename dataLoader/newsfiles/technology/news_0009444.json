The United States on Tuesday urged China to release a dozen human rights activists and religious figures who it said were detained before a planned meeting with a visiting US diplomat.\nInternational religious freedom envoy David Saperstein said the activists -- including respected human rights lawyer Zhang Kai, pastors and other Christian figures -- were held during his August 20-28 trip to China. \n\"These detentions fit into the disturbing pattern of state intimidation of public interest lawyers, Internet activists, journalists, religious leaders,\" Saperstein told reporters. \n\"They clearly underscore the precariousness of religious life in China.\" \nThe United States has escalated warnings to China on the thorny issue of human rights and religious freedom that could overshadow talks between President Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama during the Chinese leader's state visit later this month. \nSaperstein said that Zhang, who he described as a defender of religious rights, had gathered together the group for a meeting with the envoy but that they were all detained the night before it was due to happen. \nOther people who he did manage to see were later detained too, he added. \n\"It is a source of great concern to us and we are calling on the government to immediately release all these human rights activists and religious leaders.\" \nThe Communist Party keeps tight control over religion for fear it could challenge its grip on power, requiring believers to worship in places approved by the state and under government supervision. \nAnd since Xi came to power in 2013, the government has taken a harder line towards civil and religious society. \nMore than 200 lawyers and activists, including Zhang, were questioned or detained in July as part of a sweeping nationwide crackdown, according to rights groups. \nIn the eastern province of Zhejiang, authorities have stepped up a long-running campaign to remove church crosses, and several Catholic and Protestant churches have been destroyed. \nHong Kong pro-democracy student leader Joshua Wong pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges of inciting unlawful assembly over protests last year that triggered more than two months of paralysing street rallies in the city. \nWong, the teenage face of the \"Umbrella Movement\", was charged along with fellow student leaders Nathan Law and Alex Chow last week, almost a year after the protest, in a move activists described as a \"political prosecution\". \nThe charges relate to a protest in September last year that led up to widespread protests that blocked major highways and streets in the southern Chinese city. \nThe months-long protest starting in late September called for free elections for the semi-autonomous city's next leader, opposing a blueprint laid down by Beijing that would have meant candidates were vetted by a loyalist committee. \nThat reform package was voted down by legislators in June, in an unprecedented rebuke to Beijing. \nWong, 18, pleaded not guilty to charges of \"inciting others to take part in an unlawful assembly\", and \"taking part in an unlawful assembly\". \n\"This government is constantly limiting political freedom and freedom to protest,\" Law, 22, told reporters outside the courthouse after also pleading not guilty to charges of inciting unlawful assembly. \nChow, 25, facing one charge of unlawful assembly, told reporters: \"The one who's done wrong is the government, not the people, not the fighters of the Umbrella Movement.\" \nThe case was adjourned until October 30. \nWong, along with Law and two other activists, has also been charged with obstructing police at a protest in June last year. \nThey were opposing a \"white paper\" from China that asserted its control over the semi-autonomous city. \nThat case was adjourned on Friday to October 26. \n\"It's frustrating and tiring, but I still think it's worth paying the price,\" Wong told AFP at the time. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:14:59.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
