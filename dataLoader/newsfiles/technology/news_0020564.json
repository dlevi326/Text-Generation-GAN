Designed to destroy pesky drones buzzing around in sensitive locations, the High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator, or HEL MD, is small and deadly accurate. \nThe laser can hit within an inch or two of its target depending on the speed and distance â€”ideal for military use. Unfortunately, it sounds more like a dollar store laser pointer than any artillery from Star Wars. \nADVANCED 3D PRINTING \nMIT has outdone itself. Last week, we reported on the invention of a 3D glass printer. Now, the institute says its new MultiFab 3D printer can print up to 10 different materials at once. \nDeveloped from low-cost, off-the-shelf components for $7,000, the machine can be used for consumer electronics, micro-sensing, medical imaging and more. \nThe MIT team also plans to experiment with embedding motors and actuators, making it possible to 3D print more advanced electronics like robots. \nCHRYSLER STILL WOOING GM? \nEarlier this year, the CEO of Fiat Chrysler made serious waves in the American auto industry by floating the possibility of a merger with General Motors. GM executives dismissed the idea shortly thereafter, but Sergio Marchionne is back in the headlines after telling the publication Automotive News that a combined company could generate $30 billion in annual earnings. \nGM responded that it has already vetted a merger with Fiat Chrysler and concluded that stockholders would be best served by continuing its current strategy. Marchionne, who has long called for additional consolidation in automaking, countered that GM's executives and board members won't be able to avoid the merger's cost-saving potential forever. \nSO WHAT DO YOU THINK? \nAre Marchionne's concerns about rising costs in the auto industry warranted? Should Detroit's \"Big Three\" become the \"Big Two\" in the interest of savings?
