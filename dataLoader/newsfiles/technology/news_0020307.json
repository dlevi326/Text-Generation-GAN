Thanks to an inventor from Sacramento, Calif., they won't need to feel that way again.\nHe developed EZ FINDER to eliminate the need to waste time and effort searching for a missing phone. Besides that, it protects against the loss of phone numbers, photographs or other personal information. Perhaps, the best news is that it avoids the extra expense of having to replace a lost cellphone or pay for additional insurance. So it's easy to understand why it eliminates the frustration associated with searching for missing items. Furthermore, it is attractive and affordably priced, making it a great gift for any occasion. It is also convenient, practical, economical and affordably priced. In addition, it is user friendly, reliable and effective.\nThe inventor's personal experience inspired the idea. \"There were too many times when I misplaced my cell phone and couldnâ€™t find it,\" he said. \"I knew this was a common problem so I decided to solve it for myself and help others as well.\"\nThe original design was submitted to the Sacramento office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
