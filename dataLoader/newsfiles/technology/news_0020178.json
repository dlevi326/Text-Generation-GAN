Authorities have not ruled out enforcement action.

The attitude shown by a number of these websites and apps suggested little regard for how anyone's personal information should be handled, let alone that of children.\" \nThe Global Privacy Enforcement Network (GPEN) Privacy Sweep found that of the apps and websites examined: \n:: Two in three (67%) collected children's personal information, such as names and email addresses \n:: Only 31% had effective controls to limit the gathering of personal data from children \n:: Half shared personal information with third parties \n:: One in five (22%) offered an opportunity for children to give their phone number, with a similar proportion (23%) allowing them to provide photos or video \n:: Only a quarter encouraged parental involvement, while seven in 10 (71%) did not offer an accessible way to delete account information \nThe ICO said it looked at 50 websites domestically, with similar results to the international picture. \nAuthorities will consider whether further action is needed against specific providers in their respective countries, and whether there are cases requiring co-ordinated international action. \nMr Stevens said: \"Internationally we saw some websites and apps gathering more information than we felt they needed, and sharing that data with third parties. \n\"The most common concern domestically was a lack of information being provided about how their information would be used. \n\"We saw generic privacy policies that simply weren't specific enough, and some without any information at all, which isn't good enough. \n\"We'll now be writing out to the sites and apps that caused us concern, making clear the changes we expect them to make. We wouldn't rule out enforcement action in this area if required.\" \nThere were examples of good practice. Some websites and apps provided effective protective controls such as pre-set avatars or usernames to stop children inadvertently sharing their own information. \nOther examples included chat functions which only allowed children to choose words and phrases from pre-approved lists and the use of \"just in time\" warnings to deter children from unnecessarily entering personal information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:29:48.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
