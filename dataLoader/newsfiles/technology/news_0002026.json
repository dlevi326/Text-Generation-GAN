The retailer introduced LA25 , Target’s New Innovation Initiative on September 16, designed to test new innovations that will elevate Target’s shopping experience to higher levels. \nAs part of its new efforts, Target is testing customer services in some stores, including makeup and skincare advice in the beauty aisle and style advice at dressing rooms. The retailer is also providing “Digital Service Ambassadors” to help customers use Target’s digital channels, including the mobile app and Cartwheel, as well as assist with in-store pickups. \nSimilar to the personal attention shoppers expect from higher-end department stores or boutiques, the service is designed to bring personal interaction with shoppers at Target to a new level. \nTarget is spending a billion dollars on technology to boost its Omni channel efforts, but it’s not leaving it at that. Clearly the retailer believes that personal interaction with its customers in stores is essential to growth. \n“Many companies have gone through challenging times, lost their stride,” Cornell said, addressing the gathering of 11,000 corporate employees and 2,500 store leaders from across the country, according to USA Today . “For us, it is a very difficult time. We’re still facing challenges but we are turning the corner and we’re seeing a significant reversal in trend.” \n“We absolutely believe that physical stores will be a huge driver of our future success,” CEO Cornell told Fortune during a reporter briefing this week at Target’s national fall meeting. \nAs the competition to attract and keep shoppers both online and in-store mounts, retailers are challenged to find new ways to provide an enhanced shopping experience that will keep customers coming back for more.
