Diets were cross-referenced with the scans. \nThose who ate sweet drinks, salted snacks, and processed meats had smaller left hippocampi, while those who ate vegetables, fruit and fish had bigger left hippocampi, the authors concluded. The connection existed independent of factors such as gender, exercise and smoking . \nHowever, the study does not appear to draw a cause-and-effect relationship between the two, just an association. \n“Recent research has established that diet and nutrition are related to the risk for depression, anxiety and dementia, however, until now it was not clear how diet might exert an influence on mental health and cognition,” Jacka said. “This latest study sheds light on at least one of the pathways by which eating an unhealthy diet may influence the risk for dementia, cognitive decline and mental disorders such as depression and anxiety in older people.” \nReduced hippocampus size has also been shown to correlate to dementia and related brain diseases. \nThe newest study on the hippocampus just confirms some scientific suspicions. As early as 2009, King’s College London researchers pointed to diet as a possible culprit in modulating hippocampus size and function .
