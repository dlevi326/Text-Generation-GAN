Next month's vote is expected to be the most free and fair since the country's independence from France in 1960.\nA new electoral code adopted by the transitional parliament excludes everyone who backed the former president's proposal to amend the constitution so that he could seek another term. Candidates of the former ruling party also have been declared ineligible.\nAccording a statement issued on Thursday, two candidates out of the 16 have been declared unfit for the October 11 vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T11:22:52.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
