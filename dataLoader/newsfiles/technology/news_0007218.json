Picture: BLOOMBERG/PAU BARRENA Related articles Catalan independence hopes high in symbolic vote on split from Spain BARCELONA — Separatist parties were expected to win control of Catalonia’s parliament in an election on Sunday, setting the region on course for a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain, which the central government says is impossible.\nOpinion polls indicate the main secessionist group \"Junts Pel Si\" (Together for Yes) and leftist party CUP are likely to fall short of 50% of the vote, but would secure a majority of seats in the 135-strong regional assembly. Both have said that such a result would allow them to unilaterally declare independence within 18 months.\nThe Spanish centre-right government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which has opposed a referendum on secession, has called the plan \"a nonsense\" and vowed to block it in court. In Barcelona, home to three-quarters of the 5.5-million Catalan voters, the mood was relaxed following a tense political campaign.\nWHY CATALONIA MATTERS TO SPAIN: IT IS SPAIN’S SECOND-BIGGEST REGION: Catalonia is home to 7.5-million of Spain’s 47-million people, making it the second-biggest region after Andalusia in the south with 8.4-million. IT IS RICH: Catalonia accounted for 19% of Spain’s gross domestic product (GDP) last year, or nearly €200bn, making it the country’s richest region. Its GDP per capita has fallen slightly since the economic crisis erupted in 2008, but remains higher than the national average: just less than €27,000 last year, the National Statistics Institute says. BUSINESSES: More than 586,000 companies are based in Catalonia, most of them small-and medium-sized businesses. Volkswagen has a factory in the region in which it makes vehicles under its Seat brand. TOURISM: With its capital Barcelona and Mediterranean beaches, Catalonia draws more foreign tourists than any other Spanish region. More than 16.8-million foreigners visited last year, one quarter of Spain’s total. EXPORTS: Catalonia accounted for 25% of all Spanish exports last year. Since 2011, it has exported more products abroad than to the rest of Spain. It received 17% of total foreign investment in Spain last year, a sum of about €2,9bn. EMPLOYMENT: The unemployment rate in Catalonia in the second quarter of this year stood at 19.1%, extremely high but below Spain’s national average of 22.4%. INFRASTRUCTURE: Catalonia’s capital Barcelona is home to Spain’s second-busiest airport, with 37.6-million passengers last year, second only to Madrid. Its port is the nation’s third busiest after Algeciras and Valencia.\nThe regional government said it expected the turnout to rise sharply from the last elections in 2012 after postal votes jumped 56%. Pollsters have said an exceptionally high turnout could spur a surprise result.\nMontse Casamitjana, a schoolteacher from Barcelona, said the election was a moment of truth for Catalonia. \"We want to decide and we want to feel that we are being heard,\" she said after casting her ballot.\nOther voters said they were tired of the political wrangling over secession.\nWhile a breakaway by the wealthy northeastern autonomous region is seen as hypothetical, even in Catalonia, analysts say the result will bear long-lasting consequences at local and countrywide level.\nThe secessionist campaign is facing a defining moment.\nSupport for the cause has waned steadily since a peak in 2013 and any failure to achieve a majority would deal a serious blow to the movement.\nThe vote may also influence the course of the Spanish general election in December.\nThe main national parties, all seeking to capture more votes in Catalonia, have said they were ready to discuss with Catalonia a more favourable tax regime and increased infrastructure spending if they win. Depending on who forms a government in Madrid, constitutional reform to recognise Catalonia as a nation within the Spanish state may be on the cards.\nWith separatists saying independence is the only solution and the next Spanish government unlikely to enjoy the strong and stable majority it would need in a new era of fragmented politics, however, any talks with Catalonia may be a hard sell.\nBut most analysts and politicians say they would go a long way towards soothing discontent in Catalonia.\n\"Only when a final package is adopted and put to a vote will the problem find some form of resolution,\" Teneo Intelligence analyst Antonio Barroso said in a note this week.\n\"Even if secessionist parties are able to remain united — a big if — and continue pushing for independence, any concessions from Madrid would probably help to stymie the movement’s momentum.\"\nFinancial markets will also be watching the vote outcome.\nWhile few investors believe independence is likely soon, the gap between Spanish and Catalan five-year bond yields has been hovering near its widest point in two years.\nSpain’s banks, including some based in Barcelona, have warned that secession could cause financial turmoil, while the Bank of Spain has said Catalonia could risk exiting the euro.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:23:49.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
