They told us that the system was too complicated.\" \nNovartis finally established the price at around $4,500 per year, he said. \nThe CEO, a former executive at Reddiwip-maker ConAgra Foods who joined Novartis in 2007, also said the company expects its generics business Sandoz \"will always be large enough to be competitive worldwide\" without joining a consolidation trend that's seen companies including Allergan unload businesses. \nIsrael's Teva agreed to buy Allergan's generics unit in July for more than $40 billion. \n\"There is no project on our side to participate in this consolidation trend because we cannot ensure this growth,\" Jimenez said. \nNovartis, which owns more than 30 percent of pharmaceuticals rival Roche, has trade agreements with Roche on two drugs and Jimenez said he can imagine research and development collaborations, as well. \n\"But the opportunity hasn't presented itself yet,\" he said. \nA Novartis spokesman did not return a phone call Saturday seeking comment.
