Navigating Cancer, the leading patient care and engagement solution for cancer programs, is pleased to announce the release of the company's care management technology, Navigating Care Connect™ (patent pending). \"We built Navigating Care Connect™ to give cancer care providers a user-friendly software solution to readily identify, and proactively care for, patients who show a higher risk of complications,\" said Michael Graff , Navigating Cancer's VP of Product and Operations and Co-Founder. \"The purpose is to enable faster patient interventions through a new model of enhanced care.\"  \nNavigating Care Connect TM helps patients adhere to their cancer treatment regimens and offers them a simple-to-use way to report their symptoms and side effects in real time. For providers, it facilitates same-day alerts based on patient-reported data, indicating when a patient should be watched more carefully or contacted immediately. \nNavigating Care Connect TM will support practices in implementing a variety of new payment models, such as CMMI's upcoming Oncology Care Model. It currently supports Chronic Care Management, with features ranging from the automated identification of eligible patients all the way through to customized time tracking and CPT Code 99490 billing reports.\n\"We have seen many payer pilot programs in oncology over the past few years consistently demonstrate that care management reduces costs and improves care,\" said Gena Cook , Navigating Cancer's CEO. \"For cancer programs to be able to provide care management at scale, the right technology will be key. We designed this care management solution to meet new payment reform models while at the same time enabling patients to participate and feel more cared for.\"\nNavigating Care Connect ™ can function as a standalone application or as an add-on module to other Navigating Cancer products.
