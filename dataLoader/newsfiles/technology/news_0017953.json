Most mPOS terminals only support a limited number of operating systems (OS) and tablet and smartphone form factors, requiring retailers to purchase new technology whenever they upgrade their mobile devices. \nThe Verifone e355 mPOS terminal is agnostic to smartphone and tablet form factors and supports all major OS options, including Android, iOS and Windows—enabling retailers to make long-term investments in mPOS, at a much lower cost of ownership. \nMulti-lane retailers have substantially invested in Windows-based back-end systems to support critical workflows across their entire enterprise. \nThe latest device continues the advancement of payments, which Tinsley described as a multi-decade journey that started with self-checkout 15 years ago, then payments through a mobile device about five years ago. Intel reports that mPOS transactions grew by 300 percent between 2013 and 2014. \nThe pocketable device is designed to work in those locations where the existing mPOS devices aren’t meeting the merchants’ needs, according to Tinsley. “Different use cases require different types of devices.” \nThose use cases will continue to evolve, so Tinsley says payment hardware will continue to evolve as well.
