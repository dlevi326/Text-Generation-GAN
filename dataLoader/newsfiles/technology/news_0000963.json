The team has spent several years in Shenzhen working this out. \nRePhone offers eight add-on modules. A GSM module is at the heart of this phone, featuring a very small computer on a chip. You give the phone life by adding GPS, audio, touchscreen, motion sensors, camera, and other modules. You plug the modules together using flexible NFC strips. \n( Softpedia 's Alexandra Arici said these modules can be connected together \"using all sorts of solutions ranging from FPC ribbon cable to soldered wires and conductive thread, or just be breadboarded.\") \nOnce connected you can send text and make calls and program your own logic. The word \"phone\" seems limiting to what the team is up to. This is fundamentally a communication device that can do phone things. Use the device, they said, to call your dog back home, to control robots remotely, or talk to doors. \nThey list some of the things one can do with the RePhone on the Kickstarter page: \"Talk to your grandpa by assembling a walking cane phone. Talk to your dog with a RePhone, GPS, record module and dog collar. Talk to the sky with a RePhone, gyros and a kite. Talk to your body with a RePhone shirt. Talk to your light with a RePhone lamp. Talk to your dress with the RePhone and Xadow Duino module with WS2812b.\" \nYou would not be the only to think about Project Ara. Softpedia 's Arici said, \"while we are still waiting on Google to release its modular smartphone platform to the masses, we might take a moment to consider the RePhone by Speeed .\" \nJohn Biggs in TechCrunch checked out RePhone and said \"it seemed to work fairly well. It includes programming libraries in Arduino IDE, Lua and Javascript that allow you to connect the phone to the web and even IFTTT.\" \nBiggs wrote, \"It's a fun little project and it works pretty well. While you won't gain the experience of mining your own gold for wire traces and learning chip fabrication, this will let you make a phone quickly and easily which is great for all of us hobbyists without ready access to mineral rights.\" \nRePhone Kit prices range widely, anywhere from $12 to over $400.
