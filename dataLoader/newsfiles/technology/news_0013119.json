Cadence was presented with awards for both joint development of the 10nm FinFET design infrastructure and analog/mixed-signal IP. The award for joint development of the 10nm design infrastructure was given based on the early, in-depth collaboration between TSMC and Cadence on FinFET enablement and the development of this latest advanced-node technology for next-generation system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Cadence provides combined digital, signoff and custom/analog tool flows that are integrated on a common OpenAccess database, incorporating integrated signoff engines that have been validated by TSMC on high-performance reference designs. Cadence® tools certified for TSMC's 10nm process include Innovus™ Implementation System, Quantus™ QRC Extraction Solution, Tempus™ Timing Signoff Solution, Voltus™ IC Power Integrity Solution, Voltus-Fi Custom Power Integrity Solution, Virtuoso® custom IC advanced-node platform, Physical Verification System, Litho Electrical Analyzer and the entire Spectre® simulation platform.
