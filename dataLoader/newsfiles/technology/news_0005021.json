The Talon is also the world's first smart ring for gaming. Now, game enthusiasts can get this ring which is due for mass production by pre-ordering on this page ( http://igg.me/at/talon-ring ) on Indiegogo.com. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150916/267131 \nA touch screen killer \nGone will be the days when mobile gamers will have to cramp their mobile screen and controller into one. Utilizing a real time 3 Dimensional space, the Talon simply outperforms the on-screen 2 Dimensional controller and allows users to use quick and easy waves and gestures to control the application. \n\"Traditionally, about 30% of gaming screen will be blocked by the user's hand or fingers.\" Titanium Falcon's Co-founder and CEO Juan Guo, a former game developer who previously worked at Gameloft on mobile series like Asphalt, Dungeon Hunter and Might & Magic, says \"but not anymore.\" \nTraditional motion control vs current motion control \nTalon's strong point is its incredibly subtle hardware all stored in a tiny waterproof and durable frame. At the heart of all the electronics is the Microcontroller or the CPU of the device. Another key micro electronic component is the motion sensor which detects rotational and lateral motion, also referred to as 9 Degrees of Freedom. This sensor differentiates the Talon from other Motion control hardware. \nThe most common means of motion control has been motion capture (popular examples being Xbox Kinect) and it problems such as accuracy and predefined set space are unavoidable. The Talon however uses motion sensing technology and hence can take place on the go wherever you are and whatever you are doing. \nBetter than other mobile gaming controllers \nTalon also beats the conventional mobile gaming controller by reducing its size by over 90 percent making its completely portable and freeing both your hands while maintaining the same battery life even after the addition of new features like motion control (a feature that does not exist in current mobile controllers) \nDesign \nNot only in terms of affordability but also in terms of styling and ergonomic design, the team had spent numerous hours determining the best shape and combination of materials that go into this smart device. The inner portion of the ring is laced with soft skin-feel silicone gels that make it a snug fit for any user. There will also be 4 variation in sizes (Small, Medium, Large and XL) and they can accommodate finger ring sizes from 5 up to 14 according to the US ring size standards. The Silicone gels will ensure a comfortable fit for each of the ring sizes. \nWhat are your thoughts about the Talon? Do you want one as well?
