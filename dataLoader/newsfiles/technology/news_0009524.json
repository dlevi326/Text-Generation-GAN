Once they connect their Bluetooth keyboard, they can work on those fancy emails without craning their neck. Kiss those chiropractor visits goodbye. However, before iPhone users can enjoy this product, bkeeni needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $30,000 by October 12, 2015. The funds raised will go towards production and manufacturing.\nTo help bring this awesome, revealing case to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered between December 2015 and January 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help bkeeni reach their goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks using the hastag: #bkeeni. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: Katie Casey\nTitle: Co-founder and Creative Developer\nPhone: 602-903-0702\nemail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
