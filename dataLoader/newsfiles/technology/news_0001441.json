These products extend Teledyne LeCroy's Optical Modulation Analysis (OMA) portfolio, enabling the creation of flexible, modular systems with unparalleled performance and ease of use. When combined with Teledyne LeCroy's LabMaster 10Zi-A oscilloscopes and integrated Optical-LinQ analysis software, the IQS receivers test DP-QPSK and DP-16QAM optical signals at speeds up to 130 GBaud. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150925/271006 \nThe result of several years of collaboration with the optical specialists at Coherent Solutions, the 70-GHz Teledyne LeCroy IQS70 Coherent Optical Receiver pairs with the LabMaster 10-65Zi-A oscilloscope to provide a system bandwidth of 65 GHz, delivering an ideal solution for characterizing leading-edge 56-Gbaud communications systems and enabling detection up to 130 GBaud. For lower-rate applications, the 42-GHz IQS42 Coherent Optical Receiver provides the ultimate test platform for up to 32-Gbaud DP-16QAM or DP-QPSK when used with the 36-GHz LabMaster 10-36Zi-A. \nCompleting the world's most comprehensive OMA solution, Optical-LinQ is an intuitive and fully integrated software package for measurement and visualization of optically modulated signals. It runs entirely within the user interface of the LabMaster 10Zi-A. No other OMA on the market offers such integrated control of both oscilloscope and coherent receiver. Optical-LinQ provides fully automated control of the IQS receiver, phase recovery algorithms, and polarization demultiplexing, as well as an exhaustive number of modulation analysis displays and parameters. \nIn addition to a market-leading system bandwidth of 70 GHz, these Optical Modulation Analysis systems provide a dynamic calibration capability to enable the LabMaster 10 Zi-A real-time oscilloscope to be disconnected from the IQS Coherent Optical Receiver and used for other electrical validation and testing without requiring a factory re-calibration. This enables dual use of the oscilloscope for serial-data eye diagrams and jitter, noise and crosstalk analysis on NRZ electrical tributaries using Teledyne LeCroy's SDAIII-CompleteLinQ software package. \n\"Consistent bandwidth leadership means Teledyne LeCroy oscilloscopes have become crucial tools for those pushing the boundaries of optical communications technology,\" said Patrick Connally, Product Manager for high-performance oscilloscopes at Teledyne LeCroy. \"Our new IQS receivers complete the most comprehensive and highest-performance Optical Modulation Analysis solution on the market, enabling us to continue providing the most capable toolset for innovators in telecommunications.\" \nTeledyne LeCroy will demonstrate an OMA System consisting of an IQS70 receiver and a LabMaster 10-65Zi-A oscilloscope system in its booth 458 at the ECOC Exhibition in Valencia, Spain. \nAbout Teledyne LeCroy \nTeledyne LeCroy is a leading manufacturer of advanced test instruments that measure, analyze, and verify complex electronic signals.
