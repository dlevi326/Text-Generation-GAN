Over the course of a two-phased implementation, Guardian began using the TMS to manage inbound freight into their network of more than 30 distribution centers along with outbound customer deliveries leveraging their private fleet. “As a company, it was very important for Guardian to achieve speed to value. We have been able to accomplish this with Cloud Logistics,” said Tom Schaumburg, VP of Operations and Supply Chain for Guardian Building Products. “In my career, I have been lucky enough to have been part of many teams that have taken TMS solutions live. This one is by far the fastest. The interfaces were reasonably simple and the system is very intuitive – so our associates in the corporate office who run 3rd party inbound, and our team in the field who dispatch our owned fleet outbound, took to the system quickly and we have been able to validate our savings case. Cloud Logistics has helped us achieve our most important goal – speed to value.”\nMerely two months after completion of the first phase, Guardian began using the Cloud Logistics solution for managing outbound deliveries to their customers. The system optimizes their dynamic customer routes multiple times a day, assuring the best combination of customer service and private fleet utilization. At the same time, drivers have begun using the Cloud Logistics mobile solution to accept routes and capture proof-of-delivery signatures as well.\nOver the course of the next few weeks, Guardian will be rolling out the solution across their nationwide network of distribution centers and drivers to maximize their return on investment.\nMark Nix, CEO of Cloud Logistics added, “Cloud Logistics is fortunate to be partnering with Guardian Building Products to help reduce their freight costs while improving visibility and customer service. To be able to achieve this kind of success in only four months is a real testament to the teams and the solution.\"\nCloud Logistics will be demonstrating their solution at the annual Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP) September 27-30, 2015 in San Diego, California.\nAbout Cloud Logistics\nCloud Logistics provides the newest generation of transportation logistics solutions for the global supply chain market.
