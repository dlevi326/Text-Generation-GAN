The fee for ETV will completely be on reciprocal basis.\n\"We are planning to make the visa fee in four slabs. USD 20, USD 48, USD 60 and no visa fee will be levied from some countries. We have sent the proposal to the External Affairs Ministry for final approval,\" a Home Ministry official said.\nThe ETV fees were rationalised following the request of those friendly countries.\nUnder the ETV scheme, an applicant receives an email authorising him or her to travel to India after it is approved and he or she can travel with a print-out of this authorisation.\nOn arrival, the visitor has to present the authorisation to the immigration authorities who would then stamp the entry into the country.\nIndia currently offers ETV facility to citizens of 113 countries and it plans to raise it to 150 countries by March 31, 2016. Tourists can arrive in 16 designated airports across the country.\nAccording to an official estimate, a total of 1,69,976 tourists arrived on E-Tourist Visa during January-August this year as compared to 17,120 during the corresponding period in 2014, showing a growth of 892.9 per cent.\nMaximum tourists from the US (25.93 per cent) availed the e-visa facility followed by Germany (10 per cent), UAE (8.92 per cent), France (8.76 per cent), Australia (7.20 per cent) and Canada (6.39 per cent) among the top 10 source countries.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:37:43.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
