Designed to improve productivity and quality, ColorCert is a modular job-based color workflow solution for creating color specifications and measuring performance against those specifications using a simple scoring method. It provides real-time statistical process control for defining, monitoring, and communicating color quality - across the plant or around the globe. User Feedback\n“ColorCert gives us visibility into problems we were not aware we had, including with our ICC profiles, ink formulation and proofs,” said Vincent Whatley, X-Rite Coordinator and responsible for the implementation of the project at UK-based Ultimate Packaging, who includes Asda, a Wal-Mart company, in its customer base. “With the data we gather using ColorCert, we have learned a great deal about repeatability, as well as hitting the scores and ICC targets through matching conditions of fingerprinting. It has also helped us work out how variables such as heat, viscosity and temperature were affecting our outcomes.” Since implementing ColorCert, Ultimate Packaging has seen a 200% improvement in its ColorCert scores.\nColorCert 2.6: The Details\n“ColorCert 2.6 includes a range of new features that give printers and packaging converters more flexibility,” said Christopher Winczewski, Vice President of Product Marketing for X-Rite. “It now incorporates a simple wizard-driven job setup that minimizes job creation time and allows operators to make last-minute changes at any point in the print process based on standard templates within the ColorCert Pressroom. Users get the benefit of a faster process without sacrificing the end-to-end color quality they depend on with ColorCert.”\nTo help printers optimize job set-up even further, ColorCert 2.6 has now provides two ways for users to populate job information; an interface to MIS systems or using PDF fields from supplied artwork. Either option supports a more efficient print operation, speeding jobs through production with less opportunity for error.\nColorCert 2.6 also now lets users define multiple combinations of settings within a job. For example, operators can use different substrate and tolerance settings for make-ready versus the controlled settings for \"sellable\" production. This gives them the flexibility to optimize all variables linked to print production for greater efficiency.\nSupport for X-Rite eXact\nColorCert 2.6 extends Mac support to include the scanning option for the X-Rite eXact™ spectrophotometer, a next generation handheld color measurement solution. All stakeholders in the supply chain can now rely on X-Rite eXact as the common instrument of choice for measuring color in any mode across the entire workflow, including design and premedia where Mac is the de facto standard. Leveraging ColorCert with X-Rite eXact spectrophotometer provides customers with a power statistical process control solution that improves productivity and consistency in measurements throughout the complete color workflow.\nWinczewski continued, “At X-Rite Pantone, we are committed to meeting the color management needs of our customers around the world. These ColorCert enhancements reflect that commitment, and give customers the most flexible yet powerful statistical process control solution in the market.” Its improved user interface and ease of use make ColorCert 2.6 attractive to printers and packaging converters of all sizes who wish to ensure the ultimate in production quality and efficiency.”\nImmediately Available\nVersion 2.6 of ColorCert: X-Rite Edition is immediately available and is provided to all existing customer as part of their subscription agreement.\nFor more information about X-Rite solutions for print and packaging, please visit http://www.xrite.com/colorcert .\nAbout X-Rite\nFounded in 1958, X-Rite, Incorporated is a global leader in color science and technology.
