LIVE by AOL brings together AOL's world-class video expertise with Verizon Digital Media Services to give content and media partners access to a complete suite of live experience solutions for all screens and devices. \nLIVE by AOL provides content and media partners with unprecedented distribution through the company's owned and operated properties, including AOL.com, The Huffington Post, TechCrunch and more, in addition to a holistic and open network of over 1,700 publisher partners for live distribution across mobile, digital, over-the-top, and linear TV. In addition to LIVE’s expansive reach, the solution also provides complete production capabilities, full content-preparation supported by cross-device, cloud-based encoding that is combined with Verizon Digital Media Services’ high-performance stream delivery, and options to monetize through various advertising, sponsorship, and native integration options. \n“As the video landscape continues to evolve, live programming is the next frontier for innovation,” said Jimmy Maymann, Executive Vice President and President, AOL Content & Consumer Brands. “LIVE by AOL not only unites the pillars of our business, but enables all of our content and media partners to tap into the power of live programming and bring that success to their own properties. As the lines between traditional television and online video blur, producing, distributing, and monetizing live content in the digital realm will be a deciding factor for those who successfully step into the next era of video.” \nAOL has a proven track record for creating, producing, distributing and monetizing live programming, including delivering 9 to 12 hours of live programming every day across its properties. AOL Build, a live interview series where fans sit inches away from some of the biggest names in entertainment, fashion and business, has already hosted more than 300 episodes in 2015, with HuffPost Live raking in more than 2.4 billion video views since launching in 2012. \nThe roll-out of LIVE by AOL comes on the heels of the company’s most recent deal as exclusive live stream distribution partners with LiveXLive for the international music festival Rock In Rio, as well as live streaming the entire week of TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco. \nAbout AOL \nAOL is a media technology company with a mission to simplify the internet for consumers and creators by unleashing the world's best builders of culture and code. As one of the largest online properties with over 499 million monthly global consumers of its premium brands, AOL is at the center of disruption of how content is being produced, distributed, consumed and monetized by connecting publishers with advertisers on its global, programmatic content and advertising platforms. AOL's opportunity lies in shaping the future of the digitally connected world for decades to come. AOL is a subsidiary of Verizon.
