The app was designed to enhance accessibility for visually impaired and mute users of smart phones to enable easy and free communication.\nThe app’s primary function is to turn text into speech and provides a simple yet effective user interface to achieve this. Users can simply open the app, type the text they’d like to be spoken, choose from 5 of NeoSpeech’s high quality synthesized voices and click a button to produce speech. Since utility and ease of use is one of the most important things about an app designed to help people with communication related disabilities, NeoSpeech prioritized creating an intuitive user interface that can be easily accessed multiple times a day.\nUsers can also save their developed text and audio files for later, making the app perfect for everyday use. A user can create a file to introduce themselves and save this file. Later, when they meet someone new, they can simply click on their introduction file and the app will automatically transform the text into speech. Multiple text and audio files can be saved to make communication quick and simple in many common situations.\nFor mute users, the app helps remove the restrictions of relying on American Sign Language (ASL) to communicate. This allows mute users to communicate with countless more people than if they relied on ASL, and they can simply type the text they would like read out loud and press a button. For visually impaired users, the app can be used to read aloud any text you’d like, which can be useful for clarifying what an article says or simply listening to a message as opposed to having to read it.\nThe app comes with 5 high quality synthesized voice options from NeoSpeech. These include 3 female voice options (Kate, Ashley and Julie) and 2 male voice options (Paul and James) in US English.\n“As one of the world’s leading text-to-speech providers, we are proud to provide free access to text-to-speech software for people who need this technology to communicate” says Devin Lee, the interim CEO of NeoSpeech.\nDownload the Spokesperson App here .\nAbout NeoSpeech\nNeoSpeech Inc. specializes in high quality text-to-speech solutions for a range of embedded, mobile, desktop and server applications.
