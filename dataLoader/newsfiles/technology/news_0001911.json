It was created as part of a compromise brokered by Gov. John Kasich (KAY'-sik) amid efforts to repeal the targets outright. \nThe study panel's majority believes legal uncertainty surrounding proposed federal clean coal rules makes proceeding with the mandates imprudent. Proponents say the targets were creating jobs and benefiting the environment. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:45:34.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
