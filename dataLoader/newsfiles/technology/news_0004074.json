It comes out to be a harassment,\" a consumer commented on the proposal. \n\nMany others complaint about absence of mobile towers around their villages. There are hundreds of comments from people seeking compensation for failure in mobile internet connection as well along with call drops. \n\nTelecom operators, industry body Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) and Association of Unified Telcom Service Providers of India (AUSPI) have opposed the proposal to compensate consumers. \n\n\"We do not agree that calling consumers should not be charged for a call that got dropped within five second or any time later. The subscriber should be charged for the duration of the call session,\" AUSPI Secretary General Ashok Sud said. \n\nAUSPI represents mainly CDMA players like Tata Teleservices, Reliance Communications and Sistema Shyam Teleservices. \n\nCOAI, which represents pure play GSM mobile companies like Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular, Reliance Jio Infocomm, Uninor etc, said, \"We are of the view that consumer compensation will not resolve problem of the call drops, since the key factors resulting in the call drops such as non-availability of sites and spectrum constraints will still remain.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:20:03.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
