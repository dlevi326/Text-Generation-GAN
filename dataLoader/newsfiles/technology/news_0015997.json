Well, why waste your time sorting them out yourself (and getting your hands covered in candy in the process) when there’s a robot that can do it for you! It’s a 3D-printed device, powered by a micro controller that detects individual colors of Skittles and puts them in different bowls for you. Peterson used an Arduino Uno board and a Zitrades color sensor to detect the shades of the Skittles so they could be sorted into their respective dishes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T15:50:47.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
