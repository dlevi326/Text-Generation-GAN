They “heard” about you and your services from their friends, relatives and acquaintances. They “saw” your office driving by. They “called” you on your office phone to find out more about you. They “traveled” to your office to meet you “face to face” to get started with your service. \nWhat do they do now? They “Google” you. They “look you up” on \"LinkedIn.\" They “see” you on “Facebook” They “learn” about you from social media, the Web and your “social network.” \nThe list can go on. \nThe words associated with accounting technology have been changing and your clients’ lingo has been changing. \nSo what words would you, as an accountant, want to start using to survive the onslaught of expectations of your new generation of clients?
