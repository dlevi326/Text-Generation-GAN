This can help doctors determine a malaria infection more rapidly, especially when high-quality microscopy services are not available.\nORA Diagnositcs Inc. designed an innovative device SnapSure(Patents Pending) which integrate blood collection and buffer delivering into one tube, and which is much more efficient than traditional buffer vial and pipette platform. The SnapSure can collect 5ul blood sample automatically with a simple dip. The sealed buffer in the tube will flow out by gravity after snapping along the loop on the tube. What is important, the whole platform is very competitive, SnapSure will be an affordable test that fights malaria in Africa.\nORA Diagnostics Inc provides three formats of malaria antigen tests: Pf, Pf/Pv and Pf/Pan, and will develop HIV, Dengue rapid tests based on SnapSure platforms soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T07:11:30.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
