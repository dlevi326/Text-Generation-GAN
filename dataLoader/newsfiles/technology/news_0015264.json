Xone combines two powerful technologies--BluetoothÂ® beacons and our award-winning Location Management Platform--with our growing Xone App Network to create real-time, mobile moments through which businesses can serve their customers better.\" \nXone's core feature, Xone Tips, enables businesses to serve mobile content screens to customers who are within range of an in-store Xone Beacon. Xone Tips are fully customizable and can be used by retailers, restaurants, hotels, financial institutions, and other brands with physical locations to provide useful content to customers including WiFi codes, new product information, sales promotions, and incentives to download a brand app or join a brand's social media audiences. \n\"The real-time mobile engagement opportunity presented by Xone is unprecedented and should prove very exciting to businesses of all sizes,\" said Yext CMO, Jeffrey K. Rohrs. \"What better indication of brand interest and potential future loyalty is there than a customer visiting your store, restaurant or other place of business? Xone now gives brands an opportunity to not only engage those customers in the moments that matter, but also help build audiences for their own apps, owned content, and social media communications.\" \nFor a limited time, Yext is offering a free Xone Beacon and Xone Tips to all businesses with a physical address in the United States.
