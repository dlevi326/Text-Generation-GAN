This past weekend, Naraha became the first of seven towns that had been entirely evacuated to reopen since the March 11, 2011, disaster, when a tsunami slammed into the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, causing meltdowns and a massive radiation leak. The town's viability is far from certain, and its fate will be watched closely by authorities and neighboring towns to see if recovery is indeed possible in this radiation-contaminated land.
