Justin McManus by Saul Harben The rise of the digital disrupters is changing the face of the global economy. It's also giving rise to new legal claims, particularly in the context of employment law. Traditional methods of engaging workers are unable to keep up with the flexibility being demanded by both worker and employer.\nThe ride-sharing phenomenon Uber is a case in point. Uber's business model is based on having a network of independent \"taxi\" drivers: anyone who owns or has access to a car and meets Uber's safety requirements can become an Uber driver, offering their services to consumers, wherever and whenever. It's taking on the highly regulated taxi industry by offering consumers a lower-cost, independent choice.\nIn a case that is being closely watched around the world, a class action has been mounted in the District Court of California on behalf of 160,000 or so Uber drivers. One of the central issues is whether, in the eyes of the law, Uber drivers are employees or independent contractors. The Uber drivers say it's the former and the District Court, on a preliminary basis, agrees. In a decision handed down on September 1, the Court allowed the case to proceed as a class action on the basis that Uber has to prove that an employment relationship does not exist between itself and the drivers.\nThe distinction is an important one. If Uber drivers are considered, legally, to be employees, Uber has an obligation as their employer to provide them with minimum employment entitlements. Further, Uber would be responsible for meeting all their operating expenses such as driver's licence fees, petrol and car servicing costs, and insurance.\nThis case may provide guidance on the engagement process for other sharing economy companies –where companies, usually via an electronic platform such as an App, link consumers with providers of goods and services. Think Airbnb, Lyft, TaskRabbit.\nUber is also actively defending the litigation via a high-profile media campaign, with the support of a group of Uber drivers who are advocating and championing the benefits of the Uber business model as giving them autonomy and flexibility in how they perform their work.\nEmployee or independent contractor At home, it is unclear which category Uber drivers legally sit in. The Productivity Commission's Draft Report on Australia's Workplace Relations Framework released earlier this month considered the current test for determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor.\n There is no statutory definition of an independent contractor. The courts have developed a complex \"multi-factor\" test for determining a worker's legal status, including the way work is performed, how it is paid for, whether the worker is free to work for anyone, the provision of tools of trade and the worker's reporting obligations.\nBeing engaged as an independent contractor often provides mutual benefits to the company and the worker. This is largely because it affords the parties greater autonomy in terms of how they regulate working conditions. Orthodox forms of employment contracts don't usually offer the same level of autonomy or flexibility.\nOne of the hot trends in employee engagement is offering employees flexibility in how and where they perform their work. However, the lack of an employment relationship when work is being performed by one person for another can lead to problems. What it usually means is that the worker does not have the benefit of the protection of minimum conditions of employment contained within the National Employment Standards and Awards. This becomes a bigger problem when there is a mismatch in the bargaining power between the parties, and the worker ends up being engaged as an independent contractor to enable the employer/principal to avoid providing the worker with the minimum conditions of employment.\nThe Fair Work Act 2009 contains sham contracting provisions which are intended to stop genuine employees being engaged (either by consent, coercion or misrepresentation) as independent contractors. However, the lack of a statutory definition of independent contractor, coupled with the vagaries of how to apply the multi-factor test, means the application of the sham contracting laws is a difficulty and legalistic exercise.\nAs proposed by the Productivity Commission, it may well be time for a clear statutory definition of independent contractor to be established – or for the courts to develop a new common law definition. Ultimately it will benefit both companies and workers to know where their relationship stands and how to keep it on the right track. For Uber and similar companies, the outcome will either give a green light to drive – or put a brake on – how they conduct their business.\nSaul Harben is a partner at Clayton Utz, where he leads the national Workplace Relations and Safety practice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:28:02.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
