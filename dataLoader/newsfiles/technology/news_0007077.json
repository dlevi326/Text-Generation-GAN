A second round of replies are due by Nov. 12. \nCritics have criticized the shot clock, arguing the commission has frequently delayed it in the past and gone far over deadline. Some recent stalls on previous mergers dealt with legal action over the scope and handling of confidential information. \nThe commission earlier this month received the necessary votes to finalize the protective order and allow the shot clock to start. But it was finalized and released Friday. \nRepublicans on the commission have warned that the commission's proceedings expose too much sensitive business information during merger deals, possibly chilling production and other business decisions. \nThe proposed merger, in which Charter would acquire Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, was announced in late May. That followed the failed merger of Comcast and Time Warner after regulators raised reservations about the deal's impact on the online video market. \nThe merger must be approved by the FCC and the Justice Department. \nCharter has already agreed to abide by a number of self-imposed conditions of the merger, which has won over skeptics of the previous Comcast deal. The multibillion dollar deal, if approved, would create the third-largest satellite or cable company in the country and the second-largest Internet provider.
