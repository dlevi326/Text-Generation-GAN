This report analyses the optical industry supply chain from optical component vendors to service providers and internet companies, reflecting the latest financial and industry news. \nLightCounting's analyst team found that the optical transceiver market grew 6% in 2Q15, despite a significant decline in telecom operator capex, and low single digit growth in the revenues of datacom and telecom equipment companies. And despite the soft guidance given by some optical component companies for the rest of the year, LightCounting expects the industry will set a new record of more than $4 billion in sales. \n\"Public company financials are only part of the story,\" said LightCounting CEO and Founder Vladimir Kozlov. \"Private companies make up a growing percentage of the optical components industry and some of them have seen very high growth in the first half of 2015.\" \nThe latest data and analysis identifies optical interconnects, FTTx modules, and 100Gbps devices as the fastest growing segments in the market today. Ethernet and DWDM remain the largest segments in terms of revenue. \nThe most recent Quarterly Market Update report includes: Analysis of trends in capital expenditures of major global carriers and Web 2.0 companies Review of quarterly sales of optical components and modules based on confidential sales information provided by more than 20 leading manufacturers, and interviews with their customers and suppliers.
