ADCCA looks forward to guidance from the government as to how the situation can be resolved,\" he said. \n\nSeven percent of the world's $5 billion worth of bitcoin is in circulation in Australia, according to ADCCA estimates. \n\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia declined to comment while National Australia Bank and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group did not immediately respond. \n\nAn Australian government inquiry last month said that while digital currencies should be more tightly regulated, they also should be treated as money and taxes should be simplified for people who trade with them. \n\nWestpac in June invested an undisclosed amount in US bitcoin start-up Coinbase, in the first such deal by an Australian bank in the largely unregulated virtual currency.
