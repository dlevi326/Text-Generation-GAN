Each customer affected will receive $100.\nAbout $432,000 more will go to about 200 law enforcement officers, judges and domestic abuse victims who said they faced safety concerns because of the leak, which occurred from 2010 to 2012.\nCalifornia's Attorney General Kamala Harris called the leak a \"troubling breach of privacy.\"\n\"Violations of consumers' privacy will result in significant penalties,\" she said Thursday in a statement announcing the settlement.\nPhiladelphia-based Comcast Corp. apologized and applauded the settlement.\nThe breach occurred when a system upgrade failed to mark listings data of customers who paid as much as $1.50 a month to keep their information private on top of what they paid Comcast for Internet-based phone service.\nThe data was published online and in phone books after it was sold through a listings data licensing company. In 2013, Comcast refunded about $2.5 million to customers, covering the period their information was inadvertently made public.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:12:46.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
