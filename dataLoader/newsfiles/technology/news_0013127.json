Health measurements are taken at home and data goes to a nurse for review. The result has been fewer hospital readmissions and a substantial cost savings.\nHome to Stay debuted in July 2013 through OPRS’s subsidiary Senior Independence and is offered at no cost to patients of the Northwest Ohio Accountable Care Organization.\nA registered nurse or licensed practical nurse visits a patient within 72 hours after being discharged from the hospital, with a follow-up visit within seven to 10 days. The nurses review patients’ medications, take vital signs, establish health records and confirm appointments and more.\nIn the program’s first year, participating patients showed a 3.4 percent hospital re-admission (return) rate, compared to a regional average of 14.5 percent re-admission. These results represent a substantial financial savings as well as better health management for patients.\nOPRS is proud to have Verizon as an enthusiastic supporter of Home to Stay. The program includes telehealth which provides patients with glucose monitoring, pulse checking and other health measurements. The monitoring equipment sends data via a computer tablet to a nurse at Senior Independence for review.\nWendy Price Kiser, Toledo’s Senior Independence executive director, talked about the funding from Verizon. “This gives us an opportunity to partner with other key stakeholders toward innovation that supports the use of technology for the senior population. Our seniors are a traditionally underserved demographic when it comes understanding and implementing new technology. Thanks to Verizon, that is about to change,” she said.\nAbout Verizon Foundation:\nThe Verizon Foundation is focused on accelerating social change by using the company’s innovative technology to help solve pressing problems in education and healthcare.
