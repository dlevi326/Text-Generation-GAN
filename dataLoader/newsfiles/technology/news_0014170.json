I'm sorry about that. I take responsibility, and I'm trying to be as transparent as I possibly can.\" \nThe Democratic presidential candidate declined to apologize for using a private email system when asked directly by NBC News on Friday, saying she was \"sorry that this has been confusing to people.\" In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, she said an apology wasn't necessary because what she did was \"allowed\" by the State Department. \nClinton's support in the early Democratic contests has declined against a rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, as she has sought to address questions about her use of a private email server while serving as President Barack Obama's secretary of state. She turned over about 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department that she sent and received using a home-brew server set up at her New York home. \nIn her interview with AP, Clinton said it would have been a \"better choice\" for her to use separate email accounts for her personal and public business during her time at the State Department. She also said the issue has not damaged her campaign but has been a \"distraction, certainly.\" \n\"But it hasn't in any way affected the plan for our campaign, the efforts we're making to organize here in Iowa and elsewhere in the country,\" Clinton told AP. \"And I still feel very confident about the organization and the message that my campaign is putting out.\" \n___ \nFollow Ken Thomas on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KThomasDC Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
