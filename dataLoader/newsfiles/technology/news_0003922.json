HELIER, Jersey--( BUSINESS WIRE )--O3b Networks today announced the company has completed one full year of operation in providing trunking services to Digicel Samoa through the ground-breaking O3b Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite network. \nDigicel has been using the O3b high throughput, low latency connectivity to fuel the growth of 3G data users (Digicel Internet Service), as well as Digicel Business services (including cloud and enterprise services) for small to medium businesses, enterprises and government customers. Digicel is the leading communications operator in Samoa, and is continually striving to improve affordability and offer its customers the best technologies and services available. Digicel’s O3b connection supports data-heavy and latency-sensitive applications, which no other satellite network can support. \nDigicel implemented the O3b Trunk services a year ago, with a significant data capacity to provide affordable broadband internet and 3G mobile services to their subscriber base. However, once affordable higher speed services and Digicel’s subsidized smartphones became available, the operator quickly realized its customers had a rapidly expanding appetite for even more broadband service. Digicel ramped up its contracted capacity by more than 70% just four months after the service went live. \nThe use of O3b satellites, which are closer to the earth than conventional geostationary (GEO) satellites, reduces latency, increases internet speed and improves voice and video quality for the user. O3b’s next generation IP trunking solution boosts existing link capacities to substantially improve affordability and latency compared with traditional satellite systems. O3b Trunk services also provide the basis of a resilient, high performance system that is ideal for use in disaster recovery – something that is becoming increasingly important in island states such as Samoa. \n“Digicel provides faster downloads, higher productivity and the best value in Samoa,” said Rory Condon, CEO of Digicel Samoa. “We are able to provide these vital benefits to our customers because of our low latency services—and that is one of the primary features of O3b.” \n“O3b is extremely gratified to see the kind of growth experienced by Digicel in Samoa,” said Imran Malik, VP, Asia Pacific and Middle East for O3b. “The Samoan user base has proven that access to high quality, affordable international connectivity increases data usage exponentially—customers find new possibilities, doing things that used to be impossible.” \nAbout O3b Networks Limited \nO3b Networks Limited is a global satellite service provider operating a next-generation satellite network for telecommunications operators, Internet service providers, enterprise and government customers in emerging markets. The O3b system combines the global reach of satellite with the speed of a fiber‐optic network providing billions of consumers and businesses in nearly 180 countries with low‐cost, high‐speed, low latency Internet and mobile connectivity. O3b Networks' investors include SES, Google, Liberty Global, HSBC Principal Investments, Northbridge Venture Partners, Allen & Company, Development Bank of Southern Africa, Sofina, Satya Capital and Luxempart.
