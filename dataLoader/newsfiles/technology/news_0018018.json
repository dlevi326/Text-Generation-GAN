The company has since added more than 2,000 channels available through its platform, but older models provide access to only 1,200 of those.\nRoku had the No. 1 selling streaming devices last year in the U.S., with 34% share of units sold, according to Parks Associates estimates. As of Q1 2015, among American broadband households that owned a streaming device, 37% had a Roku, followed by Google Chromecast at 19%, Apple TV at 17% and Amazon Fire TV devices at 14%, per Parks' research.\nThe company, in explaining why it was dropping support for its older models, said that streaming technology has evolved \"and so have our Roku streaming players.\"\n\"Over time, our channel partners have also chosen to focus their development efforts on the latest generation of Roku streaming players,\" it said. The older devices also lack the performance of current-generation streaming players and thus have a more limited channel selection, Roku said.\nRoku is offering customers with older models a limited-time 20% discount off retail prices for current Roku 1, 2 or 3 models, which are listed at $49.99, $55.99 and $79.99, respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:10:56.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
