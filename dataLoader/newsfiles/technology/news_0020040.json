Treestle, a Dutch software house, has addressed this problem and has come up with a solution, LiquiD AutoScaler. LiquiD AutoScaler provides autoscaling based on the page load which is actually how a web user experiences a website. It offers clients webserver cost reductions while ensuring a consistent website experience and improving uptime. LiquiD AutoScaler is now available on multiple clouds including Amazon Web Services, Rackspace, and Interoute VDC.\nAutoscaling ensures an optimal deployment at all times and allows some servers be removed during low traffic times, resulting in cost savings. This feature is however not available to many companies as only the big cloud infrastructure-as-a-service providers – such as Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure – offer it to their clients.\nFurther, most current autoscaling solutions scale servers based on server statistics, such as processor consumption (CPU) or memory usage (RAM). Setting up good scaling policies based on these server statistics can be difficult since the relationship between these statistics and actual website performance is dependent on multiple non-linear variables, such as server type, type of application, and server’s network consumption.\nLiquiD AutoScaler from Treestle solves these problems regarding availability and reliability with the existing autoscalers. “At Treestle, we think from the perspective of the website visitors. Page load time is what they experience and this therefore is the best criterion for scaling. If page load time deteriorates, LiquiD AutoScaler scales out extra spot instances, in a way similar to supermarkets adding extra registers when the waiting lines are long,” says Bob Bennink, CEO of Treestle.\nLiquiD AutoScaler automatically determines when to scale and how much to scale. “LiquiD AutoScaler offers hands off scaling so the system administrators don’t need to think about the relationship between server statistics and actual website performance,“ continues Bob. “System administrators also have the option to customise the autoscaler through its user interface.”\nLiquiD AutoScaler is developed for multiple cloud platforms, so that many more companies can optimize their websites and enjoy their peace of mind. LiquiD AutoScaler is available through Amazon Web Services and Interoute VDC . Users of other platforms can buy the product on liquidautoscaler.com .\n=", "external_links": ["https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B013UXHSOO/ref=_ptnr_pr_", "https://liquidautoscaler.com/", "https://cloudstore.interoute.com/LiquiDAutoScalerBasic"], "published": "2015-09-01T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:53:06.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
