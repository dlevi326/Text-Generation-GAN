The revised design unveiled Tuesday features the same mix of blue, red, yellow and green that Google has been using throughout its nearly 17-year history, though the hues are slightly different. Google also invented a new typeface called \"Product Sans\" that is meant to resemble the simple printing in a grade-school book. The overhaul also will change the appearance of the letter \"g\" that Google uses as its shorthand logo on the smaller screens of smartphones and other mobile devices. The \"g\" will now be capitalized and displayed in color instead of being kept lowercase and white. Google last tweaked its logo in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T21:33:47.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
