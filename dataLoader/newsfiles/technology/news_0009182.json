September 18, 2015 Since its inception in 2012, the Bayer Maxforce on a Mission initiative has provided support to communities and non-profit organizations around the country by partnering with pest management companies to donate professional pest control products and services to those in need. Just last month, Bayer partnered with EnviroPest to provide treatment to Hearts & Horses, a non-profit in Loveland, Colorado. Bayer donated a variety of solutions, including Maxforce Fly Spot Bait and Maxforce Granular Fly Bait to help control flies at the horse ranch. And the team with EnviroPest, who had an existing relationship with Hearts & Horses, donated their time and expertise. “The partnership we have formed with Hearts & Horses these past 18 months exemplifies our mission as a company,” said Kevin Lemasters, President of EnviroPest. “We want to serve our coworkers, our customers and our community, and supporting this amazing local non-profit allows us to give back to an important cause.” Founded in 1997, Hearts & Horses is a PATH (Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship) International Premier Accredited Facility that serves those with special physical, mental and emotional needs. The organization — named. Loveland’s 2013 “Non-Profit of the Year”— serves an average of 160 riders per week including children and adults with physical and cognitive disabilities, at-risk youth, veterans, and seniors with Alzheimer's. Because the organization’s classes are held on a horse ranch, pest control is essential to maintain animal health and an overall healthy environment for the students. The services and counsel provided by EnviroPest helps prevent various fly-transmitted diseases to the horses, such as Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) and Pigeon Fever. VS is a nuisance virus that causes horses to contract sores, which forces Hearts & Horses to quarantine its horses from leaving the ranch until deemed clear again. Fly control, in general, is crucial in maintaining happy and healthy horses for the various therapeutic sessions the ranch offers. “We can’t thank Kevin and his team enough for their continued support and are thrilled to receive additional donations from Bayer through Maxforce on a Mission,” said Jan Pollema, Director of Hearts & Horses. “EnviroPest is more than just a pest control provider to us; they truly are a trusted source in industry knowledge and a valued partner.” This Maxforce on a Mission event marks the third year that Bayer has supported underserved communities through the initiative. The program works to support non-profit organizations while raising awareness of the importance of pest control in promoting public health", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:44:44.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
