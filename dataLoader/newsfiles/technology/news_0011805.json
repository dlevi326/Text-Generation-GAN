Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, another TV streaming service, are all central offerings on Apple TV.\nIt is unclear whether Apple is looking at films or TV series. Netflix and Amazon began their original content efforts in TV, but have begun commissioning feature films. However, Apple already has a track record of buying independent films to distribute via iTunes.", "external_links": ["http://variety.com/2015/digital/news/apple-eyes-move-into-original-programming-exclusive-1201582020/"], "published": "2015-09-01T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T13:46:24.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
