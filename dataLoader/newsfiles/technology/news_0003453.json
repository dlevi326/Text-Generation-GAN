Since implementing the platform, the NBA team has converted more fans into season ticket holders and increased overall customer engagement. Leveraging Marketo, the franchise has achieved several all-time organizational records: Boosted season ticket renewals by 8 percent (96 percent renewal rate) Increased single game ticket sales by 30 percent Improved email open rates by 45 percent Prior to using Marketo, the team sent generic communications to its fans. From people who had never attended a live event to die-hard Trail Blazers fans, the organization was unable to tailor messages based on different interests. The team's management group needed a system that would help attract people to its arena (Moda Center) for home basketball games as well as concerts, family shows and other special events. The Trail Blazers realized they needed technology that would provide a 360-degree view of their fans. After examining different marketing platforms and technologies, the team selected Marketo for its array of features, easy integration with the organization's sales platform, and intuitive interface. Marketo's extensive analytics provided the team with the information it needed to align the right message to the right fan at the right time. By engaging fans using Marketo, the Trail Blazers improved season ticket renewals to 96 percent – a new franchise record – and increased single game ticket sales by 30 percent. While Portland is the 22 nd -largest NBA market, the Trail Blazers now rank among the league's leaders in fan attendance. The organization also increased the number of fans engaging with their digital content, which promoted other events outside of basketball games. \"Marketo allowed us to become smarter marketers because we now understand our fans on a deeper level,\" said Vincent Ircandia , Senior Vice President of Business Operations for the Portland Trail Blazers. \"One of our biggest goals is to build life-long fans, and Marketo has been instrumental in helping us learn more about our customers' needs and how to strategically build a relationship with them over the course of time.\" About The Portland Trail Blazers Members of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Portland Trail Blazers were founded in 1970 and purchased by Paul G. Allen in 1988. The team's rich heritage includes 31 playoff appearances, three trips to the NBA Finals, an NBA championship in 1977 and a commitment to community service and sustainability.
