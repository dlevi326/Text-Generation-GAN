Each student will have a personal advisor who will help him or her prepare a customized graduation plan. \nWith courses beginning every eight weeks, there is the opportunity to work through the program at an accelerated pace. \n\"Our goal is to offer students a top-quality education in an online format,\" Kraska said.
