The console will now sell for 34,980 yen ($289) starting Oct. 1.\nThere were long lines at Sony's booth for its VR headset, which offers virtual reality games, promised for next year.\n---\nFollow Yuri Kageyama: http://twitter.com/yurikageyama\nTags: TECHNOLOGY CONSUMER CYCLICAL CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SPECIALTY RETAIL", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/yurikageyama"], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T04:38:45.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
