The prices for the new phones, which will be available starting Sept. 25, will remain the same as previous new iPhone versions.\nThe company also announced a new phone-upgrade plan, starting at $32 a month, that allows users to get the newest iPhone each year.\nBefore unveiling the iPhone, the company also announced a revamped Apple TV set-top box with a new voice-controlled remote control and updated software, as well as a larger iPad that further blurs the line between tablets and laptop computers.\nThe new Apple TV will be available starting in November at a price of $149 for the model with 32 gigabytes of storage and $199 for one with 64 gigabytes of memory.\nApple said the new Apple TV remote has a touchpad and responds to voice commands with Siri, the digital assistant found in the iPhone. The company said it would allow users to search for TV programs across a range of video-streaming options.\nThe company also said it would allow outside developers to create apps for a new App Store for Apple TV.\nThe new iPad, called the \"iPad Pro,\" has a 12.9-inch screen, which is a significantly bigger screen than the existing 9.7-inch model or 7.9-inch iPad Mini. The new iPad weighs about 1.5 pounds, similar to the first iPad and despite the larger screen.\nThe company also showed off a pressure-sensitive stylus and a new keyboard cover to work with the larger tablet, positioning the device as business-friendly.\n\"iPad is clearest expression of our future of personal computing,\" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said Wednesday before unveiling the new iPad.\nTogether, the base iPad with the keyboard and stylus will cost $1,067, more than the starting $999 price of Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air.\nApple is hoping that the new features will help revive slumping iPad sales, particularly among business customers. IPad sales have declined for six straight quarters.\nThe iPad was a sensation when it was introduced in 2010 but has languished more recently. It isn't as essential as a smartphones, nor as useful in the office as a laptop. What's more, the more recent iPads--while thinner and lighter--haven't offered a compelling reason for many early iPad adopters to replace aging models.\nApple also said the new iPad Mini starts at $399.\nShares of Apple, down 12% over the past three months, recently slid 80 cents to $111.51.\nApple started the event by offering updates on its Apple Watch, highlighting new designs, new apps and new health-care uses.\nSpecifically, Apple and Hermès International announced an agreement that marries bands made in Hermès' signature leather with a specially designed user interface. Apple said the new watch will go on sale next month but didn't announced the price yet.\nApple also said the watch will get native apps--apps that run directly on the watch itself, instead of paired to the iPhone. Native apps should run faster on the watch and ease complaints by current watch users that programs run slowly.\nThe new products are part of Apple's push to refresh major product lines ahead of the crucial year-end shopping season. The iPhone remains Apple's most important product, accounting for almost two-thirds of company revenue and an even larger percentage of profits.\nThe new iPhones are expected to be the same size as the current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but include a faster processor and a sharper camera.\nThe new iPhones have big shoes to fill. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were smashing successes. In the three full quarters that the phones have been available, iPhone revenues have grown more than 50% from the same period a year earlier.\nIt is unclear whether the new features will be enticing enough to attract customers to the new phones at the blistering pace set by their predecessors.\nApple started selling Apple TV in 2007. Former CEO Steve Jobs called the product a hobby--fitting considering that very few people streamed video content to their television at the time. However, Netflix, Hulu and other video services have become mainstream options for watching TV shows and movies, creating demand for set-top boxes.\nApple Chief Executive has said the device, and content sales, had generated a billion dollars of revenue in 2013, making it \"hard to call it a hobby anymore.\" But Apple left the door open for living room rivals from Google Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Roku Inc.\nWrite to Daisuke Wakabayashi at Daisuke.Wakabayashi@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"Apple, Inc.\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005\n 09, 2015 15:26 ET (19:26 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:29:47.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
