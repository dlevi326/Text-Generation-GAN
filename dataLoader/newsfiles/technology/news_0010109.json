Consumer Electronics . Serko Ltd. announced a new feature called ‘Bag Tracker’ that allows travellers to use Serko Mobile to keep track of their checked luggage while travelling.Darrin Grafton, Serko CEO, says “With Bag Tracker Serko Mobile users no longer have to wonder whether their bags have made it onto the plane, or fight queues at the luggage carousel as their Serko Mobile app will now tell them exactly how far away their bags are.”To use the new Bag Tracker feature, travellers simply ‘pair’ a small beacon with Serko Mobile and then drop the beacon into their luggage. Serko Mobile can track up to three tags simultaneously.Darrin continues: “The Bag Tracker feature is really easy to use and is another way that Serko is helping to transform business travel, making it less stressful and more productive for our customers.”The new Bag Tracker feature operates in two modes: ‘Find My Bag’ which tells users how far away their bags are and if they are in range – up to 70 meters ‘Carousel Mode’ which alerts the user when their bag comes into range on the carousel so that they do not have to fight the crowd. Bag Tracker is being initially launched on iPhone and will be available for download from the App Store in September 2015.The small, Low Energy Bluetooth (LEB) technology beacons by Estimote Beacons last up to one year without being charged. Users will soon be able to purchase tags online, or may be given them by their Travel Management Company. The Bag Tracker feature will be included in the free Serko Mobile subscription.Future releases of Bag Tracker will check that the number of tagged bags is consistent with the airfare booked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T06:59:17.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
