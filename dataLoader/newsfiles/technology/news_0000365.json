Here's what to expect Last year, Google entered Phablet territory with the release of the Nexus 6 Comments \nGoogle is holding its annual autumn event, at which the company typically unveils its new Nexus phones as well as lifting the lid on its latest operating system, on Tuesday evening. \nThis year, Google is widely expected to announce two new smartphones - updates to both 2013's Nexus 5 and last year's bigger Nexus 6 . \nThe Nexus devices are not made by Google - it outsources production to manufacturers - but they are endorsed by the company and are the first to get Android updates. \nThis year's two new phones are due to be called the 5X and 6P. As well as being the first to go on sale with Marshmallow, the latest version of Android, they are due to have several other upgrades. \nReports suggest Google will also launch a new version of the Chromecast, its video-streaming dongle, and possibly a music device. \nThe event will begin at 5pm BST on Tuesday September 27. Here's what to expect: Nexus 5X \nGoogle's Nexus 5 was unveiled in 2013 and was, as the name suggests, the fifth device in the Nexus line of handsets before last year's Nexus 6 . However, Google can't call its seventh Nexus phone the Nexus 7, because that's what its seven-inch tablets are called. \nInstead, the company seems to be taking the Apple route of adding a letter onto the predecessor's name when it introduces an upgrade. \nThe back of the Nexus 5X, complete with fingerprint sensor Photo: Marques Brownlee \nAlthough we had a Nexus 6 last year, its enormous screen meant it was really more of a new model than an upgrade, so the 5X will really the spiritual successor to the Nexus 5, hence the name. \nLike the Nexus 5, the 5X has been designed by LG, but as can be expected with a two-year gap between the phones, contain several improvements. However, it is expected to remain in the plastic casing of the previous Nexus 5. \nBigger screen: The device is widely expected to have a 5.2-inch screen, against the 4.95 inches of the previous Nexus 5, reflecting demand for bigger displays. Better camera: The 8-megapixel back camera and 1.3-megapixel front-facing one on the Nexus 5 are now seriously outdated. According to Android Police , this will be upgraded to 12.3 megapixels and 5 megapixels respectively. Faster: The new device will reportedly contain Qualcomm's Snapdragon 808 processor and have around 2GB of RAM. This will make it faster than the Nexus 5, but not up there with the top Samsung devices. Fingerprint sensor: Several Android phones contain fingerprint sensors, but recognition has not been an official feature of Android until Marshmallow. You can expect the software's flagship phones to both show off the new feature, and leaked pictures suggest just that. However, Android's control system means the sensor is on the back of the phone. \nAs for price, Google has historically been fairly competitive: The Nexus 5 had a recommended price of £295. It can be expected to go on sale in the weeks after the event. Nexus 6P \nThe main Nexus release of last year was the enormous Nexus 6, which had one of the biggest screens on the market at 5.96 inches, and unlike the Nexus 5 was squarely aimed at the high end of the market. \nLast year's device was developed by Motorola, but this year the company has gone for a change of tack by having Huawei, the Chinese manufacturer which is still really trying to get a foothold in the west, to make the device, which is expected to be called the 6P. \nA retail slide for the Nexus 6P Photo: Imgur \nThis means that despite there only being a year's difference between the two \"6\" Nexus phones, the differences are likely to be more obvious than with the 5 and 5X. \nA leak of the presentation deck for the new phone has given away most of the news about it. \nMetallic body: The 6P will be the first Nexus phone with a metal, rather than plastic, casing. People have different preferences on metal and plastic. Metal is generally seen as harder to scratch, but when they do occur, it is more noticeable. Smaller screen: Huawei seems to have agreed with suggestions that the Nexus 6 screen was just too big. It will shave a bit of room off, making the screen 5.7 inches. Better battery and faster charging: Google will claim the Nexus 6's battery will keep going all day and into the night, and the device will support USB-C, allowing faster charging Camera: In megapixel terms, the 6P's back camera is actually less powerful than the Nexus 6's at 12.3MP against 13MP. But Google can be expected to tout a new sensor, which will let in more light for \"better\" pixels. Fingerprint sensor: Like the Nexus 5X, the 6P will have a fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone. It remains to be seen how intuitive this will be to use. \nThe Nexus 6 retailed for £499, a much steeper price than the Nexus 5. However, with a new manufacturer, this could change. Android Marshmallow \nGoogle unveiled the latest version of Android, then codenamed \"M\", at its developer conference I/O in May . \nLast month, the company said this would be called Marshmallow , continuing the Google tradition of naming its mobile OS after sweet treats. \nNow on Tap: A new feature in Android Marshmallow \nThe new software is something of a minor upgrade, with tweaks under the hood rather than major changes, but will introduce a few new features. \nNow on Tap: The latest step in Android's attempt to predict the information you want before you look for it, Now on Tap creates cards relevant to whatever you're doing on your phone. For example, if you're reading a text asking whether you want to see a film, activating Now on Tap by holding down the home key will bring up information about that film. Battery life: Termed \"battery-smart power\", this feature claims to be smarter about your smartphone's activity and apps by putting them on standby when they're not being used. Permissions: Allowing an app to use your microphone, location, contacts and so on has been tweaked to make it more customisable. Permissions will only be requested when needed, for example when trying to make a phone call via WhatsApp. \nAndroid Marshmallow's official release date is likely to be September 29, although releases are staggered based on what devices are being used. Chromecast \nVarious reports also suggest that there'll be an updated version of Chromecast, Google's HDMI dongle which plugs into a TV to stream video. \nAccording to 9to5google , there will be two new devices - an updated version of the media player launched two years ago, and an audio player that plugs into speakers via an auxiliary chord. \nThe new Chromecast video dongle will reportedly improve its Wi-Fi capabilities to allow higher-quality streaming, and will also have a new \"bubble\"-like design, according to grainy leaked pictures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T17:48:16.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
