The introduction of the service kicks off Trapp Technology’s stake in the business communications industry with a strong intent to have a rapidly growing presence in local and national markets.\n“As a comprehensive IT solutions company whose mission is to meet and exceed increasing market demands for better and more effective ways to leverage technology for business gain, introducing a dynamic, feature-rich hosted communications service was a natural next step,” said David Trapp, CEO of Trapp Technology. “It was clear that businesses felt their current communications services and environments were lacking, and we knew we could offer a communications tool that would fill that void. DOTVOX was borne out of pure necessity.”\nUsing DOTVOX, company communications (such as phone calls, instant messaging, video conferencing, desktop sharing, etc.) are cloud-hosted, allowing all features and capabilities to be accessed both in the office and while mobile using a desktop client or mobile app. There’s no special on-premise PBX equipment required to implement, which reduces capital expenditures and gives greater control over operating costs for companies—resulting in a reduced total cost of ownership. This is advantageous for companies who want to utilize cloud technology to foster more consistent and efficient workflows for their in-office and/or mobile employees while remaining cost-effective. DOTVOX service is scalable to fit the unique needs of any company of any size or industry, from small businesses with basic feature sets to multi-site companies with complex communications needs and configurations.\nDOTVOX specializes in a consultative approach to best address the specific needs of each company, and provides a comprehensive portfolio of premium VoIP products and service plans to facilitate the success of each client’s communications goals. DOTVOX offers expertly provisioned plug-and-play ready phones, E-Rate certified solutions to educational institutions, and provides 100% US-based support by experienced UCaaS and telecommunications specialists.\nWith clear advantages over other VoIP providers or solutions, DOTVOX is exclusively run and maintained by Trapp Technology, making the service particularly attractive and useful for existing customers who already leverage the company’s cloud, Internet, and other IT services to cut costs and maximize ROI.\n“DOTVOX is unique because it offers organizations access to premium communication tools that increase overall user efficiency and productivity while backed by the services and 24/7/365 support from an experienced IT solutions company,” continued Trapp. “No one else provides an end-to-end VoIP communication solution like that.”\nThe September 2015 introduction of DOTVOX marks yet another addition to Trapp Technology’s rapidly growing IT services catalogue. Twice-listed by Inc. 500 as one of the fastest growing private businesses in America, Trapp Technology’s laser-focused attitude toward delivering top quality services and products to customers reaffirms their reputation as one of Arizona’s leading tech service companies.\nFor more information on DOTVOX services and features, visit dotvox.com .\nAbout Trapp Technology\nTrapp Technology provides the very best cloud, Internet, VoIP, and IT managed services to provide a true all-in-one IT solution for businesses who seek to cut IT costs and leverage technology to grow revenues.
