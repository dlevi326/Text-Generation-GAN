Its advocates say it is as harmless as coffee or tea.\nBut last year it became a controlled class C drug in the UK. This means it’s illegal to have khat for yourself and to sell or give away khat to someone else.\nIt’s known to many as qaat - especially in Somalia, where Mo Farah was born. In his autobiography, Twin Ambitions, Farah says: “All grown-up Somalis chew this stuff.\n“Some people see it as a drug, although for Somalis and Muslims generally, it’s a social thing, like drinking coffee or having a beer in a pub in England.”\nPA Winner: Mo Farah of Britain celebrates winning the men's 5,000 metres final during the 15th IAAF World Championships\nThe two main stimulants in khat quicken up the pace of your mind and body, like a less powerful version of amphetamine, which is known as speed.\nIt can make you more alert, happy and talkative but can cause insomnia and temporary confusion.\nVideo loading\nIf you chew it for a few hours it can leave you with a feeling of calm, described by some as feeling blissed out.\nIt can also suppress your appetite.\nGetty Victory: Mo Farah celebrates winning the final of the men's 5000 metres athletics event\nBut experts warn the drug could make pre-existing mental health problems worse, and can cause paranoid and psychotic reactions.\nIt can also spark feelings of anxiety and aggression .\nKhat can also inflame your mouth and damage your teeth, and there are concerns about the long-term risk of mouth cancers.\nAFP Olympian: Mo Farah of Britain celebrates winning the men's 5,000 metres final during the 15th IAAF World Championships\nYou can also get high blood pressure, heart palpitations and heart problems with heavy use.\nAs khat can cause periods of increased libido, care may be needed to minimise the risk of unsafe sex and unwanted pregnancies.\nGetty National treasure: Mo Farah does his 'mobot' celebration after winning the final of the men's 5000 metres athletics event at the 2015 IAAF World Championships\nIf caught with khat in the UK, you face being arrested and could end up spending two years in prison and/or an unlimited fine. Selling khat or giving khat away for free, even to your friends - known as supplying - could result in up to 14 years in jail and/or an unlimited fine.\n ", "external_links": ["http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/v1/unsecured/media/4221396001/201507/1095/4221396001_4374057432001_Ipkg1437812195965I-35160-1-480x360.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/andrewgregory", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-09-10T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:36:16.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
