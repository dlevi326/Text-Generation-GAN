On October 1, as U.S. retailers activate their new chip-card ready POS terminals and customers make the shift from swipe to dip, the Electronic Transactions Association will host Chip-Card 101 Day, an information briefing connecting media and industry stake holders to discuss the start of the EMV migration and its benefits for consumer data security. This event will take place in the Washington DC Newseum’s Broadcast Room from 8:30am-10:30am. \nSeveral ETA members will be on-site for the Technology Showcase, demonstrating their EMV compliant POS technologies. The variety of POS terminals on display will enable merchants and press to interact with a few of the many EMV-ready solutions available. \nAttendees will also hear from two power-house panels. First, Carolyn Balfany, Group Head of US Product Delivery at MasterCard and Maryam Cope, Vice President of Government Affairs at the American Hotel & Lodging Association will discuss details on how EMV works to make payments more secure and to reduce fraud. In the second panel, we’ll hear from merchants, financial institutions and consumer groups on the transition to EMV, implementation, and the road ahead for payments security. \nJoin us for this engaging conversation on the chip card transition and payments’ road ahead! Attendance is free, but space is limited – REGISTER NOW! \nFor additional information, please contact Meghan Cieslak, ETA Director of Communications at mcieslak@electran.org Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T03:02:13.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
