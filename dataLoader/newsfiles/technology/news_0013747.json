Picture: REUTERS Related articles Samsung takes smartwatch fight to Apple Apple shows off next generation Apple TV and latest iPhone Samsung joins tech race to make homes smarter Apple’s latest challenge: topping its own success WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Thursday gave Apple new legal leverage over Samsung Electronics in the smartphone wars, ruling the iPhone maker was entitled to an injunction barring Samsung from using certain phone features that violated Apple’s patents.\n\"Samsung’s infringement harmed Apple by causing lost market share and lost downstream sales and by forcing Apple to compete against its own patented invention,\" the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a ruling that deeply divided the three judges who considered the case.\nThe appeals court, a special court based in Washington that hears patent appeals, said a Californian trial court that previously denied Apple’s request \"abused its discretion when it did not enjoin Samsung’s infringement.\"\nThe decision is a notable win for Apple, which has argued Samsung should have to do more than pay monetary damages for infringing upon Apple’s patented technology. Apple had argued that continued infringement by Samsung damaged its reputation as an innovator and caused it to lose sales of devices and downstream products.\nWhile Apple has been able to obtain monetary judgments against its South Korean rival for patent infringement, courts on previous occasions have declined to give Apple additional leverage by barring Samsung from selling infringing features in its devices. Thursday’s decision reversed that trend.\n\"This ruling reinvigorates patent holders in keeping companies off the market,\" said Rutgers University law professor Michael Carrier.\n\"Apple now has a weapon it can use in two ways: in future litigation with Samsung and others, and in settlement negotiations.\"\nDespite Apple’s win on legal principle, the immediate practical effect could be limited. Samsung in court proceedings said it had ceased selling nearly all of the products that were originally at issue in the case. It also has said it could design around the features.\nApple potentially could attempt to use an injunction to go after newer Samsung devices if they have features similar to the patents at issue.\n\"That’s where the action is going to be,\" said Stanford University law professor Mark Lemley.\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment on the specifics of the ruling or the company’s next move. He reiterated the company’s previous comments that \"courts around the world\" have found that Samsung \"willfully stole our ideas and copied our products.\"\nSamsung said it would ask the appeals court to reconsider the ruling, this time with a larger roster of judges participating.\n\"We want to reassure our millions of loyal customers that all of our flagship smartphones, which are wanted and loved by American consumers, will remain for sale and available for customer service support in the US,\" a company spokeswoman said.\nPart of the debate in Thursday’s ruling focused on whether Apple could show a sufficient connection between the patents at issue in the case and demand for infringing Samsung phones. The court’s majority said the evidence established that the features claimed in the Apple patents \"were important to product sales and that customers sought these features in the phones they purchased.\"\nJudge Kimberly Moore, writing for the majority, said that if Apple didn’t win an injunction in this case, then such a decision would \"virtually foreclose the possibility\" that any company could win such relief for patent infringement when the technology at issue contains many different facets and functions.\nThe dissenter in Thursday’s ruling was the court’s chief judge, Sharon Prost, who said Apple had failed to demonstrate that it was being irreparably harmed by Samsung’s conduct. She said two of the patents at issue in the case related to \"minor features\" in the iPhone: the phone’s slide-to-unlock feature and a data-tapping feature that allows the user to call a phone number in an e-mail by clicking on it.\nThe judge said the third patent in the case involved a spelling correction feature that Apple didn’t use. \"This is not a close case,\" she said.\nThe case stems from a 2014 trial in San Jose in which a jury awarded Apple more than $119m in damages for infringement by Samsung. The presiding judge denied Apple’s request for an injunction blocking Samsung from including infringing features in its devices.\nSamsung is separately challenging the infringement finding and monetary damages. Its appeal on those issues remains pending. Apple’s monetary win at the trial court amounts to a fraction of the more than $2bn in damages it sought.\nMore Africa news from The Wall Street Journal\nMore news from The Wall Street Journal\nPremium access to WSJ.com: $1 a week for 12 weeks", "external_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/public/page/news-africa.html?mod=TMGSAlink1", "https://join.wsjeuropesubs.com/tmg1", "http://online.wsj.com/europe?mod=TMGSAlink2", "https://www.wsjeuropesubs.com/wsj12offer/?tagsrc=/tmg1&rnd=54622c7ae7d81"], "published": "2015-09-18T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T13:56:54.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
