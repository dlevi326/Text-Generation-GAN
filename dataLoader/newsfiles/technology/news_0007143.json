Working with local partners, at a grassroots level, we provide clean water and sanitation facilities to some of the poorest communities around the world through the construction of hand-dug and borehole wells, pipelines, hand pumps and latrines and we establish health and sanitation programmes. We operate with a handful (5) of staff and an army of volunteers, many of whom are retired military officers and water engineers with extensive experience on global water development projects. To date, we have carried out over 130 projects across 31 countries, reaching an estimated 1.5 million people from Afghanistan to Zambia. Fast Water Facts: A child dies around every 20 seconds as a result of a water related illness. Over 768 million people in the world do not have access to clean, safe water.
