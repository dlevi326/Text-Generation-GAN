The IPPS is the first and only portable backup sensor in the world that reads the movement of the back tire. It’s based on a new technology that allows the backup sensor to be installed as easy as an EZ-Pass. This innovative technology alerts the driver with a beep if there is an object behind the vehicle, and becomes louder and more frequent when it gets closer. IPPS will not only make parking much easier, but it also can prevent injuries and accidents involving backing up.\nIPPS is light, compact, and fits easily on the rear windshield. Users can even take it with them when traveling in another vehicle. Also, it is extremely affordable, unlike other bumper sensors. IPPS is now working on an upgraded version of the device, which has a camera and can be seen with a smartphone. However, before this sensor can be on the back of cars all over the world, IPPS needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $90,000 by October 31, 2015. The funds raised will go towards production and manufacturing.\nTo help bring this innovative backup sensor to life, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered between October 2015 and February 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help IPSS reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nFabio Lettieri\n+39.3347722636\nwww.kickstarter.com/projects/1023547201/ipps-portable-backup-sensors-no-drivers-excused", "external_links": ["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1023547201/ipps-portable-backup-sensors-no-drivers-excused"], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T23:21:21.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
