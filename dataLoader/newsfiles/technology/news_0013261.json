I want to thank our state and federal partners who recognised the importance of this critical project.” \nThe port is planning $1 billion in rail projects over the next decade as part of a broader modernisation programme to strengthen the port’s competitiveness and reduce port-related impacts to the environment. \nPort of Long Beach CEO Jon Slangerup said the Green Port Gateway is a key part of building the ‘Port of the Future’. \nSlangerup added: “This project will enable us to reach our goal of moving 35% of containerised cargo via on-dock rail this decade. It will also support our long-range ambition to eventually move 50% of our goods directly from terminals by train.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:01:27.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
