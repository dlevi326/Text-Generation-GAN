This decision was on top of other decisions he and his wife needed to make. \n“A lot of paperwork signing. You do the consents and somebody says 'hey what do you think about taking out your daughter’s ovary?' Um, ok, and so we kind of left it at that. There’s a lot of information, a lot of it is a blur.” \nIt was Children’s Fertility Navigator Olivia Frias who introduced the idea to the Bryants and explained the specifics. She sees about seven to ten new patients a week. She says, \"Of course there’s so many emotions, a malignancy or maybe they have found some type of blood disorder that’s going to warrant them a BMT (bone marrow transplant). But at the end of the day parents are very enlightened when they hear about this information and they are thankful about hearing about this.” \nThe Children’s Comprehensive Fertility Care and Preservation program team has been together since 2009 and today only a handful of hospitals offer it. Dr. Lesley Breech is director of the division of gynecology. \n\"Our philosophy is that every new patient to our cancer and blood disorders institute have a fertility consult and we would meet with them and talk about the options for that age patient or if the patient is after puberty or before puberty… all those implications about what choices would be available for the patient or the family.” \nBreech says no patient is really too young or too old. Deciding to remove ovarian or testicular tissue or eggs or sperm depends on how great the risk from chemotherapy and radiation will be. \nThe Options:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T06:54:15.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
