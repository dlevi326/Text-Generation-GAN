For the first time you can use EnviroEYE’s Floating Roof Drain Guard System to mitigate unforeseen petroleum spills and possible EPA problems. Come to the show and see exactly how our new Floating Roof Drain Guard System works with live demonstrations on a working model.\nYou can get more information and your free registration form for the trade show here:\nhttps://issuu.com/nistm/docs/galveston_final/20?e=1531345/14838585\nStop by our booth and see our live demonstration and get information on how you can prevent many of the common problems with petroleum spills and get 24/7 monitoring that alerts you by phone, email, and even onsite flashing lights and sirens.\nABOUT EnviroEYE: EnviroEYE founder Mark Rauch has owned and operated a pipeline and storage tank facility for over 25 years. One of the challenges in using floating open roof type storage tanks is protecting them from contamination from rain water and the ensuing damage from a spill or leak from the storage tanks. Most storage tanks have a drain system to remove any rain water but has some risks involved. With the help of a couple long time vendors, Mark came up with a system to eliminate the need for onsite personnel to monitor the weather and the position of the drain valve, open or closed. This new Floating Roof Drain Guard System uses a sensor to determine if any oil related chemicals have leaked into the drain system and immediately alerts personnel by sending information via modem to any cell phone and/or email address. This eliminates the need for onsite monitoring personnel and possible problems with undetected leaks or spills since the device can close the valve automatically.\nCONTACT INFORMATION:\nEnviroEYE\nwww.enviroeye.net\nMedia Relations\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
