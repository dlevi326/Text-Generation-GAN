This being the 30th success I am sure you will be doing many more successful launches,” he said.\nDirector of Satish Dhawan Space Centre Kunhi Krishnan said ASTROSAT was the ‘hard earned’ gift of ISRO to the world in the area of astronomy and noted ISRO had crossed the half-century mark in commercial launches with this mission.\n“We are getting ready with another dedicated commercial mission in PSLV C29 with six satellites from Singapore. All of us must be proud to see PSLV has established its prominent presence in the international space market,” he added.\nASTROSAT, which has a mission life of five years, carries four X-ray payloads, one UV telescope and a charge particle monitor.\nThe scientific satellite mission ASTROSAT has unique features including simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of various astronomical objects with a single satellite.\nAccording to ISRO, ASTROSAT will observe the universe in optical, ultraviolet low and high energy X-ray regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, while most other scientific satellites are capable of observing a narrow range of wavelength band.\nThe spacecraft control centre at Mission Operations Complex of ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) at Bengaluru will manage the satellite during its mission life.\nThe scientific objectives of ASTROSAT mission are to understand high energy processes in binary star systems containing neutron stars and black holes, to estimate magnetic fields of neutron stars and to study star birth regions and high energy processes in star systems lying beyond our galaxy.\nThe mission is also aimed at detecting new briefly bright X-ray sources in the sky and performing a limited deep field survey of the universe in the ultraviolet region.\nApart from ISRO, four other Indian institutions – Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics and Raman Research Institute, were involved in payload development, officials said.\n 28, 2015 12:25 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:14:29.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
