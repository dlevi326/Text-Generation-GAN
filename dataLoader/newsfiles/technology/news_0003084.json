The tongue then reached far down the steep mountainside, which today is hammered by a roaring waterfall pouring from the glacier lake and marking the starting point of Europe's mighty Rhone river. \n\"It has been heartbreaking to see the glacier shrink, and today it is really painful to see it covered in blankets, to see this vain battle to save a dying mountain,\" he told AFP. \nA full 1,400 metres (4,600 feet) down the mountain side, near the small village of Gletch, a wooden post signals where the glacier once ended back in 1856. \nSince then, the Rhone glacier has lost around 350 metres in ice thickness -- around 40 metres in the past decade alone. \nIt is not the only Alpine glacier feeling the heat. Studies show that around two-thirds of the ice volume in the Alps has vanished since 1850. \n\"The Rhone glacier is quite typical of what is happening in the Alps,\" said Matthias Huss, a glaciologist at Fribourg University. \"We are seeing less new ice created in higher altitudes even as the lower parts of the glaciers are melting at an accelerated pace.\" \nWorld leaders will gather in Paris later this year to try to agree to a plan to restrict the global warming blamed for the mass glacial melt and other dangerous shifts in the environment. \nThe overarching goal is to limit average warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels. \nBut for the Alpine glaciers, it is likely already too late since the Alps, like the Arctic and the Antarctic Peninsula, are considered hotspots that are warming at least twice as quickly as the global average. \nWearing a t-shirt under the glare of the sun, Volken said the Rhone glacier loses between 10 and 12 centimetres (up to eight inches) of ice thickness on a hot day. \nAnd the new lake that has formed at the edge of the glacier, as well the darkening of the ice -- a result of impurities mixing in as it melts and freezes again -- only speed up the process since they help the glacier absorb more of the sun's radiation. \n- Blankets not enough - \n\"In the last three weeks, the glacier has melted back six metres,\" said Volken, pointing to the rocky surface recently covered in ice. \nEach year, the glacier loses between five and seven metres in ice thickness, and within the next decade it is expected to lose half of its current volume. \n\"By the end of the century, only about 10 percent of the current ice volume will remain,\" Volken said. \nUnlike the melting in the Antarctic and the Greenland ice caps, that of the Alpine glaciers will have little impact on global sea-level rise. \nIf all of the region's glaciers melted, this would add only about 0.3 millimetres to ocean levels, Huss said. But he quickly added that the local impact will be dramatic. \nThe Alps function as a water tower that stores water, releasing it when it is most needed -- in the hot and dry summer months. \nAs the ice melt accelerates, Alpine glacier-fed rivers that stretch across Europe, like the Rhone, will initially see higher water levels and more flooding, though by the middle of the century water levels will decline dramatically, Volken said. \nStanding near the edge of the Rhone glacier with its odd blankets Christine Ouedraogo, a 37-year-old tourist from Burkina Faso, listened to the rapid dripping of the dissolving ice. \n\"It's beautiful, but it is such a shame that it is melting away,\" she said sadly. \n\"I don't think those blankets will be enough.\" .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:25:01.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
