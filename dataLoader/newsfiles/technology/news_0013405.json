So excited,” the 18-year-old posted on her Facebook account on Thursday afternoon .\nFTL Moda is partnering with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation to help models with disabilities. Rebekah Marine, a 28-year-old American with a bionic arm, is also taking part. “Beautiful Madeline will brighten up the runway,” FTL Moda announced on Facebook in August.\nMadeline has inspired thousands through her social media posts, generating more than 466,000 likes on her Facebook page and messages of support from as far as Canada and the Netherlands. Mother Roseanne Stuart says Madeline always loved the spotlight and after attending a fashion parade last year, decided she wanted to model.\nAfter struggling with her weight most of her life, she went on a healthy eating kick and lost almost 20kg.\nMrs Stuart then created her Facebook page in a bid to help her daughter chase her dreams.\nMadeline Stuart.

She gave people hope that their children living with Down syndrome would achieve anything they set their mind to,” she said on a post this week on Madeline’s website.\nSince then, Madeline has walked the New York catwalk for auto immune awareness, become the face of cosmetic company Glossigirl and has even had a bag named after her.\n“She is now known as the first professional adult model with Down syndrome in the world and is actually supporting herself doing it,” her mother said.\nIt was a contrast to what people thought she could do.\n“Her doctors told me she would never achieve anything,” Mrs Stuart said earlier this year.\nOriginally published as Brisbane Down syndrome model heads to NYFW Increase Text Size Decrease Text Size Print Email Share Add to Digg Add to del.icio.us Add to Facebook Add to Kwoff Add to Myspace Add to Newsvine What are these?
