It will be able to detect objects in multiple wavelengths such as X-rays, but with far lower precision than Hubble, said Mayank Vahia of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.\n\"This will bring little commercial advantage but will show India’s new capability in space research,\" said Vahia, whose institute made three of the five scientific instruments aboard ASTROSAT.\nThe ASTROSAT instruments will transmit data to a control centre in the southern city of Bangalore that will manage the satellite during its five-year mission life.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:11:08.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
