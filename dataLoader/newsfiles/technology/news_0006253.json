Similarly, Nielsen's Connected Life Report - a bi-annual study of consumer needs, preferences, attitudes, and behaviors around new and emerging technologies related to connected cars, homes, and wearables - finds 82% of household decision makers say they've at least heard the term and nearly half (46%) say they know what it does. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20100517/NY06256LOGO \nClearly familiarity isn't breeding contempt, as Americans are also increasingly likely to indicate that they'll consider purchasing a wearable tech device when it drops to a price they think is reasonable (27%, up from 17%). An additional one in ten (10%, up slightly from 7%) say they'll consider a purchase when they read or hear positive feedback from people using such devices. \nWhat's more, there's been a dramatic increase in the percentage of Americans who believe wearable tech devices are the next step to enhancing people's lives (52%, up from 37%), along with a notable drop in the percentage who simply don't understand the need for such devices (51%, down from 59%). \nThese are some of the results of The Harris Poll® of 2,273 adults surveyed online between July 15 and 20, 2015. Full results of the study, including data tables, can be found here . -- Two-thirds of Millennials (68%) are familiar with these devices, as are a smaller majority of Gen Xers (56%), while just over four in ten Baby Boomers (43%) and three in ten matures (30%) say the same. -- Additionally, Millennials (35%) and Gen Xers (31%) are more likely than their elders (22% Baby Boomers, 15% Matures) to say they'll consider a wearable tech purchase when the price drops to a level they perceive as reasonable. Meanwhile, Matures (35%) and Baby Boomers (33%) are more likely than their younger counterparts (15% Gen Xers, 9% Millennials) to say they'll never consider such a purchase. -- Six in ten men (59%) are familiar with the category, as are just under half of women (47%). \nPerceived benefits getting stronger When asked what benefits wearable tech could have on their lives, roughly two-thirds of Americans (66%) - up from 54% in 2013 - believe such devices could benefit them in at least one way. This includes an overwhelming majority of Millennials (84%) roughly three-fourths of Gen Xers (74%), just over half of Baby Boomers (52%) and over four in ten Matures (43%). Some of the top benefits Americans believe this technology could have on their lives include: -- Keeping them informed (42% of Americans, up from 26% in 2013), -- Making them healthier (32%, up from 14%), -- Making them more productive (27%, up from 18%), and -- Making them feel more connected (26%, up from 18%). \nPerceived benefits are consistently called out more among younger generations, while men are more likely than women to call out wearable tech's potential to keep them more informed (46% vs. 38%). \nEchoing some of these perceived benefits, over six in ten Americans believe wearable tech devices will make a major impact in the fitness (63%) and healthcare (61%) industries. \nA majority of Americans (54%, up from 48%) indicate they'd like to be able to access smartphone functions without having to dig in their pocket or bag, but clearly this matters a lot more to some than to others. More specifically, Millennials (69%) are especially likely to feel a need for this level of convenience; Gen Xers (55%) are in turn more likely than Baby Boomers (45%) and Matures (42%) to agree with this sentiment. \nConcerns also on the rise On the other hand, when asked about their biggest concerns with wearable tech devices only 14% of Americans say they don't have any concerns, while 86% (up from 76% in 2013) have at least one: -- The top concern is price, with a 57% majority (up from 41% in 2013) concerned that they'll be too expensive. -- Privacy and lack of unique features are the next strongest concerns, with 37% each (up from 28% each in 2013) indicating that such devices will make it too easy for others to access personal information and that they don't do anything consumers can't already do on a device they already have. -- Adding to privacy concerns, nearly six in ten Americans (58%, unchanged from 2013) indicate that they want wearable tech devices with cameras to be clearly visible. -- Further driving home the need for wearable tech to distinguish itself from devices consumers might already have, seven in ten Americans (70%, up from 63% in 2013) say that wearable tech devices must meet their needs better than current technology for them to use such products. -- Roughly one-fourth (24%, up from 10% in 2013) believe they'll be too small to easily use, while two in ten (20%, up from 14%) believe they'll be too complex to use. \nWhile the percentage of Americans concerned that wearable tech devices will make them look silly has held steady at 15%, an increasing percentage believe wearable tech can be stylish (55%, up from 43%). \nAs seen in 2013, Millennials are more likely than their elders to confirm most of these concerns. Matures, on the other hand, are the generation most concerned that the devices will be too complex to use (30% vs. 22% Baby Boomers, 14% Gen Xers, 17% Millennials). \nFactoring in form Six in ten Americans are at least a little interested (61%, up from 46%) in owning a watch or wristband type device, with over four in ten specifying being very or somewhat interested (43%, up from 27%). Fewer are interested in owning a device from the headset/glasses category (43% at least a little, 27% very/somewhat - up from 36% and 20%, respectively), while a majority say there's some other type of wearable tech they're interested in (58% at least a little, 34% very/somewhat - up from 46% and 26%). \nTo see other recent Harris Polls, please visit our new website, TheHarrisPoll.com . \nWant Harris Polls delivered direct to your inbox?

Figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting was also used to adjust for respondents' propensity to be online. \nAll sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including sampling error, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments. Therefore, The Harris Poll avoids the words \"margin of error\" as they are misleading. All that can be calculated are different possible sampling errors with different probabilities for pure, unweighted, random samples with 100% response rates. These are only theoretical because no published polls come close to this ideal. \nRespondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in Harris Poll surveys. The data have been weighted to reflect the composition of the adult population. Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in our panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. \nThese statements conform to the principles of disclosure of the National Council on Public Polls. \nThe results of this Harris Poll may not be used in advertising, marketing or promotion without the prior written permission of The Harris Poll. \nProduct and brand names are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners. \nConnected Life Methodology Connected Life provides manufacturers, developers, carriers, content providers and advertisers with an understanding of consumer needs, preferences, attitudes, and behaviors around new and emerging technologies related to connected cars, homes, and wearables. The Connected Life study is conducted online twice per year using a sample of 5,000 adults age 18+ who either currently use or are interested in at least one of the three connected life technologies: connected home, car and/or wearable technology. \nThe Harris Poll(®) #59, September 30, 2015 By Larry Shannon-Missal, Managing Editor, The Harris Poll \nAbout The Harris Poll® Begun in 1963, The Harris Poll is one of the longest running surveys measuring public opinion in the U.S. and is highly regarded throughout the world.
