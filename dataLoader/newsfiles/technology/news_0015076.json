And importantly, they remove a large part of the CO2 that is put into the atmosphere by human activities such as burning fossil fuels,\" co-author Dorothee Bakker, of the University of East Anglia, said in a statement announcing the findings. \nShe noted that the previous suggestions of a saturation point had been surprising at the time and that these new findings show the Antarctic Ocean \"has in fact regained its expected strength.\" \nThe study, published in the journal Science, is based on surface water carbon dioxide measurements taken throughout the past decade. \nThe researchers, led by Nicolas Gruber of the university ETH Zurich, attributed this reinvigoration of carbon dioxide absorption to changes in prevailing weather patterns. \nAnother study published Thursday, in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, found a similar uptick in a specific region of the Antarctic seas, the Drake Passage that separates the ice-covered continent from South America. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T08:20:20.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
