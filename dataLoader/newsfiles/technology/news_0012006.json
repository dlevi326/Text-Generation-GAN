In such an environment, the advantage to investing in petrochemical activities is access to a plentiful, inexpensive feedstock and to low-cost energy for our plants.\" \"This project is aligned with our strategy to strengthen our major integrated refining and petrochemical platforms worldwide.\" \nCB&I president and chief executive officer Philip K Asherman said: \"We appreciate the opportunity to work with Total, one of the world's largest integrated producers, and look forward to collaborating closely with them to develop this project through FEED and beyond. \n\"The award of both the technology license and the FEED phase for this significant ethylene project reflects the confidence Total has in CB&I's integrated capabilities.\" \nThe new project will be completed in 2019. \nThe Port Arthur campus is one of Total's six major integrated platforms across the world. \nTotal owns a refinery at the location, and the company jointly operates a petrochemical plant with BASF in the same location. Total owns a 40% stake in the petrochemical plant, while BASF owns a 60% share. \nBASF and Total reinstated the current Port Arthur steam cracker in 2013, mainly to process ethane and butane produced from natural gas. \nImage: BASF TOTAL Petrochemicals is a 60/40 joint-venture between BASF and Total Petrochemicals & Refining, which operates Port Arthur steam cracker and C4 Olefins complex.
