By Kersti McDonald | Submitted On August 27, 2015 \nMicrosoft made a big splash with its launch of Windows 10 on July 29, 2015. For many PC users, switching to the new OS is a no-brainer, while for others, it's a close call. If you haven't decided whether your business is ready to make the switch, here's a closer look at Windows 10 to help you determine if the new OS is truly better, stronger, and faster. \nCOST \nUpgrade to Windows 10 for free! Users with Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows Phone 8.1 can receive the new OS free of charge until July 29, 2016. Windows 10 is free for the lifetime of the device, meaning support and updates at no charge as long as Microsoft supports the operating system. \nWindows Vista, XP, 7 Enterprise, 8/8.1 Enterprise and RT/RT 8.1 are excluded from this free offer. These OS's require a payment of $119 per Home license or $199 per Pro license to upgrade to Windows 10. However, if you have Software Assurance with one of these OS's, then your upgrade is free. \nSUPPORT \nWindows 7 and Windows 8 are approaching end of support faster than we'd like to think. By upgrading to Windows 10, you gain years of additional mainstream and extended support. Here's a comparison of the operating system support lifecycles for Windows 10 vs. Windows 8 vs. Windows 7: \nOperating System End of Mainstream Support End of Extended Support \nWindows 7 January 13, 2015 January 14, 2020 Windows 8 January 9, 2018 January 10, 2023 Windows 10 October 13, 2020 October 14, 2025 \nWindows 10 brings added years of mainstream and extended support. End of mainstream support means that Microsoft will no longer enhance the product, but there will still be support for security and reliability issues. End of extended support still provides security and reliability support; however, this marks the end of support for non-security hotfixes, requests for new features and designs, and warranty claims. \nThe question is what will you do when your OS support comes to an end within the next few years? If you're an eligible candidate for a free upgrade to Windows 10, it may be worthwhile to upgrade before the offer expires. \nSPEED \nIs Windows 10 faster? TechSpot put Windows 10 to the test against Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 for speed performance. The new OS ranked within mere seconds of Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 for speed in all performance areas. Here's a quick look at the difference you may be able to feel on a daily basis with wake up and boot times: \nOperating System Hibernation Wake Up Hybrid Sleep Wake Up Boot Time \nWindows 7 27 seconds 17 seconds 5 seconds Windows 8.1 23 seconds 12 seconds 4 seconds Windows 10 21 seconds 10 seconds 6 seconds \nSimilar to wake up and boot speed, it's a close call for Windows 10 against Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 in application, storage, and gaming performance. Windows 10 doesn't have a clear win over past OS's in terms of speed in any particular category. \nFEATURES \nWindows 10 brings futuristic features to computing. With this new OS, users can expect enhanced collaboration, mobility and ease of use with a fresh look. Here's an overview of some of the newest enhancements: \nMOBILITY.

BETTER, STRONGER, FASTER? \nIs Windows 10 better, stronger, and faster? Switching to Windows 10 brings extended support, futuristic features, performance enhancements, and at no cost (for some). While its speed may not be a deciding factor, weighing the benefits of new features and added support against your current operating system could tip the scale. Microsoft has made the decision even more compelling for those on Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows Phone 8.1 with a one-year offer for a free upgrade. \nIf you have determined that Windows 10 is right for your business, testing the OS for compatibility is a must. Testing applications, hardware, drivers, printers and more for suitability with Windows 10 is necessary for a smooth transition. Since the OS was released on July 29, 2015, numerous patches and updates have already been released to enhance compatibility and stability. There will undoubtedly be more updates and patches to come as the operating system is tested by users. The key question in determining when your business will make the switch is how much testing is required to ensure a smooth transition. \nIf you're still not decided on Windows 10, try testing the new OS out in action on Microsoft's website, or contact us to explore what operating system option is right for your organization.
