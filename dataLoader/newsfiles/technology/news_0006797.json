In Google’s idea, the new spectacles would have an actuator — a little motor for controlling movement — in each arm that could bend the arms in or out as needed, rather like the way a bendy straw works. \nWhen the spectacles detect that their wearer is bobbing up and down at an increased rate — while running, for example — the arms contract to grip the wearer’s head. The actuators could also help solve the one-size-fits-all approach that many spectacles have to fitting — if the specs are too wide for someone’s face, the actuators could automatically resize them so that they fit snugly.
