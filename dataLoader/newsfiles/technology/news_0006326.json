It follows the launch of virtual-reality camera rigs by GoPro and Nokia , amid a wider search in Silicon Valley for the next big technological trend after smartphones. \nFounded in 2013, Jaunt has worked with musicians including Paul McCartney and Jack White, as well as the makers of The Hobbit films and fashion magazine Elle, to create short films aimed at smartphone-based virtual-reality systems such as Google Cardboard and Samsung’s Gear VR. \nWhile many virtual reality developers are focused on gaming and digital animation-based content, Jaunt’s expertise is in live-action video. Disney-owned broadcaster ABC has already worked with the start-up to produce a virtual-reality news report from Syria. \nJaunt’s appeal to media companies looking to make their first foray into virtual reality is what it calls its “end to end solution”, including a rig of multiple cameras and microphones for capturing content. This can then be put through its software to create high-quality 360-degree videos. \nAlongside its technological expertise, in April Jaunt hired three former Lucasfilm executives to launch its studios arm, based in Hollywood, to work directly with filmmakers and artists. More video \nRick Hess, founder of Evolution Media Partners, called Jaunt a “pioneer” and said it would give the company access to its network of brands and artists. “Jaunt’s expertise provides a groundbreaking medium for exploring these new avenues.” \nHanno Fichtner, chief digital strategy officer of ProSiebenSat.1, said: “Virtual reality will trigger an entertainment revolution similar to what our core media of TV did.” \nAfter previously raising funds from Google Ventures, Highland Capital, Redpoint Ventures and SV Angel, the round takes Jaunt’s total funding above $100m. \nJens Christensen, chief executive and co-founder of Jaunt, said: “This round further illustrates our commitment and dedication to advancing the scope of cinematic virtual reality — for filmmakers, storytellers and audiences alike.” \nAdditional reporting by Henry Mance in London Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
