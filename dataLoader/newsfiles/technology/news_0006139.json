Meetings were then rounded out by Softon's equity stake consideration, for the ongoing development of Oveedia. All parties applauded this action knowing, \"just how much faster Oveedia could reach critical mass, should Softon have a vested interest in Oveedia,\" continued Mr. Pereira.\nPure Hospitality and Softon's meeting in the USA did not yet determine what portion of Softon's future compensation will be cash vs. equity (all payments have been cash to date). However, given the size of the Oveedia project, the commitment made by Softon could be significant. Of course, considering the multi-million dollar and billion dollar acquisitions of similar but less dynamic OTA's, as well as the incredible stock valuations achieved within the marketplace, Softon's bet on Oveedia could be a major windfall for the software developer and PURE's investors.\nMr. Pereira concluded, \"Oveedia's beta launch is just the beginning of what we, and many others, believe will become a major Central America-Caribbean online travel hub .\"\nWith less than 15 days from the conclusion of Pure Hospitality and Softon's meeting in the USA , Oveedia's beta launch will commence. The excitement levels at and around both companies are high.\nAbout Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc.\nPURE provides proprietary technology, marketing solutions and branding services to hotel operators and condominium owners.
