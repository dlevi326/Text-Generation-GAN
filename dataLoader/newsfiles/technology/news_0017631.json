This would have been impossible to understand without looking at a transsexual population,\" said professor Rupert Lanzenberger from University of Vienna, Austria. \nBrain imaging shows that testosterone therapy given as part of sex reassignment changes the brain structures and the pathway associated with speech and verbal fluency. \nThis result supports research that women in general may deal with speech and interaction differently than men. \nPrevious studies have shown that testosterone has a particular influence on verbal fluency. \nFor the new study, the researchers worked with 18 female-to-male subjects before and during testosterone treatment. \nThe subjects underwent MRI brain scans before and after four weeks of the testosterone administration. \nThe results showed that with testosterone treatment the volume of grey matter decreased in two specific regions of the brain which are mainly responsible for language processing. \nAt the same time, the neuronal pathway (white matter) connecting these two regions via the extreme capsule got stronger. \n\"This fits in well with our finding of decreased grey matter volume,\" added Dr Andreas Hahn from University of Vienna. \nHowever, the strengthening of the white matter in these areas was a surprise. \n\"We think that when it comes to certain language skills, the loss of grey matter outweighs the strengthened white matter connection,\" Dr Hahn explained. \nThis may have wider implications, for example in the way that men and women handle speech and interaction. \n\"In particular, female-to-male gender reassignment resulted in local brain matter decrease within language processing regions, which may explain why verbal abilities are often stronger in women,\" noted Dr Kamilla Miskowiak from Copenhagen University Hospital. \nThe research was shared at the annual meeting of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
