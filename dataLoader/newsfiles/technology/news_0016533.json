The Portégé Z20t is optimized for business users with a variety of productivity and security features plus the powerful new Intel Core M processor, which support both content creation and consumption with ease. With an optimised form factor and wide range of features for flexible business use, the Portégé Z20t is the ultimate companion for professionals. The integrated Wacom digitizer offers superb hand writing recognition so that users can take notes and draw diagrams quickly and clearly in meetings while it can be stored conveniently in a dedicated slot on the tablet to minimize the chances of losing it.\nDesigned as a laptop but equally impressive in tablet mode, the Portégé Z20t features a reversible dock enabling the tablet to be stowed backwards allowing use as a presentation device to a larger group of people. When docked the tablet benefits from the longer battery life and extra connectivity options on the keyboard. For convenience and ease of use, the tablet can be detached using one hand via the simple attach mechanism.\nThe Portégé Z20t also has a Full HD IPS touchscreen display enabling vibrant, clear detail with wide viewing angles in case multiple users want to view the content on screen. The display’s anti-glare feature is perfect for the business user by reducing reflections to allow for work under office lights or even outside. Functionality and productivity are further enhanced by the inclusion of a spill resistant backlit keyboard2 for working in dimly lit environments with an improved key design for easy and comfortable typing. Its Accupoint provides an alternative to the large ClickPad for increased accuracy.\nWhen used as a laptop, the battery life is up to an impressive 16 hours1 by combining the charge in both the tablet and keyboard – ideal for use on long haul flights or negates the need to re-charge at the end of every day. If used as a tablet, the battery life will provide a full working day’s use of up to 8 hours1. Weighing from just 730g and measuring only 8.8mm thin in tablet mode or from 1.51kg in laptop mode, the Portégé Z20t is also incredibly portable given the computing performance included.\nPerformance:\nPortégé Z20t is powered by Intel Core M processor which enables the optimal combination of battery life and business class performance in a single device. With the inclusion of these processors and Toshiba’s engineering, the Portégé Z20t is housed in a fanless chassis with a premium, black finish that operates silently. The Portégé Z20t includes an SSD of up to 256GB and up to 8GB of LPDDR3 memory for superb responsiveness and the ability to run multiple programs with ease. Together with Intel HD graphics, business users will be able to compute faster making it an exciting yet practical model for use in the office or on the move.\nThe Portégé Z20t offers a number of advanced features designed to keep a business’s critical data safe including Toshiba’s EasyGuard suite. Trusted Platform Module (TPM) safeguards the data on local storage, while Intel Active Management Technology3 (AMT) allows the IT department to monitor, maintain, repair, update and upgrade machines remotely. Each model has also passed several rigorous tests to meet Toshiba’s quality standards – including the HALT (Highly Accelerated Lifestyle Test) by independent German test institute, TÜV Rheinland such as drop testing up to 76 cm. A Cable lock port is available which secures the keyboard to desks or other fixed points and ensures the tablet can’t be detached either when docked.\nThe Portégé Z20t provides extensive options to connect to all the peripherals a business user might need regardless of how it is being used. In tablet mode, a micro HDMI port, micro USB port and microSD slot are included for connecting to additional screens and fast data transfers respectively. With the keyboard attached, users can make the most of additional connectivity and no need for adapters with a selection of full-size ports including RGB, HDMI, GBit LAN and 2x USB 3.0 ports.\nPortégé Z20t is priced at Rs 1,30,000 and will be available in India through B2B channel.\n latest Toshiba Also Read Rupee down 17 paise against dollar in early trade Swipe raises Rs 30 crore funding from Kalaari Capital Facebook rolls out 'bandwidth targeting' for advertisers Twitter to start tracking users' mobile apps", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://d2yhexj5rb8c94.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/toshiba_2_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://d2yhexj5rb8c94.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/toshiba_2_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccanchronicle.com/150904/technology-latest/article/toshiba-launches-detachable-ultrabook-reversible-dock", "http://d2yhexj5rb8c94.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/reverse.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://d2yhexj5rb8c94.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/pens.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-05T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T19:58:34.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
