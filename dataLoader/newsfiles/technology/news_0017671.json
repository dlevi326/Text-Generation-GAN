Regulators also wrongly calculated Panasonic’s liability, the court said.\nThe European Commission accused the companies in 2012 of colluding as customers switched to slimmer liquid-crystal and plasma display sets. It ordered companies including Royal Philips NV and LG Electronics Inc. to pay fines totaling 1.47 billion euros.\nPanasonic and Toshiba clinched additional reductions for collective fines for ventures levied in the same EU ruling from 2012. A joint fine levied on Panasonic, its unit MTPD and Toshiba was cut to 82.8 million euros from 86.7 million euros, and a joint fine for Panasonic and MTPD was reduced to 7.5 million euros from 7.9 million euros.\nPhilips, LG and Samsung SDI Co. lost their appeals in the case.\nEscaped Fine Philips said it disagrees with Wednesday’s decision and will continue to appeal its fines. Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. escaped a fine because it was the first to inform regulators of the cartel.\nThe commission, the EU’s antitrust authority, declined to immediately comment because it’s studying the rulings.\nThe cases are: T-82/13 Panasonic and MT Picture Display v. Commission; T-84/13 Samsung SDI and Others v. Commission; T-91/13 LG Electronics v. Commission; T-92/13 Philips v. Commission; T-104/13 Toshiba v.
