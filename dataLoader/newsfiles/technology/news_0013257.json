The Version 12 release completes the second phase of a multimillion dollar technology upgrade of the company's flagship product, an enterprise-class laboratory information management system designed for mission-critical laboratories. \n\"Version 11 marked the 20th anniversary edition of HORIZON, tracking the evolution of personal computers from the original UNIX-based 'green screen' interface through successive Windows and web browser upgrades,\" stated Pat McGinn, President, ChemWare. \"With HORIZON v12, the application server and presentation layer were re-engineered for optimum scalability and performance in both on premise and cloud/virtualized environments.\" \nHORIZON is available under the traditional perpetual use licensing model (on premise or hosted) or as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscription. The hosted and SaaS platforms are offered with a managed services option, enabling complete outsourcing of LIMS-related IT resources and infrastructure. \n\"Alongside the v12 architectural changes, the new .NET-based interface introduces a number of groundbreaking usability, customization, and data visualization enhancements,\" said Robert Whitehead, ChemWare's Vice President of Product Management. \"And despite the ground-up UI redesign, v11 users can expect to upgrade to v12 with no loss of functionality and little to no retraining.\" \nThe first phase of the technology upgrade, kicked off in 2013, launched several next-generation laboratory informatics products, including an electronic laboratory notebook (ELN), an instrument integration module, and new LIMS web portal. HORIZON Logbook Manager bridges the paperless laboratory gap by replacing clipboards, logbooks, and worksheets with their electronic counterparts. HORIZON Data Exchange replaced several proprietary tools with a single, technology-neutral solution that connects any LIMS with any instrument that produces text file output. The new web portal technology, LabOnline, also replaced a third-party platform with a user-customizable, non-proprietary interface. All three products are compatible with both the HORIZON v11 and v12 codebases. \nFor more information click here . \nAbout ChemWare \nSince 1987, ChemWare (www.chemware.com) has been providing mission-critical information management solutions for many of the world's most highly automated environmental and human health & safety laboratories.
