Here’s how to launch it:\nClick on the little circle (Search icon) next to the Start icon on the Taskbar and overtype “Ask me anything” with “pbrush,” and press ENTER.\nRegarding Pbrush (Paint), it is an image-editing app that has come with all versions of Windows. However, Pbrush in Win7 and Win10 turned out to be a surprisingly comprehensive program that is much improved over the “no frills” versions in WinXP and earlier versions.\nOther apps that can be launched by typing them into the Search line are “Notepad,” “Wordpad,” “msconfig” (Microsoft Configuration), “Calc” (calculator) and “sol” (Solitaire), which brings up a number of old and new PC video games.\nThe Calculator, by the way, is a cool tool with several modes, including Standard, Scientific and Programmer. It also has a Converter mode for changing things such as Miles to Kilometers, Fahrenheit to Centigrade and Pounds to Kilograms, along with several other often-done conversions.\nRegarding the “Wordpad” app, it’s a super-simplified version of Microsoft Word, and for those with simple word-processing needs, it can be reasonably adequate. Its main deficiency is the lack of a spell-checker. However, all email programs have built-in spell-checkers, as does Google Docs (my favorite alternative word-processing app).\nRegarding Google Docs, I highly recommend installing it and giving it a try. It’s absolutely free and can be easily uninstalled if you don’t like it.\n“Google Docs,” “Google Sheets” and “Google Slides” are compatible with Microsoft “Word,” “Excel” and “PowerPoint,” respectively, and are part of the office suite named “Google Drive.” \nThe suite also contains other tools, such as a “drawing” app and a “form-creation” app. \nAnyone who has a Gmail account automatically has a Google Drive available \n(drive.google.com ) with 15 gigs of storage space — all for free.\nThe main thing to know is that all this happens “online” via your Internet connection. Right now, for instance, I’m writing this column as a Google Doc. I’ll subsequently copy and paste it into an outgoing Gmail message.\nI launched Google Drive by clicking an icon on my Taskbar (that I’d put there during the installation process). On the opening page I clicked on NEW and then DOC.\nThis presented me with a blank word-processing page upon which I began to type. I never have to think about “saving” my work, since everything I enter is automatically saved as it’s typed.\nIf I want to see how many words I’ve typed, I press CTRL+SHIFT+C, which immediately displays my Word Count, along with some additional information.\nOnce I send the column to my editor at The San Diego Union-Tribune, a copy is automatically saved on Google’s mail servers (as is the case with all email services nowadays).\nContact Don Edrington at (949) 891-1731 or donedrington@gmail.com \n👤 Don Edrington More from Don Edrington What happened to ‘Paint’ after installing Win10?
