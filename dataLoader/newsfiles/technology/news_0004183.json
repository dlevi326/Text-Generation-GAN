KnownCircle will exhibit its social referral platform, KnownCircle.com, in Booth #103 at the event. \n\"While most insurance agents understand that referrals are their lifeblood, research has shown that the majority still lack a consistent digital referral strategy to help them grow their business,\" said Vinay Murthy, VP of Business Development for KnownCircle. \"Many agents are still using yesterday's tools to try to compete in today's marketplace. This is a mistake, since Millennials in particular rely on social media and mobile technologies to see what their friends and family purchase, and an increasing number of people are flocking online to shop for insurance. We're excited to participate in Big 'I' Day to help agents bridge this gap by leveraging the value of consumer referrals using KnownCircle's innovative social referral platform.\" \nKnownCircle's platform enables insurance agents and brokers to tap into the power of social media to rapidly build their referral business. Consumers can use their Facebook login to immediately see which of their friends have endorsed and referred agents in their area, helping them to decide which local agents are right for them. Agents can generate more leads year-round and track their referral success via the platform's robust analytics dashboard, which provides detailed insights on leads generated, referral sources, and trends. \nFeatures of KnownCircle include: Referral Automation: A comprehensive set of tools for referral automation that includes \"Refer Friends\" button that can be placed on an agent's website or email signature, as well as on an agency's profile page on KnownCircle.com. Gift Cards: Agents can now easily send gift cards to their clients for any occasion, or to show appreciation to those who send referrals. Agents have the ability to choose from multiple merchants, and can give gift cards in any amount. SEO/Mobile Ready: KnownCircle has added a number of optimizations to make it easy for search engines to find an agent's profile page. Agents can set up a personalized profile page in under five minutes. Customer Retention: Agents can use KnownCircle's \"Thank You\" e-cards to send personalized emails in dozens of designs to their customers. The platform offers integration with Gmail, Yahoo! and other services for contact management. \nKnownCircle was recently named one of the Top 20 companies with the most creative ideas in the insurance industry by LifeHealthPro magazine.
