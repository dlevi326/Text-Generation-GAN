These days, an interactive mobile app acts as an innovative addition to a conference. No matter if you are going to plan a trade show, an event or a conference, an iPad event app takes it to a whole new level and helps you make it a grand success. An efficiently designed mobile event app ensures the attendees are engaged with the event content through game mechanics and social features. How does an event app work?If you have designed a mobile app for a specific event, it presents the event guide through a mobile tablet or a smartphone. This eliminates the requirement of any kind of paper-based agendas. An event app interconnects all the social media channels like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. This gives the event planners an opportunity to gather instant and direct feedback from all the attendees. With the help of an event app, you can also connect with the attendees of other events and increase your network. There are certain mobile event apps which allow external linking, video integration, custom branding and social media integrations. How can you encourage the attendees to download the app?If you have created an online portal using which the attendees can register for the event, consider using that portal not only for getting the attendees registered, but also for promoting the app. Ask your guests to download the app right at the event and thus you can create a lot of hype and anticipation about it. Another interesting way to make the app popular among your attendees is to ask them to make event profile using the app, before the event starts. Explain how this can help them enhance their networking opportunities on the very date of the event. Use your mobile app to leverage the content that is available for the event - be it speaker bios, keynote speakers or agendas. Make sure the content remains accessible to the attendees before as well as after the event. What you can do during the event?Ensure the event is quite interesting and consider using different types of icebreakers to make it all the more catchy. Make sure all the attendees are involved in the event throughout the day. This makes them more willing to share feedback, content and ideas throughout the event. Consider using your event app as an icebreaker. Do something intense which compels all the attendees to pull out their tablets or smartphones. If they have not downloaded the app already, ask them to do the same and log in with any of their social media accounts. Request each of the people in the room to update something about the event or upload at least one tweet. This will make it easier for you to share the content during the event. The process of sharing content will also become more natural and relaxed for all the attendees during the event.
