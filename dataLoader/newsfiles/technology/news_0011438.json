Furthermore, by working together as one operation it has allowed us to deliver a number of very large projects, which no single site could have delivered alone. Therefore, with the need for extra capacity and to satisfy our strategy for growth, work has begun to create an RP facility in Bydgoszcz, Poland, where we already have a large toolmaking factory. \n“ARRK has ambitious plans for the future and closer ties with our European sister companies to deliver a comprehensive service to our customers will be key to our success. With this in mind, it was a simple decision to establish our new facility within one of ARRK’s tooling sites. Having a strong infrastructure in place and operating within ARRK systems and protocols it has given us a head start and we plan on being operational before the end of the year. The centre will provide additional resource to our existing offering, as well as being ideally located to succeed within the Polish & German markets. A lot of our larger customers have set up operations in Eastern Europe, and our location here shows that we are keen to support them”. \nOnce operational, the centre will be providing a Stereolithography and Vacuum Casting service initially, with SLS and Rapid CNC machining capability to follow shortly afterwards. The centre will be managed by Robert Dąbrowski. Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T22:43:58.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
