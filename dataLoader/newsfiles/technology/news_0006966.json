Experience the world’s first touch-sensitive wood interface and enjoy your new single point of entry to the world of music. \nPR Newswire – Deerfield, IL – September 2015 Bang & Olufsen’s BeoSound Moment is all about combining the limitless access to digital music with a new simplicity and playful creativity. BeoSound Moment makes it easy for the whole family to collect, discover and share your favorite music. The Perfect Match: Bang and Olufsen presents the BeoSound Moment Let the music flow: connect your new and classic Bang & Olufsen products wirelessly Go to all assets \nNavigating on wood The top of the new BeoSound Moment is a detachable and double-sided interface that allows for two different listening experiences. \nOne side is an elegant aluminium interface with a delicate touch screen for engaging interaction. This is where music lovers can browse the endless online music catalogue, their favorite playlists and share their music collection. \nThe wooden side is designed for one-touch access to exactly the sound experience that fits your daily rhythm. The beautiful panel of touch-sensitive oak allows you to have your favourite music flowing from your speakers with just one touch on the wooden wheel. \nIntelligent PatternPlay BeoSound Moment introduces a new, intelligent feature that adapts your listening patterns and suggests music or radio programmes that fit with the relevant day of the week and the time of day. The advanced PatternPlay feature automatically memorizes your musical preferences and makes your listening experience both familiar and explorative. \nOver time, BeoSound Moment will gradually start to know your taste in music, and be able to play what you most likely want to hear, without you even having to ask. Just like friendship, it only gets better with time. \nThe music presented by PatternPlay stems from your own preferred favorite artists and playlists plus an extensive online catalogue of music, with access to more than 35 million songs, supplied by leading global music streaming service Deezer. One touch and the music flows according to your personal preferences. You can activate PatternPlay directly, with one touch, on the elegant oak panel. \nThe intuitive MoodWheel The aluminium interface displays another new feature of BeoSound Moment, the innovative MoodWheel. Express your mood and BeoSound Moment will find the perfect sound track to match it. A single touch on the multi-coloured MoodWheel activates an automatically generated playlist defined by your finger’s position on the wheel. The closer to the centre of the wheel, the more familiar the music. In the very middle of the MoodWheel the music will be picked from your lists of favourites only, whereas the outer parameter of the circle tempts the listener with musical adventures of associated music from the vast online catalogue of songs. \nThe MoodWheel is divided into a color gamut that ranges from melancholic blue over a passionate red zone to an energetic yellow area. Combined, these two dimensions on the intuitive MoodWheel offer limitless possibilities for defining your selection of music. \nBeoSound Moment is compatible with the whole Bang & Olufsen range of wireless and wired quality speakers that will create an impressive sound experience in your home. \n“With BeoSound Moment we are bringing back one-touch access to music in a luxuriously simple manner.
