In either case, the detection of hydrated salts on these slopes means that water plays a vital role in the formation of these streaks,” said Lujendra Ojha of the Georgia Institute of Technology. \nMORE TO COME", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T19:06:25.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
