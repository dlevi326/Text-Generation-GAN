The next test, planned for 2016, will be the first time the lens will undergo a performance review in a human patient.\nNovartis entered into an agreement with Google in 2014 in order to work on two different smart contact lens technologies, one for presbyopia and one that can help people with diabetes track their blood glucose levels. All smart lens projects are handled under Alcon, Novartis’ eye care division.\nThe lenses use non-invasive sensors, microchips, and other miniaturized electronics embedded in the lenses in order to measure fluid in the eye (for glucose sensing) or to provide augmentation for the body’s natural autofocus.\nPlacing electronics in something as thin as a contact lens requires Google’s extensive expertise in miniaturized electronics, low-power chip design, and microfabrication. For their part, Alcon brings expertise in the physiology of the eye, as well as clinical development and evaluation of medical devices and commercialization.\nThe electronics are placed in a thin ring between two layers of soft contact lens material. Instead of using a fiberglass circuit board, the ring is made of a plastic-like film.\n\"This project is progressing well,\" Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez said , as Quote: d by the Swiss newspaper Le Temps. \"I had said it would take about five years to see a product on the market. The calendar is on track and we are already developing a technological lens prototype (that) should be tested on humans in 2016.\"\n\"We are looking forward to working with Google to bring together their advanced technology and our extensive knowledge of biology to meet unmet medical needs,\" Jimenez said at the onset of the project.", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/05/novartis-ceo-idUSL5N11B08Y20150905", "https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-license-google-smart-lens-technology"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T16:53:59.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
