I am clearing the way for this fresh start with my resignation.” \nWinterkorn, 68, resigned after a crisis meeting of the Volkswagen supervisory board’s executive committee. Its acting chairman, Berthold Huber, said company directors are “resolved to embark with determination on a credible new beginning.” \nHuber said a successor will be discussed at a board meeting Friday that originally was intended to approve extending Winterkorn’s contract through 2018. \nVW reversed its market slide, closing up 6.9 percent at 118.90 euros. But VW’s share price has a long way to go to recoup this week’s losses. \nNearly $28 billion was wiped out in the first two days of trading after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency revealed that VW has been violating the Clean Air Act and could be subject to fines of as much as $18 billion. \nWinterkorn, VW’s boss since 2007, had come under intense pressure since the EPA’s disclosure Friday that stealth software makes VW’s 2009-2015 model cars powered by 2.0-liter diesel engines run cleaner during emissions tests than in actual driving. \nThe EPA accused VW of installing the so-called “defeat device” in 482,000 cars sold in the U.S. VW later acknowledged that similar software exists in 11 million diesel cars worldwide and was setting aside 6.5 billion euros to cover the costs of the scandal.
