All she’ll need is a computer with an Internet connection.\nFirst, sign into the Gmail account and open the contacts. You’ll find the contacts in a small drop-down menu just above the “compose” button in the upper left corner.\nIn the Contacts window, choose the More button and choose Export.\nYou’ll have some choices about the export.\nYou can export a single contact, a group of contacts (if you have any of your contacts grouped) or all contacts.\nThen you choose the format of the exported file.\nTwo of the three choices are to export a comma-separated file, which would work for importing to another Gmail account or an Outlook account.\nThe last choice is a vCard format for Apple’s Address Book or iCloud.\nChoose to export all contacts in the vCard format and save the file to your computer.\nThen go to iCloud.com and sign in to your account. Choose the Contacts icon and then click on the gear icon in the lower left corner. Choose Import vCard and then navigate to the place on your computer where you saved the exported vCard file.\nClick OK and wait for the contact list to build.\nNow you’ve imported the Gmail contacts to iCloud.\nOpen the Settings on the iPad and choose iCloud. You may be asked for your iCloud password.\nTouch the switch to enable iCloud contacts (it will turn green). Hit the Home button and launch the Contacts app on the iPad.\nYour newly imported contacts should be ready for use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T14:57:56.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
