Is the watch maker Pebble trying to run circles around Apple Inc. and its Apple Watch?\nThe company is launching a new model with a round face that Chief Executive Eric Migicovsky is pitching in a way that is a clear dig at the Apple Watch. It’s “not like having a smart phone on your wrist,” he says in a promotional video and blog .\nThe watch, as shown below, is thinner, lighter and sleeker than Pebble’s earlier models.\n“Pebble Time Round is the perfect companion for those who like their wearable tech a bit more incognito,” said Migicovsky.\nPebble was the first company to bring what’s become known as a smartwatch to market in 2013 after breaking a record by raising more than $10 million on the funding site Kickstarter. In its second funding round, it raised more than $20 million from 78,471 backers.\nWhile the launch of the Apple Watch AAPL, +0.06% has been expected to expand the overall market for wearables, it has also provided stiff competition for Pebble and other rivals. Industry tracker IDC forecasts a near tripling in wearable-device shipments to 76.1 million units from 28.9 million in 2014. But the Apple Watch currently has the biggest market share among smart wearables at 58.3%, according to IDC, followed by Google Inc.’s GOOGL, -0.40% Android Wear at 17.4% and Pebble at just 8.7%.\nThe new Pebble Time Round watches will begin shipping in November but are already available for preorder at a price of $249.99.

Just use your cursor to see more data:\nOne big difference between the new watch and Pebble’s other models—the Pebble, Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel—is battery life. The Pebble Time Round has an average battery life of just two days, compared with the average 7- to 10-day battery life of the earlier models. The next chart allows you to compare all four models and their individual specifications:\nThe next chart provides a direct comparison of Pebble Steel and Apple Watch Sport. The former comes with an average battery life of seven days, compared with the Apple Watch Sport’s one-day span.
