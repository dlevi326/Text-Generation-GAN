Of those 42 had orthostatic hypotension, which is defined as a drop in blood pressure within three minutes of sitting or standing – it can cause people to feel dizzy, faint, or light-headed after standing. Sometimes these symptoms can be a minor problem caused by dehydration or medication use, but when it happens often it can be a sign of the more serious condition. \nOf the people reviewed, 48 were diagnosed with delayed orthostatic hypotension, while 75 did not have either condition. The average age of participants was 59 years. \n“Our study looked at delayed orthostatic hypotension, when the drop in blood pressure happens more than three minutes after standing or sitting up,” said Gibbons. “Our findings suggest that more than half of people with the delayed form of this condition will go on to develop the more serious form of this disease. This is also the first study to date suggesting the disease is a milder form of the more common and serious disorder.” \nThe findings had implications for an increased risk of death. Over the 10-year span, the rate of death was 64 percent for people with orthostatic hypotension, 29 percent for those with delayed orthostatic hypotension and 9 percent in those without either condition. People who had the delayed condition that progressed to the more serious orthostatic hypotension saw a death rate of 50 percent. \nMore than half (54 percent) of participants with the delayed form of the condition, progressed to orthostatic hypotension, and 31 percent developed a degenerative brain disease such as dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson’s disease. \nParticipants who had the delayed form were also more likely to develop the full condition if they had diabetes at the beginning of the study. Medications that could affect blood pressure, such as diuretics, and antidepressants, were being taken by many of the people whose condition did not progress to the full condition. \nGibbons said that results might not reflect the overall community, as participants were all referred to a specialized center for tests of the autonomic nervous system. He also noted the study’s limitations as a retrospective review of data collected earlier. \n“Our findings may lead to earlier recognition, diagnosis and treatments of this condition and possibly other underlying diseases that may contribute to early death,” Gibbons said.
