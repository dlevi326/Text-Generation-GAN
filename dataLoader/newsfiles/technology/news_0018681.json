TTR subscribers in the technology industry asked TTR for assistance in determining how to tax cloud computing software and services. In response, TTR researched the taxability of cloud computing software and services across all states and added thousands of tax answers and explanations to its Cloud Computing Library.\nGenerally, SaaS, also known as application service provider or “ASP” software, is a transaction in which a purchaser pays to access and use software over the Internet but does not download the software on their computer or other device. IaaS is a transaction in which a purchaser pays to access computer servers, storage, processing capacity, networks, and/or operating systems, but does not manage or control those systems. PaaS and aPaaS are transactions in which a purchaser pays to use development software (i.e., software used to create software programs) over the Internet, along with the servers and/or other computing infrastructure on which the development software runs.\n“The taxability of cloud computing software and services is still an evolving area,” said Patrick Smith, Executive Vice President at TTR. “The manner in which states approach this issue, and the variation in approaches and answers has, understandably, led to confusion among taxpayers. By using TTR, subscribers now have the ability to immediately obtain answers, saving hundreds of hours of valuable research time.”\nTTR is pleased to provide this content to its subscribers in the technology industry.\nAbout TTR\nTransaction (buying or selling things), Tax (the tax on this activity), Resources (our people, our website, our support services) - TTR, Inc.\nTTR has a website that companies subscribe to and use daily.
