The combined solution will provide customers of both companies the ability to centrally monitor and track trailers in TruckMate to gain real-time operations information, location and cargo status for improved utilization and security. \n“SkyBitz has been a strategic partner for years, offering our shared customers innovative solutions for increased fleet visibility and actionable information,” said Ray West, SVP and General Manager of TruckMate, Innovative and TL2000® Software, TMW Systems. “With the recent additions to the SkyBitz integration with TruckMate, customers gain the fleet visibility they need to quickly find available trailers to assign with the next load and can turn their trailers faster.” \nThe integration uses industry-leading asset management services from SkyBitz delivering trailer specific information directly to TruckMate, driving faster, better-informed decisions and improved asset utilization. Moreover, the integration will help fleets reclaim unused capacity in the fleet, thereby reducing capital expenses and operational costs. This is the latest step in SkyBitz’s overall integration efforts with TMW Systems, adding to its existing software integrations with that company’s TMWSuite® and Innovative TMS applications and its fleet maintenance management system, TMT Fleet Maintenance-SQL. \nThe latest integration of SkyBitz and TruckMate allows fleet operators to: View accurate trailer and cargo status to quickly determine if the trailer is loaded or empty, hooked or unhooked, in-motion or stationary. Also, at-a-glance, know the trailer’s power status and mileage. Search for and identify the nearest idle trailers to an accurate location. Perform yard checks. \n“The key to a successful relationship is providing solutions that help solve joint customers’ needs. TMW Systems shares our vision and it is why year after year we’ve deepened our cooperation and integrations,” said Henry Popplewell, Senior Vice President and General Manager, SkyBitz. “The ability to quickly find accurate trailer information not only greatly improves our customers’ efficiency but also helps them to improve satisfaction with their drivers and customers.” \nThe integrated trailer tracking and monitoring capability is now available with the most recent version of TruckMate. Details on the integration capabilities will be available at the SkyBitz exhibit booth #105 at TransForum 2015, the TMW Systems User Conference, September 13-16 in Orlando, FL. \nFor more information on SkyBitz Transportation Management Systems integrations, visit: www.skybitz.com/WebServices/TMSIntegrations . \nThe use of referenced integrations or interfaces with TMW software may require the purchase of additional software licenses and professional services from TMW Systems.
