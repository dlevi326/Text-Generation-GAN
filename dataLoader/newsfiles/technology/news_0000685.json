Cyber is a great risk,\" Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., told  . (Wikimedia Commons) Lawmaker bucks conservatives on cyberlegislation More \nAt least one conservative member of the House favors cybersecurity legislation that opponents fear would be too invasive of privacy. \n\"I think it's a good balance because this is the new battlefield that we're on. Cyber is a great risk,\" Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., told   . He was attending the Conversations with Conservatives event, run by the Heritage Foundation, on Wednesday. \"What I liked about the cybersecurity bill is that it let the private sector do what the private sector does, but it creates a community of sharing between the industry and government.\" \nExperts, he said, have given the U.S. a grade of \"D-\" in the area of cybersecurity. \"This is the United States of America,\" Loudermilk added. \"We've got to make some drastic changes in that direction. I really hope that we can do something.\" \nThe legislation, which is opposed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other groups that support privacy rights, would provide cover for telecommunications companies willing to share metadata with the federal government. That information is collected by the National Security Agency, but its statutory power to do so will expire in November. More from   â€¢ 09/09/15 5:02 PM \nBusiness groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and Financial Services Roundtable support the legislation. While there is nothing to stop companies from sharing information with the government as the law stands, the bill would enhance their protection from lawsuits. \nThe support from Loudermilk is notable due to his conservative credentials, and the fact he also holds a degree in information system technology and worked for decades in the industry. The legislation has been championed in the Senate by California Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, as well as John McCain, R-Ariz. \nThe legislation is expected to come before the Senate again in September or October. It was proposed this year, but Congress adjourned in August without taking action. When the legislation returns, senators will consider 22 amendments to it, most of which aim to broaden privacy protections. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has been mum on when it may be brought up for consideration. \nEven if senators manage to pass the legislation, its fate in the more conservative House will be less certain. Conservatives in that chamber are especially disgruntled with the direction of the legislative agenda, which means that the bill may not be brought up at all. \n\"Whether it goes forward, I don't know,\" Loudermilk said.
