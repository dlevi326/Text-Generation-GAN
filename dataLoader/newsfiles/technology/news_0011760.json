Verizon Enterprise Solutions today unveiled its Advanced Network Retainer (ANR) program aimed at helping clients keep up with expanding network demand driven by digital transformation. The new retainer program offers rapid access to a range of networking experts who can provide assistance tailored to meet individual client requirements. Verizon experts work with clients to better understand the client's network, identify and upgrade obsolete components, run assessments to fine-tune performance, make recommendations and create a forward-thinking strategy and roadmap that will help drive competitive advantage. The team also can provide hands-on implementation activities backed up by project management. Client engagements typically begin with Verizon's Business Outcome Advancement Workshop that's hosted for cross-functional leaders within a business. The workshop is designed to clarify and align business and technology vision with a broad spectrum of stakeholders. Industry experts estimate that average enterprise bandwidth demands will grow by nearly 30 percent annually, yet IT budgets remain nearly constant. \"Our clients are finding that their networks need to move, change and adapt to ensure their business objectives are met,\" said Tony Turni , vice president, IT Consulting Services for Verizon Enterprise Solutions. \"In order to keep up with customer demand and deliver an outstanding customer experience, enterprises are learning that it always comes back to the network.\" In fact, according to Verizon's report \"Digital Transformation Powers Your Business,\" 67 percent of organizations say that legacy network infrastructure is a bottleneck in enterprise IT. Verizon's ANR is ideal for organizations affected by mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, down-sizing and the need to expand to a global infrastructure. It is also well suited for companies whose business strategies are evolving due to an intensifying competitive climate; increasing regulatory compliance mandates and organizational restructuring.
