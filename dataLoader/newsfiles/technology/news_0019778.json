We do expect that they will make a rational decision that takes into consideration the long-term future of the [league]. The constitution says if you are 35 years of age you cannot stand because your membership of the [league] lapses,” said Gigaba on the sidelines of the Congress at Gallagher Estate in Midrand.\n“Delegates are ultimate determinants with what will happen in regards to the leadership election ...
