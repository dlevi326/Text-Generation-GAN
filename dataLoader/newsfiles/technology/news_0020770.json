Manny Vivar , CEO and vice president of global operations for Orlando-based data center company HostDime , on Tuesday talked more about his plans to create an \"iconic data center and headquarters\" in Altamonte Springs. \"Its a lot more than just a HostDime building,\" Vivar told Orlando Business Journal in an interview at the company's current headquarters in Research Park. \"It will actually be 80 percent data center and 20 percent headquarters space.\" HostDime's new seven-story, 85,000-square-foot facility will cost about $25 million. And while a general contractor has not been chosen yet — the groundbreaking for the facility is planned before the end of the year — Orlando-based architecture firm Baker Barrios designed the building. Vivar said the design takes ideas from many well-known structures in Orlando such as the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts and the Amway Center . The building, which has a completion date of 2017 , will span 4 acres and will be located at 450 Center Point Circle — right next to the Majesty Tower — also known as the \"I-4 Eyesore\" to residents and commuters due to its lengthy building process. Vivar said he initially wanted the building in downtown Orlando, but the area lacked the space need for a building of its size. Vivar said the first four floors will be dedicated to data center space, while the rest will house HostDime.com Inc.'s 250 employees. But the center will also feature a sports complex with a basketball court, volleyball court and futsal court. Futsal is a modified version of soccer that is popular in Brazil. The building will also have top-floor meeting space for other local companies to hold meet-ups or other corporate gatherings. \nGet Orlando  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:10:06.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
