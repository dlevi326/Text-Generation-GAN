You can download the full report here (PDF, opt-in, 17 pp.).Bluewolf’s annual report surveyed more than 1,500 Salesforce customers. The respondents were employees of very large enterprises (more than 1,000 employees), large enterprises (up to 1,000 employees), and medium to small enterprises (fewer than 500 employees). The study was conducted via online survey in the second and third quarters of 2015. Please see page 30 for study demographics and more details on the methodology.Key take-aways from the report include the following: 64% of Salesforce customers plan to increase their Salesforce budgets in the coming year; 11% plan to increase spending by more than 50%. Sales Cloud leads budget projections at 53% to 44%, with Service Cloud budget projections ranging from 44% to 52%. Of all categories, Analytics/Cloud Wave is expected to grow the fastest in the next year. Improving the user experience of apps used by sales (90%) and increasing the use of predictive analytics (81%) are two of the most important sales strategies planned today. Improving the sales reps’ user experience on mobile devices is the third-most mentioned sales strategy Salesforce customers are pursuing this and next year. 79% are concentrating on the area of enhancing sales reps’ productivity on mobile devices. 61% of customers interviewed say that Salesforce is difficult to access through mobile today. 68% of companies will increase their investments in analytics in the coming year. The study also found that 6% have implemented Analytics Cloud, and 14% are planning to implement in the next twelve months. Accessing different types of data (30%), poor or inconsistent quality data (28%) and reconciling data from different sources (18%) are the top three barriers to gaining greater insights. Despite the high levels of investment in analytics, Salesforce customers are hindered from getting the most value from their data. The following graphic illustrates the barriers faced in deriving greater insights from Salesforce data. One-third of companies named an employee-facing initiative as one of their top three objectives in 2016. One of the most significant findings of this year’s study is how critical employee-facing initiatives are to Salesforce customers. In conversations with Salesforce partners’ senior management teams, all are focused on how to improve app adoption this year. The study’s results accurately reflect how Salesforces’ partners are already addressing employee-facing initiatives and doing their best to increase adoption. 94% of high-achieving marketers are concentrating on integrating data and driving visibility across sales, marketing and service. The study found that the stronger the data governance of a marketing department, the more effective and targeted marketing strategies are. In addition, 93% of marketing teams have set the goal of integrating disparate marketing applications to gain a complete view of the customer. 75% are focused on strengthening their partnership with IT to promote system governance and ongoing innovation. Customers continued to rely on the AppExchange, with the number of companies using five or more apps nearly doubling over the past year. 36% of Salesforce customers have 6 or more apps today, and 14% of them have over 10 installed. The following table provides insights into which app areas are on fire, hot, growing and steady.
