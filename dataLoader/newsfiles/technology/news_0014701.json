Included with ClickBid's mobile bidding software ( which can now be purchased online for $500US ), this feature allows U.S. ClickBid customers to accept donations starting with a text message. \nThe donation process starts by sending a text message with an amount. A link is sent to the donor where they can pay securely online. ClickBid Credit Processing can be used to settle the transactions, or the organization may add on the ability to use their own Authorize.net or Diamond Mind account. The process takes less than 2 minutes. \nOrganizations and schools can now share with their supporters just how easy it is to give. The phrase \"Text <our keyword> to <this number> to give!\" can be included in emails, newsletters, blog posts and social media posts. \n\"Schools and nonprofits stand to benefit tremendously - beyond the annual gala or outing,\" said Matt Burnell , Founder/CEO of ClickBid. \"Organizations are searching for ways to engage donors with minimal effort on the donor's part. Text to Give functionality can greatly improve donor response for gala events, annual fund campaigns, golf outings and alumni fundraising competitions.\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzZhKAW7NRA \nFounded in Norton Shores, Michigan in 2002, ClickBid was the first alternative to paper silent auction bidding. With 13 years' experience in paperless auction software, ClickBid's mobile bidding helps nonprofits, schools, and other causes enhance fundraising events by reducing their workload and raising more money. Auction guests use any internet capable device, including smartphones and tablets, to bid on auction items, thereby allowing them to spend more time socializing instead of hovering over bid sheets. Text alerts encourage more competitive bidding, and ClickBid software ensures fast, secure checkout. Organizations pay one flat fee rather than a portion of proceeds, and on-site support is always available.
