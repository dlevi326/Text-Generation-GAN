The partnership is part of a Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Commitment to Action. The “Genesis Light”– a brand new technology from Lighting Science, a global leader in LED technology – is a desktop light that monitors and reports air quality using a sensor chip embedded in the lamp. Lighting Science and Public Advocate James will introduce the free prototype to numerous New York City nail salons beginning in January 2016. This Smart News Release features multimedia.

We know that New Yorkers care about safety, and this technology will help thousands make the informed decisions they seek.” \nThe Genesis Light is a 24-hour lamp that monitors air quality that impacts health. It communicates with a remote dashboard and mobile devices through an app designed by Lighting Science. The unit feeds information back to an online dashboard where health officials can monitor air quality from participating salons. Salons managers can monitor air quality through an LED indicator on the Genesis Light or with smart devices fitted with the Lighting Science app. A simple graphic shows a positive emoticon for clean air and a negative emoticon when hazardous air quality conditions exist. The alert is based on the presence of key indicators like total volatile organic compounds (VOCs – including alcohols, aldehydes, amines, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones and organic acids). These indicators will be reported to and archived on a central dashboard accessible to health officials. In the future it is hoped this information will also be available to the public. \n“Pegasus aims to do well for our investors by investing in the health and wellness of people and our planet,” says Pegasus Chairman and President Craig Cogut. “This partnership allows us to activate the technologies and solutions at our disposal to try and create a safer and healthier environment for New Yorkers. We are thrilled to be working with the Public Advocate’s office, and share Public Advocate James’ ambitions to better the lives of nail technicians and their customers by improving the salon environment itself. Furthermore, we applaud the pension system of the City of New York for investing in such a transformative company like Lighting Science\" \n\"Lighting Science is at the forefront of creating solid-state, LED-based health solutions for the 21st Century,\" says Chief Scientist and Founder Fred Maxik . \"We are now using light to sterilize and heal wounds, correct vision, and even detect disease. Amazingly, we can keep people more alert, safe, and productive during work hours while also helping them get to sleep faster at night. Our new, revolutionary light engine — code named the Genesis Light — is an extension of our biological lighting series, which not only brings a full spectrum of health and wellness benefits, but can also monitor VOC levels and connect to smart technology in the home and workplace. By harnessing the power of light we are utilizing an organic resource, the oldest in the book, to solve the problems of the modern world.” \nFor this pilot program, Public Advocate James and her partners will identify a number of nail salons that will receive a free Genesis Light. The goal of the program is to inspire customers and regulators to make informed decisions that will ultimately incentivize a growing number of nail salons to better manage their air quality. \nIn September 2014, Public Advocate James released a report detailing hazardous health conditions in New York City nail salons. Her report revealed that popular chemicals – including formaldehyde - used in many nail salons have shown to be toxic and harmful to human health – causing an array of effects, from headaches and eye and lung irritation, to liver and kidney damage and birth defects. Public Advocate James has also introduced the “Nail Salon Health and Safety Bill” in the New York City Council, which will create an enforceable framework to improve the health and safety of nail salon employees and customers in New York City. \nNail salons interested in participating in the pilot program should contact: outreach@pubadvocate.nyc.gov \nAbout Pegasus Capital Advisors \nPegasus Capital Advisors, L.P. is a private equity fund manager that has been providing creative capital and strategic solutions to companies across a variety of industries since 1996.
