The 11 metre electric vessel will have a 195 kWh ESS consisting of 30 Corvus AT6500 lithium polymer battery modules. \nThe fishing boat, designed to operate entirely on Corvus battery power over a planned ten hour working day, will also have a small 50kW auxiliary generator and can be charged overnight by plugging into the electrical grid. \nNorwegian fishing company Ora AS will operate the first Selfa Elmax 1099 designed by Norwegian shipbuilder Selfa Arctic AS. The electric vessel to be named \"Karoline\" will be commissioned in Trondheim Norway this August and will be presented to the country's Minister of Fisheries, Elisabeth Aspaker, in the same month. \nThe Karoline will then be tested in the demanding conditions off the coast of Tjeldsundet in Northern Norway. In September, the boat will be moved to Tromso Norway to be part of the daily operations of Ora AS. While fishing the vessel will operate emissions free, eliminating all greenhouse gasses including CO2. The boat will also generate less noise and vibration than a standard diesel engine powered fishing vessel. \n\"We have been working on this electric boat design for some time and Corvus batteries are part of the design solution. Their innovative battery technology enables the vessel to meet the needed performance specifications, that is, to operate electrically for a full fishing day.\"Said Erik Ianssen, Selfa Arctic AS President and CEO. \"With successful sea trials completed we are planning serial production of the vessel.\" \n\"Siemens is an industry leader in the development of environmentally friendly propulsion technologies. For smaller vessels such as the Selfa Elmax, we have developed BlueDrive PlusC, an extremely flexible, compact and high-capacity electric hybrid propulsion system which is designed to provide maximum efficiency. When integrated with a Corvus lithium ESS we can nearly eliminate all emissions making for one of the greenest fishing boats on the water today\" Said Ole Johan Hungnes, Sales Manager, Siemens Marine. \n\"We are very pleased to be part of this new and exciting development in fishing vessel design. Our 'marine-hardened' battery technology is a good fit for the groundbreaking electric drive Selfa Elmax.\" Said Andrew Morden President and CEO, Corvus Energy. \nCorvus Energy makes the only lithium ion ESS Type-Approved by Lloyds, DNV and ABS. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:44:11.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
