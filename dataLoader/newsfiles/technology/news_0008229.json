It's a new role established this year to help other teachers navigate new technology. \n\"They need the tools; they need to know how to use it, in order to utilise beauty of tech in the classroom,\" says Mr Laurenson. \nAccording to the new report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), more schools need to follow Albany High School's advice. \nIt shows that New Zealand has the second highest number of school computers per student - well above the OECD average. \nBut it doesn't correlate to student achievement. In a 2012 report from the OECD, our performance in science, reading and maths had plummeted. \nSo is technology helping? \n\"I don't think they're saying throw out the technologyâ€¦just saying [it's] not good enough,\" says Mr Laurenson. \nLaurence Zwimpfer is from the 2020 Trust, which works for digital inclusion in schools \nHe says it's not just up to teachers to make technology effective. \n\"Parents need to take some responsibility here as well, and we need them to be able to engage with our kids' learning and support their learning,\" says Mr Zwimpfer. \nThe Government has spent about $700 million over the past six years connecting schools to the internet. \nEducation Minister Hekia Parata says it's worth it. \n\"The real key is that this is a tool; it's not a magic bullet. We have to make sure teaching and learning and practice goes along with it is also present.\" \nEducation experts also say once we start using technology to its full potential the results will show. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:52:18.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
