Renesas is also developing a product that supports 760MHz, the ITS frequency in Japan, planning to announce it in a different occasion. \nRenesas will start to ship samples Oct 1, 2015, at a price of Â¥3,000 (approx US$25, excluding tax) per unit. The company will begin volume production in December 2016, planning to ship 50,000 units per month in December 2018. \nThis time, by using its own RF system design technique to reduce noise generated from the integrated circuit as well as a filter outside the chip, Renesas reduced out-of-transmission-band noise to -65dBm or lower for the first time in the world, the company said. \nAs a result, the R-Car W2R is the world's first product that complies with the out-of-transmission-band noise standard set by ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute), a Europe-based standardization body. \n\"In Europe, the ETC frequency is close to the V2X frequency,\" Renesas said. \"Therefore, no one could meet the ETSI standard.\" \nThe power supply voltage of the R-Car W2R is 3.3V (external I/O) and 1.2V (internal core). Its interface to a host is SDIO, and its memory interface is I 2 C. Its package is a 176-ball FPBGA measuring 10 x 10mm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:52:16.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
