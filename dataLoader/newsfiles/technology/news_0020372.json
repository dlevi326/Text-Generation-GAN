Credit: Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant photo/Irene Miles \nA project involving Purdue University led to the launch of a Lake Michigan nearshore buoy that will provide boaters and beachgoers with more real-time data on lake conditions. \nThe environmental-sensing buoy, about four miles off the coast of Wilmette, Illinois, will relay information on wind speed, air and water temperature, wave height and direction, and other environmental characteristics from May to October each year. \nThe TIDAS 900 Wilmette buoy, launched in August, is a collaboration between Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant, LimnoTech and Purdue. It was made possible with grant money awarded to Tomas Höök, an associate professor in Purdue's Department of Forestry and Natural Resources and Sea Grant's associate director of research. \nThe buoy is meant to help advance understanding of nearshore waters, alert the public to hazardous conditions in real time and improve weather forecasts. It is equipped with a webcam that enables people to see the conditions on the lake. \n\"This is a tremendous leap forward,\" said Ed Fenelon, a National Weather Service meteorologist with the Chicago office. Before this buoy, data near Chicago were limited to beach areas, very close to shore. \nData from a buoy launched in 2012 off the coast of Michigan City, Indiana, has led to adjustments in wave forecast models and boosted understanding of fisheries and nearshore dynamics. \nData from the Wilmette buoy will also be used to improve predictions of hazardous weather conditions and issue swim and small-water craft advisories. \n\"To accurately forecast the future, you have to have a detailed measurement of current conditions,\" Fenelon said. \"This buoy will give us just that.\" \nCurrent lake conditions will be updated every 10 minutes and be available at Sea Grant's Wilmette Buoy page. Photos and video footage is available at the LimnoTech Webcam Gallery. The mobile-friendly sites highlight conditions of particular interest to recreational users, such as wave height, wind speed and surface water temperature . \nAlong with graphs showing trends over recent periods, the information will tell boaters and kayakers when it's safe to be on the water and help anglers target specific species. 14 hours ago 4 New PacIOOS wave buoy deployed in waters off Hawai'i Island March 13, 2012 \nOn March 4, 2012, Captain Roger Antonio navigated his 35-foot Force, China Girl, in waters off of Hawaii Island to deploy a new Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System (PacIOOS) Datawell Mark II Waverider Buoy. ... Everyone knows it's windy . . . May 25, 2012 \n... And now they have the data to prove it. The middle of Lake Michigan is a vast, untapped reservoir of wind energy. The next step will be to find out if it can be harvested economically without harming the environment. Environmentally friendly methods for controlling algae in lakes and reservoirs May 28, 2014 \nThe growth of blue-green algae in our lakes, large ponds, water reservoirs and public waters constitutes a problem for our environment and for our health. These types of algae often result in a deterioration of the water ... PacIOOS wave buoy in Majuro helps keep islanders safe July 16, 2014 \nIf the ocean swell is too high, the safety of fishermen transiting out of the lagoon to open waters is threatened, homes and businesses may be flooded with seawater, roadways may become impassable, and even the runway strip ... Experimental wave-power buoy survives winter in Monterey Bay February 10, 2015 \nIn early January 2015, a team of MBARI engineers, led by Andy Hamilton, set out to sea to recover an experimental buoy that creates electrical energy from ocean waves. This power buoy had been deployed six miles southwest ... Ocean surface currents now being measured in near real-time off Hilo June 22, 2015 \nA new data set of the direction and speed of ocean surface currents in Hilo Bay is now available online. The hourly data updates are accessible to the public and free of charge on \"Voyager,\" the interactive mapping platform ...
