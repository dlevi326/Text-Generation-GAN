As consumer sentiment improves, consumers will continue purchasing industry products, parts, and accessories.\"\n“Motorcycles are the transportation of choice for many because it provides a more convenient way of getting in and out of traffic,” says Cattya Bella, Director of Product Development for World Patent Marketing. “Choosing a motorcycle as a means of transportation definitely has its benefits but it also comes with some downsides. Motorcycle parts are more exposed to the elements, thus making it more prone to damage. Certain parts such as the exhaust pipes tend to acquire scratches and burn stains known as bluing. This happens due to its constant exposure to high temperatures. Bluing stains can be quite difficult to remove, but our automotive invention, Rid a Blue, offers a quicker and more efficient cleaning solution.”\nRid a Blue is a new and improved way of cleaning motorcycle exhaust pipes and removing bluing stains. The common cleaning process used by many requires a lot of elbow grease and a significant amount of time. Even after slaving away during the cleaning process, there is still no guarantee that the bluing stains will be eliminated. This automotive invention makes use of special products which shorten the exhaust pipes-cleaning process. With Rid a Blue, bluing is effectively removed without too much fuss.\n“People who own motorcycles know how tedious it can be to maintain it and cleaning off stains is one of the most common problems,” says Neil S., inventor of Rid a Blue. “This automotive invention is a cleaning method which provides motorcycle owners a faster and more efficient way of dealing with bluing in exhaust pipes. With just a few simple steps discoloration is eliminated!”\nLoren Richards, a mechanic and motorcycle enthusiast from San Bernardino, CA, has this to say about Rid a Blue: “This automotive invention specializes in removing bluing in motorcycle pipes. It consists of a detergent oil, white diamond Polish, an anti-oxidizer chemical and a piece of rag. The detergent oil will provide a quicker way of cleaning when used on newer motorcycle pipes. Most cleaning products will require a certain amount of rubbing which can take time and a whole lot of effort. The best part is that this automotive invention requires no rubbing.”\nRid a Blue is the fastest and most effective solution to bluing in motorcycles. Using this invention will extend the life of motorcycles and help maintain a shiny and new appearance.\nAbout World Patent Marketing\nWorld Patent Marketing is a vertically integrated manufacturer and engineer of patented products.
