The LNGreen joint industry project brought together DNV GL, GTT, Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) and GasLog. The vessel concept is designed to deliver an improved environmental footprint, a higher level of energy efficiency, as well as an improved boil-off rate and cargo capacity, making it much better suited to future trading patterns than existing vessels.\nLNGreen investigated the improvement of efficiency and performance of LNG carriers by considering actual operational conditions and optimization in terms of hydrodynamics, machinery and system configuration. These developments were based on DNV GL's integrated systems engineering approach COSSMOS, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations, and a containment system design, tailored to a specific operational profile and anticipated trades.\nHHI and DNV GL carried out the hydrodynamic performance evaluation by comparing CFD simulations. Different CFD codes were applied for the comparison of resistance and self-propulsion performance but different scale effects were also considered.\nCargo containment optimization was investigated by GTT and HHI. The tank shape, necessary reinforcements and boil off rate calculations, were examined to develop alternative cargo tank designs that could yield additional cargo capacity. With a starting design point of 174,000 cu. m. cargo capacity, cargo tank optimization by GTT and HHI allowed for a cargo capacity increase to 182,800 cu. m., while maintaining the same main dimensions (length overall, breadth, draft) and taking into consideration newly introduced regulations and compatibility restrictions.\n(As published in the August 2015 edition of Maritime Reporter & Engineering News - http://magazines.marinelink.com/Magazines/MaritimeReporter )", "external_links": ["http://magazines.marinelink.com/Magazines/MaritimeReporter"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:06:18.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
