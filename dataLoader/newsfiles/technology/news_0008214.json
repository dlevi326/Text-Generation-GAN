Photo: Glenn Hunt\nA crappy copper phone line might not be the only reason why your broadband runs like it's filtered through a dead dog.\nFor all the promises of the new-look NBN, many of us are stuck on crappy ADSL broadband for a few years yet. Sure ADSL2+ offers maximum download speeds of around 20 Mbps, but only if you live next door to the telephone exchange. The further away you get the worse it gets, especially if the copper line is flaky.\nIf your telephone exchange is at the other end of your suburb, you might be lucky to get a reliable 3 Mbps via DSL. If there's water in the cable pits you could lose your connection for days at a time when it rains – you can see the appalling state of the copper network which Telstra is handing over to the NBN .\nEven then you should consider yourself fortunate, there are some metro homes that can't get any form of fixed-line broadband thanks to the haphazard nature of our communications rollout.\nAdvertisement When I moved house a few years ago I was reluctantly forced to leave behind Optus HFC cable and make the switch to DSL. At first I was getting line sync speeds of 6 Mbps via ADSL2+ at the new house but it's slowly dropped over time. Recently I've only been able to get a steady 2.7 Mbps. I managed to bump this up by tweaking my DSL profile but the connection wasn't stable so I had to wind it back to a very conservative DSL profile.\nI started out with a Billion DSL modem but later upgraded to a FritzBox 7390, which has been reliable until the last few months. It would perform flawlessly for weeks but then crash several times a day, requiring a regular reboot. Then it would come good again for no apparent reason.\nThe intermittent nature of the fault had me convinced that the problem lay with the phone line, but one day I held off on rebooting the crashed modem and rang my ISP's tech support desk. From their end they could still see the modem up and running, even though it was unresponsive on my end. Clearly some of the blame lay with the modem, not just the phone line, so I swapped it out for a newer FritzBox 7490.\nThe crashes appear to have stopped, plus I've seen a significant speed boost from the new FritzBox. On the same conservative DSL profile I can get a reliable 4 Mbps rather than 2.7 Mbps. Switching to the standard DSL profile now has me on a solid 5 Mbps – a connection my old modem couldn't maintain.\nIt doesn't sound like much to get excited about, I'm still clearly at the mercy of a long and questionable copper line, but I've almost doubled my download speeds and you can feel the difference. It's still a long way from the 100 Mbps my neighbour gets on HFC cable, but unfortunately that's the luck of the draw in this country. Eventually I'll end up on HFC cable alongside my neighbour, we'll never see fibre in out street even though they have it in the next suburb.\nIf you suspect that your modem could be partly to blame for your DSL woes, it's worth swapping it out to see the difference. Talk to your ISP, if you've tried all the basic tests you might be able to get a replacement modem to test the line. Sometimes even swapping the power supply is enough to fix the problem. Alternatively you might be able to borrow a modem from a tech-savvy friend with an old box to spare.\nIs your DSL connection slowly getting worse? How are you managing to squeeze the most of it until the NBN arrives on your doorstep?\nRELATED POSTS:\nDSL woes - is your broadband up to speed? Wi-Fi woes - is your home a dead zone?
