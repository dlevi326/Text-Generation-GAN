Shares of Arrowhead have gained 35% in the past month.\nArrowhead has been racing against competitors such as Gilead Sciences Inc. to develop a new hepatitis B drug. Jefferies analysts have projected Arrowhead's lead candidate, ARC-520, could potentially reach $4.5 billion in peak annual sales, with market entry around 2020. But some analysts have said the drug hasn't yet proven it can be a functional cure for the disease.\nArrowhead released the data ahead of an analyst day in New York.\nArrowhead said in human studies of patients who tested positive for the E-antigen, HBeAg, a single dose of ARC-520 reduced the antigen by up to 98%. The E-antigen is a protein made by the virus, which indicates that there is a lot of virus in the blood and it can be easily spread to others.\nHepatitis B can lead to liver diseases such as cirrhosis and cancer.\nThe treatment also reduced the S-antigen by up to 99% in human patients. The S-antigen is a surface antigen found in the blood of someone infected with hepatitis B. Arrowhead said it is currently conducting phase-two human trials of the drug.\nThe chimpanzee studies, which gave up to 11 monthly doses to 9 chimps, reduced the S-antigen by amounts ranging from 81% to 99%.\nArrowhead said it hasn't seen any serious or severe side effects in humans or chimps.\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com\n 24, 2015 09:55 ET (13:55 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T00:10:50.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
