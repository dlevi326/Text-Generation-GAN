The SOLAS amendment also says that containers without certified weight will not be loaded on the vessel. \n\"Bromma is gearing up to supply our twistlock based weight verification solution on both new spreaders, as well as retrofitting existing installations but there is a serious risk that the capacity for retrofitting will not be sufficient as the container handling market has not reacted fast enough.\" \nRichard Brough, Technical Advisor at the International Cargo Handling Coordination Association, argues: “There is no exemption from weighing in some form – if you are a Method 2 shipper, you will still have to weigh the cargo; the calculation aspect comes from adding the cargo weight with the tare weight of the container. \nTo read a Technical Paper by Lars Meurling of Bromma on container weighing, click here \n“But, come 1 July next year, there will be containers showing up at the gate without signed verification forms – so how do we manage that? What do we do with those boxes? The whole operational side needs to be discussed and sorted out.” \nThere are currently two methods for weighing container; weighing a loaded container, or weighing an empty box and then its contents separately.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T01:05:36.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
