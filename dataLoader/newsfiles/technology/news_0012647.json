Techradar | 20 September 2015, 10:46 AM IST Experiencing the first VR film festival \nThe room is dimly lit with a few people milling around, carrying Samsung Gear VR headsets looking anxious as if the impending crowd will hold the golden ticket to their success. I'd been to Public Works in San Francisco before for other events but not for a tech event, let alone the first virtual reality film festival. \nHeld by Kaleidoscope, a virtual reality agency (yes, there are agencies for VR now) a company created by Rene Pinnell, a filmmaker and director and Michael Breymann, founder of Glyph Software, the film festival is currently showcasing 20 VR short films. \nThere are chairs in different areas of the venue, placed next to each other and separated into sections with a Samsung Note 4 version of Gear VR and Samsung Galaxy S6 Gear VRs on each seat. Films on Oculus Rift (DK2) had their own section as well. \nI was directed to a headset and asked \"what film would you like to watch\" to which I replied \"all of them, but whatever you think is best to start with.\" The demoer laughed and told me Colosse by Joseph Chen is a good place to start. He wasn't wrong. \nI have a few VR devices already and I've seen quite a few of the Oculus 360 Degree features but sitting in a room full of other people with a Gear strapped to my face is a completely different experience. Even with the mobile VR, I was still transported to different worlds all the while being surrounded by 30 strangers. \nIt's still a solitary experience right now, but companies like AltSpaceVR - who is part of the traveling VR festival - are attempting meld social interaction with virtual space. Even Oculus itself is trying to remedy the loneliness of virtual reality by adding social functions to Oculus Cinema . \nRegardless, I was still impressed with the films I watched and excitedly removed my headset to discuss various points with my partner sitting next to me. Once the \"movie theater\" experiments are fully functional in Oculus Cinema, I can definitely see this as the future of watching movies at home. \nWith the major headsets hitting shelves in 2016, we're going to need a lot of content. Fortunately, that shouldn't be a problem. The Kaleidoscope VR Film Fest is proof that there are brilliant filmmakers breaking the boundaries of the silver screen. Future Spielberg's to watch out for \nI was able to speak with four directors about their projects in the festival. With live action, experiential and animation thrown in, there's a substantial amount of genres to choose from each with their own filming challenges. \nTyler Hurd, director of Butts, never thought he'd be talking to a reporter about his animated short. Originally 2D, Hurd's coworkers at Double Fine wanted to make Butts for VR. Simple, hilarious and yes, even touching, the short was one of the first virtual reality films made. \nTechnically, he says the conversion is tricky, because VR is still in development, \"There's a lot of things that break.\" Creatively however, it's \"been fun to explore.\" Examples include directing the audience's attention to little moments with certain cues to look in different places since you \"can't physically turn their heads\" you have to provide visual and auditory hints. \nAudience participation is something director Mac Cauley is familiar with. His piece, The Night Room is a homage to Vincent van Gogh and beautifully captures the artist's style in VR. More experiential, you move forward with the Gear VR touch pad to look at the vibrant items and people in the room. \nCauley says he wanted more game-like interaction but as he was developing it, there wasn't enough time and the film became a visual experience. However, depending on where you're \"standing\" in the room, characters may react differently. \nArtists inspiring artists seems to be a trend with virtual reality. Bright Shadows, directed by Michael Catalano also brings in art with a more musical tilt. Drawing inspiration from Expressionist art films used by German artists like Paul Klee, Joseph Albers, and Wassily Kandinsky, Catalano focused on bringing music to the forefront of his animated short. \nHis technical difficulties weren't too hard to solve since Bright Shadows is a pre-rendered opposed to real-time animations where moving your head causes the parallax to change. \nHowever he did want to sync the visuals with the music in the film perfectly. To achieve his, Catalano devised an algorithm to analyze what was happening in the music and then use that data to move the pieces in the film. \nWhile animations are certainly immersive and innovative, live action is breathtaking in its own right. When done well, the film should make you feel like you've just witnessed history or participated in a major event, then compelled to take action - which is what company Ryot is trying to do. COO Molly Swenson explains how the virtual reality documentaries Ryot is creating are creating a social awareness they've been hunting down. \nRyot takes news stories and pairs them with actions you can take to actually do something instead of simply reading and moving on. Swenson says Ryot wanted to find what content, medium and format best compels action at the highest rate. She notes, \"this medium [virtual reality] is incredible for that because it makes people feel something and want to get involved.\" \nRyot is the company behind The Nepal Quake Project, directed by David Darg. It's the first VR film done in a post-disaster zone and yielded a substantial amount of donations for relief aid. Welcome to Aleppo directed by Christian Stephen was filmed in the similar documentary tone to shed light on the Syrian war zone. \nThis \"documentary-style cinema verite,\" as Swenson describes it, is perfect for the Ryot news outlet. \"Once the equipment got durable and small enough to travel with - we just use the GoPro 360 Hero rig - it became the perfect marriage of our filmmaking, our journalism and our action capabilities.\" \nDespite the incredible footage captured, Swenson says there are still a lot of challenges filming live action, even documentary-style: \n\"As you're figuring out as a filmmaker how to do it, it's very different. You can't move the camera or you risk motion sickness, you can't have a crew of any sort because they're all in the shot. You can't hide any effects from the audience.\" \nEssentially, improvising and improving filming techniques as you go. Swenson notes it's all a learning curve but Ryot will continue down the VR path because of the success they've had with the immersive projects. \nThe Kaleidoscope Film Festival is the first of its kind and surely won't be the last with the upwards trajectory virtual reality is taking. All sorts of films are out now with more on the way. The filmmakers I spoke with are already excitedly in the midst of new projects. With Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR on the horizon, plus newer innovator editions of the Samsung Gear VR coming out soon (and even more mobile headsets I can keep up with), it's obvious virtual reality isn't a medium that's disappearing any time soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T08:56:00.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
