MTech simplifies the process of managing mobile devices by properly configuring, securing, supporting, repairing and promptly delivering them back into the hands of employees.\n\"The growing need to be connected anywhere at any time is forcing companies to enable a mobile workforce with business productivity tools on any device, regardless of the underlying operating system,\" said MTech MDM President and founder Tony Fernandez.\n\"As employees increasingly use their own devices for both personal and work-related activities, companies are quickly losing control over business assets. Companies can no longer ignore this reality,\" Fernandez added. \"Mobile device management helps companies secure their sensitive information and reduce liability issues.\"\nAmong MTech’s clients are Sarasota Memorial Hospital and the Saint Stephens Episcopal School in Bradenton.\nJoining MTech MDM as Vice President of Professional Services is Roger Hostetter, who leads the division's implementation and call center operations. Hostetter has 20 years of executive level experience with international corporations, responsible for global call center operations and managed services implementations.\n“The impact of mobility on business operations is a tremendous opportunity for those companies that properly embrace the change,\" said Hostetter. \"The complexity can be overwhelming, but by implementing proven methodologies, the impact on operations can be minimized, driving immediate positive effects. I am excited to have a key role in helping companies manage through this change!\"\nFounded in 2012 in Jupiter, Florida, by Anthony Fernandez, MTech Repair last year merged with Lakewood Ranch-based iHeart Repair, which was founded in 2010. The merger enabled MTech Repair to bring its retail and servicing strengths to the Sarasota area and expand its online ship-in service to businesses at the national level.\nMTech Repair is now headquartered in Lakewood Ranch at the San Marco Plaza, 8209 Natures Way, Unit 203. The Jupiter repair center recently expanded operations at the Chasewood Plaza, 6230 W. Indiantown Road, Suite 9.\nFor more information about MTech MDM, please visit www.mtechmdm.com or call 1-844 MY MTECH.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T01:48:19.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
