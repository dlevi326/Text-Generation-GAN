The firm has been uncovering the skeleton since 2012.\nMaltese says there were enough differences between Ava and the Avaceratops that researchers were sure they'd found something new.\nThe skeleton was used to make a replica that was unveiled in an exhibit Wednesday at the center in Woodland Park, Colorado.\n___\nInformation from: The Gazette, http://www.gazette.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1Lj6eUG"], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:20:06.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
