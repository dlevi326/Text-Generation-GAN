When an old building is being demolished or remodeled many wonderful features such as old beams, elaborate timber doors and ornate fireplaces are simply broken up because people don’t realize how inexpensive it really is to sell items like this on eBay, and ship them using a specialist courier such as ParcelHero.’\nDavid explains: ‘Just looking at the latest shipping heavy items list, ParcelHero has recently delivered large period oak beams, beautifully carved timber doors and a number of attractive old fireplaces and surrounds. It even moved a period gazebo, as well as some delightful but undeniably large antique furniture such as rocking chairs, grand dining tables and even a commode. Without this low cost service, saving and transporting these items would have been too expensive.’\nDavid sighs: ‘Too many people are simply destroying old period features because they think it’s too costly or too much of a hassle to move them elsewhere or sell them; but it’s no harder than sending a parcel. Of course shipping such items would cost a lot if restorers and traders were to engage a specialist heavy haulier in a dedicated same day delivery, but ParcelHero offers a realistic alternative for transporting large items because it offers an established service at a fraction of the price. It can collect same day for packages under 50kg in weight, and a shipment of up to 50kg costs from just £24.75 ($38.25). For heavier and larger items over 50kg or 180cm in length, shippers just need to give 24 hours’ notice. And if they need a vehicle with a tail-lift, or a pallet truck for moving a pallet, senders can get in touch with ParcelHero and let them know.’\nAnd David says it’s not just architectural features that can be delivered using the large and heavy items service: ‘ParcelHero has recently delivered all sorts of interesting heavy parcels and pallet loads, ranging from a TV game show podium and the nose landing gear for a light aircraft, to gymnastic beams and a large kebab machine. And at the other end of the scale it has also shipped delicate antique jewellery and paintings, and some 100 year old vases. It’s amazing the range of valuable vintage items moved, from the very tiny and frail, to large and heavy items!’\nFor more information see: http://www.parcelhero.com/en-gb/courier-services/large-and-heavy-parcels\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12964847.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.victoriansociety.org.uk/news/griff-rhys-jones-launches-victorian-societys-top-ten-most-endangered-buildi/", "http://www.parcelhero.com/en-gb/courier-services/large-and-heavy-parcels", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12964847.htm", "https://www.parcelhero.com/en-gb/courier-services/large-and-heavy-parcels"], "published": "2015-09-16T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T12:55:29.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
