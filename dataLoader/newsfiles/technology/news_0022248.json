At-a-glance notifications for calendar entries, e-mail and news updates are combined with the ability to send text messages directly from the wrist. A 24-hour activity log monitors daily fitness activity and patterns, and can send reminder updates to keep users on a fitness plan. The user interface is built on the open-source Tizen operating system, now available in 182 countries–including Canada–which was launched earlier this year on Samsung’s low-cost Z1 smartphone. Samsung is positioning Tizen as an aletrnative to Google Inc.’s Android operating system and Apple’s iOS. The company plans to run not just wearables and mobile devices on Tizen, but also its line of smart TVs. The Gear S2 runs on a 1-GHz dual-core processor with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of onboard storage, and offers a variety of connectivity technologies. Near-field computing (NFC) technology opens the device to touch-payment solutions and keyless home and automobile technologies. A 3G connectivity option allows use without tethering to a smartphone, though that’s also possible with its Bluetooth connectivity. A wireless charging dock can keep the watch running for two to three days, the company says. \nThe Samsung Gear S2 will be showcased at Tempodrum in Berlin on Sept. 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T12:18:49.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
