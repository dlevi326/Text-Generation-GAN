But if you search her name there, you’ll see multiple songs that are, ostensibly, “Taylor Swift songs”: “Bad Blood,” “Blank Space,” “Shake It Off.” The catch, of course, is that it’s not Taylor singing. Sometimes there will be no voice at all — just a jaunty karaoke instrumental that sounds like a tooth whitening commercial. Other times, there is a voice, but it’s unfamiliar and lacking that Swiftian shine. It’s a cover song.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:28:53.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
