The BioSafe Step Ladder combines safety with a clean, durable design. All- electropolished stainless steel construction creates a sturdy, ultra-smooth surface. Wheeled casters are also stainless steel to ensure non-shedding performance with metal-on-metal action. Each ladder step is perforated, minimizing turbulence which disrupts laminar air flow, and allowing particles to flow through rather than be deposited. The continuous-seam welds give the non-folding step ladders a noticeably smoother composition and eliminates hard-to-clean cracks which can harbor particles and other contaminants. Personnel can securely use the ladder without concern of slipping due to the non-contaminating nylon leveling feet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T22:47:32.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
