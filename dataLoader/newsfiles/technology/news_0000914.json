The same result was achieved with seawater, the only difference being a 2 percent lower clearance rate. \nAccording to the research team, most of the CO2 sequestration scenarios currently discussed in governmental and business circles are hardly something to be overly enthusiastic about. Each of these “has its own disadvantages, such as high cost, high energy input, use of harsh chemicals, and [the] generation of pollutants”. \nInstead of relying on these, scientists could deploy the new, autonomous micro-motors that use the environment itself to move around and cost much less to produce. \nOne of the barriers to overcome before these devices are released out “into the world”, however, is related to their self-propelling mechanism – currently, they use hydrogen peroxide, which reacts with platinum in their casing to create oxygen, allowing them to move. Pending further research, it is not known whether this could be applied on a massive scale. \nOn the up side, the motors are impressively fast. Water infused with just two to four percent hydrogen peroxide allows them to reach a speed of up to 100 micrometres per second – quite a considerable feat for bots of this size. \nThe next step in development will be to re-design the motors to run on other minerals that are not as expensive as hydrogen peroxide and more abundant in the intended environment. \n“If the micromotors can use the environment as fuel, they will be more scalable, environmentally friendly and less expensive,” said Kaufmann.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:38:15.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
