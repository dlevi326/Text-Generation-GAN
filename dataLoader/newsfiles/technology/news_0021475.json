MHPS is also responsible for supplying six 80MW boilers for that facility. \nThe two projects, totalling generation capacity of 9.6GW of thermal energy, are outcomes of Eskom's efforts to ease the power crisis in the country, which has been experiencing major blackouts. \nZuma said: \"Shortage of energy is a serious impediment to economic growth.\" \nImage: The 4.8GW Medupi Power station is expected to be at full capacity by 2019.
