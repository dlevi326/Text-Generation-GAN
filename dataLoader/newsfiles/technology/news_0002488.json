Chandrashekhar noted that \"The two-way flow of investments and intellectual talent is central to the growing commercial and strategic relationships between India and the U.S.\" For many years, NASSCOM has advocated for more open markets for U.S. companies in India, as well as for U.S. policies that permit temporary high-skilled workers from India to support their hundreds of American customers. \nDirect and indirect jobs supported by India's IT sector in the U.S. grew at an annual rate of 10 percent in 2011 to 2014, or about six times higher than the average jobs growth rate of 1.7 percent during that same period. The report further noted that states leading the number of direct jobs created by India IT sector operations and investments are California, Texas, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Georgia, Ohio, Washington, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Texas, Michigan, Illinois, California and Georgia had the fastest rate of job growth in 2011-2013. \nIn addition to jobs, investments and taxes paid, the report estimates that philanthropic activities by Indian IT companies touched more than 120,000 American lives in 2011-2013, with a major focus on educating more Americans in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills increasingly needed by the U.S. employers. The report also lists several recent examples of grants by leading India-based IT services companies including a $5 million per year grant by Infosys for nonprofit organizations engaged in delivering services, research and advocacy; an $8 million commitment from Wipro ( News - Alert ) to support fellowships for STEM education teachers; and a $35 million commitment from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to Carnegie Mellon University in August for a new 40,000 square-foot technology building plus fellowships and scholarships for outstanding students. \nIndian Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Minister Sitharaman is visiting Washington, DC, Sept. 21-22 for the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue hosted by her counterpart, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. Announcing plans for the dialogue during her visit to India with President Obama in January 2015, Pritzker said, the dialogue would \"ensure that the United States and Indian businesses - small, medium and large - are in a position to capitalize on abundant opportunities that exist in both of our countries.\" \nAbout NASSCOM \nNASSCOM Â® is the premier trade body and the chamber of commerce of the IT-BPM industry in India.
