Also called Hazara Expressway, the E-35 Expressway will allow for safer, faster and more cost-effective, inter-regional transportation of goods and services, while stimulating economic activity and opportunities for the people in towns and cities along the route. \nImage: ADB has also supported the construction of the Manshera-Oghi Road in Pakistan.
