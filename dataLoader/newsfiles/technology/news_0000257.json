At least four other senior executives have quit Flipkart this year, including Mekin Maheshwari as chief people officer; Ravi Vora as chief executive of strategic brands group; Amod Malviya as chief technology officer; and Sameer Nigam as engineering head.\n\nBut Flipkart, which is valued at over $15 billion, has also been hiring a number of high-profile senior executives, such as former Google executive Punit Soni whom it appointed as its chief product officer.\n\nAt Zomato, which has raised $225 million from a slew of investors, Durga Raghunath recently resigned as senior vice president-growth after a six-month stint to found an online publishing company, joining a list of senior executives who have quit the venture this year.\n\nNamita Gupta, former chief product officer, and Rameet Arora, former chief marketing officer, also quit recently, all having spent less than a year at the Gurgaon-based company.\n\n\"A lot of the hiring (at Indian internet companies) is pushed by the investors, and while the companies have hired top-notch people from the Valley, the culture here is very different,\" said Prateek Srivastava, founder and CEO of talent acquisition firm Basil Advisors.\n\nAt Ola, which counts Falcon Edge Capital, Tiger Global and SoftBank among investors, Arvind Singhal recently quit as CEO of the company's TaxiForSure unit, and Swaminathan Seetharaman resigned as vice-president for engineering.\n\n\"(The resignations have) less to do with compensation. You can attract the best talent with money, but you're not going to always retain them with money,\" Srivastava said.\n\nET could not immediately reach the companies or the executives for comment over the weekend. 14 highest-paying tech jobs of 2015 of 15 There's no question that the technology industry pays well.\n\nBut which job titles will specifically make the most money in 2015, and which ones have tons of job openings?\n\nThose are the questions the job-hunting site Glassdoor answered when it created its latest list of the 25 best-paying jobs that are in high demand.\n\nAnd naturally this list is dominated by tech roles.\n\nHere are the 14 tech jobs that have found a place in Glassdoor's 'best-paying jobs' list.
