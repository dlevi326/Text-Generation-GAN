The new enhancements include a client scoring system which formalizes the evaluation of new business opportunities and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance as part of the intake process. In addition, Intapp is launching Terms of Business, a new system that enables firms to programmatically capture, index, report on and enforce client obligations throughout the matter lifecycle. Together, the new functionality will help firms to expand the view of client inception to better position client engagements for success. “Clients are demanding more than ever from their law firms, and the firms that will thrive tomorrow are rising to the occasion by transforming how they serve clients today,” said Dan Tacone, President, Intapp. “Intapp Open is already playing an important role in this transformation – and Intapp is committed to delivering even more new ways for firms to use technology to their strategic advantage. Our newest innovations – in formalizing client scoring and evaluation, in assessing AML compliance and in centralizing terms of business – will enable greater visibility, further enhance efficiency, and help lawyers and firm management make better informed decisions.” “From the point of view of the AML / Risk Assessment team at Ashurst, we saw tremendous potential to add value to the firm’s business by being prepared, being ahead of the curve and anticipating the regulatory, statutory and client-driven changes happening in the market. Working together with Intapp, we developed our risk assessment system based on Intapp Open, which leverages the business intelligence we gather for wider business purposes in a very focused and dynamic way,” said Muriel Marseille, Head of Risk Assessment, Risk and Compliance, Ashurst. “The risk assessment system now provides a real global view of Ashurst’s legal practice, and is helping to support the firm’s business strategy. Our lawyers are also able to take a more integrated approach in advising clients and in managing large, complex multi-jurisdictional transactions, disputes and projects, and our clients benefit tremendously from a high level of consistency and efficiency in client service worldwide.” \nShare:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:19:52.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
