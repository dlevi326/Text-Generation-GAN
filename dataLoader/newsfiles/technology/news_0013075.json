Blue Coat offers an integrated portfolio of hardware, software and cloud-based cybersecurity solutions for protecting web connectivity, combating advanced threats, and responding to security breaches. The company’s Customer Support Portal provides a variety of product resources to customers, partners and internal users. To ensure a great support experience by making relevant product-related resources easily accessible and quickly available, Blue Coat has deployed the Google Search Appliance (GSA) to power the portal.\n“The success of this project is the result of our partnership with Google and our expertise in architecting and implementing enterprise search, whether that be for extranets or intranets. Unified search is a classic use case, which many leading companies use to empower customers while increasing the productivity of their staff,” said Kamran Khan, CEO, Search Technologies.\nSuccessfully launched in October 2014, the Blue Coat project also included a redesigned custom user interface providing simplified, user-friendly access. This portal is available to customers, partners and internal users and securely searches multiple content stores including the knowledge base, product documentation, technical briefs, security advisories, WebGuides, and support forums.
