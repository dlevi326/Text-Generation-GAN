It helps people escape poverty. A good education is critical to improve income, employment and enterprise opportunities. For girls, extra years of basic education make a difference to employment opportunities, marriage age, health and their capacity to make better decisions about their lives and those of their children. For children with disabilities, education opens doors to social inclusion and independence. Education enables communities to make choices about their future, and contributes to good governance and sustainable development.To our beloved youth let us go back to school and further our studies so that our realm will be rule by intellectuals like Pixley Isaka Ka seme, Dr. A.B Xuma, Chief Albert Lithuli, and Athony Muziwakhe Lambethe,Robert Sobukwe, SteveBantu Biko, Oliver Reginald Tambo and Chris Tembisile Hani, let us not put our trust to the current stomach and corrupt politicians because they are fooling us for the sake of delivering us economically, whereby they are living the luxury lifestyle.South Africans, how long you will be fool to fend and enrich the individuals while you are living in the abject poverty. How long will bogus politicians tell you about freeing you economically while they are driving a luxury cars, staying in the mansions, wearing the expensive clothes, and spending huge money on partying while you go to bed with an empty stomach.Let us go back to our roots, the roots of Shaka Zulu, The roots of Soshangane, the roots of Sekgwathi, the roots of Cetwayo, the roots of Mphempu, the roots of Modjadji,Pixley Isaka Ka Seme, the roots of Hudson Ntsan’wisi , the roots of Lucas magoepe,where our people, where fighting for the real battle, the roots productive politically and economically emancipation. Let us go back poor South Africans to restore our dignity.How long not long that the daughter of the domestic worker shall became the president of the African Union. How long not long that the son of the farm worker shall became the chairperson of United Nation. The African victory is not certain because of the bogus leaders that we keep putting them on power.The capitalists killed Thomas Sankara, Patrice Lumumba,Chris Hani, Steve Biko, Solomon Mahlangu , Samora Machel ,Saddam Hussein, Muamm Gadhafi, Osama Bin Laden, for fighting for the Republic of Africa, now they want to butcher Dr. Robert African Hero Mugabe for shielding the African realm. The ANC of 1990 CODESA negotiation sold Africa with money or dosh they received from capitalist, today South Africans are suffering due to the hogwash sacrifices of the CODESA negotiations, We are suffering because the ANC of that time made an agreement to benefit their family while leaving South Africa into the debts and in abject poverty. Today South Africa cannot go out of debts because of the reaping the apple while was not ripen.Today South Africa is living on debts, and the inhabitants of South Africa are likewise living in debts, in fact South Africa is the Debt Country, where everything from the regime to the citizens are debts. How can we attain the economic freedom while we are living on debts. South Africa must free itself from World Bank and International Monetary Fund debts before they free us.The ANC regime must lead by example, when you preach peace, you must live peaceful by yourself so that we can follows. We do not want the government of insulting each political party or leaders, we need the government of “SOLUTIONS”. We do not need the regime of coming to the people during the elections period, after that they are gone. You must know that we are not the voting cows but the sons & daughters of the Almighty God.Economic Liberation of Republic of Azania is on the hands of the farm worker or domestic worker, who knows the pain of going to bed without food, who knows the pain of sleeping under bridge in the coldness night without blankets, who know the pain of South African people, who never tested the wealth of the thieves, who never accepted tenders form the capitalists, who never plays seek and hide to his people, who never wasted even a cent to buy luxury garments or belonging.South Africa and Africa is still waiting for the economically ,politically and spiritually liberator because, is not yet born, May Almighty God send the messiah to free Africa, like Aaron freed the Egyptians, Like Sankara freed the Burkina Faso people, like, Samora Machel Freed Mozambique, Like Patrice Lumumba Freed Congo, Like Kwame Nkrumah freed Ghana, like Robert Mugabe Freed Zimbabwe, like me and you poor south Africans to free our beloved country, Now is the time for me and you to liberate our realm.Let Economic Freedom rings in South Africa!May God see the tears and slavery of Africa and free her from the thieves and hungry lions.Africa has a dream that one day it shall be one on politically, economically and spiritually.Let God Shows his grace and almighty in Africa!Issued By: Adam SibuyiMobile Id: +27 81 830 1974Email Id: adamsibuyi.myo@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:04:33.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
