Schultis, president of Mercy Health Foundation Mahoning Valley, will retire from the organization effective Jan. 1. \nSchultis has been with Mercy Health Foundation, formerly Humility of Mary Health Foundation, for eight years. A successor has not been selected. \nDuring his tenure, Schultis spearheaded community support and fundraising for construction of the Joanie Abdu Comprehensive Breast Care Center, an $8 million project; greatly expanded Mercy Health Youngstown’s community-outreach programs; tripled the number of donors supporting the Foundation’s mission; and increased funds raised each year to between $3.5 million and $3.8 million. \nHis crowning achievement, development of the breast-care center, provides the most-advanced breast-diagnostic services available anywhere, state-of-the-art technology and is one of only two health care providers in Ohio to offer molecular breast-imaging services, Mercy Health officials said. \nUnder Schultis’ leadership, the Joanie’s Promise Fund, which ensures that every Mahoning Valley resident in need of diagnostic breast services has access regardless of ability to pay, was established. Joanie’s Promise Fund benefits from the Panerathon, now in its sixth year, the largest single fundraising event in the region. Since its inception, Panerathon has raised more than $1.3 million. \nAmong the Mercy Health community-outreach programs that have expanded under Schultis’ direction are the Resource Mothers programs, which provide guidance and support to pregnant women and new mothers, community fitness and education programs, oral-health programs provided through the Smile Station, a mobile dental office, nutrition programs and sponsorship of a community test kitchen where underprivileged families learn to prepare healthful meals. \n“I have never worked with such excellent professionals and wonderful people. I am proud of what the foundation has accomplished over that time,” Schultis said. “But, I give all the credit for our accomplishments to a number of people that I have been honored to work with: first, the Sisters of the Humility of Mary, whose footsteps we try to follow.” \nSchultis went on to credit and thank Bob Shroder, president and CEO of Mercy Health Youngstown, the foundation board of directors, the senior leadership team at Mercy Health Youngstown and his staff who, he said, “make me look good.” \nShroder recently announced his retirement in February 2016.
