With over 1000 individual statistics available just in time for the NFL regular season, which begins on September 10th, OnPoint is positioned to become the new go-to platform for advanced sports data analysis. OnPoint Sports boasts the fastest delivery of real-time data - an average of three to five seconds from the time an event actually takes place on the field. Users can subscribe to the teams and players of their choice to receive push notifications when there is an update on anything they follow. The ease of access to up-to-the-minute data empowers fans to make fantasy plays using the most recent information and allows them to stay on the leading edge without even watching the game.\nThe most popular sports statistics apps offer just 10-20 data points per sport and do not provide a dynamic interface that allows users to choose how they interact with the statistics that are most important to them. By analyzing and categorizing the wealth of raw data available on the platform, users can follow their favorite teams and players, focusing on the game and dominating their fantasy leagues. OnPoint is integrated with Twitter, giving fans live access to streams from the players and teams they follow. Elisha Ferrara, the CEO and one of three founders of OnPoint Mobile had this to say about changing the way sports fans interact with the statistics: “The thing we love about OnPoint is that even though we’ve got the most data all in one place, it’s still very user friendly. Everything is modular so that users can decide how deep into the data analysis they want to go, without ever feeling inundated by information they don’t want or need.”\nOnPoint Sports for Android is available to the public today, starting with full access to NFL data in time for the regular season, which begins on September 10th. The OnPoint Sports Android app can be downloaded for free HERE .\nAbout ONPOINT SPORTS\nMore statistics, better analysis, faster updates and intuitive design make OnPoint Sports the most intelligent sports data application on the mobile market. By doing the heavy lifting of organizing and sorting through the data that's important to individual users, OnPoint's interface allows you to easily find the information that is relevant, allowing fans to stay in the game. OnPoint Sports is the brainchild of Elisha Ferrara, Vitaliy Kondratiev and Tyler Lyn, all graduates of the Computer Science program at McMaster University.\nEND\n###\nMedia Inquiries\nLisa Hillyard\nlisa(at)onpointmobile(dot)ca", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2JpdC5seS9vbnBvaW50ZGw="], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:08:01.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
