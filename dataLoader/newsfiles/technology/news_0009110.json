It is then followed by lists of affected client and server versions of Windows, and other Microsoft products. \nThe next three groups list security bulletins, security advisories and revisions, and non-security updates released since the last patch day in August. \nThe final chapters provide you with download and deployment information, and links to important resources. \nExecutive Summary Microsoft released a total of 12 security bulletins this patch day. Five bulletins have a maximum severity rating of critical. All Windows client operating systems are affected by at least one critical vulnerability. Other Microsoft products affected this patch day include Microsoft Office and Microsoft Exchange Server 2013. \nOperating System Distribution \nWindows 10 is the only client operating system that is affected critically by vulnerabilities reported in two bulletins (MS15-094 and MS15-095) while all other supported client operating systems are only affected critically by MS15-094. \nThe reason why is easily explained: bulletin MS15-095 is a cumulative security update for Microsoft Edge which is only available in Windows 10.
