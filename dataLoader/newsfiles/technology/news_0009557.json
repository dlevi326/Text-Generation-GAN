Most of the company data had been encrypted, cutting off his access to it. In short, the database had been hacked and the hackers were demanding money to decrypt the data.\n\nThe new trend of 'cyber extortion' has the cyber crime wing of the Hyderabad police on tenterhooks. \"An incident of data being kept hostage was first reported a year ago. At that time, we did not take it seriously. But when another victim came with a similar complaint in late July, we realised that it's a new modus operandi,\" assistant commissioner of police (Cyber Crimes) B Anuradha told TOI. \"The victims could not access their data as it was controlled by the hackers,\" she explained.\n\nIt was found that hackers were penetrating the weak security systems of several companies and demanding payment in Bitcoins, which the police are now terming as the hawala system of cyber space.\n\nAlso in the recesses of the world wide web are several rogue websites that are putting up for sale the confidential information belonging to individuals. The information sold can range from email IDs to Aadhaar and bank account numbers.\n\nREAD ALSO:\nCyber extortion attacks on the rise, says report \n\n\"The personal information of people is getting leaked by unscrupulous employees of banks, who are approached unofficially by those looking for prospective customers. Data sharing is invaluable for improving businesses. But in several cases, the information is put up for sale for a few lakhs of rupees and is bought by organised gangs indulging in various kinds of frauds,\" a cyber police officer said.\n\nBy feeding the data into the easily-available 'brute force' software tools, fraudsters generate various possible passwords against an email id or bank accounts in under a minute. Once the accounts are hacked, financial fraud like illegal money transfer is readily done.\n\nREAD ALSO:\nNet banking fraud tops cyber crime in Pune \n\nOne of the most common frauds being committed by hackers is to misguide business partners by sending emails from similar looking email ids and asking them to transfer money to new accounts.\n\n\"Corporates and individuals should always maintain upgraded operating systems, firewalls and advanced anti-virus softwares to protect data from intrusion. One should avoid using unlicensed, pirated, free anti-virus tools available on the web, since many of them are not foolproof. Corporates should have a periodic cyber audit to avoid data hacking. Never open unsolicited mails or invites on social media,\" joint commissioner of police (CCS), T Prabhakar Rao, told TOI.\n\nHe also suggested that users should always have passwords that are complicated and not predictable like names of family members.\n\nDo's and don'ts: \n\n* Never open or respond to unsolicited emails or invites on social media\n\n* Do not download free mobile apps that offer free talk time\n\n* Default password given by telecom service providers must always be changed\n\n* Do not use pirated operating systems or rely on free anti-virus softwares. Buy advanced tools\n\n* Erase the three digit number on the rear side of the debit or credit card and write it some where\n\n* Use complicated passwords for all online accounts\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T11:51:49.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
