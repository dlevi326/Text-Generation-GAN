It is an affordable and practical commercial vehicle with a new modern design. \n\n'The Renault Dokker Van is the perfect van from SMEs to large companies seeking affordable reliable and practical business companion' said a senior SBA spokesperson. \nSpacious and impressive the Renault Dokker Van aims to please with an innate sense of practicality and versatility. It can take all kinds of loads assisted by XL sliding side doors (more than 70cm wide) and two asymmetrical rear doors meeting the challenges of transport and delivery with ingenuity and panache. \n\nThe Renault Dokker Van moves with the times: its economic engine low CO2 emissions and respect for both the environment and your budget make it a truly model employee! \n'The Dokker offers functionality and at the same time comfort while demonstrating very clearly that Renault strives for excellence in manufacturing commercial cars just like it does with all other passenger vehicles' added the SBA spokesperson. \n\nIt also boasts of built-in radio and hands-free telephone system in addition to some very practical storage spaces in front for convenience and in the back for better use of the space and boot organisation.The Dokker perfectly meets the needs of business owners since it can carry up to 750kg payloads and a volume upwards of 3.3 m3. \n\nFoldable and removable the passenger seat shows its full ingenuity when the backrest folds down to form a temporary desk. When fully removed it frees up extra space increasing the loading volume to 3.9 m3. \n\nIts loading area is equipped with eight lashing rings on the floor ensuring that your most fragile items are firmly held in place. \n\nFor added security you can choose between three types of partition: tubular full glazed or pivoting wire-mesh (associated with Easy Seat). The side and rear doors can be either panelled or glazed. And for even greater efficiency the Dokker Van is available with side panels and a robust stylish boot carpet. \n\nThe Dokker Van comes with one or two sliding side doors and the loading width stands at 703mm. The asymmetrical rear doors meanwhile open to a width of 1.08m. That's not a bad score either! \n\nThe Renault principle of safety is outlined in four basic points: Prevent correct protect and educate. Renault provides equipment that performs auxiliary tasks automatically to promote the responsibility of drivers by warning them when they are not in a position to control their vehicle or when they put themselves in a position of potential danger. For example the visual and audible seatbelt reminders and tyre pressure monitoring. \n\nThe inherent handling and braking qualities of a vehicle are fundamental factors of its overall dynamic active safety and accident avoidance performance. Moreover Renault is also known to have the maximum number of Euro-NCAP Five Star rated models globally.
