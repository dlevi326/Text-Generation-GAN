Now available for Twitter, the service allows people and businesses to configure SecureMySocial to automatically, in real time, delete Tweets as they are made, if the posts are deemed likely to violate laws, harm the poster’s career or personal relationships, put the poster or his/her children in physical danger, bully others, leak confidential data, or inflict harm in other ways.\nReports of inappropriate social media posts causing all sorts of professional and personal problems appear in the media nearly every day. Bad posts by employees – and disciplinary actions taken as a result – have caused businesses to be sued, investigated, and fined, and have cost fortunes as leaked data has undermined investment in marketing campaigns and research projects.\n“With SecureMySocial’s patent-pending Auto-Deletion technology, businesses can protect themselves and their employees from risks that were previously not addressable. People using personal social media accounts during non-work hours could inadvertently harm their employers or themselves. With SecureMySocial that risk is dramatically reduced,” noted Joseph Steinberg, CEO of SecureMySocial.\nTo learn more about SecureMySocial please visit www.SecureMySocial.com.\nAbout SecureMySocial\nSecureMySocial protects businesses and people from the risks of inappropriate social media usage by warning users of social media in real time if they are making posts that could harm themselves or their employers.
