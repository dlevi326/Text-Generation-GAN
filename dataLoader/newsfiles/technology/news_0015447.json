Unlike previous control order applications made by the AFP, it was not publicised and has been quietly progressing in a series of federal court hearings that have been largely closed to the public.\nOn Friday Guardian Australia was present at what is believed to be the first ever open court hearing of an interim control order matter. Federal circuit court judge Rolf Driver took directions from the parties to determine the course of the case.\nA judge must confirm the order ... considering whether the controls listed are reasonable and necessary\nWhen an interim control order is sought, it can only be temporarily imposed. A judge must confirm the order, which involves in part a consideration of whether the controls listed are reasonable and necessary.\nThe “controls” place a number of restrictions over where the man can travel, who he can speak with, and requires him to check in regularly with police.\nThe man must attend a police station every two to three days. He is not permitted within 500m of international airports.\nHe is also restricted from using mobile phones, computers, email, any telephone service, any internet account or any web applications such as FaceTime, WhatsApp, Telegram or Skype, unless otherwise approved.\nA further control states: “You are required to consider in good faith participating in counselling or education relating to your spiritual, emotional and physical wellbeing, with a suitably qualified professional counsellor or publicly recognised religious leader, for at least 60 minutes every week.”\nThe controls listed also specify the names of a number of individuals, including a 12-year-old boy, a 16-year-old and a number of other men.\nA point of contention between the AFP and the respondent is the control that prevents the man from going “inside, or in the grounds of, any masjid/mosque, or any other place of observance” other than one particular mosque specified in the order.\nThe man’s lawyers said they were considering a constitutional challenges on this order and whether it was consistent with section 116 of the Australian Constitution , which provides freedom of religion.\nThe lawyer for the man told the court: “The contention that will be put by the respondent is that control 4.4 is failing this test.”\nA non-publication order is currently in place surrounding documents and evidence in the case. It is uncertain whether the further hearing set down for the confirmation of the order will be in public.\nJudge Driver said in the proceedings he was aware Guardian Australia had queried whether the proceedings were in open court, and would proceed on the basis the hearings were open unless an order was sought by the parties.\nThe AFP and the lawyers for the man may seek a further order from Driver to restrict access to further hearings.\nA date will be set down for the hearing surrounding the confirmation of the order.", "external_links": ["http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s116.html"], "published": "2015-09-11T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T13:32:05.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
