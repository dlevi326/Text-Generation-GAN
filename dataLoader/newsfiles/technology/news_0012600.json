Quirky had been able to raise $170 million from several firms, including Norwest Venture Partners LP, RRE Ventures, General Electric Co.'s GE Ventures LLC and Andreessen Horowitz Fund LP, according to industry tracker Dow Jones VentureSource, which like The Wall Street Journal is owned by News Corp.\nBut growing pains and losses from unsuccessful products brought Quirky to bankruptcy, though it is poised to accept a $15 million offer for its Wink subsidiary, a software platform for smart-home products. Flextronics International Ltd., a manufacturing company that provided hardware for Wink, made the bid for the subsidiary.\nQuirky hopes to find a buyer for the remainder of its business, though it warned it could discontinue products that don't find a new home.\nQuirky said it has $53.9 million in assets versus $136.8 million in liabilities. As a result, investors are likely to lose their equity stakes.\nWhen he founded Quirky in 2009, Ben Kaufman aimed to create a crowd-sourced invention platform, whereby inventors could pitch their ideas and solicit help. Quirky would develop the products it believed were hits and pay royalties to the inventors. It achieved success with simple products like the Pivot Power, a flexible power strip that sold more than 1.5 million units.\nBut the misses -- like a digital egg tray that told consumers how many eggs were left in the refrigerator -- plagued the company's profitability.\nAs its roster of products grew to 150 from 34, Quirky rapidly expanded its operations but struggled to bring such a diverse array of products to market.\n\"In short, Quirky was unable to attain manufacturing and distribution scale, and sustained significant losses on many of these products,\" the company said in court documents filed Tuesday.\nEarlier this year Quirky decided to get out of the product development business and focus on its partnerships with companies like GE, and its consulting arm through the acquisition of Undercurrent LLC.\nBut the change in focus didn't fix Quirky's immediate problem: it needed cash.\nQuirky's $19.9 million revolving loan from Comerica Bank was coming due in October and $36.8 million in convertible bonds were set to mature at the end of the year, though they could be converted to stock then. The company also would have to start paying up to $8 million of the Undercurrent purchase price that had been deferred.\nGE said Tuesday it was disappointed that Quirky filed for bankruptcy but will continue introducing smart products of its own this fall. GE said it would continue to make products to be used with Wink.\nBy late summer, Quirky lost the leases for offices in New York and San Francisco, laid off 159 employees and replaced Mr. Kaufman as CEO.\nFlextronics struck a deal with Quirky's landlords in New York, allowing it to stay on a short-term, rent-free basis. Quirky entered bankruptcy with 90 employees, most of whom work for Wink, after securing Flextronics's bid, which Quirky hopes to put to the test at a November auction.\n---\nYuliya Chernova contributed to this article.\n 22, 2015 20:05 ET (00:05 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T15:59:41.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
