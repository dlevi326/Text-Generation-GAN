The excitatory dopamine receptor in the mice was triggered more and more easily with less and less stimulation over time, they found. \nThese “D1 receptors” were known to become more accustomed to activation – and then promoted more alcohol consumption than ever before, they added. \nWhen the D1 receptors were inhibited with drugs, the mice did not want alcohol as much, they found. \n“If these neurons are excited, you will want to drink alcohol,” said Wang. “You’ll have a craving. \n“My ultimate goal is to understand how the addicted brain works,” Wang added, “and once we do, one day, we’ll be able to suppress the craving for another round of drinks and ultimately stop the cycle of alcoholism.” \nDrinking has long been known to increase the effects of inhibitor GABA in the brain, while inhibiting the excitatory glutamate neurotransmitter. But at the same time, it causes a release of pleasurable dopamine which the addict can come to crave . \nAccording to Wang and the Texas A&M team, the exact chemical pathway for all these interactions still needs to be delineated.
