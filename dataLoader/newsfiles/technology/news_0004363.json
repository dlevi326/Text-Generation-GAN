Radio transmissions from Earth are unable to reach the far side, making it an excellent location to place a radio telescope for use by astronomers.\nChina's next lunar mission is scheduled for 2017, when it will attempt to land an unmanned spaceship on the moon before returning to Earth with samples.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T09:25:11.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
