Cyber Command envisions all-encompassing cyber defense \nU.S. Cyber Command officials would like to build an overarching, electronic system to find vulnerabilities in the military's computer networks, weapons systems and installations so they can be prioritized and corrected, according to news reports. \nLt. Gen. Kevin McLaughlin, the command's deputy commander, told Reuters that defense officials should reach agreement on the framework within months and turn the system into an automated scorecard in the coming years. He made his remarks after a speech at the Billington Cybersecurity Summit in Maryland on Sept. 17. \nHe said the effort grew out of a report released earlier this year in which the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, Michael Gilmore, warned that nearly every major U.S. weapons system was vulnerable to cyberattacks. \nAccording to McLaughlin, Cyber Command staff would do the initial data entry by hand, with the goal of creating a fully automated system that would help defense officials instantaneously detect and respond to any attacks. Local IT budgets on the rise, but staffing concerns loom large \nIT budgets are on the rise for many cities and counties, but technology executives in those local governments still have concerns about investment levels in certain key areas -- and in their ability to retain top talent. \nThose trends are among the findings in a new survey by the Public Technology Institute and Deltek.
