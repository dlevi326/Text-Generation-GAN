Agencies | 22 September 2015, 2:03 PM IST Share NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday withdrew the contentious draft national encryption policy, saying that it will be reworked and reworded to dispel the \"myths\" surrounding it. \"The draft encryption policy is not the Centre's final view. The government recognises social media freedom and this move is largely aimed at businesses, not individuals,\" Information and Broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said at a Cabinet briefing on Tuesday.In an addendum to the draft policy, the Department of Electronics and IT said it has exempted \"the mass use encryption product, which is currently being used in Web application, social media sites and social media applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter etc\".Generally, all modern messaging services like WhatsApp, Viber, Line, Google Chat, Yahoo Messenger etc come with a high level of encryption and many a time, security agencies find it hard to intercept these messages.\"Modi government respects and recognises social media freedom. The whole purpose of encryption is not related to social media messaging platforms used by individuals,\" Prasad said, clarifying the Centre's intention.The policy was widely panned on the Web for being ambiguous and for suggesting the government wanted to assume an \"autocratic\" stand on access to encrypted information.\"There have been some uncalled for misgivings, I have asked the concerned department to withdraw it and reword it appropriately to quell doubts.\"As per the original draft, the new encryption policy proposes that every message a user sends -- be it through WhatsApp, SMS, e-mail or any such service -- must be mandatorily stored in plain text format for 90 days and made available on demand to security agencies.The draft proposes legal action that could also entail imprisonment for failure to store and produce on demand the encrypted message sent from any mobile device or computer.The draft, issued by the Department of Electronics and Information Technology, would apply to everyone, including government departments, academic institutions, citizens and for all kinds of communications -- be it official or personal.The new addendum or clarification has also exempted certain encryption products from being used in Internet banking and payment gateways as directed by the Reserve Bank of India and e-commerce and password-based transactions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T13:20:50.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
