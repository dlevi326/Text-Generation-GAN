More Etsy under fire over Irish tax practices \nTanium has raised funds from TPG, Institutional Venture Partners and T Rowe Price , as well as Andreessen Horowitz, which was the sole investor in the previous two rounds . \nThe fundraising is one of the largest for a private cyber security start-up. This year venture capital funding has been flooding into the industry in anticipation of a boom in spending on cyber defences . \nCyber security start-ups raised more than $1bn for the first time in a single quarter in the first three months of this year, according to data from research company PrivCo, while on the public markets, investors have pumped money into an exchange-traded fund that tracks cyber security stocks. \nOnly Lookout, the mobile security start-up that raised $150m last year, and AVG Technologies , the antivirus maker that attracted $200m in 2009, have raised more than Tanium in a single round, according to PrivCo. \nThe cyber security industry says that companies’ budgets for protecting against hackers are rising on the back of high-profile attacks such as breaches at adultery website Ashley Madison and health insurer Anthem . \nOrion Hindawi, Tanium’s co-founder and chief technology officer, said investors were becoming more “disciplined” in terms of cyber security start-ups — looking for traction in the marketplace rather than just smart technology. \n“A year ago, everybody who had a good idea was getting funded, whether they had any capacity to execute on that idea,” he said. “We’re starting to see, especially in the higher echelons of the VC community, people recognising that they were overfunded and a lot didn’t do anything but spend a lot of money on sales and marketing.” \nMr Hindawi said this fundraising round was the first in which investors were “really interested” in the fact that Tanium was cash flow positive; that bookings had risen more than 250 per cent in the second quarter from the same period the year before; and it had more than doubled the number of transactions above $1m in the first half. \nThe round was four times subscribed and could be extended by up to $30m, he added. After the fundraising, the company will have more than $250m in the bank, enough to protect against a “crazy black swan event”, he said. \nBryan Taylor, a partner at TPG, said he had backed Tanium because Mr Hindawi was “one of the top half-dozen brilliant infrastructure software engineers in the world”. \nHe said the company, which he described as a communication platform on which powerful security applications could be built, had the “potential to reshape how corporate America secures and manages its data”. He added that he was impressed at how quickly Tanium had been able to sell to “large, complicated, mission critical government agencies”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:53:46.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
