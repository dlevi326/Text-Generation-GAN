Part of the company’s EZ-Boardware range of PCB hardware solutions, the new EZ-Removeable Jumper Links comprise contact clips and removable linking bars. The surface mounted clips are supplied in tape and reel packaging for automatic placement, whilst the bulk-packed removable linking bars make the electrical connection between clips. The system provides secure retention of the linking bars, whilst allowing them to be speedily removed and replaced if a failed LED array requires replacement. Clips are available in both vertical and horizontal styles. \nThese products allow users to further automate the processes involved in manufacturing and assembling multiple LED arrays, eliminating manual soldering and/or the use of more costly conventional connectors. The novel design allows for the removal of an individual array if it fails without disturbing adjacent PCBs, facilitating easy and quick serviceability and repair. EZ-Removeable Jumper Links occupy minimal board space and their neutral colour provides for maximum light reflection. They can carry up to 1.5A, making them ideal as a highly cost-effective PCB connection system. \nComments Product Manager, Paul Gillam: “The alternative to our new EZ-Removeable Jumper Links is either soldering a bar or wire connection which is time-consuming and risks damaging the board, or the use of a plug and socket connector which is expensive and makes the replacement of any one module within a complex array almost impossible. EZ-Removeable Jumper Links enable fast connection to all four sides of an LED array, and can even accommodate PCB misalignment.” \nAlthough obvious applications include LED lighting tubes, LED lighting arrays, LED signs and other similar products, EZ-Removeable Jumper Links are an ideal solution wherever low cost, low profile, separable connection is required.
