John Kitzhaber for official business before he resigned in an influence-peddling scandal. \nSome of the emails released Tuesday show Kitzhaber's fianc√©e, Cylvia Hayes, weighing in on environmental policy matters, such as crafting a 10-year energy plan and discussions of coal exports. \nKitzhaber stepped down in February amid allegations that used the governor's office to win contracts for her green-energy consulting business. \nGov. Kate Brown's office says that 12,000 emails from Kitzhaber's account have yet to be reviewed for public release. \nEmails from a separate account that Kitzhaber used for private business are not included in the release. Those emails were archived inadvertently on state servers, and Kitzhaber's lawyers are fighting to keep them private.
