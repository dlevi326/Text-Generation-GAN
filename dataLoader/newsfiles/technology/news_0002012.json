Thickness offerings range from 1.97 micro-in to greater than 100 micro-in. Furthermore, these options facilitate assembly by wire bonding, conductive adhesive (epoxy bonding) as well as most soldering attachment methods while ensuring improved long term performance and reliability. \"KEMET's new gold termination options further the company's commitment to supporting customers with increasingly higher temperature requirements,\" said Reggie Phillips , KEMET Product Line Manager. \"Our patented base metal electrode dielectric technology combined with gold termination translates to a lead-free, RoHS and REACH compliant product capable of continuous and reliable operation up to 200 degrees Celsius.\" For more information, please visit [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTkzZDNjdWEyVnRaWFF1WTI5dEwwaHBMVlJsYlhBdFEyVnlZVzFwWTF3aUlISmxiRDFjSW01dlptOXNiRzkzWENJZ2RHRnlaMlYwUFZ3aVgySnNZVzVyWENJK2QzZDNMbXRsYldWMExtTnZiUzlJYVMxVVpXMXdMVU5sY21GdGFXTThMMkUrfA==]].
