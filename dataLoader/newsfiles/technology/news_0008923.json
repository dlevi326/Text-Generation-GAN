The fuselage is made of carbon fibre, Kevlar and hybrid composites, whereas the joint segments constitute precision computer numerical control (CNC) machined aluminium parts. \nThe engine is positioned between the tail booms and fuel is stored in bladder tanks. \nEach Bayraktar TB2 system consists of six aerial vehicles, two ground control stations (GCS), three ground data terminals (GDTs), two remote video terminals (RVTs) and ground support equipment. \nThe UAV has a length of 6.5m, wing span of 12m and a maximum take-off weight of 630kg. Bayraktar TB2 avionics and payload Bayraktar Mini Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Turkey \nDesigned for short range reconnaissance and surveillance missions, Bayraktar is currently operational with the Turkish Land Forces. \nThe UAV is equipped with a triple redundant avionics system. An onboard avionics suite encompasses units, including microcontroller, engine control, servo motor power control, engine signal processing and I/O and GPS receiver units. \nIt also features a Pitot static sensor, laser altimeter and alpha beta sensor modules, as well as speed, temperature and fuel level sensors. \nBayraktar TB2 UAV can carry a maximum payload of more than 55kg. The standard payload configuration includes an electro-optical (EO) camera module, an infrared (IR) camera module, a laser designator, a laser range finder (LRF) and a laser pointer. Flight control and navigation \nThe redundant flight control system allows autonomous taxi, take-off, navigation, landing and parking operations without assistance from any external sensor. Sensor fusion architecture using modern non-linear control techniques ensures good control and guidance of the UAV. The unmanned vehicle is also capable of employing semi-auto modes during missions. Bayraktar TB2 ground control station \nBayraktar TB2 UAV is controlled by a ground control station based on a NATO spec ACE-III mobile shelter unit. The module integrates pilot, payload operator and image exploitation consoles. \nThe station is equipped with rack cabinets, air conditioning unit, NBC filtration system, power supply units, wireless systems and internal communication systems. Engine and performance of tactical UAV \nThe power plant integrates a 100hp internal combustion engine driving a two-bladed variable pitch propeller. \nThe tactical UAV has a range of more than 150km and can fly at a maximum altitude of 22,500ft. It has a maximum speed of 70kt and endurance of more than 20 hours.
