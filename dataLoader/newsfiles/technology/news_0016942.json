A sportsperson can easily associate him/her with all these things. But what if their sportswear could adjust itself with the changing needs of their body? To test the potential of Curie module of Intel, the company teamed up with architectural sportswear designer Chromat to produce two responsive garments – a dress and a bra. These responsive garments change shape responding to the wearer’s body temperature, adrenaline or stress levels. The first one The Chromat Adrenaline Dress is a black number made of neoprene stretched over 3D-printed panels with a carbon fibre framework attached to the back. When an adrenaline rush indicated by an increase in sweating and breathing rate is detected, the carbon fibre framework activated by a shape memory alloy will expand into a stylized hourglass shape. The second one, Chromat Aeros Sports Bra consisting of Lycra, mesh, neoprene and 3-D printed frames also integrates shape memory alloy just like the dress, but uses it to open vents in the bra to provide a cooling air flow when it detects changes in the wearer’s perspiration, breathing and body temperature. When things cool down, it also shuts off the vents. It is to be noted that Intel Curie is actually a button-sized module that packs a low-power, 32-bit Intel Quark microcontroller, six-axis motion sensor with accelerometer and gyroscope, integrated digital signal processing (DSP) sensor hub and pattern matching technology, Bluetooth Low Energy and 384 kB of flash memory and 80 kB of RAM. Intended for embedding in wearable devices aimed at a range of applications, such as health and wellbeing, social networking and fitness, the module is power efficient and supported by a software platform developed specifically for the unit. A number of companies are sampling this module and Chromat was one such company to incorporate it in its sportswear. The dress and bra are still not available in the market as Intel Curie is yet to receive the required authorization from the FCC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:13:41.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
