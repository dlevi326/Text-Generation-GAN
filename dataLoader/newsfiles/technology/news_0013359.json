The credit industry itself aids consumers in making these dreams a reality, but when credit is abused it can lead to a debt spiral and a dangerous situation. Over indebtedness is something which many South Africans face, in this instance credit has become a burden instead of a tool for a brighter future.\nYou will pay more for what you borrow – The National Credit Act allows credit providers to charge interest and monthly fees on facilities granted to consumers. Regardless of the credit amount granted, fees and interest will be charged in accordance with the National Credit Act. Always ensure that your credit providers are registered with the National Credit Regulator. There are many micro lenders out there who are not registered and abuse interest percentages and fees charged. Think twice before engaging in shady business.\nKnow the difference between Secured and Unsecured Debt – Secured debt consists of home loans, vehicle finance and asset finance. This means that should you wish to sell the asset which you have bought, you will be able to receive payment from a third party and a transfer of ownership can be processed. Unsecured debts consist of personal loans, credit cards, retail cards and student loans. Consumers can not sell credit cards or retail accounts to third parties, this is a debt obligation for the account holder alone.\nDo not “live” on credit – Always make provision in your budget for your living expenses. Buying your groceries or paying your rent with credit can become a problem as consumers become dependent on credit to survive each month. If you pay for your groceries using cash alone, you will not be charged any fees and this is a healthy objective to achieve.\nPay your most expensive debt first –Inspect your annual interest rates for each active account you have; the account with the highest interest percentage is what we would consider the most expensive. The National Credit Act allows for up to 60% per annum on micro loans, this being the highest amount of interest which is can be charged. Pay your micro loans quickly and try not to access them in the future.\nYour credit score is based on your behaviour – To obtain a good credit score, the credit bureau will monitor consumers’ payment behaviour over a few months. Always pay the full instalment each month and ensure payments are on time.\nUnderstand what over indebtedness is – Here is an example on how to work out your debt to income ratio and debt percentage. Work out how much your monthly debt repayments are:\nFor example: Loan 1 R1000.00\n Loan 2 R1500.00\n Retail 1 R500.00\nTotal Debt R3000.00\nThe next step would be to divide your total debt repayments by your nett salary.\nFor example: Salary R4500.00\nR3000.00 / R4500.00 =0.66 (66%)\nIn this example the client is 66% over indebted, this is considered moderate but concerning as well. Try to create a balance so that your debt obligations do not exceed 50% of your nett salary.\nPut money aside for emergencies – Unplanned events happen to everyone, be it your car breaking down or a medical emergency. One of the many reasons why consumers fall into debt is because they do not have a saving facility for these events. Putting a small portion aside each month will help consumers build reserves for those unplanned obstacles. Having this provision will take the immediate pressure off of consumers’ wallets.\nConsolidations are not your saviour – Consolidation loans merely replace debt with more debt. In some cases, consumers are worse off after having taken a consolidation loan. Consumers still have access to their retail and credit accounts, so even after they have been settled, consumers will still be able to access the credit available.\nCash is King - Instead of buying a pair of jeans on your account, rather save cash and buy them without credit. The same goes for groceries and living expenses, make a provision in your budget to pay cash for these items. Know the difference between “ a want” and “a need.” By using cash consumers will act responsibly towards their purchases. Remember that providing for your household and teaching them good financial habits is vital for our future economy to flourish. Teach your family that credit needs to be used responsibly and in a healthy manner.\nThe content above is strictly the author’s opinion and does not reflect the opinion of any company or entity.\nPublished: 7 September 2015\nAuthor: Samantha Lotze", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:27:44.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
