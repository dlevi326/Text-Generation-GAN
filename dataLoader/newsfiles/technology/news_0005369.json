In addition, consumers will welcome efforts to outfit trucks and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) with customized features and improved fuel efficiency.\" Pick-up trucks can easily transport large, bulky items from one place to another, says Cattya Bella, Director of Product Development for World Patent Marketing. With the popularity of such vehicles, there is a need for an automotive invention that can help in securing and fastening the cargo in place so as to prevent them from getting blown away or damaged during the travel. The Easy Tarp was designed with this thought in mind: cover truck beds. The biggest problem in transporting items at the back of an open pick-up truck is that the cargo is subject to the elements and is often damaged by the harsh weather conditions. Fortunately, this invention is made from resilient material and is waterproof which ensures the safety of the cargo underneath it. It is even easy to install and remove which makes securing the load less of a hassle. This is an automotive invention that can make life easier for truck drivers everywhere, says inventor Robert S. The Easy Tarp is made to be lightweight and easy to carry so as not to add to the drivers burden. It can be folded easily and is affordable; it even comes in different colors to match the color of the truck! Nate Clemmons, an advertiser blogger from Los Angeles, CA, has this to say about the Easy Tarp: Any space can become a medium of advertisement and one of the best media is something that people can always see. Easy Tarp is an automotive invention that is ideal as an ad space. It is very visible to people and travels from one place to another. The idea is no different from ad space on buses and closed trucks and is certainly a very viable option for companies wanting to spread awareness on their brand. The Easy Tarp is a unique automotive invention which makes life easier especially for people who own pick-up trucks or for businesses that rely on shipments and cargo.
