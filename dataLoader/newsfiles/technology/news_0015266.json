Women, youth must help shape development goals, says NGO In this article Companies and organisations: United Nations WORLD leaders have negotiated and agreed on an ambitious plan to end poverty and inequality in the next 15 years, adopting 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) at the United Nations (UN) as a road map to tackle the world’s most troubling problems.\nMore than 150 world leaders were scheduled to attend the three-day summit that ended on Sunday to formally adopt an ambitious new sustainable development agenda, said the UN.\nThe summit was held ahead of the UN General Assembly this week.\nWhile getting the 193 member nations to agree on priorities, scope and wording of the SDGs and the 169 targets was monumental, far more daunting is their implementation. The toughest challenges are the sheer breadth of the agenda, finding ways to monitor and measure progress, and keeping the process transparent and accountable.\nAdded to those are the reluctance of some countries to address certain issues, with climate change and gender equality high up the agenda, not to mention the enormous trillion-dollar price tag, say those involved in the sweeping project.\n\"Having been in government, I know managing 10 targets is difficult. Managing 169 targets is challenging for the most efficient government,\" said David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee that runs humanitarian relief operations in more than 30 war-torn countries. \"The great danger here is that the breadth of the targets becomes an excuse for not fulfilling the targets,\" Mr Miliband said.\nEchoing that sentiment, Helen Clark, administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, said the role of the 169 targets was to cut the goals down to manageable bites.\nThe targets range from halting deforestation to raising living standards and reducing child mortality.\n\"These sub-goals spell out in great detail what we need to do so that every year there is stocktaking as to what we’ve been able to do,\" said Ms Clark.\nImplementation will be monitored and reviewed with a set of global indicators to be agreed on by next March.\nMeanwhile, Brazil on Sunday pledged to slash greenhouse gas emissions 43% by 2030 as its contribution to a UN climate agreement, but the country said it would include reductions from past efforts against deforestation to help it reach the target.\nPresident Dilma Rousseff said the targets, based on a reference year of 2005, more ambitious than those of most developed countries.\nCountries are submitting pledges to cut emissions ahead of global climate talks in Paris later this year.\nSo far, those pledges are estimated to limit warming to 3°C.\nScientists say global warming needs to be limited to 2°C (to avoid devastating droughts and rising sea levels).\nMs Rousseff reaffirmed the country’s commitment to ending illegal deforestation in the Amazon, as stated during a joint announcement with US President Barack Obama in June, but fell short of declaring a total freeze on deforestation as many environmental groups had sought.\nEstimates from leading researchers on land use change in Brazil indicate legal deforestation could still be carried out in an area of about 100-million hectares — equivalent to the size of Colombia.\nBrazil also pledged to offset emissions coming from regulated deforestation, but has not provided details.\n\"Brazil is one of a few developing countries to commit to an absolute emissions reduction target,\" Ms Rousseff said.\nThomson Reuters Foundation, Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:12:13.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
