The highlight of the handset is its impressive set of specifications, latest Android version, and support for 3G connectivity at a low-price tag of Rs. 3,999. The handset will go on sale in its first flash sale starting September 30 at 12 noon on Snapdeal . The registration for it will begin on Wednesday at 10am. \nBeing touted as \"India ka 3G phone,\" the handset comes with a range of enticing features for its price category. It sports a 5-inch display of FWVGA (480x854) screen resolution. It is powered by a quad-core chipset clocked at 1.3GHz. Other features of the handset include a 5-megapixel rear camera and a 2-megapixel sensor placed upfront. It comes with a 4GB internal storage, which can be expanded using a microSD card (up to 32GB). \nThe dual-SIM capable Canvas Spark 2 supports 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other standard connectivity options. There's an 1800mAh battery, which the company claims can last for more than 300 hours on standby mode. On the software front, the phone runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop, which is rather impressive for a phone of sub-Rs. 4,000 category. \n\"The Canvas Spark proved to be a huge success for Micromax, selling over half a million units in less than two months of its launch [...] The Canvas Spark 2 is the most affordable 5-inch, 3G, Android Lollipop device available in the Indian market, making it a great value proposition for the consumers. Our association with Snapdeal has been long standing, and we expect sales of Canvas Spark 2 to touch newer heights in the coming weeks, which will further strengthen our leadership position in India\", said Vineet Taneja, CEO, Micromax.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T17:28:49.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
