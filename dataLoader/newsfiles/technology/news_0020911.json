PETERSBURG, Fla. -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- iQor introduced a new branding campaign today, including a new website ( www.iqor.com ), the new tagline Experience Matters , and marketing collateral which communicates the company’s unique set of integrated customer and product support solutions. \nIn April 2014, iQor acquired the Aftermarket Services division of Jabil Circuit, providing the company with expanded capabilities that span the consumer value chain, from customer care and receivables management to product diagnostics and repair services. \n“Our new branding and positioning illustrates how our 32,000+ employees around the globe solve our clients’ most difficult challenges,” said Gary Cole, Executive Vice President, Sales & Marketing at iQor. “Our Experience Matters messaging reflects the evolution of iQor, the benefits of our integrated service delivery model, and our vision for the future.
