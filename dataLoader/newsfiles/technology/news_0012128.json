Photo Illustration: Dianna McDougall Today you can find pretty much any kind of emoji keyboard your little heart desires, from Star Wars and Ikea to Coca-Cola and Mentos. Now you can add the pope to that list. A pope's visit to the U.S. always sparks anticipation, and Pope Francis' arrival on Sept. 22 should be no exception. This time around, emoticon-obsessed millennials and fans of the social-savvy leader can top off their tweets and texts with emojis from Swyft Media's new Popemoji app. It debuted for iOS and Android today. Want an emoji of Pope Francis standing next to the Statue of Liberty? You got it. Posing next to the Lincoln Memorial? Done. Enjoying an nice sub sandwich? Also, weirdly, done. Commissioned by global Catholic network Aleteia.org for the \"#GoodIsWinning\" campaign, the keyboard was designed to engage young people on social media as soon as the pope touches down in Washington, D.C. \"Emoji are so ingrained in digital and social language, particularly among young people, that it was natural to make them an element of our digital effort to support Pope Francis' visit to the U.S.,\" said Kathleen Hessert, founder of Sports Media Challenge, the company overseeing Aleteia.org's efforts, in a statement. \"Besides, the Pope has a great sense of humor, is totally approachable and dedicated to engaging people where they communicate.\" The emoji keyboard app comes complete with 52 pope-themed stickers and 14 animated GIFs of his holiness so you can go ahead and tweet your favorite Popemoji to @Pontifex.
