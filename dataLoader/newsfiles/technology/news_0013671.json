There has to be someone there to click OK.” \nHealth-tracking will also feature in Samsung’s IoT plans in the form of the SleepSense device, unveiled in Germany earlier this month.

Lee. \nIt could, for example, determine when you’ve fallen asleep and automatically turn off a connected TV and turn up an air conditioner to ensure a comfortable rest. \n“It will change the environment that you’re sleeping in by connecting with our home appliances and (consumer electronics) devices.” Lee says. “This is something new, never been done before, but I think it’s crucial in helping you to sleep better.” \nSamsung’s IoT devices will compete with Belkin’s WeMo devices that include power monitors and smart plugs, Philips Hue lighting system, and coming devices that support Apple’s HomeKit and Google’s Brillo software, with a router called OnHub available for pre-order now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T19:59:40.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
