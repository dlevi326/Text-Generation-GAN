She said the group has nearly 700 clinics but obtains foetal tissue in less than 1% of them.\n\"Planned Parenthood is proud of its limited role in supporting foetal tissue research,\" she said, arguing that the donations have helped scientists search for cures.\nAbortion opponent David Daleiden obtained the videos by posing as an executive of a fake company seeking to supply foetal tissue to researchers. Richards said Daleiden, despite three years of doing that, didn't entrap any Planned Parenthood officials into doing anything illegal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:16:05.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
