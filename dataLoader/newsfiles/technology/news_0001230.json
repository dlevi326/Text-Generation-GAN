It will trade under the ticker symbol HPE.\nThe split is expected to be made final on Nov. 1.\nThe employee departures will save $2 billion annually, the company said.\nH-P Inc. will remain focused on printers and PCs.\n\"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today,” Whitman said in a statement.\n“As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world,\" she said.\nHP ( HP ) was up 1.80% in after hours trading on the news.\nWhitman announced last year that she planned to split the 75-year-old company in half.\nHP was founded in a garage in Palo Alto, Calif. in 1939.
