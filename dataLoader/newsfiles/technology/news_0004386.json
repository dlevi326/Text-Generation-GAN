\nSillah said emergency workers were distributing drinks, bread and foam mattresses. \n\"The raging waters took away all my property,\" housewife Fatu Kargbo told an AFP correspondent on the Fourah Bay College slope in the east of the city. \n\"I have three children and four grandchildren who suffered some bruises and cuts but neighbours were able to rescue them before they were dragged away.\" \nMamie Sillah told AFP she had lost everything as the waters hit the Kroo Bay slum in central Freetown. \n\"I wonder whether it is worth living now. What I am wearing now is all I have,\" the 45-year-old said. \nFive Red Cross emergency operations were at work plucking frightened residents from flooded neighbourhoods while at least three major bridges linking the city centre to its rural western edge were reported damaged. \n\"We were able to rescue at least 20 people, including children from school, who would have lost their lives,\" Teddy Jones, a leader of one of the teams, told AFP. \nThe government was to hold an emergency meeting headed by Vice-President Victor Foh, who is coordinating the relief efforts. \n\"The situation is serious and hundreds of people have been affected,\" Mary Mye-Kamara, the government's director of disaster management, told reporters. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T16:18:24.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
