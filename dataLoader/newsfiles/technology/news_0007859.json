According to Smart Insights, 57% of users 'multiscreen', meaning they access websites on both their desktop and mobile devices. Smart Insights added that more than 20% of Google searches come from mobile devices. The data proves that a business cannot afford to continue without a mobile website anymore. Ideally, your business website should be 'responsive'. Responsive design is a way of developing a website so that the site structure provides optimal viewing experience across all devices, from desktop to tablet to smartphone. Just having a traditional website might not fetch you good search engine ranking for much longer. Google's algorithm now considers a website's 'mobile friendliness' before ranking it. The algorithm basically scans a website for its load time and its mobile responsive design elements against standard mobile practices. Websites that do not have mobile-friendly designs may rank lower down on Google's results pages. This change in Google's algorithm has made it necessary for all businesses to invest in mobile web development services. Take a look at some of the most important reasons of getting a responsive website:Google prefers it - Google prefers responsive websites since it does not create two copies of the same site - one for desktop and one for mobile devices. A responsive design creates only one website with the same URL and HTML that can adapt and react to fit the specifications of a variety of devices. It is easier to manage - Having a single website for your business is more practical and cost-effective than having two versions of the same site. Having two websites means that you have to do everything twice. Every single action from SEO to routine site maintenance, takes twice the effort and cost. Responsive design serves the same purpose but uses less resources. It increases relevance - Responsive design allows a business to deliver its message in device-specific ways. For example - a business can offer a web form to those visitors who send in lead enquiries via a desktop. For the enquiries that come through mobile devices, the business can offer a highlighted click-to-call action. Mobile web developers can also make messaging features adapt according to specific devices.It increases conversions - Google states that in case your business website is not easily navigable, there is a 61% chance that visitors will leave. On the other hand, if visitors have a positive experience of browsing your mobile site, they are 67% more likely to convert. Having a responsive design enables users to browse the website via a variety of devices with a single URL. Responsive websites have fast load times. Since this website can adapt to any screen size, there is no need to put in additional effort in scrolling and zooming just to make the site fit to the screen. The ease of use makes visitors happy and increases conversions. The above factors show why mobile website development have become a compelling option for all businesses. It is an efficient and economical solution that can help you cater to both your desktop and mobile-using customers satisfactorily.
