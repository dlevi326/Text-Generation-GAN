Besides murder, the accused were found guilty of various charges under the Indian Penal Code, MCOCA, Indian Railways Act, Explosives Act and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. While five accused have been found guilty of murder, all 12 have been found guilty under MCOCA’s Section 3-1(1) — both attracting the death penalty. Seven RDX bombs went off in the first-class coaches of Mumbai’s suburban trains on July 11, 2006. All blasts were timed within a span of 10 minutes during the evening rush hour in the crowded suburban section of the Western Railway. The charge-sheet filed in the case claimed the blasts were carried out by Lashkar-e-Toiba men led by Faisal Shaikh, who headed group’s Mumbai operations. Shaikh is accused of obtaining training from the Pakistan-based LeT commander-in-chief Azam Cheema. Shaikh was also accused of organising bombers’ training in Pakistan and helping organise funding through hawala. He is accused of recruiting other co-conspirators from the banned Students’ Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). Others held guilty in the case had been accused of harbouring Pakistan terrorists Salim, Sohail Shaikh, Abdul Razak and Abu Umed. These terrorists were housed in the residences of some of those found guilty. The Anti-Terror Squad of the Mumbai police, which investigated the case, claimed the RDX used to carry out the blasts was procured from Pakistan through Bangladesh. The pressure cookers and ball bearings were acquired locally as were the bags in which these were placed before being planted in the Mumbai trains.
