The CustomerCount Express Permission uses the proven CustomerCount online stable platform to reach out to existing customers to gain their express permission to call, satisfying the TCPA requirements.\nNew FCC Declaratory rulings make calling customers increasingly difficult. Millions of dollars in fines are being levied by the FTC and the FCC forcing contact centers to gain “express consent” to use any type of auto dialer equipment.\nAccording to Bob Kobek, President of Mobius Vendor Partners creator of CustomerCount “fines are now up to $16,000 per incident and contact centers are losing all control over contacting their existing customers. Many of these companies are being forced back into manually dialing their customer lists, or not contacting them at all.”\nThe solution, which employs all the legalese necessary to make it official, can be used to call both land and cell phone lines as well as those customers who have placed their name on national and state Do Not Call registry. “We use the same ‘Opt-In’ language required by the FCC and provided to us by our attorneys. Given the robust nature of our 24/7 reporting capabilities, the Express Permission solution provides a strong defense against those ‘serial litigators’ who sit and wait for the phone to ring and then start class action suits.”\nHe explains that the CustomerCount system is simple to design, launch and maintain. “We do all the heavy lifting. Compared to the cost of not contacting existing customers and the potential fines that can incur make the costs of the CustomerCount Express Permission solution implementation is very inexpensive.”\nOriginally developed for the timeshare industry, CustomerCount Enterprise Feedback Management system collects and measures customer feedback through branded, customized surveys formulated to measure the quality of the entire customer experience by tracking and reporting on all Key Performance Indicators from sales and contact center experiences as well as product experience. Its flexibility to gain input from customers for any “touch point” is one element of its strength.\n“Since we integrated the technology to make CustomerCount compatible with smartphones and tablets, the evolution to Express Permission Technology was a natural development,” said Kobek.\nMobius Vendor Partners, an Indianapolis-based company that provides business process design, management and performance improvement services to companies, associations and non-profit organizations developed the system for a major client and now makes the platform and services available to companies throughout the world in over 30 languages.\nKobek says he will be demonstrating the recent updates to the CustomerCount system, including both the Opt-In software capabilities at various industry conferences including CRDA, PACE, TBMA and ARDA Fall Conference in Washington, DC in mid-November.\n“Of course we give online demonstrations, but nothing beats a face-to-face meeting to understand the full value of all the bells and whistles of our user-friendly system.”\nFor a demo of CustomerCount Express Permission cut and paste in your browser:\nhttps://www.customercountsurveys.com/find.aspx?C=69&B=471", "external_links": ["https://www.customercountsurveys.com/find.aspx?C=69&B=471"], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T18:26:21.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
