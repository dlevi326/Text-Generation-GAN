Drawing data from community generated tags, exclusive yellow pages databases and Internet search results, Whoscall helps identify incoming calls in real time and filters out unwanted callers, said Yuting Liu, country manager of Whoscall Thailand. \"With the proliferation of smartphone devices in Thailand, people are more connected than ever; however, this does not always mean people are available to talk. \"Being able to screen calls, especially from spam calls or unwanted sales is an important way to manage your day and focus on the task at hand, whether it's spending time with family and friends, or continuing an important work meeting uninterrupted,\" said Liu. Boasting a global database of over 700 million phone numbers, Whoscall is able to identify business numbers as well as numbers crowd-sourced by the community, automatically identifying and displaying the source of incoming calls as they arrive, allowing users to filter out suspicious numbers before they are answered. The award-winning app also features a number of call management features, including a block function that allows users to block numbers, and customisable incoming call information, allowing users to edit and decide what information the receiver of their call sees. Whoscall allows users to provide feedback on unwanted calls that can in turn help other users. For example, if they receive an unwanted call from a telemarketer, they can report information from the call determining the source, and this information is stored on the database. Once Whoscall receives a critical number of similar tags on a specific number, the user reports are consolidated and shown, allowing other smartphone users to benefit and save their time. \"We have put a lot of time into making it truly intuitive, especially with regards to the localisations of our features in Thailand, so users are able to identify unknown numbers as soon as they receive the call, and fully enjoy the experience,\" added Liu. Whoscall is available for download on Google Play, App Store, and Windows Phone Store. 158 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T07:42:19.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
