According to analysts, after this cut most banks base rates are 35-65 bps higher than HDFC Bank and they will have to take some hit on net interest margins (NIMs) if they match it.\nThe BSE Bankex was down 1.77 per cent at 19,290 in the morning trade (at 10.32 am).\nStocks of Punjab National Bank dropped after Fitch downgrades viability rating by one notch to ‘bb’.\nAll the banking stocks in the BSE Bankex were trading in red. Punjab National Bank slid the most —3.11 per cent to Rs 140.35, it was followed by Yes Bank (down 2.76 per cent at Rs 670.50), Axis Bank (down 2.12 per cent at Rs 495.95), Kotak Mahindra Bank (down 2.10 per cent at Rs 637.25). HDFC Bank was down 1.79 per cent at Rs 1009.70.\nIDBI Bank, down 2.15 per cent, is also vulnerable to a downgrade given deterioration in the stressed asset ratio, Fitch adds.\n(With inputs from Reuters)\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 10:51 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T08:59:05.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
