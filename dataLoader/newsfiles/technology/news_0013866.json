(AP) - ESPN says commentator Curt Schilling won't appear on the air for the next month in the wake of his anti-Muslim tweet.\nESPN said Thursday that Schilling won't be on telecasts for the rest of the regular season or the American League wild-card game on Oct. 6.\nThe former star pitcher and \"Sunday Night Baseball\" analyst was pulled by ESPN from a major league game and the network's coverage of the Little League World Series last month after he retweeted a post that compared Muslims and Nazi-era Germans.\nAt the time, Schilling said he'd made a \"bad decision.\"\nSchilling later sent an email to a sports media site about his Twitter post, causing a further uproar.\nESPN said \"Curt's actions have not been consistent with his contractual obligations nor have they been professionally handled; they have obviously not reflected well on the company.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:24:26.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
