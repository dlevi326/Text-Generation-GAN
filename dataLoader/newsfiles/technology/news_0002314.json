TNN | 20 September 2015, 10:11 AM IST Share AHMEADABAD/NEW DELHI: India's IT-business processing representative body Nasscom and leading Silicon Valley non-profit The Indus Entrepreneurs will sign an MOU to facilitate a start-up exchange and collaboration programme to encourage and scale up innovation in India during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US west coast.The \"Start-up Konnect\" being organized will also see IIM Ahmedabad's centre for innovation and incubation enterprise signing MOUs with corporates and academic partners which will also seek to boost the development of \"disruptive innovations\" that change the ground rules of existing businesses or theoretical knowledge. The September 27 event will see some 30-odd start-ups from India showcase work being done in fields like agriculture, healthcare, energy, bio-technology, technology business and finance with a view to attracting partnerships and support from US investors and organizations like TiE Silicon Valley that seeks to spur mentoring, networking, funding and incubating activities.With Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected to attend and speak at the function, the Indian participants are hoping that the start up connect will provide a high profile platform for innovation in India, an area seen to be a weak spot despite India's reputation as an IT solutions provider. PM Modi to address startup founders in Silicon Valley \"We aim to further accelerate the strong interface that exists between India and the US start up eco-system. We would like to thank the PM for encouraging us in this endeavor to fuel India's start up economy,\" said NASSCOM president R Chandrashekhar. The accent on the use of technology to change lives and deliver both high end and broad application products will mark the start up event.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T08:31:03.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
