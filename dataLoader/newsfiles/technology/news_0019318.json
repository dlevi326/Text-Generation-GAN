Both companies are platforms for Internet advertisers.\nMarkiles says ads are submitted with the understanding that the advertiser owns or is authorized to license the image.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T02:04:40.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
