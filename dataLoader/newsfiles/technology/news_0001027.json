Only 10,000 of them for a population of 1.2 billion are not adequate. So we decided to set up this online teaching portal so that one doctor can train multiple residents on one go. It will be having visiting professors from Europe and United States in addition to Indian faculty.\" \n\nRadguru.Net is a comprehensive and collaborative learning platform with live case discussions, quizzes and an archive of interesting cases. It also includes guest lectures by eminent national and international faculty from institutions such as Yale, UMass, Baylor and Harvard. \n\nRegistration is free on their site.
