Only about 100 of the nearly 2,600 households have returned since a trial period begun in April.\nNaraha Mayor Yukiei Matsumoto said that Saturday marked an important milestone.\n\"Our clock started moving again,\" Matsumoto said during a ceremony held at a children's park. \"The lifting of the evacuation order is one key step, but this is just a start.\"\nHe said that fear of radiation and nuclear safety was still present, and the town had a long way ahead for recovery.\nFor instance, the town will be without a medical clinic until October, and a new prefectural hospital won't be ready until February next year.\nA grocery store started free delivery services in July, and a shopping center will open next year. Still, many residents, especially those who don't drive, face limited options for their daily necessities.\nResidents are given personal dosimeters to check their own check radiation levels. To accommodate their concerns, the town is also running 24-hour monitoring at a water filtration plant, testing tap water for radioactive materials.\nLast year, the government lifted evacuation orders for parts of two nearby towns.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T07:56:28.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
