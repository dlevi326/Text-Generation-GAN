Even its Civic had factory-installed CNG-fueled powertrain from 1998 to 2015.\nBut CNG Civic wasn't able to catch on and was discontinued in 2015, despite being one of North America's best-selling cars. Despite these facts, Honda still refocused its efforts on supplying CNG .\nHonda knows that the market for natural gas vehicle (NGV) in North America comes in fleet and commercial customers, not individual car owners. This is one of the major reasons why Honda opened up its first CNG refuelling station in its campus located at Marysville, Ohio.\nThe campus is one of the giant car manufacturer's first and biggest automotive assembly plant in North America.\nIt is also Honda R&D America's headquarters, manufacturing 440,000 vehicles annually. It is one of the largest numbers of vehicles manufactured in North America with hundreds of deliveries per day, making it an ideal place for a CNG refuelling station.\nThe Natural Gas Refuelling Infrastructure of Navigant Research reports that the number of CNG refuelling station in North America is seen to grow to just more than 1,800 in the next 10 years from the present 1,560.\nThat is a compound annual growth rate of only 1.7%. In a worldwide scale, the number of stations is predicted to grow at 4.0% in the next 10 years.\nAccording to Honda spokesman Eric Mauk , they have designed the station to have a capacity to hold 2.5 million gallons per year. As of now, it is fuelling over 1.0 million gallons annually, which translates to 75-80 fuelling events every day.\nIf it holds its maximum capacity of 2.5 million gallons a year, it would see 200 fuelling events every day.\n ", "external_links": ["http://as.ebz.io/scripts/api/beead_apiV3.js", "http://mgid.com/advertisers/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=add", "http://mgid.com/", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/pikeresearch/2015/09/01/honda-compressed-natural-gas/", "http://www.hondanews.com/releases/honda-opens-compressed-natural-gas-fueling-station-on-marysville-campus?query=cng&channel_slugs%5b%5d=corporate&channel_slugs%5b%5d=powersports&channel_slugs%5b%5d=autos&channel_slugs%5b%5d=power-equipment&channel_slugs%5b%5d=acura-automobiles&channel_slugs%5b%5d=honda-marine&channel_slugs%5b%5d=honda-racing&channel_slugs%5b%5d=hondajet&content_types%5b%5d=releases&content_types%5b%5d=videos&content_types%5b%5d=photos", "http://www.navigantresearch.com/research/natural-gas-vehicle-refueling-infrastructure"], "published": "2015-09-03T04:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T07:50:25.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
