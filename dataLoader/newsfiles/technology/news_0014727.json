September 25, 2015 \nEditor's note: The following article was written by Christopher Lyon, a former fleet manager who currently serves as director of fleet relations for NTEA – The Association for the Work Truck Industry. \nBy Christopher Lyon Because a typical vocational fleet spends a large portion of its total operating budget on energy/fuel, fleet managers are always looking for ways to reduce energy costs. There are really only two methods for doing so: consuming less of the energy you are currently using, or switching to alower-cost energy source. While this sounds cut and dried, the actual implementation can be very complex due to the nearly limitless configurations and designed mission capabilities of work trucks. First, most fleets have to maintain service during anyconversion process. They also may have to figure out how to relocate vehicles on an emergency, short-term or permanent basis. Funding is another important consideration. Depending on how a fleet approaches energy cost reduction, it could require significant capital expenditures, one-time expense payouts, and/or ongoing supplemental maintenance and operating costs. Assuming required funding is available, the fleet manager might need to prove an acceptable return oninvestment (ROI) within a reasonable payback period. This article outlines six steps fleet managers can take to determine the best ways to maximize their fleets’ energy budgets. 1. Analyze Drive and Duty Cycles Most of the processes and technologies for reducing fleet energy costs are sensitive to drive and duty cycles. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they are actually separate measurements of how a fleet operates. A drive cycle defines how vehicles operate based on factors such as: Average speed * Amount of incidental idling time * Power export time (PTO operation, etc.) * Number of starts and stops per cycle * Longest average continuous running time per cycle. A duty cycle defines how much a vehicle is used and looks at factors such as: * Length of average operating cycle * Number of operating cycles per period * Total miles driven per measurement period * Percentage of loaded vs. empty operation * Percentage of on-road vs. off-road operation. Because the effectiveness of energy reduction technologies is generally closely related to a fleet’s drive cycles, fleet managers can utilize drive cycle data to identify technologies that could reduce their energy budgets. They can then use duty cycle data to determine if the projected savings associated with an alternative are adequate to cover the investment and provide the desired ROI. Remember, a single fleet can have multiple drive and duty cycles, so one approach to energy cost reduction might not work across the board. Also, drive and duty cycles are frequently seasonally dependent, especially in areas with harsh winter weather. For example, a fleet may have an inner-city drive cycle with low average speeds, multiple stop/start cycles and extended periods of incidental idle time. All of these factors are compatible with use of an electric hybrid powertrain. However, a duty cycle analysis could show annual miles driven are so low that even doubling the current average fuel economywill not produce enough savings to cover the cost of buying the hybrid system. Since the drive cycle also documents an excessive amount of incidental idle time, a better (lower-cost) approach for this fleet may be to implement an idle management strategy. 2. Remember the Basics In many cases, the simplest and most economical approach to reducing energy costs is to simply consume less energy. There are several tried-and-true steps fleets can take. The simplest techniques have been recognized for so long, they are often downplayed — but when implemented properly, they can be very effective. A short list of these approaches includes: * Maintain proper tire inflation * Passive idle reduction (driver coaching,reminder signs, etc.) * Maintain vehicles properly Going beyond these somewhat passive approaches, fleet managers can take action to make new or existing vehicles more efficient. Since the powertrains of newer vehicles are computer-controlled, fleets can oftenre-map the engine performance curves and transmission shift points of theirtrucks to improve overall powertrain efficiency. When ordering new trucks, carefully choosing and matching components to specific drive and duty cycles can produce impressive energy reductions. 3. Implement Telematics and Driver Behavior Modification There are a number of ways to improve vehicle operational efficiency. Two approaches that provide great potential are telematics and driver behavior modification. The most familiar application of telematics in the vocational fleet environment is GPS functionality. This technology can have a direct impact on fleet operating costs by reducing miles driven. Going beyond this aspect of telematics, the ability to track vehicle condition in real time offers multiple possibilities for energy management. By mapping the PCM to the telematics system, fleet managers can read system fault codes, tire pressures, and other information. By using an exception reporting system, vehicles with defects are flagged so repairs can be made at the earliest opportunity. Thedata collected can also be used to develop drive cycle profiles and identify issues such as hard acceleration and braking, sudden radial maneuvers and engine idle time. The driver can impact overall fuel economy by as much as 30 percent. The most effective behavior programs provide the driver with real-time performance feedback. Something as simple as instantaneous fuel economy feedback on the vehicle’s dash can be effective. 4. Consider Hybrid and Electrification Technology For vocational trucks, hybrid and electrification technology can be an effective choice. It can reduce energy costs in several ways: * Allowing the engine to operate in an optimum efficiency range * Recapturing kinetic energy normally lost during braking * Capturing surplus engine energy for use at a later time (driveline or power export) * Facilitating engine idle management * Allowing for the primary vehicle power source to be downsized When utilizing hybrid vehicles, the selected technology should be matched to the drive and duty cycles. Many vocational trucks are driven a relatively limited number of miles per day, so the efficiencies associated with full hybrid drivetrains might not justify the cost and complexity of such asystem. This has resulted in the development of work-site hybrids. These vehicles utilize surplus engine power, stored as electric energy (sometimessupplemented by plug-in battery charging) to operate truck-mounted equipment without having to run the primary engine. This technology is much simpler than full hybrid powertrains, but still provides substantial idle time reductions during stationary work-site operations. Idle management can be further enhanced by using the system to maintain cab heating and cooling (hotel loads). 5. Evaluate Lower-Cost Energy Options Fleet managers have several lower-cost energy options such as biodiesel, electricity, natural gas (CNG or LNG) and propane (autogas). Biodiesel is generally more expensive than conventional diesel fuel; however, in some regulatory environments, it offers significant tax advantages that may result in lowertotal cost. In these areas, biodiesel represents a significant opportunity for fleet managers, since it is basically a drop-in replacement for conventional diesel. The primary expense associated with conversion to biodiesel is cleaning fuel storage tanks before taking delivery and changing fuel filters frequently until the biodiesel has cleaned all residue out of the vehicle tanks. Electricity is typically the lowest-cost alternative fuel available to fleets, and when the capabilities of an available vehicle fit the associated drive and duty cycles, operating cost savings are very attractive. But electric trucks are limited in availability and range/speed capabilities. Upfront costs can be high, as they require a fairly large capital investment and, in some cases, significant infrastructure investments for charging systems and grid tie charges. An alternative to pure electric trucks is the extended-range electric truck. These units utilize an all-electric drivetrain with a smallonboard motor generator set that can provide a portion of the electric demand. This combination can offer operating ranges in excess of 250 to 300 miles before a full battery charge is required. There is a fine line between extended-range electric vehicles and series electric hybrids. If the onboard motor generator set is large enough to provide all of the truck’s power demands, it crosses over to being a hybrid. Natural gas has the lowest cost of all the alternative internal combustion engine fuels currently in use and generates the smallest carbon footprint. These advantages are offset in some drive/duty cycle applications by both high conversion and infrastructure costs. If a fleet has access to public natural gas fueling infrastructure, or if the quantity of fuel consumed at a given location is enough to justify the infrastructure investment required for a captive facility, natural gas has the potential to generate major energy cost savings. Compressed natural gas (CNG), currently the most commonly used natural gas variant, imposes weight and space penalties on trucks, so in many cases, it may not be feasible to convert existing trucks to use CNG. However, most of these weight and space issues can be addressed when designing new vehicles. Propane, also known as autogas, has the second-lowest carbon footprint of currently viable alternative fuels and is priced between natural gas and gasoline. It has the advantage of requiring the lowest infrastructure costs of any of the alternative fuels (other than electricity if major infrastructure investments are not required). It also has a much higher energy density than CNG and isstored at a lower pressure, so the tanks are lighter and cheaper. This makes it much easier to convert existing vehicles and more attractive for fleets with lower volumes per fueling facility. 6.
