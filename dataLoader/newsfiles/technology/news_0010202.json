A complete listing of the performance of the Maori players on the international stage can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maori_All_Blacks. In 2005 they even beat the British Lions Rugby team. This despite the fact that the Maoris make up only 14.9% of the total New Zealand population of about 4.4 million people.\nIn view of their success on the international stage it made only common sense that such talented players should be included in the All Black rugby team. Unfortunately some South African politicians have, in their meddling way, either closed or have not considered this avenue of competing as a 'South African black team ', thus honing their skills on the international stage, and instead made \"representivity\" rather than ability alone, a yardstick for inclusion into a single national South African rugby union team.\nThere could be many reasons why a black South African rugby union team has not materialised. It could be that, for various historic reasons, soccer has eclipsed rugby as the more popular game played by South Africa's black people.\nIn that case rugby union could only benefit if it can manage to popularise rugby amongst the country's black population, but one can certainly not dictate to people which sports they should play.", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maori_All_Blacks."], "published": "2015-09-21T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T09:15:32.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
