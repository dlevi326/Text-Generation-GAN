She spoke after a ceremony for the rollout of the first of the 52 F-35s that Norway will buy.\nMartin said the second round of testing is a milestone for the jet, which has wider wings than Air Force and Marine Corps versions, holds more fuel, and is designed to be catapulted off the deck of an aircraft carrier, and then land, using a special hook and heavy arresting gear.\n\"We're really pleased with the momentum that we've got with the Navy,\" she said. \"If you talk to the Navy's aviators, they know the aircraft has incredible importance for their ability to do what they need to do from the ship around the world.\"\nLockheed is building three models of the supersonic jet for the U.S. military and nine other countries: Britain, Australia, Norway, Italy, Turkey, the Netherlands, Israel, Japan and South Korea. Denmark and Canada are also considering orders.\nThe Pentagon plans to spend $391 billion to develop and produce 2,457 planes over the next few decades.\nTotal procurement is now slated to reach 3,150, but could rise, Martin told reporters this week.\nShe said the U.S. government is providing information about the aircraft to other countries, identified by sources familiar with the program as Singapore, Belgium, Switzerland, Poland, Finland and Spain.\nThe U.S. Marine Corps in July became the first service to declare an initial squadron of its F-35B jets ready for combat, with the Air Force due to follow suit next August.\nThe U.S. Navy, which carried out the first round of at-sea testing on the USS Nimitz last November, plans to have an initial squadron of jets ready for combat by late 2018 or early 2019.\nMartin said the jets' performance during the first round of carrier testing had helped build confidence in the program.\nThis time, one Lockheed and three government pilots will be using the jet's improved Generation-3 helmet, which is already being used for testing on land. They will fly with a full store of internal weapons and full fuel tanks to test the jet's performance at higher weights. There are no plans to fire the weapons, officials said.\nU.S. defense officials said the tests would also include catapult takeoffs with after-burner power, more night approaches and landings, engine runs for maintainers and other parameters aimed at creating conditions that are more similar to combat.\nThey said the tests would not include a portable version of the F-35's complex, computer-based logistics system, with the data required to be relayed via communications links instead.\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Matthew Lewis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T22:10:17.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
