But sources inside the SA Police Service (Saps) have told City Press their management will try to argue that the increase in violent crime was not as high as last year’s spike.\nIn an effort to reduce violent crime and speed up the arrest of perpetrators, the police have come to an agreement with the SABC to regularly flight pictures of some of the country’s most wanted criminals.\nPhiyega is also under pressure because she has until Monday to respond to President Jacob Zuma ’s instruction that she give him reasons for why she should not be suspended pending an inquiry into her fitness to hold office.", "external_links": ["http://whoswho.co.za/jacob-zuma-927", "http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=927", "http://whoswho.co.za/mangwashi-phiyega-24877", "http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=24877"], "published": "2015-09-28T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T23:03:50.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
