If so, it’– and fast. \nThe European Union’s Data Protection Directive (1998) prohibits the transfer of personal information outside of the European Economic Area unless the receiving country ensures an adequate level of privacy protection. Soon after the Directive was passed, the European Commission determined that the US doesn’t offer adequate levels of protection. Safe Harbor agreement in 2000 to allow US companies to self-certify that they provide protections that are equivalent to the requirements of the Data Protection Directive. \nCurrently, over 4,000 US companies rely on the EU-US Safe Harbor program to make their transfer of personal data from the EU to the US legal under European privacy laws. But in light of the opinion issued today by ECJ Advocate General Yves Bot in the Schrem case, there’s a very high risk that the Safe Harbor program will be invalidated by the European Court of Justice, which is the EU’s highest court. The AG found that the Commission’s decision (made 15 years ago) that the US-EU Safe Harbor program ’s disclosures) about the transfer of personal information from companies such as Facebook Ireland to the NSA under the PRISM intelligence program. \nThe ECJ will issue its ruling on the Schrem case before the end of 2015, and possibly sooner.

BCRs need to be approved by the relevant national information commissioners, and this is a lengthy process (potentially 18 months or more). ’ Contracts between the exporting and receiving entities. The European Commission has provided model clauses that can be incorporated into agreements to ensure adequate protection of the transferred personal data In the UK, companies may be able to make their own adequacy determinations under guidance issued by the UK’s Office \nHowever, there’s a very important caveat that would apply to all of these alternatives except possibly the data subject consent option: If your company could receive a subpoena from the NSA or other US government agency to disclose the personal data of EU residents, then the BCRs and contracts would presumably face the same weakness that the Safe Harbor faces: a fundamental incompatibility between EU data protection law and the powers of US government agencies to conduct intelligence operations and require US companies to comply. \nThe larger question of the international conflict between protecting privacy and enabling intelligence activities aimed at increasing the safety of the public (and, potentially, various other national interests)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T03:02:47.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
