The fact that VMware is growing — 10 per cent last year compared to its parent’s anaemic 2 per cent — has emboldened the activists.\nVMware management believes the share price is a short-term issue: “Clearly, the issue at the highest level is EMC as an entity has outperformed the industry in growth rates and such and underperformed in the stock price, it’s that simple,” Mr Gelsinger told The Australian .\n“The question for the board is how to get better share price performance. Shareholder activists are pretty simple folk.\n“Their common denominator is stock price, their objective is to as quickly as possible drive change that increases shareholder value. We’ve laid out our strategies with both businesses on what we think will work and I believe in the long term we’ll be rewarded for that.”\nPart of the plan is to broaden its product range, from endpoint device security, following its Airwatch acquisition last year, to software-defined data centres to power the next generation of in-house computing services.\nThe key shift remains the cloud. “Every company has this challenge ahead of them and we’re not any different.”\nVMware’s key strategy is to push its Unified Hybrid Cloud offering of technologies that connect enterprise networks with private and public cloud offerings, such as the VCloud Air service it launched in Australia last year with Telstra as its highest-profile partner.\nDuncan Bennet, VMware’s Australia and New Zealand manager, doesn’t see the cloud service’s tie up with Telstra as a handbrake to adoption in the Australian market. “It’s not an exclusive relationship, it’s a location for the data centre.”\nMr Bennet sees bridging the gap between on-premise and cloud data centres, along with management of mobile devices, as the key opportunities for VMware in Australia.\nThe Unified Hybrid Cloud was the main theme of the company’s announcements at the annual conference, where VMWare showcased the range of products intended to grow its customer base. A Microsoft cameo is becoming a regular thing at Bay Area tech events these days and, true to form, the two announced a joint product to manage Windows 10 devices.\n“There’s nothing new about ‘co-opetition’,” Mr Gelsinger said. “There are plenty of areas we’re going to compete with Microsoft, hyper-V versus VSphere, we’re going to fight to the death.”\nIn a shifting marketplace and with activist shareholders on EMC’s tail, VMWare’s management faces a substantial task in training its virtualised elephant to dance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T09:47:39.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
