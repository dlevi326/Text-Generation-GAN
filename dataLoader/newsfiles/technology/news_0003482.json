Holguin is with you!\" Holguin's Plaza of the Revolution was packed with an estimated 150 000 people for the Mass, many dressed in white to protect them from the sun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:17:46.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
