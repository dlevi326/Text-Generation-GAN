Software such as AdBlock Plus is increasingly popular with users who don't want to see pop-ups, banner adverts and pre-roll advertising on videos.\nBut this starves websites of advertising revenue, and it appears that Google is hitting back.\nSeveral Twitter users have reported being presented with lengthy adverts when viewing videos on Google-owned YouTube - with no option to skip them.\n:: News Apps: Give Us Your Views \nThe adverts appear despite ad-blocking programs being installed, meaning Google may have found a way to bypass the software.\nThe issue has only been reported on Google's Chrome browser at the moment, and only some users have reported seeing adverts.\nOne user posted a screengrab of a three-minute advert playing on YouTube which they could not skip.\nThey wrote: \"A three-minute ad? Really? I have AdBlock also how is this even possible?\"\nSeveral Twitter users claimed that people were effectively being \"punished\" for using advert-blocking software.\nBut Ben Williams, from AdBlock Plus, says the adverts only appeared because of an \"issue in Chrome\" which it expects Google to fix.\nSky News has contacted Google for a comment.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:58:09.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
