The firm, which was intially set up as a hobby by a software programmer who wanted to sell a broken laser pointer pen, has created around 2,000 eBay millionaires in the UK alone in that time.\nPeople use eBay to buy and sell things. Those wanting to buy the goods can compete with other potential purchasers by bidding their own prices for the goods until a deadline passes.\neBay's headquarters are in the USA. Such has been the success of the model that some people even make a living from it. The company has around 25 million sellers and 157 million buyers worldwide. It has a stock market value of more than 32 billion US dollars (£21 billion).\nThe University of Kent academic and business forecaster, Professor Richard Scase, says that eBay has transformed business and retailing.\n\"Governments try to create entrepreneurs and generally fail. Over the past 20 years eBay has done it for more than 25 million sellers.\n\"... destroying the relevance of geographical and national boundaries. With tablets, laptops and smartphones, teenagers through to pensioners can be international traders.\"\n– Professor Richard Scase, University of Kent eBay first came to Britain in 1999. The site attracts 18 million visitors every month. There are more than 200,000 businesses trading through eBay, some of them in the South and South East. Six years ago there were just 123,000 UK businesses on the site.\nThe firm has an app for mobile phone users, and says it is planning to improve its international services for sellers across the world.\n\"We're working hard to ignite the entrepreneurial spirit of small businesses, providing them with the tools and the flexibility to export millions of British goods abroad, despite lacking the infrastructure of a traditional exporter.\n\"Selling can be very easy to do on eBay and for many businesses, it's changed their lives.\"\n– Sarah Calcott, Director of Operations, eBay UK Last updated Thu 3 Sep 2015 Read more 4 updates 20 years of buying and selling online: The weird and wonderful world of eBay Business eBay Essex", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:59:19.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
