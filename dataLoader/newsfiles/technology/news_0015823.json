(NASDAQ:CMTL) today reported its operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2015. \nNet sales for the three months ended July 31, 2015 were $77.5 million compared to $89.4 million for the three months ended July 31, 2014. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower net sales in the Company's telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments, partially offset by higher net sales in its RF microwave amplifiers segment. GAAP net income was $5.5 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the three months ended July 31, 2015 as compared to $8.0 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the three months ended July 31, 2014. \nNet sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015 were $307.3 million compared to $347.2 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2014. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower net sales in the Company's telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments, partially offset by higher net sales in its RF microwave amplifiers segment. GAAP net income was $23.2 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015 as compared to $25.2 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2014. \nThe Company also announced that it expects consolidated net sales and operating income in fiscal 2016 to be similar to the levels it achieved in fiscal 2015. The Company projects that sales for fiscal 2016 will be between $300.0 million and $310.0 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be between $1.34 and $1.50. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2016 is expected to be in the range of $50.0 million to $54.0 million. \nIn commenting on the Company's fiscal 2015 performance and fiscal 2016 business outlook, Dr. Stanton Sloane, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our fiscal 2015 performance reflects the fact that many of our international customers have been impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar and by the plunge in oil prices.” \nDr. Sloane added, “As we look to fiscal 2016, we do not believe that market conditions will meaningfully improve. We continue to implement certain organizational changes including expanding our marketing and business development functions in order to position us for growth when end market conditions for our customers improve.” \nSelected Fiscal 2015 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Metrics and Other Items Backlog as of July 31, 2015 was $117.7 million compared to $133.4 million as of July 31, 2014.

Adjusted EBITDA was $12.0 million and $51.8 million for the three and twelve months ended July 31, 2015, respectively, as compared to $16.7 million and $61.3 million for the three and twelve months ended July 31, 2014, respectively.
