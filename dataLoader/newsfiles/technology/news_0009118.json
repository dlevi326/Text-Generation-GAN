The findings, which provide travel buyers with comprehensive data to plan and budget for the coming year, show the industry’s travel will be affected by changing oil prices, and reduced air and hotel traffic in key locations.\nMonisa Cline, senior vice president, CWT Energy, Resources & Marine, said, “Travel conditions in the energy, resources & marine industry are changing in many different and complex ways. This report is designed to help our clients understand the implications of these developments, and to ensure their programs remain as efficient and effective as possible.”\nThe 2016 Energy, Resources and Marine Forecast highlights a general trend of increasing airfares, as well as specific conditions in those parts of the world that have a concentration of energy, resources & marine industry activity.\nJohn Vawter, vice president, CWT Energy, Resources & Marine, Americas, added, “Our forecast looks at detail, as well as the wider picture. For example, Houston could see more volatile airfares in light of reduced travel demand, yet we’ve seen more international carriers entering this market. We also know the continued economic uncertainty in Europe means there will be shifting demand and therefore inconsistent pricing. Since these factors all have an impact on how travel buyers plan, the report also provides ways in which they can adjust their tactical planning both to accentuate the positive changes and minimize the negative ones.”\nThe report, which is free to download, also examines new technology and online booking tools, looking at the data to identify program improvements and looking at whether travel apps are a good fit for travelers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T23:47:06.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
