That, to say the least, was a disgrace to the nation.\nIt was really disturbing to learn that 253 teachers only managed to obtain an average of 57%, which, mind you, is below entry requirements into any Engineering discipline at a respectable academic institution. It still perplexes me how it was possible for teachers to have been allowed to teach what they themselves have poor knowledge of. From a much more personal perspective, I wonder how I could have studied engineering had I ever been one of their learners; after all, it’s not easy for a student to out-perform his master.\nThe Department of Education and the media are not doing enough to avoid recurrence of such a disgrace. There are currently a lot of education programmes fighting the struggle of our uneducated nation, but the Department of Education has turned a blind eye to such programmes as far as adequate funding is concerned. The media also has a hand in our uneducated nation remaining uneducated – just not enough publicity is being diverted towards such programmes. Instead, most attention is given to celebrities’ dirty laundries and lifestyles. Perhaps if such initiatives were put in the open like they should, private sectors would extend a helping hand with funding.\nA very good example of an education programme which should be given attention in all its aspects is one pioneered by a group of young professionals who run by the name “Rainbow Tutors” on social media. Their company is registered under the name “Leaders Bridge Tutors” and their sole purpose is to empower scholars through the written word, get them into the rhythm of reading and show them how magical education can be; their primary goal is to groom tomorrow’s leaders. This education programme has been operational for quite some time and making a difference at under-privileged schools, but recognition has not been granted to it. Why? Why are these young leaders not funded? How they can they grow if they are not given a platform to?\nIt is not very far from the truth to say there is a visible gap between our secondary level curriculum and our tertiary level curriculum (especially Universities). For that gap to be breached, those who did not succumb to the gap’s monstrous width must step up and teach leadership, the new leadership, leadership 2.0! And that right there is exactly what the likes of “Leaders Bridge Tutors” are doing. They have a dream, their dream is to make education fashionable, their dream is to be the academic Messiah who extends his healing hand to the entire rainbow nation, create an inductive “domino effect” of help across the country. As the saying goes, the sexiest and hottest outfit to wear is a graduation gown.\nThe “Leaders Bridge Tutors” would like to see more sexy and hot young people… attention South Africa, Leadership 2.0 cannot lead without you following!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:10:45.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
