Now, as it faces stiff competition from rival exchanges to lure the next hot IPO, it's reaching out to business startups before they go public. \nNew York-based Nasdaq, through an affiliated foundation, is opening what it calls an \"Entrepreneurial Center\" Thursday in a trendy commercial district south of San Francisco's Market Street. It's promising business training, mentoring and networking opportunities for early stage startup founders -- maybe even the next Mark Zuckerberg or Larry Page. \nThe move comes as Nasdaq's chief rival, the New York Stock Exchange, has increased its outreach to the tech sector in recent years and has lured some high-profile startups like Twitter. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
