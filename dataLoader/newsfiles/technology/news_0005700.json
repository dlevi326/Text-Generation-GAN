No problem.\nAccept a monitor to report back to the government? Bring it on, especially if the company gets to approve the monitor.\nTurn over executives responsible for the crimes? Under the bus they go.\nBut no guilty pleas for the corporate parent.\nThat’s why people who follow corporate crime prosecutions closely are taking the release of a memo from the Justice Department that will implement new policies to go after individual corporate executives with a grain of salt.\nAlso read: DOJ’s new focus on individual prosecutions may be response to judicial challenges\nNews outlets are reporting that with the memo, the Department of Justice is “cracking down on corporate crime.”\nDon’t believe the hype.\nHad the Justice Department coupled its memo with one prohibiting the use of deferred and nonprosecution agreements for corporate criminal wrongdoing and required corporate guilty pleas — that would have been the tip off that the department is serious about corporate crime.\nInstead, the department announced a “new policy” that should have been policy all along — require the corporate criminal to cooperate with federal prosecutors to get cooperation credit.\nBrandon Garrett is a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, an expert on corporate crime, and author of the book, “Too Big to Jail: How Prosecutors Compromise with Corporations” (Harvard University Press, 2015).\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://www.brandonlgarrett.com/toobigtojail/"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:23:07.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
