Bradley Kanaris Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Paul Smith The competition watchdog is considering an inquiry into the actions of Australian banks for shutting down accounts of local bitcoin operators, after being contacted by Queensland Nationals Senator Matthew Canavan.\nSenator Canavan, who was part of a recent Senate Committee looking at bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, sent a letter to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims on Tuesday morning after a report in The Australian Financial Review revealed Australian banks were closing down the accounts of bitcoin businesses without explanation. In it he asks the ACCC to investigate whether the banks were involved in anti-competitive conduct.\nBanks have sent letters advising account closures to at least 17 Australian bitcoin companies, with 13 already having had their accounts closed. Senator Canavan expressed concerns that the banks were putting the viability and potential of a dynamic local industry at risk, in order to avoid competing with the emerging companies.\n\"The actions by the banks would appear to directly engage competition in the financial services industry as it stands now – and, by effectively nipping in the bud the growth of potential competitors, is likely to substantially reduce the potential for future competition to the detriment of consumers in the future,\" Senator Canavan wrote.\nNationals Senator Matthew Canavan has written to the ACCC calling for an inquiry into banks cutting off accounts for bitcoin exchanges. Jesse Marlow \"The reasons for the apparently co-ordinated nature of the decisions by the major banks should also be investigated. On the face of it, these actions raise legitimate concerns about the degree to which collusive behaviour on the part of the dominant industry players was present.\"\nLack of explanation Chairman of industry body the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association Ron Tucker, whose company Bit Trade is set to be \"debanked\" by Westpac, told The Financial Review on Monday that companies were being left in the dark about the reasons for their accounts being closed. One bitcoin exchange founder, who requested anonymity for fear of further raising the ire of banks, said his company had been left trying to get answers off low level call centre bank workers, to no avail.\n\"We are trying to collaborate with banks and are trying to get other arrangements in place but we haven't heard anything back and I don't know why,\" the company founder said.\n \"It may be about competition but it is not the right approach to just block other companies, without explaining your concerns.\"\nWhen contacted about the matter Mr Sims said he had received Senator Canavan's letter and was considering how to proceed.\nSenator Canavan said his office had been contacted by businesses in the sector that were concerned about sudden account closures. He said that, in the light of news of Australian banks exploring the potential benefits of digital currency for their own business needs , an inquiry appeared to be warranted on a number of grounds.\nThese were the refusal to supply products or services without proper reason or clear justification, and misuse of market power – in particular whether the banking industry has engaged in conduct that takes advantage of its substantial market power for an illegal purpose.\nMoney laundering and terrorism Acting chief executive of the Australian Bankers' Association Tony Pearson earlier said banks were obliged to close accounts if they couldn't see a full payments trail under anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws.\nSenator Canavan said the ACCC should look at this as part of its investigation and consider whether the bitcoin companies were being treated unfairly.\n\"I would also ask that the issue of possible incompatibility of digital currency businesses with anti-money laundering/counter-terrorism funding laws, which have been raised as a possible reason for the banks refusal of service, be investigated,\" the senator wrote.\n\"In particular, the question of what documentary evidence/internal legal advice was considered prior to the decisions by different banks to close their customers' accounts.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/101552183386293013225/posts", "https://twitter.com/@SaysSmithy"], "published": "2015-09-22T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:20:47.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
