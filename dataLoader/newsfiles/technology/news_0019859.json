Google Inc. last year introduced an Android operating system as a software solution for wearable manufacturers.\nSource: Samsung via Bloomberg \\r \\r Apple Inc. sold 3.6 million watches in the second quarter, making it the top provider of smart wearable devices after just one quarter of sales, market research firm IDC said in a report last week.\nWhile Samsung didn’t release any apps for the Gear S2 on Tuesday, the new watch will allow for mobile payments, smart car keys and remote control of home devices, the South Korean company said in a statement.\nFitbit Inc. dominates the basic wearables market with 4.4 million units sold in the second quarter, according to IDC. Basic wearables differ from smart wearables in that they don’t run third-party applications. Other companies making fitness wearables include Garmin Ltd. and Jawbone Inc.\nIDC estimates that the smart-devices sector will grow to 89 million units in 2019 from 33 million this year, surpassing sales of basic wearables, which are forecast to increase to 66 million units in 2019 from 39 million this year.\nThe new Samsung watch features a 1.2-inch circular screen with a thickness of 11.4 millimeters.
