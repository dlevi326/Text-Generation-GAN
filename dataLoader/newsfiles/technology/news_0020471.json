It Has a Whole New Look for the Mobile Age Tech giant unveils a flexible collection of colorful icons By Kristina Monllos September 1, 2015, 12:34 PM EDT Advertising & Branding Google's branding just got a makeover. The 17-year-old tech leader today released its new serif-free logo with a two-minute video showcasing the evolving ways consumers use Google's many digital services, from search to navigation. \"So why are we doing this now? Once upon a time, Google was one destination that you reached from one device: a desktop PC,\" wrote Google's Tamar Yehoshua, vp of product management, and Bobby Nath, director of user experience, on the company's blog. \"These days, people interact with Google products across many different platforms, apps and devicesâ€”sometimes all in a single day.\" Here's the new logo: But the new logo isn't the whole story. Google created the look as a way to introduce its new \"identity family,\" which shows the myriad ways Google works for consumers, including on your \"mobile phone, TV, watch, the dashboard in your car and yes, even a desktop.\" By creating a collection of visual elements around the logo, Google can carry over the look across any app or tool. For example, \"a colorful Google mic help you identify and interact with Google whether you're talking, tapping or typing.\" \"As you'll see, we've taken the Google logo and branding, which were originally built for a single desktop browser page, and updated them for a world of seamless computing across an endless number of devices and different kinds of inputs (such as tap, type and talk),\" the brand wrote. Google created this GIF to highlight the continuity of the logo and its associated elements: The small \"g\" icon, seen on platforms like Gmail, will be replaced with a multi-colored \"G,\" which matches the new logo design. The update, released today, will soon make its way across all of Google's properties, like Search, Maps, Gmail, Chrome and others. \"We think we've taken the best of Google (simple, uncluttered, colorful, friendly),\" the brand's leadership team writes, \"and recast it not just for the Google of today, but for the Google of the future.\" Watch the video explaining the transformation: Get the Advertising & Branding newsletter: \nCheck out our other newsletters: Daily Digest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T20:07:38.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
