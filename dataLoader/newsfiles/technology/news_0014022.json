The inaugural Boomerang Commerce Retail Analytics Report for Consumer Electronics analyzes 1,200 items and examines how Best Buy, Jet, Target and Walmart compete online against Amazon. Surprisingly, among the items in the sample, Walmart has higher consumer electronics prices than the online competitors examined. \nTWEET THIS http://ctt.ec/Kee4L : Most expensive #bigbox #eTailer in consumer electronics = @Walmart says @boomerangcommer #RetailAnalyticsReport http://ctt.ec/Kee4L+ \nKey findings in the Boomerang Commerce Retail Analytics Report for Consumer Electronics show the following: Best Buy, Jet, Target and Walmart lag significantly behind Amazon in their product assortments. Closest competitor Walmart has 32.9 percent product assortment overlap with Amazon, while Best Buy and Jet overlap by 29.5 percent and 16.4 percent, respectively. Overall Jet most closely matches Amazon on price , averaging only 1.4 percent higher. Walmart has the highest prices, which average 8.3 percent higher than Amazon among the most popular (or “head,” in retail nomenclature) products. Amazon competes very aggressively with discounts, offering an average of 66 percent off list prices. The top 5 most popular brands are Sony, Samsung, Fujifilm, Asus and Dell. These appear most frequently at Best Buy and Walmart. \n“Retailers will not survive the modern world of omni-channel sales without a proper assortment strategy,” says Guru Hariharan, CEO and founder of Boomerang Commerce. “Product selection and pricing directly impacts consumers’ experience, buying habits and loyalty. This Boomerang Commerce Retail Analytics Report illustrates just how far retailers’ pricing and assortment currently lag behind Amazon.” \nAmazon’s Consumer Electronics Assortment, Pricing and Discounts Prove Tough to Beat – But Not Impossible \nAccording to the Boomerang Commerce Retail Analytics Report for Consumer Electronics, competition among retailers is fiercest among the most popular (or “head”) products. Amazon’s closest competitor Walmart offers only 39.3 percent of the sample product assortment and is priced more than 8.3 percent higher. Despite Amazon’s clear domination, competing retailers could lure consumer electronics consumers by substantially expanding their assortments and offering lower average prices to improve consumers’ price perception. \nThe report also shows Amazon is outmaneuvering its competition with mass discounts that average 66 percent off list prices. This strategy presents competitors an opportunity to become more aggressive with discounts. Currently, Target offers the smallest list price discount at 15 percent. Walmart and Best Buy discounts average 22 percent and 19.9 percent, respectively. In contrast, Jet’s membership-focused business model is to sell at cost rather than offer discounts. \nThe Boomerang Commerce Retail Analytics Reports and Methodology \nBoomerang Commerce Retail Analytics Reports are produced monthly, and each report features a different product category. In this report on consumer electronics, Boomerang analyzed 1,200 items across 490 unique brands during a two-day period in August 2015 throughout the online stores of five top retailers: Amazon, Best Buy, Jet, Target and Walmart. Using a combination of machine learning and big data analytics, Boomerang has created proprietary methods for analyzing actual, current consumer pricing and product assortment. The analysis is based on best-seller items on the Internet, as well as a selected assortment of moderate- and low-popularity products.
