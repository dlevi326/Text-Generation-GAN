Source: Instagram\nInstagram has a radical new look: On Thursday, the Facebook Inc.-owned mobile app introduced portrait and landscape orientation, allowing social shutterbugs to avoid cropping out gathered friends or that perfect pair of shoes.\nThe app will continue to let users post images and video in its traditional square format. However, the additional options could help Instagram appeal to serious photographers and maintain its dominance in the increasingly crowded photo-sharing app space.\n“It turns out that nearly one in five photos or videos people post aren’t in the square format, and we know that it hasn’t been easy to share this type of content on Instagram: friends get cut out of group shots, the subject of your video feels cramped, and you can’t capture the Golden Gate Bridge from end to end,” Instagram wrote in a blog post .\nInstagram users for years have resorted to third-party apps like InstaFit to post photos to Instagram without cropping them. More than 1 million people have downloaded InstaFit and more than 60 million photos have been resized and posted to Instagram from the app, according to its App Store description.\nThe new aspect ratio is also available for videos, a major focus of social networks competing for mobile advertising. With this update, users will be able to share widescreen videos. The company paired its announcement of the new feature with an exclusive landscape video from the upcoming “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”\nInstagram’s move coincides with consumers increasingly purchasing smart phones with larger screens that provide a better mobile viewing experience for widescreen videos. The app also stepped up its video game today by announcing the same filters will work on both photos and videos.\nThe update is available on Android and iOS, so users can start fitting their whole “skinny arm” poses or the entire group in their shots right away.\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": ["http://blog.instagram.com/post/127722429412/150827-portrait-and-landscape", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KA964_INSTAG_G_20150827153315.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-28T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:26:33.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
