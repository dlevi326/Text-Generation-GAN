The new model rounds out Sony's line of 4K professional cameras, filling an important niche between cameras like Sony's PXW-FS7 and the NEX-FS700, or complementing Sony's new consumer a7R II and a7S II models. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140206/LA60150LOGO \nAs a companion camera or on its own, the PXW-FS5 fits a range of applications, including documentary and independent filmmaking, online content creation, student film projects and even DSLR users looking to \"step up.\" \n\"We are continually developing and growing the most complete, fully featured line of cameras for every level of production, and the new FS5 model is the missing piece our customers need,\" said Francois Gauthier, Director of Digital Imaging, Sony's Professional Solutions Americas. \"Sony has the right production tool for any application - HD, 2K or 4K - and for any budget.\" \nThe PXW-FS5 is ergonomically designed for versatile, hand-held shooting. The lightweight body has excellent weight balance, ensuring reliability and all-day comfort. It can be used in almost any location, even airborne when mounted on a drone. A variety of shooting angles is possible with the one-touch rotatable grip. All key controls are at the user's fingertips, allowing for shooting flexibility and instant switching between low or high angle shooting. \nUsers can attach the 3.5-inch type LCD panel to different positions on the handle or the compact camera body, further supporting easy handheld operation and customized shooting. \nCapable of 4K XAVC high-definition shooting, the camera's Super35 Exmor(TM) CMOS sensor incorporates 11.6 million pixels and 8.3 million effective pixels. The high sensitivity and large size of the sensor delivers background defocus, increased low-light sensitivity and lower image noise. High-quality imagery is further ensured by high frame rate cache recording at 10-bit 4:2:2 Full HD and a high frame rate of up to 240 fps, in 8 second bursts, which makes 1/10 times Super Slow Motion possible without sacrificing bit depth or loss of image quality. \nThe PXW-FS5 is the first Super35 camcorder to feature built-in electronic variable ND filters, further expanding the depth of field representation by the large-format sensor and enabling flexible exposure control. \nThe compact power zoom E lens PZ 18-105mm F4 G OSS (SELP18105G), provided in the PXW-FS5K kit model enables zoom operation with one hand. \nIntegrating easily with other camera lenses, Sony's a Mount System offers compatibility with both Sony and third-party lenses. The PXW-FS5's E-mount can take virtually any lens, such as SLR lenses via an adapter, as well as Sony's E-mount and A-mount lenses, ensuring the camera adapts to multiple environments. Sony's a Mount System and its enhanced interfaces include 3G-SDI, HDMI output and dual SD card slots. Also equipped with Wi-Fi and a wired LAN terminal, the PXW-FS5 features enhanced network functions such as file transfer and streaming transmission. A planned future firmware update will provide RAW output. \nKey features of the PXW-FS5: \nFlexible handheld shooting with a lightweight body \nThe lightweight (1 lb., 13.2 oz.) body with excellent weight balance ensures comfortable handheld shooting as well as an easy fit with a drone or gimbal. The one-touch rotatable grip enables instant switching between low or high angle shooting. Shooting parameters can be changed with one hand even during recording by using the multi-functional grip. The zoom can be operated similarly with a single hand. The detachable handle, one-touch rotatable grip and flexible LCD panel support various shooting styles. \n4K shooting and 240 fps high-speed shooting \nThe camera is equipped with an 11.6 million pixel Super35 Exmor(TM) CMOS Sensor, enabling 4K XAVC long GoP high-definition video shooting. It is the world's first Super35 camcorder with a built-in electronic variable ND filter, supporting linear control from 1/4ND to 1/128ND and further expanding the depth of field representation. 1/10 times Super Slow Motion reproduction is possible through 10-bit 4:2:2 full HD 240fps High Frame Rate, with no sensor cropping. Low light capabilities and background defocus are heightened by the high sensitivity and large sensor size. 14 stops of latitude in exposure deliver strong grayscale rendition without crushing shadows or blowing out light details. \nVariety of shooting applications and rich network functions \nThe camera's interfaces include 3G-SDI, 4K HDMI output, MI shoe, dual SD card slots, Wi-Fi and wired LAN terminal, supporting various system configurations. The Clear Image Zoom feature allows users to zoom in at up to 2x, even with a fixed focal length lens. \nFind out more about the PXW-FS5 at www.sony.com/fs5 . \nThe PXW-FS5 is planned to be available in November 2015, at the following suggested list pricing: -- PXW-FS5, body only -- $6,699 -- PXW-FS5K, with lens -- $7,299 \nConnect with Sony Professional Solutions Americas:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:59:47.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
