The family of complementary peripherals features four adapters designed for 4K Ultra HD and two for traditional HD. This new line of products follows the launch of the Kensington SD4000 Universal USB Docking Station, which enables business users to leverage 4K Monitors or Dual Monitors in business applications without the need to upgrade their laptop with a costly 4K graphics card. The introduction of the Kensington 4K Video Adapters continues to build on the company's commitment to creating a rich user experience through greater efficiency and improved productivity, particularly in the office environment. Today's typical business user views a document while multiple applications run in the background, such as email. Moving from one window to the next or pulling up a new app or web browser requires the user to lose focus, making it more time-consuming to complete tasks. Studies have shown that increasing screen size with Ultra HD resolution -- which Kensington's 4K USB Docking Station and 4K Video Adapters facilitate -- helps eliminate these issues. The new family of products includes the following 4K Video Adapters: Kensington VU4000 4K Video Adapter with USB 3.0 to HDMI connection (SKU K33988WW; SRP: $99.99) and Kensington VU4000D 4K Video Adapter with USB 3.0 to DisplayPort connection (SKU K33989WW; SRP: $99.99) The VU4000 4K Video Adapter with USB 3.0 to HDMI connection plugs into a USB 3.0 port on a laptop to connect to the HDMI video cable.
