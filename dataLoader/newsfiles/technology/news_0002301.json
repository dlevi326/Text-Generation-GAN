The competition will consist of three challenges and take place in an outdoor open arena. \nChallenge one requires an unmanned aerial vehicle to locate, track and land on top of a moving ground vehicle. Challenge two requires an unmanned ground vehicle to locate and reach a second ground vehicle, and locate and physically operate a valve on a side of the vehicle. \nThe final challenge requires a team of unmanned aerial vehicles to collaborate to search, locate, track, pick and place a set of static and moving objects. The Grand Challenge will combine all three of the individual challenges. So far 316 teams from 163 institutions in 45 countries have expressed an intention to participate in the competition, organised by Khalifa University that boasts prizes and team sponsorship totalling Dh15 million.\nnewsdesk@thenational.ae", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T06:14:44.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
