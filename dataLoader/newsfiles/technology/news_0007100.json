Teavana’s innovative take on this trend includes loose leaf teas inspired by cider and infused with spices and dried fruits. \n“There has been a revival of the American tradition of producing hard ciders,” said Naoko Tsunoda, tea authority and director of tea development at Teavana. “With this in mind, we reinvented the flavors of ciders into brewed tea and created new epicurean blends with botanical ingredients.” \nEvery Saturday and Sunday from September 12 through October 18, Teavana stores in the U.S. will offer a complimentary “flight” or samples of the cider-inspired teas, for customers who wish to taste them side by side. \nIn addition to the complimentary tea cider flight, customers may try individual samples of Spiced Apple Cider throughout the week from September 12 through October 18, while supplies last and those who purchase one pound of any tea cider or cider combination, will receive a 20 percent ;discount from participating stores. \n“If you follow the wine industry, flights are a standard now,” said Tsunoda. “For the first time, we will provide tea flights, so customers can taste and compare our three tea ciders that are light, medium and full-bodied in flavor.” \nFlights of Tea: \nPoached Pear Cider The most subtle flavor of the tea cider collection, the new Poached Pear Cider is a nuanced blend of pear with citrus, lemongrass and soft spices. \n“We wanted to create a tea with the taste of an epicurean dessert, similar to the poached pear that you find in French cuisine. White hibiscus adds a bright flavor to the medley of sweet apples, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves,” she said. \nSpiced Apple Cider A seasonal favorite at Teavana, Spiced Apple Cider is medium-bodied and starts with red rooibos tea, blended with sweet cinnamon spice, apple, chicory, plum and red hibiscus. \n“Spiced Apple Cider is one of our most popular blends that we offer in the fall,” said Tsunoda. “It tastes wonderful as a brewed tea or you can take it an extra step and mull it with apple cider.” \nMulled Pomegranate Cider A full-bodied blend, the Mulled Pomegranate Cider is new to the tea cider collection and is made with pomegranate, a juicy medley of red and black berries and spices. \n“Pomegranate is beloved as a super fruit and has a rich culinary history in Persian cuisine,” said Tsunoda. “Mulled Pomegranate Cider makes a deliciously vibrant iced tea and is also amazing sparkled with seltzer or with a blush rosé.” \nSOURCE: Starbucks Like what you are reading?
