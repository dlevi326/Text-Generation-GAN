On Tuesday, hundreds of people angry about the deaths circled the town's police station and protested. The police, outnumbered, opened fire again. Two people were killed and another three were hospitalised with critical injuries.\nPolice imposed a curfew on Tuesday night and deployed paramilitary forces amid heavy tension in Churachandpur town, 70km southwest of the state capital of Imphal.\nLawmaker N Biren Singh said the law demanding people provide proof that their families lived in Manipur before 1951 is aimed at keeping \"outsiders\", including migrants, from settling in the state bordering Myanmar. But Singh said authorities had no plans to begin checking documents soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T22:01:50.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
