YunoJuno provides a platform that connects freelancers with employers.\n(PRWEB UK) 28 September 2015\nMicrosoft Gold Partner, TVision Technology has successfully delivered Microsoft Dynamics NAV for London based professional services company, YunoJuno.\nEstablished in 2012 to build a platform and community for freelancers, YunoJuno has rapidly grown. YunoJuno has a single bold vision, to create “The Future of Work”, achieved through enabling freelancers and employers to connect with each other in a direct, transparent and cost-effective way.\nOne of the services provided is to manage freelancer invoicing and payments. As the company grew, the need for a finance system that could cope with projected growth and provide a platform for greater integration with YunoJuno’s portal, led to the selection of Microsoft Dynamics NAV.\n“We chose Dynamics NAV as the leading Dynamics solution for the UK,” Harpreet Sahota, Financial Controller, YunoJuno. “The user interface and integration with MS Office is very impressive.”\nPhase one of the project addressed key finance and freelancer invoicing requirements. Freelancers enter timesheets via a portal; YunoJuno then manage invoicing of the employers without delaying payment to the freelancer. As most of this is managed on YunoJuno’s web portal, the phase one requirement was fairly standard sales and purchase invoicing.\n“We were confident that most accounting packages could meet our day one needs.” Harpreet Sahota, “the key was a system that has the ability to fulfil our phase two needs of seamless integration with the YunoJuno portal. Dynamics NAV has the tools and TVision Technology has the experience of both NAV to website integration and working with companies similar to YunoJuno.”\nPhase one was delivered within eight weeks and successfully went live on Microsoft Windows Azure Cloud platform as planned in August 2015.\n“This has been a great project to work on,” Nicki Stewart, TVision Technology, “NAV is now very affordable for growing companies such as YunoJuno. More importantly it is also very accessible. YunoJuno’s team impressed us with how quickly they picked up how NAV works, a credit to them and also to the user-friendliness of NAV. We look forward to a long and happy partnership.”\n //www.prweb.com/releases/tvision/09/prweb12982661.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/tvision/09/prweb12982661.htm", "https://www.yunojuno.com/", "http://www.tvisiontech.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-09-28T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T19:52:35.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
