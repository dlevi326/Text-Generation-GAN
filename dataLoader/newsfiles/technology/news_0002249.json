Are you kidding me? No one gets a second chance. You've had yours and you botched it. Thatâ€™s political life.\nA person is hired by his track record. A good track record counts in your favour and a bad one not so much. Your track record stinks all over South Africa let alone in the Cape. Do you think voters are naive and gullible?\nDo you think that voters have short memories? In order to get voted into power you need to prove that you are better than the existing government. You need to outdo the current WP government in Gauteng and all other places where you are in power at the moment.\nGood luck with that. Till then forget about the Cape. In fact very soon you will be usurped all over SA. So you should get used to begging for favours from the voters, you will soon need to plea again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:15:35.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
