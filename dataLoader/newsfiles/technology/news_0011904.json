Many of the core committers from the Apache Kafka community will share key learnings from implementing a stream data pipeline and real-world use cases. The Apache Kafka Summit call for submissions is now open: www.kafka-summit.org/cfp . \n\"Kafka is transforming how businesses fundamentally operate and manage stream data, from building better products to providing personalized customer experiences and adapting in real time,\" said Jay Kreps, CEO and co-founder of Confluent and co-creator of Kafka. \"Kafka adoption is growing rapidly, and the Kafka Summit in April will showcase the tremendous impact it is already having across various industries.\" \nApache Kafka is the wildly popular open-source system for managing real-time streams of data from websites, applications and sensors that is now being used as fundamental infrastructure by thousands of companies, ranging from LinkedIn, Netflix and Uber, to Cisco and Goldman Sachs. Organizations from all sectors are looking to evolve their data architecture to enable real-time stream data processing as demand for Apache Kafka and the Confluent Platform is accelerating. Confluent is the only company that enables businesses to take full advantage of Kafka, from initial development through ongoing operation. \nAfter receiving Series B funding a couple of months ago, Confluent is rapidly growing and bringing on new talent to meet enterprise adoption of Kafka and build the tools that will extract value from the barrage of data in any company. The company, which spun out of LinkedIn in September 2014, has now moved to a new headquarters in Palo Alto to accommodate its expanding workforce. \nTo learn more about Confluent and Kafka, attend Confluent co-founder and Kafka co-creator Neha Narkhede's speaking session at Strata + Hadoop World, \" Copycat: Fault tolerant streaming data ingestion powered by Kafka ,\" on Thursday, Oct. 1 at 1:15 p.m. ET at room 1 E18 / 1 E19. \nGwen Shapira, systems architect at Confluent and Kafka committer, will also be leading a session about how the financial industry can best leverage Kafka for critical applications, \" When it absolutely, positively, has to be there: Reliability guarantees in Kafka .\" Join the session today at 11:20 a.m. ET at room 3D 02/11. \nVisit booth 929 to meet the team and learn more.

It is widely adopted for use cases ranging from collecting user activity data, logs, application metrics, stock ticker data and device instrumentation. Its key strength is its ability to make high volume data available as a real-time stream for consumption in systems with very different requirements -- from batch systems like Hadoop, to real-time systems that require low-latency access, to stream processing engines that transform the data streams as they arrive. This infrastructure lets you build around a single central nervous system transmitting messages to all the different systems and applications within an company. \nAbout Confluent Confluent, founded by the creators of Apache혲 Kafka혲, enables organizations to harness business value of stream data. The Confluent Platform manages the barrage of stream data and makes it available throughout an organization. It provides various industries, from retail, logistics and manufacturing, to financial services and online social networking, a scalable, unified, real-time data pipeline that enables applications ranging from large volume data integration to big data analysis with Hadoop to real-time stream processing. Backed by Benchmark, Data Collective, Index Ventures and LinkedIn, Confluent is based in Palo Alto. To learn more, please visit www.confluent.io . Download Apache Kafka at www.confluent.io/download .
