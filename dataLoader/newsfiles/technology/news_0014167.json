It has a huge impact and has solutions for numerable problems\". \nAddressing a special session of the national meet on promoting space technology here, Modi said he was happy to note the high degree of enthusiasm among government departments to use space technology in their respective areas of governance. \n\"It's important for us how do we come up with the new initiatives (in terms of utilising technology) as new ideas and initiatives could do wonders,\" he said. \nGiving example of an aeroplane how it would have all the information of weather and clouds coming up in its way, the prime minister said he once saw it and wondered if the technology could be used to avoid accidents on unmanned railways crossings across the country? \nModi said he discussed the issue with the scientists and asked them to come up with some tool which would inform the railways engine driver that there would be an unmanned railways crossing after three to four kilometres so that he could become alert. \n\"Available technology, if used with new thinking and initiatives, could make life better for poor of the poorest,\" he said. \nSimilarly, the Prime Minister after witnessing a series of presentations for over two hours by senior officials on the outcomes of various theme sessions during the meet, said in areas such as encroachment on national highways, illegal coal mining and natural disasters, the satellite technology could be used to make things clearer and easy for all concerned. \nModi recalled eminent space scientist Vikram Sarabhai's words on the cost of India's space programme, who had said that no effort should be spared in the objective of fulfilling the needs of India's common man. \n\"There has been an ongoing debate if a country like India should get into competitive race of space technology. But our efforts (to improve life) must not lose the steam,\" he said. \nThe Prime Minister also called upon the Indian Space Research Organisation to involve young minds to have new ideas. \n\"There should be no space between the space technology and the common man,\" he said, stressing the need to make maximum use of the available technology to improve life for all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:17:35.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
