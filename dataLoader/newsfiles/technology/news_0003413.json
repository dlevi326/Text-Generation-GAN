Don't use spin doctoring and neurolinguistics to \"massage\" the message into the shape that fits your mould!\nHere are my thoughts on the article.\nThe article basically \"promotes\" a gun-free society on the (core) argument that guns FUEL crime... So - in the absence of guns, crime would NOT be \"fuelled?\".\nSo - the number of people killed by guns would be \"as high as ever...\" Right? Why not higher? There are thousands of guns sold all the time. If it is true, there should be a steady increase. Not so? Why would be? Why not WILL be or WON'T be? How do we know this for sure? Neurolinguistics. Saying \"would be\" is the same as saying \"might not be but we can't say that, because WOULD BE will read the same as WILL BE.\" This is a guess. Not one based on fact, but one designed to support the message to follow...\nPlease add the following statistic: How many are \"killed by guns\" held by police, legally held and used by citizens in self-defence (against ALL weapons), etc?\nIt says \"Chandre Gould and Adele Kirsten argue that interviews with men who are serving time in jail for violent crimes indicate that gun ownership alone is a key problem...\"\nReally? So - if we arrest Cash-in-Transit or BAT robbers, all we need to do is take away their guns and PRESTO! They'll be moral, upstanding citizens? My first experiences with guns also came at about the age of 10. By then I could operate a revolver and did. Later in life, I carried firearms and still do. My gun must be a christian one - it never \"converted\" me into a criminal!\nHlupa was eight when he got his first gun. He FOUND it in a plane that went down near his house in the Northwest. What!? Really!? He just \"found it!?\" And the pilot? If he \"just found it\" and took it, then he STOLE IT! He was ALREADY a little criminal! You don't just \"find\" a gun! So - did he call an ambulance for the pilot or murder him for his gun? Where is the back story!?\nSee what I mean? Spin-doctoring!\nHlupa then got arrested for kidnapping, robbery and assault. Ok - so how do you assault someone if you have a gun? Doesn't the article imply that the \"gun changed him!?\" How? Neurolinguistics, people. Look carefully at the trend here!\nAnd then \"his adult neighbour taught him to use it to commit crime..\" Whaaaat!? Are you serious!? But wait. There's a problem. This is an article about how GUNS fuel CRIME. I think the article should be re-named \"How neighbours fuel crime!\"\nVelabahleke was just 10 when he stole his first gun from a man down the road from his grandmother’s house in Thokoza on Johannesburg’s East Rand., the article reads further. Copy, paste, repeat. He STOLE the gun, at least. Hlupa just \"found\" his, remember! So another 10-year old CRIMINAL with a gun. See the trend?\nThe article then continues to explain \"his father had beaten his mother when he was angry with her; how his father waited until it was late and the children were asleep to drag them out of bed and beat them for things they had done wrong during the day; and how he had been beaten with pipes and canes by the teachers at school when he played truant...\"\nBut the GUN was the issue, right!? So the artivle reads \"how GUNS fuel CRIME.\" Not how ABUSE fuels SOCIAL DEVIANCE! What a joke!\nAnd then the little gem... \"But it was only when we started speaking about guns that Velabahleke expressed emotion.\"\nReally!? Seriously!? So - this is independent reporting? What qualification does the author have to assess this? What emotion? Anger? Disgust? Pity? Sadness? Happiness? Pride? Neurolinguistics again. Let's leave the reader to ASSUME that this means that - other than him being a \"good boy,\" he only started to become a criminal (again) when he referred to a gun.\nWHAT!?\nHere's a goodie. A real keeper: \"He said his gun changed his life. It brought him status among his peers and meant he no longer had to rely on entrepreneurial skills to earn a living. He could do much better from robbery.\"\nBwaahaahaa! So, wait. Lemme get this right. At the age of 10, he was a budding entrepreneur who had to use his (highly developed) entrepreneurial skills to \"earn a living!?\" What were these skills? Here - lemme help: STEALING (remember). So now he could just point the gun and ask for the money and POOF! There goes his career (at 10)!?\nIt goes on with: \"The gun made him feel safer, but ironically also increased the danger he faced. Velabahleke said he had lots of enemies, and told us “the first enemy would be the person who wants this very gun that you are carrying, but on the other hand, I was carrying a gun because I needed to get money by using the gun. When you carry a gun, your life is at risk.”\"\nSeriously!? Having an (illegal) gun WILL attract danger. The POLIE might even KILL you and they ARE your \"enemy\" now! He was carrying the gun because \"he needed to get money!?\" To GET money? See the cute use of neurolinguistics!? IF you are using the gun to \"get money\" you are ROBBING PEOPLE! Knives get the same result! How was he \"getting money\" before he had a gun, at TEN!? Was he \"working\" already? And what did he need money for, at ten!? Wasn't his parents feeding and clothing him? And if not - was that not the bigger issue?\nMore neurolinguistics: \"The earlier they got a gun, the earlier they committed serious acts of violence.\"\nThe earlier they GOT the gun? NO! If they were ANYWHERE before 18 and if they ever only GOT a gun, they are criminals already! You don't just GET a gun in South Africa - you BUY one and APPLY FOR A LICENSE when you are OLD ENOUGH. If not, you are committing a crime and you're a criminal already!\nThen we venture into an interesting area: \"Handguns were most popular, as they are light, easy to conceal and require little expertise to shoot.\"\nNo! The law REQUIRES you to conceal it. You are not allowed to \"open carry\" in South Africa. So don't spin this into an \"issue\" when the opposite would be ILLEGAL anyway!\nAnother gem: \"Even one is too many.\"\nSo - the argument is: If it can, do or would result in a loss of life, then all forms of this (evil) should be removed from society, in the interest of saving lives. Right? Where is this argument for alcohol, cigarettes, cars, planes and trains? MORE people own vehicles, use them as weapons and die from their use (legal and illegal) than guns. Why SPECIFICALLY guns, then!? Oh wait - because guns can be used by citizens to stand up to governments. THAT is the REAL ISSUE!\nThen there is \"In 2009, the last year for which data is available, 89% of the 6 428 people shot and killed were men.\"\nAnd how many (what percentage) were killed illegally, legally, by police, by legal gun owners and by illegal gun owners? Can we have those stats as well, please?\nAnd why is the last statistic only available for 2009? If firearms are better controlled, better legislated and better protected (because of new laws) and law enforcement has improved (police will tell you this is the case every year), where are the stats till now?\nSo now we have \"In 2009, the NIMSS data suggested there had been an almost 50% reduction in gun deaths since the introduction of the Firearms Control Act passed by Parliament in 2000\" and it follows with \"This suggests that making it harder to own a gun, reducing the number of guns in circulation and strengthening national gun laws can result in fewer guns. That translates into less gun violence.\"\nReally? Again, really? And since then? How could you start with \"gun death would be the same this year\" and then follow with \"it reduced by 50% in 2009\" while you KNOW that you have no statistics since then and somehow PREDICT that there would be \"less gun violence.\"\nThen I have a question: IS gun violence (interestingly not MURDER) any different from other kinds of violence? In countries like the UK - where guns were taken away - was there less VIOLENCE after that? What about countries where gun ownership is PROMOTED? Are gun crimes higher there?\nSo the article then boldly states: \"Simply put, without the presence of a gun, people like Lucky Dube, Senzo Meyiwa and Reeva Steenkamp could not have been shot dead.\"\nNeurolinguistics. The question should be: \"Would removing guns result in an absolute sudden STOP of murders!?\" They might not have been SHOT, but there is NO EVIDENCE or ARGUMENT that will ever support an argument that the removal of GUNS (specifically) would result in less DEATH. They could not have been shot, true. But they could have been strangled, stabbed, bludgeoned, poisoned, thrown off balconies, etc. Not so?\nI think this article is nothing more than an anti-gun advertisement. There is no evidence anywhere to support the argument that less guns will result in less crime or in less murder.\nDon't get me wrong. I support better legislation, better control, better enforcement and stricter paths to ownership.\nBut this article tries to suggest that GUNS are the CAUSE of crime. They are not. They are tools.
