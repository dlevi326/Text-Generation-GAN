As part of this China has announced it will donate 2 million euros (2.3 million U.S. dollars) for laboratory construction. \nHe said the nuclear power plants currently under construction in China account for 40 percent of the total around the world. While such clean energy is being developed, ensuring safety measures are in place is also paramount, he said. \nXu pointed out the successful development of a third-generation nuclear reactor design, known as the Hualong One, as an example of China's advancements in the field of nuclear technology. \nChina has been a member state of IAEA for over 31 years. \nAmano said he had earlier been shown two such technologies developed in China, and was aware that many others are also currently in development, again stressing that for the future of nuclear power use to be \"secured,\" these improved safety features are \"very important.\" \nCooperation between China and the IAEA is also increasing, he said, as evidenced by the appointment of Chinese national Yang Dazhu as one of the IAEA Deputy Directors General. \nAmano said one of the greatest challenges for nuclear power is at present social acceptance, with public confidence in nuclear power negatively impacted by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011. \nThe IAEA has released a report on the disaster at the conference, he added, and hoped it would be a good source to \"learn lessons to strengthen safety.\" .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:41:36.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
