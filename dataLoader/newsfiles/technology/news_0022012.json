As an animal lover myself, this matter is very close to my heart,\" Wickremesinghe said. \n\"We are currently looking into how we can implement meaningful measures such as the strict enforcement of speed limits and further restrictions on the rate of visitors to each of our national parks and reserves, in order to create an environment that is safe and secure for all its inhabitants,\" he added. \nThe park attracts more than 100,000 foreign tourists each year and is a key source of revenue to the government.
