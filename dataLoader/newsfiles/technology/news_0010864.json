The new feature is available on most Apple and Android based devices. “Our goal is to give our members options for how and when they want to access their accounts, and make it convenient for them to do so,” said Eric Givens, Senior Director of Digital Banking at Arizona Federal. “We’ve had great response from our members. In the first six days, there have been over 7,500 logins using Eyeprint ID without any promotion.”\nEyeprint ID joins other account protection options for Arizona Federal members, including Touch ID™ and CardPower™. The technology comes from EyeVerify Inc. and, using the smartphone camera, scans the unique blood vessel pattern in the whites of the eye and matches those to the pattern on file in seconds. The eye pattern is scrambled, encoded and stored locally – never leaving the device.\nThe update to the Arizona Federal mobile app was released September 3 on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.\nAbout Arizona Federal Credit Union\nArizona Federal is a $1.3 billion not-for-profit financial cooperative providing financial services and expertise to over 120,000 member/owners. Founded in 1936, the organization took their foundation of financial empowerment and mutual benefit to heart with the release of their web-based financial reality show, My Comeback with Kurt Warner, in March of 2015. Arizona Federal has 17 locations across the Phoenix metropolitan area. Deposits are insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).\nPhotographs and artwork of the Arizona Federal mobile application and EyePrint ID are available upon request.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T10:33:26.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
