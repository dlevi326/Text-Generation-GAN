Credit: Wikipedia \nResearchers from the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI), together with the teams of Dr. Martin Farrell at Oxford University, and Dr. Sekar Kathiresan at the Broad Institute, have found the answer to an ongoing debate in the cardiovascular scientific world. Dr. Ruth McPherson and Dr. Majid Nikpay, researchers at the UOHI's Ruddy Canadian Cardiovascular Genetics Centre, report that the genetic basis of heart disease is largely derived from the cumulative effect of multiple common genetic variants, rather than from a few rare variants with large effects. \nThe study, published today in the eminent Nature Genetics , used the data from the 1000 Genomes project in order to obtain information on close to 10 million genetic variants (called SNPs). The analysis involved 60,000 heart disease patients, 120,000 healthy individuals, from a total of 48 studies around the world. Not only is the number of genetic variants much greater than the approximately 1 million previously studied, this is the first time that researchers have been able to study the link of rare genetic variants present in as few as 1 in 1000 people at risk of heart disease. \n\"Our analysis provides a comprehensive survey of the fine genetic architecture of coronary artery disease (CAD), showing that genetic susceptibility to this common disease is largely determined by common SNPs of small effect size rather than just a few rare variants with large effects,\" say the authors of this important study. \nDr. Majid Nikpay, post-doctoral fellow at the Ottawa Heart Institute, also used an alternative statistical method of analysis to find two new risk markers that have an effect only if an individual has inherited two copies of the \"bad gene\", that is one from each parent. In addition to discovering a total of 10 new risk markers, by using other statistical approaches, this research team has produced a list of 202 genetic variants in 129 gene regions that together explain approximately 23% of the heritability of coronary heart disease as compared to only 11% reported in previous studies. \n\"Many of these genetic variants are likely to exert their effects on the walls of arteries, making them more susceptible to the common heart disease risk factors such as cigarette smoking, diabetes and cholesterol,\" added Dr Ruth McPherson, Director of the Ruddy Canadian Cardiovascular Genetics Centre at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. \nA number of preventative strategies target the vessel wall (control of blood pressure and smoking cessation), but the large majority of existing drug treatments for lowering CAD risk operate through manipulation of circulating lipid levels and few directly target vessel wall processes. Detailed investigation of new aspects of vessel wall biology that are implicated by genetic association but have not previously been explored in atherosclerosis may provide new insights into the complex etiology of disease and, hence, identify new targets. Sep 04, 2015 1 DNA variants explain over 10 percent of inherited genetic risk for heart disease November 8, 2012 \nAbout 10.6% of the inherited genetic risk for developing coronary artery disease (CAD) can be explained by specific DNA variations, according to research reported today at the American Society of Human Genetics 2012 meeting. Largest coronary artery disease study shows evidence of link between inflammation and heart disease December 3, 2012 \nThe University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI) participated in the largest genetic study of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) to date.

Large-scale meta-analysis discovered ten new genes that tune cholesterol levels May 11, 2015 \nAn international research consortium has discovered ten new genes underlying blood lipid levels. This large study, published today in world's leading genetical journal, the Nature Genetics, was led by researchers at the Institute ... Genes may not be to blame for link between migraine and heart disease July 2, 2015 \nA new study suggests that genes may not be to blame for the increased risk of heart disease some studies have shown in people with migraine, especially those with migraine with aura. The research is published during Headache/Migraine ... Researchers identify genetic clues associated with cigarette addiction September 1, 2015 \nResearchers at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Pharmacy have identified specific sets of genetic variants that are significantly associated with cigarette addiction. Pinpointing these genetic variants could ... Recommended for you Early warning gene signature for Alzheimer's September 6, 2015 \nA 'gene signature' that could be used to predict the onset of diseases, such as Alzheimer's, years in advance has been developed in research published in the open access journal Genome Biology. Mathematical 'Gingko trees' reveal mutations in single cells that characterize diseases September 7, 2015 \nSeemingly similar cells often have significantly different genomes. This is often true of cancer cells, for example, which may differ one from another even within a small tumor sample, as genetic mutations within the cells ... Study reveals the genetic start-up of a human embryo September 3, 2015 \nAn international team of scientists led from Sweden's Karolinska Institutet has for the first time mapped all the genes that are activated in the first few days of a fertilized human egg. The study, which is being published ... Genes physically held in silencing 'lock-down' in embryonic stem cells August 31, 2015 \nResearchers at the Babraham Institute have discovered a strong physical gene interaction network that is responsible for holding genes in a silencing grip during early development. In the same way that people can interact ... Genetic overlapping in multiple autoimmune diseases may suggest common therapies August 24, 2015 \nScientists who analyzed the genes involved in 10 autoimmune diseases that begin in childhood have discovered 22 genome-wide signals shared by two or more diseases. These shared gene sites may reveal potential new targets ... Adaptive mutation mechanism may explain some forms of antibiotic resistance August 25, 2015 \nEvolutionary theory says mutations are blind and occur randomly. But in the phenomenon of adaptive mutation, cells can peek under the blindfold, increasing their mutation rate in response to stress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T20:53:06.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
