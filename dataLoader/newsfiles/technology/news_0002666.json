Goats, lemurs, and meerkats had their hooves, paws or claws dabbed with non-toxic, water-based paint and ran over a blank sheet of poster board while chasing a treat.\nThirty-two of the works will be auctioned on eBay starting on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:56:01.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
