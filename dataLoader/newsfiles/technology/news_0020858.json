Yesterday, NBC announced the show would add only one new cast member for its 41st season—the near-unknown stand-up comic Jon Rudnitsky. SNL is, of course, a sketch-comedy show, but it keeps hiring mostly white stand-ups who have a markedly different skill set, with limited results. As critics and viewers keep calling out for greater diversity on the show, it’s hard to imagine the series’s reasoning in sticking to old habits.\nRelated Story What's Wrong With Saturday Night Live's 'Weekend Update'?\nAs is unfortunately typical today, controversy has already arisen over some tasteless old jokes from Rudnitsky’s Twitter and Vine feeds, similar to the furore that greeted Trevor Noah’s hiring at The Daily Show this summer. But Rudnitsky was apparently hired on the back of his stand-up performances, not his Internet presence, similar to the other young stand-ups the show has hired in recent years: Pete Davidson, Brooks Wheelan (since fired), and Michael Che. It’s a peculiar route to the show, because SNL is 90 percent sketch acting, and unless you’re hosting Weekend Update (like Che), you’re not going to do a lot of stand-up material. So why hire Rudnitsky?\nThe simplest answer is that SNL already has plenty of great sketch actors. The current stable of stars includes Kate McKinnon, Taran Killam, Cecily Strong, and Jay Pharoah, along with old hands Bobby Moynihan and Kenan Thompson. Their forte is impressions and wild recurring characters, and newer hires Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney have taken up the more esoteric humor of the digital shorts pioneered by Andy Samberg. What SNL is looking for is another Seth Meyers, or Jimmy Fallon, or Norm MacDonald, or Dennis Miller—a magnetic personality who can serve as a straight man in sketches, and perhaps eventually take over the Update desk.", "external_links": ["http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/saturday-night-live-adds-new-818917", "http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/31/trevor-noah-backlash-highlights-jokes-jews-women", "http://defamer.gawker.com/some-tweets-and-vines-snls-new-cast-member-should-proba-1727963575", "http://www.bustle.com/articles/107758-snl-casts-jon-rudnitsky-hopefully-the-show-has-some-more-diverse-players-on-the-way"], "published": "2015-09-02T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:06:16.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
