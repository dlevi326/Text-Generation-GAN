With CAKE, Mixbook has been able to build, manage and attract new relationships with multiple publishing partners in-house, instead of using a third-party provider. Mixbook makes the creation of photo books, cards and calendars simple and fun, while offering powerful design software that doesn't limit users to static, pre-defined templates. Over the last few years, the company has expanded its product line with several new offerings, including the mobile app Mosaic , which allows users to create photo books from their phones in minutes, and Montage , which combines both mobile and desktop features. Digital marketing plays a key role in the company's ongoing growth strategy, including an affiliate program designed to drive traffic to Mixbook landing pages through strategic relationships with online publishers. Three years ago, Mixbook deployed CAKE so that it could more granularly track the performance of affiliates and bring management of the program in-house to cut third party costs and boost ROI.\n\"CAKE has enabled us to save marketing dollars that would have otherwise gone to a third party, but more importantly, it allows us to build more personal and transparent relationships with our publishing partners,\" said Desiree Welke , Senior Manager, Customer Acquisition at Mixbook. \"Accurate metrics on what's working and what's not enables us to make the adjustments needed to improve the quality of the leads we are capturing and ensure that our partners are effectively monetizing their traffic, which is a win-win on both sides.
