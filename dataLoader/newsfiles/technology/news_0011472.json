The alliance between Emerson’s Therm-O-Disc business and Cormant, Inc. provide customers additional insight within the complete DCIM solution that will simplify data collection and improve the efficiency of the data center landscape. Data center managers implement DCIM tools to help reduce recurring energy costs by optimizing the data center environmentals, such as temperature, power, and humidity, as well as during server consolidations. All information is displayed in a single platform reducing the complexity and inaccuracy from having multiple data sources. Environmental data enhances the overall data center visibility, as solved by this partnership.\n“Optimizing your data center’s ambient temperature down to the rack level can provide huge operating cost savings,” said Julie Mullins, Cormant’s Head of Marketing and Channel Development. “We’re excited to provide a plug-and-play interface with Emerson’s wireless sensors to achieve a time-saving, cost-effective way for customers to collect and display impactful data center information.”\nEmerson’s wireless sensors enable reliable, secure and real-time monitoring and control of the data center environments utilizing WirelessHART, a highly secure communications protocol. As a wireless solution, Emerson’s technology for the data center is easier to deploy, reconfigure, expand and maintain compared to a wired system, saving the end user time and money. Emerson’s WirelessHART solution takes it to the next level by delivering unique encryption security, high data transmission reliability, and open standard compatibility.\nThe Cormant-CS DCIM solution combines all of the Emerson’s wireless sensor environmental data with detailed IT information about the facility, enterprise assets, infrastructure, and related connectivity to enhance decision-making with analytics and dashboards. Within Cormant-CS, users can configure environmental data to trigger Alerts when levels of temperature, humidity, or any other data point are reaching levels of concern.\nAccording to William Stevenson, Director of Global Power and Environment for Therm-O-Disc, “The combination of Emerson’s wireless sensors and Cormant-CS provides the data center market with an advanced and integrated technology option for one-source environmental management solutions.”\nTo see the Cormant-CS DCIM solution with integrated data from Emerson’s wireless sensors, visit, booth #423 at AFCOM’s Data Center World at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland on September 21-22, 2015.\nAbout Cormant, Inc.\nCormant has been an expert at IT infrastructure management software for the data center (DCIM) and beyond since 2001.
