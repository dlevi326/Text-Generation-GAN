The recognition is further evidence of how Blackboard's outstanding community engagement solutions are helping K-12 school districts inform and engage local stakeholders. \nNSPRA's top program award, the Gold Medallion, recognizes superior educational public relations programs from public and private schools, vocational-technical schools or community colleges beyond 12th grade, and the education groups, public relations agencies or corporations serving the institutions. Winners were announced at the NSPRA National Seminar held in July. \nThe five Blackboard K-12 customers recognized by NSPRA use products included in the company's community engagement solution to inform and engage local communities about issues that impact them. \nFor example, parents in Portland Public Schools (PPS) showed concern for decreased enrollment at a particular district high school and set out to increase total enrollment growth by 65 percent from 2014-15 to 2015-16. PPS set short-term grassroots and viral marketing goals that were each exceeded as part of the campaign with help of Blackboard's community engagement solutions. \n\"We believe that community engagement is critical to learner success and safety in K-12,\" said Chris Crawford, head of Blackboard K-12 Community Engagement solutions. \"We continue to work hard to deliver an unparalleled and robust set of solutions that advance the needs of learners and continually exceed the needs of our K-12 partners that support them. We are proud to say that five of the seven recipients of this year's award are our customers, and we congratulate all of the winners on their outstanding work.\" \nTo learn more about the winners, visit http://www.nspra.org/gold_medallion . \nAbout Blackboard Inc.
