Ampere Analysis predicts that at least 6% of households globally will be Netflix homes at the start of the next decade. \nAnd, as Netflix commits to investing more in original content like House of Cards and Marvel Defenders Project , it looks set to reduce spend on third-party content acquisitions – a differentiation strategy that investors can get behind. If Netflix aims to hit the 50% of spend devoted to originals hinted at in a recent investor call by 2020, its expenditure on acquired content could begin to fall as early as 2017. \nNetflix expects to invest nearly $5 billion on acquired and original content in 2016, and Ampere anticipates this will grow by another $1 billion in the subsequent two years. Ampere anticipates that Netflix’s investment in original programming will leave programme-makers a short window to maximise licensing agreements. \nSimultaneously, Amazon is ramping up its own content plans – licensing existing titles and generating new ones – like the new motoring show fronted by the former Top Gear team. Collectively, Ampere expects Netflix and Amazon to be spending over $9 billion per year on acquired and original content by 2020. \nThis comes as consumers are increasingly happy to double up on subscriptions. Across the UK, US, and Germany, almost half of Amazon Prime’s video user base subscribes to both Netflix and Amazon, which is evidence that it is content, not cost, that drives subscriptions priced at $10 or less per month. \n“Subscribers to both SVOD services (Amazon and Netflix) experience little content duplication as the two players have very different approaches to content acquisition – and this defines their brand propositions too,” Ampere noted . “Overall, Netflix’s content is typically more recent as it opts for high-profile titles earlier in their release cycle.” \nAs of August 2015, by Ampere Analysis estimates, 11% of Netflix’s movies were released in 2013, and 9.5% in 2014. It’s the same for TV shows: Netflix has twice as many titles released in 2015 as Amazon Prime. These include high profile shows from big brand producers – Disney, Fox, NBC and BBC. Perhaps it’s not surprising then that Netflix spent over $3.1bn on content in 2014, compared with Amazon Prime’s bill of $1.3 billion. \nAmazon Prime, by contrast, has a heavier focus on a larger library of older titles: 18,000 movies and 4,500 TV shows versus Netflix’s 11,300 movies and 5,500 TV shows. There is also evidence of differentiation along genre grounds – Netflix has focused on drama, action, crime and comedy, Amazon Prime tends towards documentaries, family and kids movies, and music. \n“The differing title acquisition strategies have allowed each provider to thrive in its own content niche – consumers are quite happy to spend on both Amazon Prime and Netflix,” said Richard Broughton, research director at Ampere. “Netflix subscribers across the US, Germany and UK are over 60% more likely than the average internet user to also watch videos via Amazon Prime.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T10:35:56.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
