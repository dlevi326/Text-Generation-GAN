Follow along with New York Times reporters and editors, who will be providing highlights, analysis and commentary throughout the day. 6:11 am ET Sep 9, 2015 2015-09-09T10:11:12+00:00 Farhad Manjoo Even Without Steve Jobs, Apple’s Events Continue to Command Attention Video: By AINARA TIEFENTHÄLER In a strange bit of timing, Apple’s media event is taking place a few days after the premiere of a widely anticipated new documentary about the company’s co-founder, Steve Jobs. The film, by the documentarian Alex Gibney, is severely critical of Mr. Jobs, who is depicted as “ruthless, deceitful and cruel.” You can read my colleague Andrew Ross Sorkin’s take on whether that’s fair . For me, the specter of Mr. Jobs raised another thought — about how successfully Apple has managed to weather his departure. These media events used to be the Jobs Show; he commanded the tech world’s attention with singular showmanship, and it was hard to believe, when he was around, that a post-Jobs Apple could ever spark such excitement. But here we are at another big show without Mr. Jobs, and enthusiasm for Apple’s announcements don’t seem to have diminished. Even without its charismatic co-founder, Apple still makes the tech world stop and pay attention. 6:10 am ET Sep 9, 2015 2015-09-09T10:10:01+00:00 Nick Wingfield How Apple May Change the Video Gaming Business Photo The big question is whether Apple's game offerings will be compelling enough to challenge Microsoft’s Xbox or Sony’s PlayStation. Credit Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters Apple changed the games business with the iPhone, which opened the way to mobile games. Now game industry executives are wondering if the company could do it again with the new Apple TV. The new Apple TV that the company is set to introduce on Wednesday is expected to feature games as a centerpiece , a big change for the device, which has been known for streaming video since it was first introduced eight years ago. The big question is whether Apple will be able to make the game offerings on its systems more compelling than those already available through similar inexpensive television boxes from Amazon, Nvidia and Ouya. None of those companies has had much impact on the market for games in the living room, which is dominated by consoles like Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation. Apple has a lot more credibility as a disruptive player in the games business though, because of the huge impact the iPhone and iPad have had on the mobile games business. 6:07 am ET Sep 9, 2015 2015-09-09T10:07:30+00:00 Katie Benner Photo Apple is expected to unveil revamped iPhones with better cameras. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Nothing gets the Apple faithful excited like the company’s annual iPhone event, which will be held this year at San Francisco’s Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. Here’s a rundown of what we have reported will be coming from the event: We’ll get a look at revamped iPhones, which will have better cameras and Force Touch, a technology that lets users gain access to information and menus by pressing hard on the screen. The devices will also run the new iOS 9 mobile operating system, with a new and improved Siri voice assistant. (Siri, open up my Apple Pay!”) In addition, Apple TV will be revamped to expand its uses in gaming, including with a new remote control and support for apps and games made by independent software developers. The event is also set to showcase updated iPads. The big mystery: How will consumers receive the new Apple TV? It is the company’s most serious effort yet to be a living room entertainment hub. Yet the field for such devices is already crowded and competitive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:30:03.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
