Source: Deepa Seetharaman / The Wall Street Journal\nSamsung Electronics and Facebook’s Ove unveiled a new version of theGear VR headset, aimed at bringing what executives said was the “power of virtual reality to the mainstream.” To reach the masses, the headset will be priced at $US99 and work with the full slate of 2015 Samsung Galaxy phones: Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge+ , S6 and S6 Edge .\nThe new headset is 22 per cent lighter and “much more comfortable” than the previous Innovator editions , which Samsung first released last year to fine-tune its consumer product. The Gear VR includes a trackpad, back button and motion sensors to detect acceleration and gyroscopic position, but it still requires the brains and high-resolution screen of a smartphone to work. Phones are docked inside the headset, via a MicroUSB connection.\nVirtual-reality hardware is only as good as its content, and content was scarce for the early-adopter editions of the Gear VR. On stage at an Oculus developer event in Los Angeles, Peter Koo, Samsung Mobile’s senior vice president of technology strategy, announced partnerships with Twentieth Century Fox and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. to bring movies to Gear VR, including the Alien trilogy, the Hunger Games series and “Pulp Fiction.”\n(Until recently, Twentieth Century Fox and News Corp, the owner of The Wall Street Journal, were part of the same company.)\nSamsung and Oculus unveiled a new Gear VR headset that would cost $99 and accommodate more Galaxy phone models.

Mr. Koo also said that the Gear VR will have Netflix support, with apps forVimeo and Hulu coming soon.\nGames are another major content area for virtual-reality headsets. Oculus announced a partnership to bring Minecraft, now owned by Microsoft Corp., to the device. Previously, Minecraft creator Markus Persson said he canceled an Oculus deal because he said its corporate parent, Facebook, “creeps me out.”\nThis new Gear VR will sell this fall, Samsung said, and it will cost $100 less than the Innovator editions built specifically for theGalaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S6 phones.\n“We see virtual reality as the next computing platform, and we are thrilled to partner with Oculus on Gear VR to set the standard for mobile VR and bring this revolutionary product to consumers,” J.K. Shin, chief executive of IT & Mobile Division for Samsung Electronics , said in a press release\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=FB", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-galaxy-s6-review-the-iphone-6-has-met-its-match-1427825674", "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/03/25/minecraft-creator-on-canceling-oculus-deal-facebook-creeps-me-out/", "http://www.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=005930.SE", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/galaxy-s6-edge-and-note-5-review-a-choice-between-style-and-stylus-1440522899", "http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/02/20/samsung-gear-vr-review-a-shallow-dip-into-the-virtual-pool/", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KL904_GEARVR_G_20150924145452.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KL892_GEARVR_G_20150924143853.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-25T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:47:15.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
