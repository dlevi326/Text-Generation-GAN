During the case fine plaque details were visualized in a highly stenosis vessel, while continuously visualizing the entire vessel. This helped optimal stent sizing and HDi aided in ensuring proper stent expansion. \n\"Images are spectacular and interface is very intuitive,\" said Dr Teirstein. \n\"The HDi High Definition IVUS System represents a re-invention of IVUS from the ground up. Image clarity, speed of procedure, image interpretation are all improved. By launching the first high definition Ultrasound imaging system in the world, ACIST Medical has taken another major step forward in the transformation of the company,\" said Tom Morizio, President and COO, ACIST Medical Systems. \"We built our presence by providing the first variable rate contrast injector that simplifies the delivery of contrast in the Cath Lab. In 2014 we introduced the ACIST RXi(®), the first MicroCatheter Rapid Exchange FFR System. The Rapid FFR system overcomes many of the limitations of traditional pressure-wire systems. With the introduction of high definition IVUS, ACIST Medical again demonstrates its commitment to offer technologies that simplify procedures and improve patient care in the Cardiac Cath Lab.\" \nReinventing IVUS in HD With HDi, ACIST has developed the world's first high-definition IVUS system. It reinvents IVUS technology with improved image quality, a touch panel interface, a highly deliverable high-definition catheter, and superfast pullback speed. \nHDi's improved image quality is due to a combination of its proprietary 60 MHz transducer and powerful state-of-the-art signal processing, which deliver imaging at high axial resolution (<40 µm versus the ~100 µm of other IVUS systems) and with minimized image noise, without the need for vessel clearing. HDi also offers a high depth of penetration to allow assessment of full plaque burden and the complete left main artery. \nThe complete HDi imaging system is integrated into one single 19 inch touchscreen console, which offers interactivity via swiping, zooming, drawing, and annotating, allowing rapid measuring and manipulation. With its small footprint HDi is easy to integrate into catheterization laboratories. \nThe Kodama(®) HD IVUS catheter, which houses the ultrasound transducer, has not only been designed for improved image quality, but also for improved pushability and deliverability. \nHDi offers both manual and super fast automated pullback options up to 10 mm/s. In this setting HDi can complete pullback up to 20 times faster, reducing the time from minutes to seconds and minimizing ischemic risk and motion artifacts. \nACIST ACIST Medical Systems, Inc. is a pioneering interventional and diagnostic technology company with a portfolio of advanced products, including the world's first Rapid Exchange FFR and High Definition IVUS systems. It is also a global market leader in advanced contrast imaging systems for cardiovascular angiography and radiology imaging. Through these products, ACIST is demonstrating its commitment to bringing unique and innovative technologies that simplify cardiovascular procedures and empower clinicians to treat patients with superior care.
