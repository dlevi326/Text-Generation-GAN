As a matter of fact: “ Ego partim culpa ” – I am partly to blame.\nI started off writing articles on News24 in 2011 – under the nom de plume, Irukandji . I had 289 articles (and 330 photos) published before I was banned.\nSince then, I’ve used many different aliases ( but most of these were banned as well, Sakkie ).\nAll in all, I have had more than 730 articles and 900 photos published. Thank you, News24, for the opportunity to share my thoughts and experiences with your readers. Some of them have become dear friends to me.\nI have absolutely no problem with the decision to shut down the comments on your publication. It belongs to you, and we, the general public, are not forced or coerced into visiting the www.news24.com website.\nThe endless war between the religious and not-so-religious became a thorn in my side – these guys are never going to convince one another of their differing points of view. But again, no one was forced to read their articles, comments, or arguments.\nI do feel, however, that it would have gone a long way to solving the comments problem, if the offending commenter was told why his/her comment or article was deleted, before banning him/her. But I do realise that it is difficult for News24 to do this on every comment.\nI have been guilty of making snide remarks, trading insults, and being insensitive with some of my comments. Mea culpa . I am sorry. Most of it was written in the heat of my keyboard the moment. It was never my intention to hurt your readers in any way.\nAnd so I leave you now… full of sorryness and repentance for my boorish behaviour. May the finger of fate take pity upon my insensitive soul.\nGoodbye, all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T14:09:37.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
