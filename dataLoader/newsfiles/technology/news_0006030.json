The cameras can produce high-definition video out of an extremely minimal amount of lighting thanks to 6MP Moonlight technology. Mobotix’s new 6MP Moonlight technology relies on a wider image sensor, a noise reduction filter, better image processing and improved lenses. The result is the ability to capture clear, detailed images of moving objects. No motion blur or other effects caused by long exposure times.\nThe technology is available with the cameras, or as individual sensor modules for the cameras. Two versions of the 6MP sensor module are available, one with a color image sensor and the other with a black and white image sensor. The black and white image sensor is more sensitive, and suited for nighttime surveillance.\nMobotix 6MP IP cameras are built for a variety of environments. The Mobotix Q25 camera , for example, has an IP65 protection class, shielding it from harsh weather conditions. Mount the camera indoors or outdoors from a ceiling and receive a fully detailed view of the floor below. The Mobotix i25 camera is designed for elevated installation on a wall, featuring a 15-degree downward tilt so it can accurately capture the space in front of it.\nThe new 6MP Moonlight technology improves the picture coming from the camera, no matter where it is deployed. Now any business can receive more reliable video from its security solutions. The ability to verify objects and persons in the environment is greatly improved, and any event can be accurately witnessed and confirmed.\nLearn more about the Mobotix solutions available at IP Phone Warehouse by contacting the free pre-sales tech support channel by phone: (888) 201-9056 or email: service(at)ipphone-warehouse(dot)com today!\nAbout IP Phone Warehouse\nIP Phone Warehouse is the leading specialty reseller of VoIP phones, video conferencing equipment, IP cameras and network devices.
