She became severely ill on Aug. 14 and was hospitalized for nearly a week.\nDvergsten is suing Andrew and Williamson Fresh Produce, Inc. The San Diego company voluntarily recalled \"Limited Edition\" brand cucumbers Friday and has said it's working to determine if the cucumbers are involved in the outbreak that's sickened nearly 300 people in 27 states.\nThe lawsuit says Andrew and Williamson had a duty to sell safe foods. It says Dvergsten seeks unspecified compensation for medical expenses and suffering.\nCompany official Dave Murray declined to comment because of pending litigation.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-08T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T08:43:13.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
