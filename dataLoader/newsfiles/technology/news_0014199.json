South Korea’s won paced developing currencies lower.\nSamsung Electronics Co. headed for a two-week high in Seoul to pace gains for a gauge of technology shares. Naver Corp. rebounded from near a two-year low. HDFC Bank Ltd. advanced to help India’s S&P BSE Sensex halt three days of declines. Hermes Microvision Inc. dropped for a third day in Taipei. The won retreated 0.7 percent versus the U.S. dollar.\nThe MSCI Emerging Markets Index added 0.1 percent to 797.68 at 1:09 p.m. in Hong Kong after a three-day, 2.9 percent slump. Chinese markets are shut Thursday and Friday to commemorate the end of World War II, providing investors respite from trading that has been at the center of recent global volatility. The U.S. will on Friday release August payrolls data, which could influence the timing of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increase.\n“With China temporarily out of the picture, markets are calmed\nand investors have gone on a bargain hunt,” said Jonathan Ravelas, the Manila-based chief market strategist at BDO Unibank Inc. “The U.S. payrolls data will give investors an indication if a rate increase could come as early as this month.” Ravelas said he’s advising investors to buy stocks that declined in a recent rout.\nNearly twice as many shares rose as those that fell in the MSCI developing-nation index, which has dropped more than 9 percent since China devalued the yuan on Aug. 11, roiling global markets. The gauge’s 10-day volatility, a measure of price swings, jumped to its highest level since October 2011 this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T08:49:16.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
