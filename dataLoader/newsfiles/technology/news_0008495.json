I'm sure most of you folks are fine, compassionate people, but my life would be better not knowing why someone I don't know needs to go to an OB-GYN.\nDoesn't anyone simply hold the cell phone up to their ears anymore? I get the panic over cancer , but I'm dying here having to hear the broadcast back-and-forth regarding your \"moron\" boyfriend Brad while I'm trying to choke down an egg salad sandwich at Stroube's.\nDon't you folks know that cell phones come with ear buds? Maybe you forgot, but they're there and ready for use. Not only does that cure the cancer fear but it also keeps me from learning the pros and cons of a potential financial deal while trying to enjoy the incredible art of Demond Matsuo at The Foundation Gallery. A portion of the proceeds from buying his work went to Stomp the Violence. I'll gladly donate 25 percent to Stomp the Speaker.\nI've come to accept people checking emails during lunch, and texting -- rather than actually speaking with -- people 15 feet away, but the line must be drawn somewhere, and the line of demarcation starts with speaker conversations in public.\nLook, I'm no codger; I get the joy of speaker communication. But can't people live the speaker dream in the privacy of their office (with the door closed), home or automobile?\nMaybe it's the Facebook, Instagram, whatever-social-media-platform-is-hot-with-young-people mentality that's seeped into our culture. You know, the theory of believing the world wants to see a picture of your lunch -- or your toes on the beach -- via Instagram, or sharing with the Facebook world just how cute your children look on the first day of school.\nWe live in a world where people publicly share the minutiae of their private lives under the (false) assumption that the rest of the planet gives a damn. Paint me guilty as well.\nI call it channeling our inner-Kardashian (you can also insert your favorite \"Housewives of ...\" brand -- mine is Orange County), or the need for public attention while doing nothing of actual value.\nIt's easy to blame millennials for this, but, in reality, Baby Boomers created this mess with the invention of the \"every kid is special\" and \"every child deserves a trophy\" mentality.\nYou may be special and you may have shelves of \"participation\" trophies lining your walls, but the world doesn't need -- or want -- to be privy to your every phone conversation.\nThis much is certain: If this societal speaker insanity doesn't end soon, I'm going to grab one of those \"participation\" trophies and smash it against my \"special\" brain.", "external_links": ["http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/can-cell-phones-cause-brain-cancer/"], "published": "2015-09-25T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T03:11:00.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
