REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's U.S. arm said on Friday it would recall 7,810 sport utility vehicles in the United States to update software for radios to prevent hacking. \nThe announcement by FCA US LLC, formerly Chrysler Group LLC, comes more than a month after the company recalled about 1.4 million vehicles in the United States for the software update. \nCybersecurity researchers used the Internet to turn off a car's engine as it drove, escalating concerns about the safety of Internet-connected vehicles. \nFCA said on Friday that it was unaware of any injuries related to software exploitation.
