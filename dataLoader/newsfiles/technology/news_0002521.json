Nasa have claimed that there is flowing water almost certainly on Mars\nThe space agency discovered salty water on the surface of Mars.\nUsing the Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter, NASA spotted evidence of salts which could only have been deposited by water.\nSadly, the craft only peers at the Martian surface at 3pm each day, meaning any liquid water would have evaporated.\nWill we find more water on Mars? NASA/JPL/University of Arizona/Handout These dark streaks are thought to have been formed by running water\nPerhaps. It It is thought that Mars was once home to a massive ocean which was \"as big as two thirds of Earth's northern hemisphere\" and at least a mile deep.\nIt is thought this disappeared during a period of massive climate change, evaporating into space.\nThere may also be underground aquifers, although this cannot be established yet.\nIs there life on Mars? NASA A mock-up of a Martian Stonehenge (which doesn't exist)\nAgain, we don't know for sure yet.\nAlfred McEwen, professor of planetary geology at the University of Arizona, said: \"The possibility of finding life in in the interior of Mars is very high.\"\nHowever, this could just be life from Earth, because microbes may have hitched a ride aboard a meteorite from earth.\nWhat does the discovery of water mean for human space missions? NASA/JPL/University of Arizona/PA Scientists believe that flowing liquid water is almost certainly responsible for mysterious features on Mars that change with the seasons\nQuite a lot, because astronauts could not only drink the water, but use it to make Mars more habitable.\nNASA suggested it could be used in greenhouses where the plants feast off the Martian carbon dioxide and turn it into oxygen.\nWater could \"may decrease the cost and increase the resilience of human activity on the Red Planet,\" said Mary Beth Wilhelm from NASA's Ames Research Centre.\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/jasperhamill", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T05:18:07.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
