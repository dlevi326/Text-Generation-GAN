The report highlights products and services that integrate mobile capabilities and security into digital business strategies. Report authors state, “Small devices are capable of holding large amounts of potentially sensitive information, and keeping that information safe and preventing unauthorized access is of the utmost importance to IT organizations in many industries.”\n“The market need to secure sensitive information on mobile devices, in a convenient and private way, is the driving force behind Eyeprint ID,” states Toby Rush, CEO and Founder of EyeVerify. “We believe that recognition in the Cool Vendor report by Gartner validates our focus on using the smartphone itself to authenticate users, providing payment grade protection for mobile data and transactions.”\nEyeprint ID uses the existing front-facing smart device camera on compatible devices to image and pattern match the unique micro features of the eye. It’s more accurate than face or voice biometrics while being less expensive and more convenient than iris and fingerprint sensors. Eyeprint ID is the only biometric that protects your data with a high entropy encryption key – equivalent to a 50-character complex password. Three of the top ten device manufacturers and several banks have implemented Eyeprint ID for their customers.\nGartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in our research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.
