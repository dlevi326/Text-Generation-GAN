As one of the first semiconductor vendors with certified wireless microcontroller- (MCU) and processor-based evaluation kits ready to work with the Microsoft Azure IoT Suite, TI is uniquely positioned to help developers begin IoT application development within minutes. The Microsoft Azure IoT Suite's agent code has been pre-ported to TI's low-power SimpleLink™ Wi-Fi® CC3200 wireless MCU LaunchPad™ kit and Sitara™ AM335x processor -based BeagleBone Black and BeagleBoard Green kits. Developers can expect additional certifications of TI products in the coming months. The Microsoft program verifies that a member's hardware is compatible with Azure IoT Suite and enables developers who have purchased TI's low-cost development kits to easily download the appropriate Microsoft Azure for IoT agent to quickly connect to the cloud. TI-based kits verified for Microsoft Azure Certified for IoT: SimpleLink Wi-Fi CC3200 wireless MCU LaunchPad kit enables a low power and secure connection to the cloud BeagleBoard.org BeagleBone Black board based on TI's Sitara AM335x processor with a 1GHz ARM® Cortex®-A8 core supports Ethernet as well as Wi-Fi connectivity through TI's WiLink TM 8 Wi-Fi + Bluetooth ® combo connectivity modules SeeedStudio BeagleBone Green board based on the BeagleBone Black adds easy connection to a large family of Grove sensors \"We are pleased to include Texas Instruments as one of the first members of Microsoft Azure Certified for IoT to allow customers to build TI-based cloud-connected products faster and easier,\" said Barb Edson , General Manager for Data Platform and Internet of Things, Microsoft. \"Building on today's certifications, we are committed to working closely with Texas Instruments on industrial, automotive and consumer applications certified for Microsoft Azure IoT Suite.\" Semiconductor innovations are at the foundation of the IoT connecting people, things and cloud. TI innovations are enabling the IoT by expanding from wired connections to wireless connectivity, driving down power to enable battery-operated connected products, increasing integration to drive down system cost, easing development by providing modules and pre-integrated internet software stacks and increasing security in silicon. TI has the broadest portfolio of building blocks for IoT nodes and gateways spanning wired and wireless connectivity, microcontrollers, processors, sensing technology, power management and analog solutions – along with an ecosystem of cloud service providers to help our customers get connected to the cloud faster. TI is adding Microsoft Azure to its IoT Cloud ecosystem – a select group of organizations that support a wide variety of TI devices to enable a quick and easily connection to the cloud.
