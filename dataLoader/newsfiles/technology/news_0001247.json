I am not including the child grants or disablity grants.\nThe pensioners were the ones that worked for this country, and now they have to live on a couple of slices of bread and some jam a day, cant afford to pay the electricity costs, unable to have hot bath's even unable to cook.\nThey have to depend on others to live, Like I do, with the help of my family, but if I did not have them, at 70 there would be no chance of me getting another job.\nI was a nurse at one time. and worked in the government hospitals all my life. and this is the thanks I get from the government. I want this looked into as soon as possible.\nThank you on the behalf of all Pensioners in South Africa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:07:21.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
