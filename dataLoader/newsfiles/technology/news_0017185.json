Exlanation f how permafrost thawing could radically accelerate global warming \nGetting ministers involved \nBut it is unfair, analysts say, to place too much blame on rank-and-file diplomats, themselves deeply frustrated to have made so little headway with only five negotiating days left before the main event in Paris. \nWithout clear instructions from their ministers and, at the top of the political food chain, state leaders, they can only go so far in removing the logjams that have beleaguered climate talks for years. \n\"You have a very tight brief coming here from your ministers and capitals that you can't go beyond,\" said Alden Meyer, a veteran climate analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. \n\"That kind of dynamic can impede creativity and the ability to break through boxes to interesting solutions.\" \nThe French hosts have moved aggressively to bridge that gap. \nTo start, they have enlisted early and often the ministers who will ink the deal in December, with the next \"informal\" meeting—with some 60 countries in attendance—scheduled for this Sunday and Monday. \nOther high-level parlays coming up will give top leaders a chance to narrow the gap on core climate issues, ranging from hundreds of billions of dollars in financing for poor countries to how ambitious the world will be in slashing greenhouse gases. \nOn September 27, French President Francois Hollande and Ban Ki-moon will host a climate luncheon summit in New York, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. Diplomats have lamented the \"snail's pace\" of a round of crunch UN talks in Bonn to forge a workable draft for a climate rescue pact to be inked by the year's end \nA game changer \nAlso in September, foreign ministers will gather in another climate arena, called the Major Economies Forum, with finance ministers set to meet in Lima the following month at a joint session of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. \nFinally, France has invited presidents and prime ministers to attend the first day of the 12-day Paris conference. \n\"It is a way of ensuring that they inject some political momentum at the beginning,\" said Meyer. World map assessing international commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions. \n\"What happened in Copenhagen is that you had the ministers unable to do their job because they knew the leaders were coming at the end.\" \nBardram is optimistic that in Paris, negotiators will not paper over differences and punt serious disagreements further down the road. \n\"A purely superficial political accord without a robust set of accompanying [operational] decisions is not sufficient—I know that there are many parties that share that vision,\" she told AFP. \n\"This is not only about action for a few, but about transition to low carbon. It will be a game changer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T12:11:28.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
