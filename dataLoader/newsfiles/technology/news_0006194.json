But the latest laser-enabled concept is something the average consumer can more readily appreciate. The Skarp Razor may become the first-ever personal shaving tool powered by a laser. \nThe common means of hair-removal generally involves sharp steel blades, a layer of shaving cream, and water to rinse. Although this method has worked for generations, the team members behind the Skarp Razor believe it's possible that the same can be done with lasers. They claim that the Skarp can provide close and smooth shaves without the scratches, cuts, burns, or skin irritation that hazard our traditional shaving routines. \nPrototypes of the Skarp are constructed out of 6061 aluminum with the familiar look of shaving razors. But instead of an edge of steel, the Skarp uses a single fiber optic wielding a low-power, class 1 laser. Morgan Gustavsson, who is experienced in the field of medical and cosmetic lasers, states that his reasearch has led to the discovery of a chromophore in human hair that can be cut/broken when hit with a particular wavelength of light. The Skarp Razor is designed to target those specific molecules upon contact, safely removing the hair without a high-powered laser output or any lasting effects. \nUnlike some other methods of laser hair removal, the Skarp Razor does not heat up or melt hair, eliminating burns or offensive smells. It is supposed to work like a blade, cutting any color of hair against all skin types (e.g. sensitive, acne, uneven) and pigments, regardless of age, gender, or race. And given how the Skarp could be equipped and powered by a single rechargeable AAA battery, it has the potential to greatly reduce the waste associated with disposable razors, blade cartridges, and shaving cream canisters. \nThe Skarp Razor is supported by a patent and given our modern understanding of medical science and technology, it seems quite possible for it to go from design to reality. But one likely hurdle will be execution. In order to succeed in the eye of many backers, the Skarp Razor will have to cut hair with similar speed and efficacy as of standard steel blades, all with a laser that can safely operate off a single AAA battery for up to a month of standard use. Some beards and stubble get pretty darn thick, and it's yet to be seen how well the Skarp handles such manliness. \nThe Skarp Laser Razor is currently funding on Kickstarter, having raised 265 percent of its US$160,000 goal in just four days, with another 23 days left to go. Those interested in joining the ranks of backers on this project can pledge $159 for a single Skarp Razor, which is planned to retail for over $200. \nIf the tooling, production, clinical testing (very likely requiring FDA approval if it's to be classified as a medical device), and quality control go according to schedule, backers can expect shipments (certain countries only) to start sometime March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:46:37.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
