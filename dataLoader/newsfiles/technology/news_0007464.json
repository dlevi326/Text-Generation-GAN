The Sikh Coalition is urging citizens to contact their Congressional representatives and request them to co-sponsor a resolution honouring the victims of hate crimes, including Sikh-Americans, in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks. The appeal by the group comes in the wake of the brutal attack on Inderjit Singh Mukker (53) in Chicago’s Darien suburb on September 8. He was called “Terrorist, go back to your country, Bin Laden!” by his assailant, who repeatedly punched Mukker in the face, causing him to lose consciousness, bleed profusely and suffer a fractured cheekbone and a laceration to his cheek. The suspect is in custody and the Darien Police Department has notified The Sikh Coalition that they are investigating this matter as a hate crime. “On the eve of the 9/11 anniversary, the violent attack on Mukker is another painful reminder for all Americans that hate remains alive and well in the US,” The Sikh Coalition’s Legal Director Harsimran Kaur said. “While we relentlessly work to protect Mukker’s rights and work hard to ensure that hate crime charges are pursued in this case, we urge all Americans to reach out to their neighbors to build bridges of understanding. It is through recognising our collective humanity that we can work together to end hate.” The coalition said this is a “critical time” for everyone to raise awareness and appreciation about the Sikh-Americans. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T22:49:33.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
