Not all start-ups will be launched in every market.\n\"The most important part is the very close work with our business units ... to have a partnership at the end of the acceleration program with the business units,\" Boulanger said.\nOrange itself has helped 107 start-ups over the past two years in 10 centres across the world, she said.
