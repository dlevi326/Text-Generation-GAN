BT is also among the first global network providers to offer this service in Europe through connectivity in Amsterdam and London. This capability leverages BT Cloud Connect, BT's high performance connectivity to cloud services. \nKeith Langridge, vice president, BT Connect portfolio, said: \"Our vision of Cloud of Clouds is all about giving customers more choice, more security and a better user experience as they orchestrate their increasingly diverse cloud environments. Our global network infrastructure helps them bring it all together by connecting them directly with enhanced security to a whole ecosystem of cloud providers. Our customers are looking forward to accessing Office 365 in the cloud as if it was hosted in their own data centers. Being among the first providers able to deliver this connectivity is an important milestone in our journey to be one of the world's leading cloud services integrators.\" \nBT was already, in 2014, among the first global providers to enable its customers to connect directly to Azure through a security-enhanced, reliable and resilient connection. As a result, BT's enterprise customers can build a seamless, hybrid IT environment encompassing their corporate networks, data centers and Azure. It also includes single billing facilities for the BT Compute and Azure services. Customers can leverage BT's network and systems integration strengths, in combining their own cloud with Microsoft's cloud under a single service wrap from BT. \nHoulder, a global marine and offshore design and engineering company, was one of BT's first customers to use Azure ExpressRoute connectivity. \nAndy Matthews, IT Manager at Houlder, said: \"Adding Office 365 to the existing Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute connectivity provided by BT is a logical extension of the service for us. In our own testing of ExpressRoute for Office 365, the service delivered consistently high performance, security and reliability. The new service also simplifies management so customers can operate both Microsoft cloud environments through one resilient connection. This supports Houlder's goal of reducing our in-house infrastructure, freeing up resources to focus on our innovative engineering output instead.\" \nAzure ExpressRoute for Office 365 adds to the wide range of business solutions that BT already offers with Microsoft, and demonstrates both companies' commitment to cloud interoperability for their customers. \nBT's technology vision: the Cloud of Clouds The cloud is creating choices that never existed before. Through understanding those choices comes the confidence and the ability to harness change and do things that matter: get to market and innovate faster, keep costs down, and keep customers happy. \nBT's Cloud of Clouds vision is about allowing customers to connect easily and securely to the applications and data they need, regardless of where they are hosted and where they are based. \nAs a cloud service integrator, we help customers move confidently and successfully along their cloud journey whilst minimising the complexity, risk and cost; to give them a choice of roadmaps that work for their organisation, in a way that will deliver the results they need. We manage the whole process from network to cloud, we deal with third parties, deliver performance and security and simplify pricing, all under a single Service Level Agreement. \nClick here for more information on the Cloud of Clouds \nAbout BT BT's purpose is to use the power of communications to make a better world.
