ICER uses ultra- high capacity processors, coupled with sophisticated and proprietary audio processing software, to identify illegal calling between inmates. Securus, through its purchase of JLG Technologies last year and subsequent further investment in infrastructure and capacity, is now making ICER available to all of its customers without charge. \nThe full rollout of Securus' latest investigative solution will help identify hundreds of thousands of illegal inmate communication events that would otherwise go undetected. Inmate telephone providers without access to ICER will not be able to identify and alert agencies to these calls and illegal inmate-to-inmate communication will continue to occur unnoticed. \n\"We've made a commitment to our customers to provide the most cutting-edge technology available,\" said Richard A. \"Rick\" Smith, CEO of Securus Technologies. \"To do this well, we continually invest in innovation which makes us the clear technology leader in the industry. Securus provides technology that other carriers cannot replicate, and that leads to more connected calls, alternative communication methods such as video visitation, and the very best investigative solutions for corrections staff. Our call platform footprint and architecture allows us to push these innovations out to our customers quickly and seamlessly--making sure our customers continue to maximize the safety and security of their facilities and the communities in which they reside.\" \nCompleting calls safely and securely in a corrections environment has become increasingly difficult due to the use of mobile cell phones. Inmates continually find new ways to circumvent security rules. \"If the technology doesn't keep pace, it makes for an extremely dangerous situation. Our newest technology provides alerts to when that's happening, and we're giving it away for free to our loyal customers,\" said Smith. \nABOUT SECURUS TECHNOLOGIES Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and serving more than 2,600 public safety, law enforcement and corrections agencies and over 1,000,000 inmates across North America, Securus Technologies is committed to serve and connect by providing emergency response, incident management, public information, investigation, biometric analysis, communication, information management, inmate self-service, and monitoring products and services in order to make our world a safer place to live.
