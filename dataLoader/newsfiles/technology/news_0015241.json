What's digital entitlement? \nThe core differences between product key activation and digital entitlement activation are the following two: Digital entitlement does not require a product key. The activation is linked to the device. \nSince activation is linked to the device, it is possible to re-install the same version of Windows 10 on the device without entering a product key and have it activated once the installation completes (by skipping the product key step). \nObviously, you need to make sure that Windows 10 has been activated once on the device before you reinstall the operating system on it as you won't be able to do so if it is not fully activated (and thus linked to the device). \nThe main issue with this type of activation is that you cannot use this activated version of Windows 10 on a new device. \nInsider Builds \nIf you have been running Insider Builds before Windows 10 was officially released by Microsoft, your system will remain activated for as long as you don't revert back to regular builds of Windows. \nNew users who opt-in to the Insider program need to activate Windows 10 before they can activate the system. \nInstalling Windows 10 Insider Preview on a device that never had an activated copy of Windows 10 on it will require using a Windows 10 product key or buying genuine Windows from the Windows Store. This also applies if the new installation is for an edition of Windows 10 that wasn’t previously activated on the device. Windows 10 Activation Troubleshooting \nMore information and instructions about Windows 10 activation errors here . \nThis product key didn't work. (Error code: 0xC004C003) \nLicense could not be found or was invalid. (Error code: 0xC004F034) \nThere are several reasons why these errors may be thrown: You ran a clean install of Windows instead of upgrading from previous versions of Windows. The fix for this is to go back to the previous version, and run the upgrade from it to get Windows 10 activated properly. The activation servers may have been busy. Windows will try again or you can try and activate manually under Activation in the Settings. An invalid product key was used, for instance a Windows 7 product key. \nGenuine Validation detected tampered Windows binaries. (Error code: 0xC004C4AE) \nThis error is thrown if third-party software added display languages to Windows that are not officially supported. To fix it use system restore, restore backups or reset the PC. \nThe Software Licensing Service determined that this specified product key can only be used for upgrading, not for clean installations. (Error code: 0xC004F061) \nThis happens when you try to use an upgrade key on a fresh installation of Windows 10 without previous versions of Windows present on the device. \nA networking problem has occurred while activating your copy of Windows. (Error code: 0xC004FC03) \nIf you receive this error, something is blocking Windows 10 from completing the activation process online. Either try to troubleshoot the issue so that the activation can be performed online, or use the phone activation method instead. \nThe activation server reported that the product key has exceeded its unlock limit. (Error code: 0xC004C008) \nThe product key is not accepted because its number of activations has been exceeded. This can be the case if Windows 10 has already been installed on another device and activated using this product key. Solution is to buy another product key, or to contact Microsoft Support to sort out the error if it is one. \nThe activation server reported that the Multiple Activation Key has exceeded its limit. (Error code: 0xC004C020) \nThis error is similar to the one above. It means that the activation limit for the entered product key has been exceeded. \nDNS name does not exist. (Error code: 0x8007232B) \nThe filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. (Error code: \n0x8007007B) \nThis refers to network issues while trying to activate a work PC. These errors may be thrown if you are trying to activate a work PC while not connected to the work network. \nThe Software Licensing Service reported that the license evaluation failed. (Error code: 0xC004E003) \nThe error may be thrown if third-party software, corruption or attacks modified system files needed for Windows activation. System Restore, backups, or a reset, may resolve the issue. \nA security error occurred. (Error code: 0x80072F8F) \nThis error may be thrown if the system's date and time are set incorrectly, or if Windows cannot connect to the online activation service. \nUnspecified error. (Error code: 0x80004005) \nMicrosoft recommends to activate Windwos manually if the error is displayed. This is done with a click on Start, and the selection of Settings > Update & Security > Activation > Activate Windows.
