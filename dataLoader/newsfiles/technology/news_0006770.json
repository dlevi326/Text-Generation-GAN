Supplied as a pipe based sensor, the new Dens-itometer monitors slurry flow across an entire cross section and provides accurate, real-time data on the density profiles of moving solids during dredging. \nIts patented measurement technology uses electrical conductivity - rather than gamma radiation - to take these essential readings.\nKen Primrose, CEO of ITS, said: “ITS is the only company in the world to have commercialised electrical resistance tomography for high conductivity systems. We’ve achieved this by developing a patented, high conductivity adapter specifically for use with seawater-based systems.\nThe fact that our DENS-ITOMETER technology can be deployed for use on board vessels, we believe is also a unique capability.  This specialist expertise, together with low maintenance costs and operational benefits has made the DENS-ITOMETER our best selling tomography package to date.”\nAn adaptable design allows the Densitometer to inspect 100% of flows no matter what the orientation of the pipe. The Dens-itometer also eliminates the need to receive, maintain or dispose of nuclear sources either on board ship or at land based installations.\nLaunched in early 2015 and already installed in some of the leading dredging and mining firms across the world, the Dens-itometer is proven in use and able to handle extremely demanding field requirements including: pipes with diameters of up to 1.2 metres, heavy rocks as well as fine grain and flows of up to 30,000 tonnes per hour. \nFor all the latest on dredging, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T18:31:40.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
