September 03, 2015 -- Sep 3, 2015 - ( Newswire.com ) \nBusinessCreator, Inc. Announces the Launch of their new Celebrity Endorsement Program for small to medium-sized businesses. \nBusinessCreator, Inc., an established leader in local search marketing, mobile marketing, social marketing and video marketing, today announced the launch of their new Celebrity Endorsement Program. \nAccording to BusinessCreator, Inc. President Edward Kundahl, the Celebrity Endorsement Program will be available for purchase immediately and will be available by calling 855-943-8736. \nThe Celebrity Endorsement Program is designed to help small businesses grow their social outreach to attract new customers. We setup a program to broker relationships between celebrities and local businesses who do not have the reach or finances that large, national companies have. We develop custom social media campaigns centered around a celebrity that would make an appropriate spokesperson on social media for our client, stated Kundahl. \nCelebrities carry heavy Social Weight with their recommendations and endorsements, which adds value and recognition to your brand. A celebrity can Tweet about your store, and consumers will rush through your door to see what the buzz is about, continued Kundahl. \nOne celebrity post can draw thousands of shares, fans, and local recognition to your business, which translates into a surge of new customers for your store. This is the same concept the big retailers use to endorse their products and services but for a cost that is affordable for the small business owner. Endorsements can be used forever in many campaigns. The posts are shared and re-shared over and over again. Your business will stand out from your competitors, concluded Kundahl. \nMore About BusinessCreator, Inc. \nFounded in 1994, BusinessCreator, Inc. has helped many businesses with local search marketing, mobile marketing, social marketing and video marketing.
