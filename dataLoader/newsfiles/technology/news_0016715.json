They also come to shore on the Russian side.\nResearchers say it's likely a result of less sea ice brought on by climate warming.\nWalrus dive to feed on clams, sea snails and other food on the ocean bottom but cannot swim indefinitely.\nMany male walrus never leave the Bering Sea but females, especially mothers with pups, ride the edge of the sea ice as it moves north in summer through the Bering Strait and into the Arctic Ocean. They use sea ice as a platform from which to dive for food while pups rest on the ice.\nIn recent years, sea ice has receded north beyond shallow continental shelf waters and over water that exceeds 2 miles deep, beyond the diving range of an adult walrus.\nWalrus in large numbers were first spotted on the U.S. side of the Chukchi Sea in 2007. They returned in 2009, and in 2011, scientists estimated 30,000 walruses along 1 kilometer of beach near Point Lay.\nLast year, an estimated 35,000 walrus were photographed 5 miles north of Point Lay.\nThe agency and two others last week issued an appeal to stay away from large gatherings of walrus that come ashore. Young animals are vulnerable to stampedes when a group gathers nearly shoulder-to-shoulder on a beach.\nStampedes can be triggered by a polar bear, human or low-flying airplane. The carcasses of more than 130 mostly young walruses were counted after a stampede in September 2009 at Alaska's Icy Cape.\nWith this year's low summer sea ice, it's not surprising to see walrus on shore looking for a place to rest, Margaret Williams of the World Wildlife Fund in Anchorage said in a statement. The sharp decline of Arctic sea ice over the last decade is leading to major changes for wildlife and communities.\n\"Such extreme events are a stark reminder of the urgent need to ratchet down the emissions that are warming our planet,\" Williams said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:46:18.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
