(Photo: The XQ Project)\n8 CONNECT 42 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Since its emergence nearly two centuries ago, the American public high school has endured as one of the most promising yet problematic features of our education system. The subject of countless reforms and re-imaginings, the big, comprehensive public high school seems at once ripe for change and stubbornly resistant to it.\nNow a high-profile philanthropic effort, led by Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, seeks to remake high school for a high-tech, post-factory era, with a decidedly local, experimental approach.\nThe Emerson Collective, which funds Powell Jobs' philanthropic projects, on Wednesday rolls out XQ: The Super School Project. Funded to the tune of $50 million over five years, it will select five or more promising new public high school models by next fall and underwrite experimentation — $2 million per year per school.\nThe amount pales in comparison to what most public schools receive from taxpayers, but Powell Jobs told USA TODAY she wants the extra funding \"to inspire new thinking\" about what might work.\nXQ will look for what it calls \"audacious, unconventional, unconstrained ideas to reinvent the American high school.\" It plans to share the successes with other communities looking for new ways to get students ready for college and careers.\n\"We are trying to make this completely local and appropriate to each community,\" Powell Jobs said. \"It's driven and owned by the communities. That's what makes me most excited.\"\nThe effort pushes heavily on the idea that American high schools have long been \"frozen in time\" as jobs of the new century change. \"To prepare the teenagers of the early 20th century for factory life, we put them in a pre-factory,\" the campaign's literature asserts. \"And that's where we've kept our teenagers ever since.\"\nPowell Jobs said all students deserve a chance to immerse themselves in theater, arts, mathematics, civics, science, technology and engineering, among other subjects. And they should do it in a project-based curriculum that focuses on \"absolutely relevant\" learning.\nA few high schools are \"knocking it out of the park\" when it comes to these sorts of lessons, she said. But others are struggling. \"Building these kind of schools for every single child in our country would be absolutely great work.\"\nThe effort, which rolls out publicly on Wednesday, will also include an unusual media and outreach campaign, including video spots featuring The Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams. In one spot, she confides to viewers, \"We need to talk about high school.\"\nDressed in a silver-and-green spacesuit, Williams invokes the space race of the 1960s and says most of her audience is too young to remember it. \"Long story short,\" she says, \"we totally put a dude on the moon. It was epic!\"\nWe need the same energy, she says, to rethink American high schools, which are academically falling behind international competitors. \"We need to shoot for the moon again.\"\nA visitor to XQ:The Super School Project records memories of high school in a special sound booth.

She also founded the Education Trust-West, an Oakland-based education advocacy group for low-income and minority students.\nAs part of that work, she said, she realized that high school is a crucial time in young people's lives. \"It is where students can have the most agency over their own learning,\" she said.\nIt's also increasingly seen as a time that is key to brain development, recent research suggests.\nAli said the group is in the effort \"for the long haul,\" at least five years and likely more. \"We expect a multi-year journey,\" she said.\nThe new effort isn't the first high-profile re-imagining of high school. Fifteen years ago, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation invested what would eventually grow to more than $2 billion to create \"better high schools.\" That effort saw what even Bill Gates himself eventually characterized as mixed results: Many of the schools pioneered new methods that endure years later, he told supporters in 2009. And many saw attendance and graduation rates rise.\nBut Gates said his bigger goal — to raise \"college-ready\" graduation rates so that more students could succeed in college and beyond — often fell short.\nAsked if she worries that the new effort's focus on funding local ideas means it'll have to settle for small ideas, Powell Jobs said, \"I think we're going to be really surprised. I don't think local equates to small.\"\nShe added, \"I have found a universal desire for greatness from families for their children.\"\n8 CONNECT 42 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Fe4Otj TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b4285c1d64d50de5d52d9f73b4d2a8eb66f33a6/c=326-0-5433-3840&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635779391888981494-HS-cube.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1Fe4Otj", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f602284233b97c28e15b66bbefaf727473a16eb/r=500x349/local/-/media/2015/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635779382906131912-williams2.PNG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Fe4Otj&text=New%20effort%20seeks%20%27audacious%27%20ideas%20to%20remake%20USA%20high%20schools&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635779382906131912-williams2.PNG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0d72c611b538957187425a68467f3520c288eb06/c=24-0-657-476&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635779382906131912-williams2.PNG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Fe4Otj&mini=true"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:47:56.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
