It had come from an earlier work of Kildall.\n“In 2010, I made Playing Duchamp , which was a commissioned art project,” said Kildall. “I reprogrammed an open-source chess engine to play chess as if it were Marcel Duchamp. I worked with his 72 recorded chess matches, all tournament games that he played in, to modify the algorithm to resemble his style and skill level of chess play.”\nIn the process of researching Duchamp’s chess life, Kildall found old pictures of Duchamp’s own hand-carved chess set, created around 1917. He loved the aesthetic, and wanted to recreate the beautiful objects. So Kildall turned to another digital fabrication artist, Bryan Cera, to work out how to model 3D-printable versions derived from the archival pictures.", "external_links": ["http://archive.turbulence.org/Works/playing_duchamp/game.php"], "published": "2015-09-08T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T22:46:37.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
