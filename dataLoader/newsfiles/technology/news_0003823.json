Farrell II.\nSeparately, SunEdison and an investor group advised by a unit of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. unveiled a strategic partnership that will fund renewable energy projects. This partnership, which will be majority owned by J.P. Morgan's clients, and may be expanded with the agreement of both partners, is initially expected to fund the purchase 33% interest in the solar portfolio.\nThe partnership with the J.P. Morgan clients aims to support added flexibility and long-term growth for both SunEdison and renewable-energy spinoff TerraForm Power Inc.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com\n 08, 2015 09:01 ET (13:01 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T09:25:10.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
