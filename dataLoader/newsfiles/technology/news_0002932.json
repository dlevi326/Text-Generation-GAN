Well, according to Vergara’s Modern Family co-star Julie Bowen anyway.\nJoe and Sofia's 'primal' passion Speaking to Us Weekly at an event in West Hollywood, Bowen said: “He’s like a caveman with her. It’s sexy! I love it. She’s so strong, and so [used to] calling the shots all the time, and then you see them together and there’s a part of her that kind of melts. It just warms your heart when you see that, because it’s not all the time that you can tell that there’s an aspect to this relationship that’s very — how shall we say? — primal.”\nSofia Vergara at Magic Mike XXL premiere The 45-year-old Modern Family actress added that she’s thinking of throwing Vergara a wedding shower on set — but isn’t quite sure how to plan a party fitting of her vivacious co-star.\nOther Stories Murray brothers edge Aussies in Cup epic Tennis 0 comments Abbotts dogged by pack of rabid foes Opinion 0 comments Libs win Canning by-election Live 0 comments Goodes says that’s enough after 372 games Afl 0 comments Women winners in new Cabinet Nsw 0 comments NRL investigates loss of 2534 juniors Nrl 0 comments “You’re like, ‘Oh, Sofia, what do you want for your wedding shower?’ And she’s going to be like, ‘Ay, I want a toaster and some plates,’” she joked. “She has a beautiful new house.
