Source: AP \nAnalyst Jeffrey White of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said: “They are not going to sit around and defend the airfield or maybe even the province of Latakia. \n“This kind of aircraft suggests that the Russians intend to exert their combat power outside of Latakia in an offensive role.” \nMoscow has been on a diplomatic push to get the coalition of Western and regional powers fighting the Islamic State group in Syria to join forces with Assad against the jihadists. \nUS Defence Secretary Ashton Carter spoke with his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu on Friday, ending an 18-month freeze in military relations triggered by NATO anger over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine crisis. \nThey agreed to continue discussions, which are crucial to lessen the risk of incidents involving coalition forces and Russian forces operating in the same air space. \nThe US-led coalition is carrying out almost daily strikes against the jihadists in Syria.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T09:36:29.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
