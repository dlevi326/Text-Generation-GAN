Photo: Supplied\nA plan to make the Sunshine Coast a vital internet gateway is luring Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull to the area on Friday to view the proposal in person.\nToday four undersea communications cables – essentially industrial-scale fibre optic broadband – come into Sydney, with a fifth one going into Perth, helping connect Australia to the online world.\nThe plan would bring Australia's sixth undersea communications cable to the Sunshine Coast.\nCommunications Minister Malcolm Turnbull to visit Sunshine Coast on Friday Photo: Brendan Esposito\nThe 'submarine' cables link Australia's voice and data traffic to international markets.\nAdvertisement A link into the Sunshine Coast would be the only link on Australia's east coast outside of Sydney.\nSunshine Coast digital technology businessman Ted O'Brien – the LNP's rival candidate for Clive Palmer's Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax – said the scheme could make the Sunshine Coast an \"internet gateway\".\n\"By bringing it into the Sunshine Coast – which would be the only place on the eastern seaboard outside of Sydney – it puts the Sunshine Coast on the map as an internet gateway.\"\nThe Sunshine Coast Council in July applied to run Australia's sixth undersea communications cable – a spur from a line already connecting Guam to Sydney – into the Sunshine Coast.\nThis YouTube presentation explains the basic proposal.\nThe council believes the expansion of the Sunshine Coast Airport – where a new runway is to be built - the soon-to-open Sunshine Coast University Public Hospital and the Sunshine Coast University were all important triggers for Sunshine Coast business to build on with better internet access.\nACMA (Australia's Communications and Media Authority) - an independent statutory authority - is responsible for assessing and approving undersea cable applications.\nIt acknowledged the organisation had received and was reviewing the Sunshine Coast Council's application.\nThe Sunshine Coast Council is applying for a protection zone, effectively giving notice to fishing fleets that it wishes to have an undersea submarine cable come to the Sunshine Coast.\nProtection zones prevent towing, operating or suspending ship trawl gear near the seabed where the submarine cables lie.\nMr Turnbull on Wednesday declined to comment until after he had been briefed on the Sunshine Coast Council project on Friday.\nMr O'Brien, who worked for 12 years with international digital technology firm Accenture , said the proposal was tailored for the Sunshine Coast.\n\"It is an enabler for other things to happen,\" Mr O'Brien said.\n\"In my view the undersea cable itself doesn't deliver the economic boon you need, rather it is what you do with it,\" he said.\nMr O'Brien said having the undersea communications cable come into the Sunshine Coast – in the initial modelling it connects to the Sunshine Coast Airport – would let businesses connect faster to international markets.\nHe said the move would allow local businesses to attract investment capital for future growth.\n\"One of the biggest problems any regional economy faces is how do you unlock capital from outside your region,\" Mr O'Brien said.\n\"This is a massive game-changer for the Sunshine Coast,\" he said.\n\"It allows us as a region to suddenly get on the map when it comes to major technology.\"\nSunshine Coast mayor Mark Jamieson in July said the topography of the ocean floor off the Sunshine Coast offered strong possibilities for the connection.\n\"The Sunshine Coast is in the best possible location to provide a new cable landing point on the eastern seaboard, taking into account the topography of the coast line and marine environment and the existence of a significant population centre sufficiently distant from Sydney.\n\"If this protection zone is achieved and the cable is delivered, the shape of the region's economy and our attractiveness to new businesses will change profoundly and forever,\" Cr Jamieson.\n\"It will provide milliseconds of advantage and significantly improved speed and bandwidth from Queensland – all from the Sunshine Coast.\n\"Milliseconds are integral to banking and finance, digital solutions developers and those businesses and industries that are heavily dependent on online transactions.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.acma.gov.au/Industry/Telco/Infrastructure/Submarine-cabling-and-protection-zones/nsw-protection-zones-submarine-cable-zones-i-acma", "http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/sitePage.cfm?code=undersea-cable", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/07GtQ90yfw0", "https://www.accenture.com/au-en/strategy-index.aspx", "http://www.acma.gov.au/Industry/Telco/Infrastructure/Submarine-cabling-and-protection-zones/submarine-telecommunications-cables-submarine-cable-zones-i-acma"], "published": "2015-09-03T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T07:06:21.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
