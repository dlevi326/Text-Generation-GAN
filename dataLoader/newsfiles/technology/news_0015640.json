This season’s lineup of shows featured a series of over-the-top, theatrical approaches to set design including beach-as-runway, red-carpet-as-runway , and swimming-pool-as-runway. But one of the most intriguing concepts, championed by the up-and-coming designer Misha Nonoo didn’t include much in the way of physical props at all. Instead, it lived exclusively on Instagram.\nLast weekend, Nonoo became the first designer to debut her collection solely via the picture-sharing platform—releasing a series of individual photos that came together to form a complete panoramic image when viewed in tandem. Spectators could see the “Insta-show” by following the handle @mishanonoo_show and gain access to the mosaic of images, which went live at 10 a.m. EST on Saturday morning. The photos showcase models clad in contemporary chic against white walls and exposed brick—a visual closely resembling that of an editorial magazine spread . By turning their phones horizontally and scrolling, viewers could walk themselves down the runway.", "external_links": ["http://mishanonoo.com/", "https://instagram.com/mishanonoo_show/", "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/inside-fashion-week/spring-2016/trend-watch-lace", "http://nymag.com/thecut/runway/2016/spring/new-york/rtw/marc-jacobs/", "http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/09/everything-to-know-about-fashion-week-so-far.html"], "published": "2015-09-20T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T15:18:21.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
