We'll examine the factors behind this shift and provide some prescriptive advice on ways channel firms can retool their business models and customer acquisition strategies.\" \nMuch of this marketplace dynamism is driven by the widespread availability of cloud-based and mobile technology solutions. With technology more accessible and available to more users, organizations are changing their approaches and processes for choosing, implementing and managing IT. \n\"For example, many departments besides IT – individual business units, finance, marketing, sales and human resources – are more engaged in the discussions and decisions on technology purchases,\" Robinson noted. \"This change doesn't eliminate the need for channel partners, but it does alter the manner in which channel partners engage with existing and prospective customers.\" \nComplete presentation slides will be posted on CompTIA's SlideShare account ( http://www.slideshare.net/comptia ) following the live program. \nChannel Directions Live is a new event designed for partners to address the changing business dynamics of the IT channel head on. Leaders from across the channel will come together to tackle the tough business challenges of today and map out the future direction of the industry.
