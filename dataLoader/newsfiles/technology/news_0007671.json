Aware, Inc. (NASDAQ: AWRE ), a leading global provider of biometrics software products and solutions, today announced that a number of its products have been licensed by Certisign to build a cloud-based biometric services platform. Certisign is the largest supplier of digital certificates in Brazil . They intend to leverage their substantial presence in the Latin American security technology and services market to deliver new biometric identity proofing and authentication services. Targeted customers include banks, retailers, telecoms, healthcare providers, and government agencies that want to reduce fraud by more effectively authenticating the identity of their customers and employees, but prefer a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. The multi-tiered Certisign platform is built upon key Aware software products, including Biometric Services Platform (BioSP™), Nexa™, Inquire™, and Astra™. The enrollment and verification stations are branded by Certisign and were built using Aware's NISTPack, SequenceCheck™, LiveScan API, PreFace™, and IrisCheck™ SDKs. The system is designed to be sufficiently scalable to meet high-volume service demands, while its modularity enables Certisign to support the varied requirements of a diverse customer base. Aware will receive a per-transaction fee for Certisign's right to use Aware's software in the system. \"The range and flexibility of Aware's software helped make our new biometric services possible,\" commented Igor Rocha , managing director of Certibio, the biometric business unit of Certisign. \"Their deep expertise and reliable support are what we expect will help ensure our success.\" Biometric enrollment and identity proofing can be conducted either at a customer's premises or at one of Certisign's 1400+ retail locations. Biometric authentication is performed by customer staff using workstations installed at the location of their choice. Services can be deployed either from Certisign's highly secure cloud, or alternatively from software installed in a private cloud or network. \"Certisign promises to make robust identity fraud prevention truly universally accessible throughout Brazil and beyond,\" said Rob Mungovan , VP of Biometrics at Aware. \"We are pleased to be providing the identity platform in a solution that will surely set a benchmark for consumer-facing biometrics-as-services.\" Aware will be demonstrating its biometrics software products and solutions at the Global Identity Summit , taking place September 21-24 in Tampa . Igor Rocha of Certibio will provide more information about their new services in a presentation at the Biometrics 2015 conference, taking place October 13-15 in London , where Aware will also be exhibiting.
