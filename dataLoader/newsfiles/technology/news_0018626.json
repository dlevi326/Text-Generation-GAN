But they've come too far to turn back.\nSome huddle in the small tents they carried, others sit on blankets, many only have the bare ground. The facilities include one water tap and four mobile toilets.\nThey form serpentine queues for a meal, handed out by the workers at the Migration Aid organisation.\nBudapest Mayor Istvan Tarlos said on Wednesday that the authorities will build a tent camp for refugees near the main train station in the city within two weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T00:41:35.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
