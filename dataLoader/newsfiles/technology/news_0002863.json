Smartphones may be getting bigger, but the Nexus 6’s 5.96 inches felt like a step too far . It was practically impossible to use with one hand, even for those with extra long thumbs. \nThe second flaw was with the camera. For a high-end smartphone, picture quality was nothing special, and Google’s own camera app - which is bundled with the Nexus - was painfully slow. \nBoth of these issues have been alluded to with the Nexus 6P, the successor to the Nexus 6, which Google unveiled on Tuesday evening. \nThe new Nexus 6P phone introduced by Google (Photo: EPA/Google) \nWhile its 5.7-inch screen places it firmly at the top end of phablet territory, even the slight reduction in its size makes it feel a lot more manageable. Meanwhile, the camera has not only been improved but supercharged, with both the hardware and software bringing major upgrades. \nThe 6P has 12.3-megapixel sensor, but more importantly, Google says, it has “bigger pixels”, which let in more light for much better photos. It was difficult to fact-check this in the few minutes I had to play with it, but photos did appear crisp and bright. \n\"Bigger pixels\" allow the camera to let in more light (Photo: Google) \nIn the small amount of time I had with the Nexus 6P, these two changes made the new device feel like enough of an upgrade to make it worth considering, but there’s a lot more to it than that. \nWhile last year’s Nexus 6 was built by Motorola, this year’s model has been developed by China’s Huawei, meaning the changes go beyond just a few upgrades. \nThe new Google Nexus 6P is on display during a Google event on Tuesda (Photo: AP/Tony Avelar) \nFor one thing, the phone’s chassis is made of aluminium, rather than the Nexus 6’s plastic. Which one you prefer is a matter of taste, but the metal finish does give the 6P a sense of being a little more of a premium handset. It is also slimmer and flatter than last year’s model, whose curved form could make it a little difficult to hold. \nThe Google Nexus 6P is faster than previous models (Photo: Alastair Good) \nThe phone’s innards also have a big upgrade. Qualcomm's 64-bit Snapdragon 810 processor gives the Nexus 6P a huge speed boost, at least in the demo model I tried. \nFor the first time on a Nexus device, the 6P and its smaller counterpart the 5X have fingerprint sensors. This is now a given in a high-end device, so Google is playing catch-up, but the sensor was very easy to set up and, in use, unlocked the phone immediately. \nThe sensor is, though, placed on the back of the phone, meaning you use your index finger to unlock it. I didn’t find this as intuitive as it might seem - when I hold a phone I tend to wrap my fingers around the opposite side to my wrist, so the back of the phone isn’t a natural place to put my finger when I unlock it. This might be something one gets used to, however. \nDave Burke, vice president of engineering at Google, speaks about the new Google Nexus 6P (Photo: (AP/Tony Avelar) \nThe other major selling point of the Nexus 6P is its battery life and charging using the new USB type-C connector, which Google claims can give seven hours of battery life with just 10 minutes of charging. This was obviously not something I could determine in the short time with the device, but the Nexus 6 lasted all day for me, so as long as the battery isn’t worse this time, it will be good enough. \nThe Nexus 6P is slimmer and flatter than last year's model (Photo: Alastair Good) \nAt £449 for the entry-level 32GB model, the Nexus 6P comes in a lot cheaper than the highest-specced devices from Samsung or Apple. \nIf it lives up to Google’s claims about battery life and camera quality, it could well be a big success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T01:44:27.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
