We were pleased to welcome over 70 industry leaders, who went on to meet with Members of Congress and federal regulators, including the CFPB, Federal Reserve and Treasury, to discuss issues facing the industry. This Fly-In was a unique opportunity for our members to speak directly to lawmakers and provide insight into how the payments industry drives the U.S. economy. \n“The ETA Executive Payments Fly-In brings industry leaders to Washington as the voice of the payments industry,” said Jason Oxman, ETA CEO. “ETA is excited to bring our members face to face with members of Congress and regulators to engage in frank discussion about our industry, which enables $5 trillion in electronic transactions for merchants and consumers in the U.S. each year.” \nOur Fly-In participants met with 40 Congressional leaders and regulators, including members of the newly formed House and Senate Payments Caucuses, over the course of the day. The House Congressional Payments Technology Caucus and the Senate Payments Innovation Caucus were formed to explore the new and innovative technologies in the payments industry, as well as answer questions about data security, unbanked users’ access to electronic payments, and more. Senator David Perdue (R-GA), a member of the Senate Caucus, addressed the attendees at lunch. \n“Having a voice in politics is crucial for businesses of all sizes”, said Scott Talbott, ETA Senior Vice President of Government Affairs. “At a time of unprecedented change in the payments industry, including mobile payments and other new technologies, ETA’s government relations efforts are enormously important to advance our industry.” \n“ETA member companies continue to drive payments technology innovation,” said Greg Cohen, President of iPayment and ETA’s President-Elect. “We are grateful that members of Congress and regulators are interested in and excited about the secure and convenient payments advancements that we are offering American consumers and merchants.” \nThe ETA Executive Payments Fly-In was the latest in ETA’s series of policy events advancing the payments technology industry. Upcoming events include Chip Card 101 on October 1 in Washington, DC. Follow us on Twitter for more events and ETA news, as well as the latest updates from the payments industry.
