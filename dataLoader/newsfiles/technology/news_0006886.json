Acqueon Insights Platform (AiP) and Acqueon Intuitive Response (AiR) integrate various customer data sources to provide holistic, contact center based business intelligence and predictive service (capabilities). These new products use analytics based intelligence to empower businesses to deliver a more precise and enhanced experience to customers through the contact center. By expanding its suite of Cisco contact center solutions to both inbound and outbound applications, Acqueon now provides customer experience solutions for all market segments.\nAcqueon Insights Platform\nAiP integrates various siloed customer data sources to provide detailed analytics and reporting for enhanced insights into customer satisfaction and customer service performance. Advanced inbound reporting and graphical analysis lets businesses monitor performance and demand across regions, skill groups and individual agents through detailed metrics. Through customized reporting and data visualization, AiP is configurable to provide key data for any business vertical. These insights translate into reduced operational costs by improved resourcing decisions to efficiently, yet effectively meet customer demands.\nAcqueon Intuitive Response\nBy integrating and analyzing various customer data sources across the business, AiR gains a holistic view of each customer and their interactions. AiR leverages this data to predict customer intent or preemptively determine why the customer might need to contact the business in the near future. By integrating contact center, CRM and various backend systems, AiR predicts why the customer is contacting your business and provides personalized, automated service on a mass scale whether through the IVR or proactively through an outbound channel. By increasing the effectiveness and use of self service options, AiR reduces live call volume, thereby allowing the contact center to operate with fewer agents.\n“With the introduction of AiR and AiP Acqueon now provides solutions for all business verticals and for both inbound and outbound contact centers,” said Ashok Raj, Vice President of Product Management. “With these new product releases, businesses can fully leverage customer data for greater service performance insight as well as intelligent, predictive automation.”\nTo learn more about Acqueon’s new AiP and AiR products along with our outbound solutions for Cisco contact centers visit http://www.acqueon.com/cisco-products/.\nAbout Acqueon\nAcqueon Technologies Inc. specializes in developing software solutions for the customer collaboration space.
