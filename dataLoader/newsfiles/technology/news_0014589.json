The All-Star right-hander hasn’t won a game since beating the Marlins on May 17, the day he came within one out of throwing a no-hitter in Miami. He was 0-14 with a 3.68 ERA since that game and entering Monday’s start at Citi Field. In 19 of those 23 games, he has given up four or fewer earned runs. He gave up only two earned runs Monday in six innings. The record is 27 set in 1916.\nJim McIsaac The Braves’ Shelby Miller follows through on a pitch in the second inning against the Mets at Citi Field on Sept. 21, 2015.

Manager Fredi Gonzalez expects Markakis to be ready to play Tuesday night in Game 2 of the series at Citi Field in New York.\nFolty has ‘procedure’\nPitcher Mike Foltynewicz had a “procedure” done at an Atlanta hospital Monday for the blood clots in throwing arm, and during the procedure had the anterior half of his first rib removed. He will have another smaller procedure before a Thursday release and will go on bloodthinners.", "external_links": ["http://www.myajc.com/news/sports/baseball/markakis-out-of-braves-lineup-2nd-game-in-a-row/nnkLy/", "http://www.myajc.com/news/sports/baseball/braves-pitcher-foltynewicz-has-procedure-for-blood/nnkMQ/?icmp=ajc_internallink_referralbox_free-to-premium-referral", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/09/21/9b/e8/489476302.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-21T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T05:52:51.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
