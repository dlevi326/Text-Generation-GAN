The device, called the Halo H1, is a wearable that monitors the user’s hydration level using proprietary optical and electrical sensing technology. These sensors track trending interstitial fluid levels in the body, in addition to sodium-potassium ratios in the blood plasma, to determine the user’s state of hydration.\n“This technology has far-reaching implications,” said Fred Calero, co-founder and CEO at Halo. “Heat-related illnesses plague multiple sectors, from amateur and professional athletes, to industrial workers in extreme heat conditions. With this technology we now have the ability to provide real-time, actionable insight into the human body that’s never been available before.”\nHalo Wearables develops non-invasive sensing technologies for athletics, occupational health & safety, consumer fitness, and military applications. The focus for the H1 will be the team sports market, as well as industrial workplace settings that experience extreme heat conditions like the construction, agriculture, manufacturing, and oil & gas industries.\nThroughout the development of the H1, Halo consulted with multiple athletic trainers and sports scientists at the professional and collegiate levels, as well as health & safety leaders at manufacturing companies.\n“The demand for this technology has been overwhelming,” said Trevor Calero, co-founder and head of business development & marketing at Halo. “There’s a huge need for real-time hydration monitoring , and nothing exists today that can even come close to what we’re offering.”\nThe H1, slated for an early 2016 release, will not be made available to the public, however, Halo is currently working on a new wearable device that will specifically target the consumer fitness market.\n--\nAbout Halo Wearables, LLC\nHeadquartered in Plymouth, Michigan, Halo is a technology company that develops non-invasive sensing technologies for the elite athletics, occupational health & safety, consumer fitness and military markets. Halo produces the Halo H1, the first and only real-time, non-invasive hydration monitoring wearable device that tracks a user’s hydration at the cellular level.\nFor more information, please contact Halo by phone at 248.798.4554, or by email at media(at)halowearables(dot)com.
