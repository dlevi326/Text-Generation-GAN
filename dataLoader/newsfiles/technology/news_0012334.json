The breach exposed Hollywood secrets, destroyed company data and caused the movie studio to initially cancel the release of “The Interview,” which was about a fictional plot to assassinate North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-Un.\nRobert Lawson, a spokesman for Sony Pictures in Culver City, California, a division of Tokyo-based Sony Corp., declined to comment on the settlement.\nThe case is Corona v.
