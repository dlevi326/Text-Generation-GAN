Some of the money was also allegedly used on an “expensive custom-built bed”, Jiji added.\nKarpelès was arrested in August in connection with the loss of hundreds of millions of pounds worth of bitcoin when the exchange collapsed.\nAt the time, a spokesman for the Tokyo police said French-born Karpelès, 30, was suspected of accessing the exchange’s computer system in February 2013 and inflating his cash account by $1m.\nHe has denied the charges, saying he had intended to pay back the money, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.\nIn January this year, Yomiuri said that , contrary to reports from Mt Gox, the vast majority of missing bitcoins from the company’s stash were stolen by an insider, with just 7000 bitcoins, or 1% of the shortfall, attributable to hacking attacks from outside the company.", "external_links": ["http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/it/20141231-OYT1T50135.html?from=ytop_main6", "http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:utL4-uidTrMJ:jen.jiji.com/jc/i%3Fg%3Deco%26k%3D2015082100251+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk"], "published": "2015-09-14T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T21:28:55.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
