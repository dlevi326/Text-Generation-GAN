Starting Sept. 21, Howell will direct the nonprofit association's Institute of Innovation, which was first launched in 2012. \nHowell worked with the PM-ISE Program Manager Kshemendra Paul for five years helping plan, oversee the build-out, and manage use of the ISE to implement the president's terrorism-related information sharing priorities. That job capped a long career in government that also included stints as the CIO for the Interior Department and deputy administrator for IT at the Office of Management and Budget. \n\"I am really excited about this opportunity,\" Howell told FCW via email, \"because I think ACT-IAC and its Institute for Innovation provides a great venue for the federal government and private industry to work together to address important, timely, and challenging issues related to using technology to improve government.\" \nACT-IAC Executive Director Ken Allen confirmed the hire, and told FCW that Howell also will be co-chairing the cybersecurity committee and working on special projects with the institute. Howell already is a member of the American Council for Technology's executive committee, and Allen said the organization is looking forward to having him in the expanded role. \n\"We're delighted,\" Allen said. \"Mike Howell is a longtime leader in the community.\" About the Author \nBianca Spinosa is an FCW editorial fellow.
