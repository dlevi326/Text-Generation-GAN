Evidence of this is highlighted via a recently published World Health Organisation report which estimated that in 2012 Southeast Asia was the most polluted region in the world and indoor pollution accounted for 3.3 million deaths. \nCCS is an industry leader in sensor technology and its range of environmental sensor solutions and components are manufactured through a fabless supply model. This outsourced manufacturing flow relies upon the capabilities of the semiconductor industry’s leading suppliers based in Taiwan. \nAnthony Pan, Greater China Country Manager at CCS said, “The aim is to establish a strong local presence in order to provide optimum support for suppliers, customers and partners in Greater China and support the high volume supply chain in Taiwan. We are delighted to open our first regional office and we look forward to exploring the significant commercial opportunities for CCS’s environmental sensor solutions within the region”. \nAbout Cambridge CMOS Sensors \nFounded in 2008, Cambridge CMOS Sensors (CCS) is the industry leader in advanced sensor solutions providing sensor technology across multiple global markets. CCS is an ISO 9001:2008 certified fabless semiconductor company with an established high-volume supply chain. \nThe technology developed by CCS offers a radical step change in performance when compared to the competition; this has opened up multiple markets which previously were unserviceable. Ultra-low power consumption, fast response time, embedded intelligence and ultra-small form factor has enabled the growth of new application areas for improved health and wellbeing such as; ambient air quality monitoring and breathe analysis, in smartphones, tablets, wearables and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \nFor further information, please visit http://ccmoss.com/ Contacts \nAnthony Pan, Greater China Country Manager+886 3212 5303", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T11:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T11:36:22.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
