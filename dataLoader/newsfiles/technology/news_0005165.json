Since then, the company has doubled in employee size and is about to open an office in Canada.\n“We are also working with about 50 Australian businesses to sell into China, and our first global brand, Ecostore, is about to be launched.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:32:23.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
