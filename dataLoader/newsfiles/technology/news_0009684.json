Mr Warneke is also concerned about the protection of the confidentiality of the information.\nMr Warneke said some developing countries simply did not have the necessary resources to properly use the information. \"It remains a concern and a risk to companies as to what is going to happen with the information that is shared with other tax authorities,\" he said.\nKPMG international tax partner, and member of the Davis Tax Committee, Deborah Tickle said the Beps initiative was premised on the fact that there has to be co-ordination and buy-in from countries.\nThe Davis committee has already released its first interim report on Beps and requested further comment on some of the concerns from a South African perspective.\nMs Tickle said that in many respects South Africa does not have a choice at the moment about following the Beps project. The initiative sets out certain (international) rules and countries who want to stay in the international arena have to follow the rules.\n\"However, if the information that is obtained through the Beps initiative – like country-by-country reporting – is abused, then countries (like SA) are no longer obliged to give that information.\"\nOne fear is that tax authorities will use the information to make tax adjustments based simply on the reports.\nAccording to Ms Tickle, the authorities must make an independent assessment and conduct an audit if it is not satisfied with the company’s disclosures. It cannot simply use the country-by-country report to make adjustments. She admitted that it is a fine line between the two.\nThe OECD said in its guidance note on country-by-country reporting that there are specific conditions that underpin the obtaining and use of the country-by-country reports.\nOne of the conditions is that tax authorities should use the information to assess Beps-related risks and not to make adjustments to the income of any taxpayer, simply based on the data in the country-by-country report.\nHowever, SA Institute of Tax Professionals deputy CEO Keith Engel noted that country-by-country reporting may even have some benefits for the private sector.\nCertain countries within the region are imposing withholding and other charges that should fully demonstrate that certain companies are actually being over-taxed, Mr Engel said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:29:49.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
