Gen. Vincent Stewart said on Thursday at a conference for intelligence officials.

His admission follows a Wednesday story that 50 intelligence analysts had their reports on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria improperly altered by their superiors to portray the terrorist group as weaker than it is.\n\"The cancer was within the senior level of the intelligence command,\" one defense official told the Daily Beast.\nEarlier in the day, Stewart spoke before a panel of the House Intelligence Committee. He didn't touch on the allegation at that time, but did speak about intelligence collection, saying it was a collaborative effort by the government.\nMore from the Washington Examiner FEC Chair: Feds must help Americans make 'thoughtful' contributions \"Yes, I believe the American people are intelligent enough to make decisions,\" said FEC chairwoman Ann Ravel.\nBy Rudy Takala • 09/20/15 7:10 PM \"None of what I can do at DIA can be done without the efforts of NSA, or the things that are being done at CIA.
