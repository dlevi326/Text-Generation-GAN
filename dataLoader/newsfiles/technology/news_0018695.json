The revamped logo displayed as a Google Doodle on its homepage spells 'Google' in a sans-serif typeface similar to the one being used by Google's newly created holding company Alphabet. The compact version of the logo used to identify most of its apps bids farewell to the little blue \"g\" icon and replaces it with a uppercase \"G\" colored in blue red yellow and green to match the full logo. The new brand identity \"aims to make Google more accessible and useful to our users\" the company said in a blog post explaining the logo. The new logo comes three weeks after the company's surprise move to create a holding company called Alphabet to pool its many subsidiaries and separate the core web advertising business from newer ventures like driverless cars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:10:21.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
