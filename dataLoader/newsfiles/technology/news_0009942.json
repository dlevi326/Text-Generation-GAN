They’ve already driven the cost of new users up near $3 each, and that’s just the beginning. Engaged, signed-up users can cost $40-200. But now, on the other side, big brands are joining the mobile advertising banquet in droves, seeking new ways to connect to millions of customers. \nAdd it all up, and George is getting very upset indeed. \nBrand-based mobile advertising grew about 10X last Christmas season, says Lisa Marino of Rockyou . But that’s going to accelerate even more this coming holiday season when we hit another inflection point, she says. That fits with what internet sage Mary Meeker pointing out a recently: a $25 billion monetization gap on mobile between the massive growth of consumer time spent on mobile devices, and the trailing growth of advertising revenue. \nThat’s great news for mobile publishers who monetize via advertising; their business will grow. \nBut it’s tough news for mobile publishers who are looking to engage in extensive mobile user acquisition campaigns , because supply is going to be sucked up with increased demand, and prices will inevitably rise.

Competitive analysis engine AppScotch says that the average UA cost $2.91, but it varies significantly between categories. For instance, while apps in the business category average just over $1, poker apps are $5 and strategy games are over $4. Some games, such as MMORPG games, go as high as $12. \nOther apps, either not quite so well-known or savvy at UA, or simply in higher-value niches, are spending up to and above $90 for the right user, as we detail in the newly-released mobile user acquisition report from VB. \nAs worlds collide and brands continue to flood into mobile advertising, we’re already seeing signs of premium inventory shortage. There’s one reason the big apps from Supercell and Machine Zone are advertising on TV and other places: they have more ad dollars to spend than premium inventory to spend them on. \nThe competition — and mobile publishers’ desperate need for new users to drive increase revenue — has resulted in significant investment in the UA space: about $250 million in the last year. Above: Mobile investment heatwave \nThe implications for both mobile marketers and everyone else — mobile users — are obvious: Prices are going to go up Organic is going to become even more important than it is now Our collective mobile experiences are going to be increasingly noisy It’s going to be harder for mobile user acquisition marketers to cut through that noise \nCurrent prices are significant already, and climbing.
