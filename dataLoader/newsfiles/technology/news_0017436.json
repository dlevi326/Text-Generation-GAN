Comprising all 193 members, it is a forum for multilateral discussion of the spectrum of international issues covered by the Charter of the UN.\nThe general debate begins on Monday and will continue until Saturday. The assembly is due to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the UN and of the end of the Second World War and the use of nuclear bombs.\nPolice Minister Nathi Nhleko will on Tuesday release the annual crime statistics against the background of repeated calls for this to be done more than once a year.\nOf interest will be whether he will be joined by national police commissioner Riah Phiyega who has until Monday to inform Mr Zuma why she should not be suspended ahead of a board of inquiry into her fitness to hold office.\nGen Phiyega was found to have been dishonest before the Farlam Commission of Inquiry into the shooting deaths of 34 mine workers at Marikana in late 2012.\nThere will be no action in Parliament this week as the house is in recess until October 12.\nHowever, Parliament and the Union Buildings are expected to be the centre of attention on Wednesday when 300 civil society organisations participate in the Unite Against Corruption march. Organisers say 100,000 people will join the march and that it will be the largest of the democratic era.\nWhile the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) has championed the protest, there is doubt whether it will be allowed participate. Numsa had asked the National Economic Development and Labour Council for permission for the strike, but the body only met on Friday and told Numsa the strike certificate would only come into force in two weeks.\nThe protest, which has elicited support from civil society, faith-based and nongovernmental organisations, was planned for August but has had several delays. The latest was a postponement from September 23 to 30 to avoid conflict with Eid and Yom Kippur.\nOn Thursday the Council for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration resumes its mediation in gold sector wage talks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:08:02.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
