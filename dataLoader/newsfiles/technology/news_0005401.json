Credit: NASA Goddard MODIS Rapid Response Team \nTyphoon Kilo is the westernmost tropical cyclone of a four storms in the Pacific Ocean basin on September 4. From west to east they include Typhoon Kilo, Hurricane Ignacio, Hurricane Jimena and Tropical Storm Kevin. \nNASA's Aqua satellite passed over Kilo and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer or MODIS instrument took an image of the storm that showed Kilo maintained an eye and thick bands of thunderstorms wrapping into the low-level center. Kilo also appeared more symmetric in the MODIS image. \nAt 11 a.m. EDT (5 a.m. HST/1500 UTC) the center of Typhoon Kilo was located near latitude 24.0 north and longitude 166.0 west. That's 702 nautical miles east-northeast of Wake Island. \nThe Joint Typhoon Warning Center noted Kilo was moving toward the southwest near 1 knot (1 mph/2 kph). Maximum sustained winds are near 80 knots (92 mph/148 kph). \nJTWC expects Kilo to re-intensify over the next several days and peak at 120 knots by September 6 over the open waters of the Northwestern Pacific Ocean. The MODIS instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite made several passes over the Pacific Ocean on Sept. 3 and captured Typhoon Kilo (left) and Hurricanes Ignacio (center) and Jimena (right) across the Pacific Ocean.

NASA's Aqua satellite passed the storm when it was a developing low pressure area the day before. NASA sees Tropical Storm Kilo wrapped halfway around itself August 27, 2015 \nWhen NASA's Aqua satellite passed over Tropical Storm Kilo early on August 27, infrared imagery showed that bands of thunderstorms wrapped more than halfway around the system. NASA sees comma shaped Tropical Storm Kilo August 28, 2015 \nTropical Storm Kilo looks like a giant comma from space in imagery from NASA's Aqua satellite. Kilo continues to strengthen and was affecting Johnston Island as a tropical storm warning continued on August 28. NASA sees Hurricane Kilo headed for International Date Line August 31, 2015 \nNASA's Aqua and NOAA's GOES-West satellite saw Hurricane Kilo moving west in the Central Pacific Ocean as it neared the International Date Line. NASA spots Kilo, now a typhoon in the Northwestern Pacific September 1, 2015 \nHurricane Kilo may have formed in the Central Pacific Ocean, but on September 1 it crossed the International Date Line, so it was classified as a typhoon. NASA's Aqua satellite spotted a clear eye in the Category 3 typhoon ... September 2, 2015 \nNOAA's GOES-West satellite spotted the eye in a strong Typhoon Kilo moving through the Northwestern Pacific Ocean.
