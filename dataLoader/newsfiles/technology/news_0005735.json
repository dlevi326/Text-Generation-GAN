When Recycle Inc. had the opportunity to design a new container processing plant from the ground up, an automated conveyor system was high on the list of priorities. Company managers wanted to replace a largely manual handling operation with a conveyor-based approach that would be both more efficient and safer.\nBased on the new facility's first few months of operation, they were right. Employee productivity climbed 20% just in the first week of start-up. Throughput projections predict that the new plant will process four times as much material as the old plant did in the same amount of time and with the same number of employees. Jeffrey Bey, President of Recycle Inc., citeed several reasons behind his company's decision to switch to automated handling. \"Essentially what we are is a manufacturing operation,\" Bey explained. \"We use one process to wash and prepare containers that will be reused, and another process to shred or granulate containers that are to be destroyed.\n\"Our incoming 'raw materials' are the containers themselves. These containers — especially the larger ones — tend to be unwieldy, and some of them are fairly heavy. In the past, we handled the containers manually at a number of points during processing. Given our throughput requirements, we had the potential for accidents, and our approach wasn't very efficient. As demand for our services escalated, we knew that we needed to come up with a completely new way of handling containers — one that would take advantage of the benefits offered by automation.\"\nTo learn more, go to: http://bit.ly/1Mdw1No\nAbout Hytrol Conveyor Company, Inc.\nHytrol Conveyor Co., Inc.
