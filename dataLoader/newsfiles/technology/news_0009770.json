(NASDAQ:TSRA) and the leading provider of computational imaging solutions for mobile phones and digital still cameras, and Huawei, a leading global information and communications technology (ICT) solutions provider, today announced that Huawei will use FotoNation’s FotoSavvy™ beautification algorithms in the cameras of its latest premium smartphones, the P8 and Honor 7, as well as additional upcoming models. \n“The capability and quality of a smartphone's camera is increasingly becoming a key criteria for users evaluating these devices,\" said Gang He, President of Huawei mobile phone product line. \"We consistently strive to provide our users with the best photography experience. FotoNation is a leader in the digital imaging space with a deep understanding of our devices. Implementing FotoNation technology in the P8, Honor 7, and other handsets is a critical step toward a simpler and more intuitive mobile camera experience.\" \nFotoNation's beautification algorithms identify and interpret scene-influencing factors like light, color, gender and age when shooting still images or videos, and seamlessly adjusts settings to achieve the best possible picture. The increasing use of front-facing cameras to take 'selfies,' along with the shortcomings of existing technologies in the marketplace, drove the development of Perfect Selfie in the P8, as well as the beautification solutions in the Honor 7. \n\"Huawei is a world leader in the smartphone industry with a relentless drive to improve and innovate, and we are thrilled to extend our partnership with them as they set the course for the future of this market,\" said Sumat Mehra, SVP of marketing and business development at FotoNation. \"We have demonstrated our ability to customize our technology to fully take advantage of the Huawei handsets’ mobile imaging capabilities. This allows us to jointly deliver the best possible photography experience to the end user.\" \nFotoNation’s face-and-eye detection and tracking technologies, already found in 60% of tier-one smartphones, represent the foundation of our beautification suite of products. As part of the FotoSavvy™ product family, our beautification technology aims to change the way users experience mobile photography. \nSafe Harbor Statement \nThis document contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
