In 2007, the Oxford University Press removed dozens of words from its junior dictionary to make room for more modern terms. \nMany nature words were removed at the time, but the British media mainly focused on the fact that terms related to religion and British history such as “bishop” and “monarchy” had been omitted so that words such as “blog” and “broadband” could be added, Snopes.com noted. \nThe publisher said that the changes were made because “Britain is a modern, multicultural, multifaith society.” \nBut some raised objections that the changes to the 10,000-word Junior Dictionary could mean that children lose touch with Britain’s heritage. \nVineeta Gupta, the head of children’s dictionaries at Oxford University Press, responded to the controversy at the time, Snopes.com reported. \n“We are limited by how big the dictionary can be — little hands must be able to handle it — but we produce 17 children’s dictionaries with different selections and numbers of words. \n“When you look back at older versions of dictionaries, there were lots of examples of flowers for instance. That was because many children lived in semi-rural environments and saw the seasons.” \nThe last of such changes occurred in 2008. \nIn January 2015, a group of writers led by Margaret Atwood — a Canadian poet and novelist— wrote a letter to Oxford University Press urging editors to reinstate some of the words that had been removed, \nOUP released a statement explaining their word decisions: \n“In the last 40 years our range of children’s dictionaries has increased from two to 17, and as such the total number of words — including those about nature — has significantly increased across the range. ... They also reflect the language that children are encouraged to use in the classroom, as required by the national curriculum. This ensures they remain relevant and beneficial for children’s education.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T05:26:34.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
