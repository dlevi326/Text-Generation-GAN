Work by GNS Science in recent years has been publicly credited by the exploration industry with helping to lift and focus exploration activity in Taranaki Basin,\" Mr Sykes said. \nThe New Zealand government would use outputs from this research to inform decisions on new acreage for permitting to attract new exploration investment in New Zealand. \n\"Compelling exploration blocks backed by high quality scientific data will promote more competitive bidding, higher quality work programmes, and increase the chances of new discoveries.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:31:12.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
