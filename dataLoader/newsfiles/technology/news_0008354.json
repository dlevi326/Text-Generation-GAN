Boot capacity at 434 litres is beaten by only one rival.\nAt launch the Megane will be available with a six-strong engine range – diesel units of 89, 108 and 128bhp and petrol offerings of 99, 128 and 202bhp. A six-speed manual gearbox will be standard, an EDC dual-clutch auto offered on the 108 diesel and 128 petrol, while the 202bhp GT model gets a seven-speed EDC as standard.\nThe 108bhp dCi 110 diesel is expected to be the core Megane model, with combined cycle fuel economy of 85.6mpg and CO2 emissions of 86g/km.\nEarly in 2017 Renault intends to launch a hybrid version of the Megane, which with fuel economy stretching past 94mpg and emissions down to 76g/km is being pitched as the market leader for efficiency.\nRenault also states that the Megane is introducing technology not previously typical of the sector. This includes a retractable colour head-up display, a customisable TFT (Thin Film Transistor) instrument display with in higher-spec models the option of a portrait-style 8.7-inch screen, and Renault’s Multi-Sense technology – a system activated by a button on the centre console that allows the driver to customize the car’s functions, modifying the accelerator pedal and engine response, adjusting the speed of the gearshifts in the automatic transmission and even controlling the massage function of the seats and the cabin lighting.\nThe top-line GT model will also include 4Control, a four-wheel-steer system that offers precise handling on challenging twisty roads and also improves manoeuvrability at slower speeds or when parking.\nPhoto: Newspress\n ", "external_links": ["http://uno3s41zr1g29mjw2f9dkf1b.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1509_Renault_Megane_01.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-16T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:23:26.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
