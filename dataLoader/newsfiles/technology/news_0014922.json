This offer claims to be an \"invite-only feature\" that can only be activated by clicking the link provided. Further encouraging users to click, the scam offer claims to expire in a short period of time. Clicking through leads the victim to a malicious website. . \nThe scammers' ultimate goal is to encourage users to share the link on their Facebook page, putting it in front of all of their friends. Once spread on Facebook, the scam asks you to fill out intrusive surveys in an attempt to gather personal information and account credentials. Although not verified in this case, such scams often end by installing malicious software onto a victim's computer, causing further damage. \nZuckerberg said at a recent Q&A session that Facebook is \"very close\" to launching a dislike button, following pressure from users demanding a way of showing empathy without 'Liking' a post containing bad news, such as the passing of a relative. \"We are working on it, and are very close to shipping a test of it,\" the co-founder and CEO said.

If you're a Facebook crack-addict then try to resist the urge of falling for the latest scam, and wait for Facebook to properly roll-out new features as and when they choose.\" \nUltimately, clicking on these links could lead to the theft of your personal information, spam attacks on your friends and family, and damage to your computer.
