Ask her for the time, and use the clock app to type in a random word in the \"Choose the City\" field and share it. \nOnce you can share through the Message app, you can add a photo from the device which gives you access to the entire photo library on the iOS device. You can browse and view photos individually. \nYou can also select \"Create New Contact\" to access the device's contact list. \nThis hack comes days after French security firm Zerodium announced a total of $3m bounty rewards for iOS exploits and jailbreaks until October 31 - but the condition is the attacker must be able to remotely compromise a non-jailbroken iOS device. \nIn the case of this hack, it only works if someone has physical access to your iPhone or iOS device so it doesn't qualify, but since the hack is relatively easy for novices to pick up, it's a huge risk to your personal data. \nThis is the second iOS 9 hack discovered since the software launched - the first allows access via AirDrop . How to Prevent iOS 9 Hack \nUntil Apple fixes this issue, iOS 9 users can protect themselves by disabling Siri when the device is locked from Settings > Touch ID & Passcode. \nOnce disabled, you’ll only be able to use Siri after you have unlocked your iOS device using the passcode or your fingerprint. \nTurn off access to Siri when your device is locked", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T12:09:13.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
