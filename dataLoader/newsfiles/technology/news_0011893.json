XSCALE, which is a pattern language for third-generation Agile, or Agile 3G, is designed to give a businesses rapid growth culture.\n“This is about how do we reach out to small and medium companies and provide them with the support that they need to get past hurdles,’’ he told The Australian.\nMr Merel, who is a coach and trainer, has been involved in Agile transformations for divisions of CBA, IAG, Ray White, Websense and Reuters, as well as SMEs. He said Agile 3G had grown up around Spotify and Zappos in the northern hemisphere but there were many initiatives in Australia.\n“Spotify has done a very good job of communicating how they are using Agile in their engineering culture,’’ said Mr Merel, who recently spoke at an Agile industry seminar. “This is a culture that started as a very small team and as it grew they were determined not to surround the small teams with layers of bureaucracy so they have got a very flat structure and the real point about this is the autonomous decision-making in the teams themselves.’’\nMr Merel said Agile 3G was used for product management, portfolio management, change management and traditional service operations.\n“It is about how do we get business agility rather than how do we get more productivity out of IT.’’\nMr Merel added that many SMEs had got to a point where they faced a growth challenge and wanted the benefits of Agile 3G, such as transparency, rate of ROI, adaptability and risk reduction.\n“The intent is that we can provide people both in terms of day-to-day simple practices with what they need to be able to get that growth culture.’’\nHR advisory services Davidson Technology’s chief executive Damien Ross said there had been increased demand for Agile methodologies such as Lean, XP, Scrum, Kanban and Kaizen Agile in medium to large organisations.\n“More recently, we have been working with enterprise organisations who are implementing SAFE: Scaled Agile Frameworks, or otherwise known as the Spotify model,’’ he said.\n“From our experience across Australia and New Zealand, start-ups are more suited to operate in Lean/Agile frameworks to enable iterative delivery, rather than following a more mature and complex delivery methodology with typically longer delivery times.’’\nThe company has started to notice start-ups following select Agile processes, such as story boards and daily stand-ups.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T06:34:56.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
