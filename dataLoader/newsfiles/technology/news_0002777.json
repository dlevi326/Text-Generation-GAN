This is the fourth year for the event, and more than 1,600 American manufacturers will open their doors to students. In honor of Manufacturing Day, SkillsUSA recognizes the role its manufacturing partners play in helping SkillsUSA meet its mission to empower its student members to become world-class workers, leaders and responsible American citizens. The U.S. manufacturing sector is the world’s eighth-largest economy and provides more than 12 million jobs, almost all of which require increasing levels of technical expertise and ability to apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\nSkillsUSA Executive Director Tim Lawrence said, “Our manufacturing base must be strong in order to keep our national economy strong. Today, SkillsUSA continues to work with our key partners to bolster awareness of the manufacturing industry as an excellent career choice. We want to help inspire students and support manufacturing training programs, foster the creation of new jobs and broaden work opportunities for more Americans.”\nAmong the 300,000 career and technical high school and college/postsecondary SkillsUSA members nationwide, thousands are studying careers in the trades and specifically for manufacturing careers. Many more are studying curricula related to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), which often lead to careers in the manufacturing sector.\nSkillsUSA chapters will participate in Manufacturing Day in a few different ways. Some schools will hold an Open House to showcase their manufacturing-related training programs to parents and the community. Other chapters will visit one of the 1,205 Manufacturing Day events planned nationwide. These range from career fairs to manufacturing plant tours. There are also virtual field trips for students to attend.
