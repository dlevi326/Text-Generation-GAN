Would would have thought a 90s rom com would have predicted the future? Source: News Limited \nIT appears Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were predicting the future of dating with the 1998 cinematic masterpiece You’ve Got Mail. \nAccording to a study from Indiana University, sending an email is more romantic than leaving a voicemail when communicating with a potential lover. \nCo-author Alan R Dennis said the finding should not come as a shock given the tech savvy attitude held by millennials. \n“Email’s been in the popular consciousness since the 1990s and if you look at the new generation of millennials … they’ve grown up with email and text messaging, so it may not be as unnatural a medium as we at first thought,” he told Phys.org . \nFor the purpose of the research, a group of college-aged people were randomly selected to send an email or leave a voicemail, romantic in nature. \nWhile completing the task, subjects’ had their psychophysiological measures analysed with skin sensors recording muscle movements associated with positive and negative emotion. \n“When writing romantic emails, senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages, perhaps to compensate for the medium’s inability to convey vocal tone,” researchers wrote in the paper. \n“Email enables senders to modify the content as messages are composed to ensure they are crafted to the needs of the situation. Voicemail lacks this feature. \n“A sender records a voicemail in a single take and it can be sent or discarded and re-recorded, but not edited. Thus senders engage with email messages longer and may think about the task more deeply than when leaving voicemails.” \nDespite email appearing to be the better choice to convey feelings, Mr Dennis said there was still a place for face-to-face communication and phone calls. \n“If something isn’t really clear and you want to make sure that everyone has the same understanding of what something means, that’s best done in phone calls, face-to-face meetings or video conferencing,” he said. \n“You have different cues, and it’s also synchronous discussion, as opposed to email, where time goes by before the receiver gets to it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T12:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:55:52.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
