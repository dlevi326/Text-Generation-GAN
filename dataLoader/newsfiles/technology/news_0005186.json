The user enters his login credentials on the page, and it transmits him to the perpetrator. Such techniques are the most common method used by foreign governments, most notably China and Russia, to hack U.S. systems.\nRussian hackers accessed email servers held by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in early August, while Chinese hackers reportedly accessed the Office of Personnel Management this year. Provided the Chinese government was behind the hack on the OPM, they likely already have information on nearly all Homeland Security employees. However, being able to access ICE or Secret Service systems would give them an even greater intelligence advantage.\nAdditionally, the report found that ICE was failing to conform to various federal cybersecurity guidelines. That included a failure to rename administrative accounts, which makes systems accessible to anyone who could hack a password. It also includes allowing sensitive system data to be saved on employees' workstations, making it available to anyone with physical access to the agency's computers.\nThe IG also found the agencies guilty of lesser transgressions, such as failing to provide \"annual, specialized security training\" for individuals with \"significant security responsibilities.\"\nAdditionally, investigators said, interdepartmental communication was not taking place effectively, which reduced efficiency across agencies. \"Cyber personnel do not have a clear understanding of each other's responsibilities and operational and investigative capabilities,\" the report stated.\nThe IG made a number of recommendations, including department-wide training programs and security enhancements that would eliminate basic system vulnerabilities. Homeland Security responded that it agreed with the inspector general's assessment, and said it would implement a plan to complete the reforms by March 2016.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T02:22:31.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
