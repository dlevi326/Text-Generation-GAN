But will it be effective? And what are the risks for privacy and human rights? \nFalse positives \nCurrent research shows that the latest facial technology is still plagued with error rates and inaccuracies. \nImages collected through CCTV or social media platforms are hampered by poor lighting or indirect angles of faces, so it is often difficult to find an accurate match. For example, even with the volume of footage of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects, facial recognition wasn’t enough to identify the assailants. \nIt is also unclear how much the use of facial recognition is actually helping police make arrests. \nThere is also the question of accuracy. The FBI reportedly has a 20 percent error rate for its next generation identification program. \nIn Australia there is no clear indication what authorities are willing to accept as an error rate when using facial recognition technology. \nLike the data retention amendments, regulation of the collection and sharing of biometric identifiers in Australia is subject to executive ministerial discretion. Any other regulation of the capability is left to weak privacy legislation (which many of the agencies involved in the capability are exempt from) in the absence of a formal bill of rights. \nFrom overseas wars to domestic policing \nFacial recognition has been a part of military and intelligence operations in overseas conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. \nNow the technology will find its way into routine policing environments in Australia, aided by mobile hand-held devices such as tablets, smartphones and even wearable cameras. \nIn a policing context, this raises new questions that push the legal envelope on the collection of biometric identifiers without meaningful consent when using mobile devices in the field. \nThe use of facial recognition identification in policing introduces the possibility that law enforcement might want to stop an individual simply to check, and potentially collect, their facial recognition print. They could also use the technology to identify people at a political protest or major sporting or music event. \nJennifer Lynch, a senior staff attorney with the civil liberties advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation , notes that the use of facial recognition technologies in routine policing “ pushes the line of what’s legal ”. \nSecurity risks \nThe Australian government is seeking to quell any concerns about privacy over the mass biometric archive by insisting that the capability will not be a centralised database. \nBut an integrated network of shared records is actually even more vulnerable to penetration simply because the prospective attack surface is larger. \nThe only way to actually ensure privacy is to limit initial collection and restrict the use of any biometric records. If they are to be used at all, it should be for only very specific purposes. \nGiven that there is no clear evidence on the expected effectiveness of the capability, which has already spread into a whole-of-government initiative, critical questions remain about the risks posed by Australia’s newest mass surveillance weapon. \nAdam Molnar is a lecturer in Criminology at Deakin University .
