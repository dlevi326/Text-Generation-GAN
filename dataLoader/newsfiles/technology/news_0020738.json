If that’s you, then fear not. \nNew research published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology suggests that it is never too late to start exercising. \nA walk can do wonders for you Photo: Alamy \nResearchers claim that those who don’t started exercising until they reach their 60s will still see a decided improvement in their health. \nThe good news is that at whatever age you start to exercise, it will still make a difference. \nThe study showed that older people benefit more from recent activity than prolonged exercise over time, stemming from when they were younger. \nWalking or cycling for just 20 minutes a day can significantly reduce a 60 year old man’s risk of heart failure by a fifth, they also found. Anything you do from now on will have a positive effect \nThe findings have emerged from a study of 33,000 Swedish men from 1998 to 2012. The men, who had an average age of 60, were asked to recall how active they were aged 30, and their current activity rates. \nThe study showed that recent active behaviour had a bigger impact on heart failure risk than activity earlier in life. \nThose men who had exercised regularly as younger men, but who found themselves inactive now, were no less likely to ensure heart failure than anyone else. \nIn contrast, the survey found that men who had been active in young men, but taken up exercising later in life, fared better. \nKeeping active is important for your health Photo: Alamy \nWalking or cycling for 20 minutes a day was associated with the biggest reduction in the risk of heart failure, which fell by 21 per cent. \nThe project also found that those men with the least active schedules were at a 47 per cent higher risk of heart failure than the average 60 year old. \nBut even those who have been devoted to keeping fit and healthy are at risk of developing heart problems. Study leader Andrea Bellavia said: “We found that recent activity may be more important for heart failure protection that past activity levels.” \nThese comments suggest that the benefits of exercise are closely related to the here and now, rather than resting on your laurels about past activity. \nThe message is: stay active, and don’t worry if you’ve not got a good track record of it. Anything you do from now on will have a positive effect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T10:13:09.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
