Unikrn hosts an online community for people to watch and bet on games played by teams of professional video gamers (though betting itself isn’t offered in the U.S., where sports gambling remains illegal in most places).\nAlso on Tuesday, Unikrn announced a new feature designed to encourage people to place bets on the platform, discuss Unikrn on social media, and answer trivia questions. Participants in the feature, dubbed Unikrn Global Arena, are eligible to win raffled prizes from makers of PC hardware makers and other companies.\nMatt Day: 206-464-2420 or mday@seattletimes.com .
