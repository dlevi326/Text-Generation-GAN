Wireless 20/20 has leveraged their in-depth knowledge garnered from over 100 engagements with 3G/4G operators worldwide, to create its newest version of the award-winning WiROI™ Venue Tool. The new WiROI™ Neutral Host Network Venue Business Case Analysis Tool can be used to analyze neutral host networks for various venue environments, such as college campuses, enterprise buildings, hospitals, airports, shopping malls, train stations, subways, convention centers, stadiums, race tracks, and special event venues where there is a high density of broadband users. The model can be used to analyze network technology options like Wi-Fi, DAS, and LTE small cells, and to simulate various methods for monetizing the investment in venue networks. The result is a complete ROI analysis for Neutral Host Providers, venue owners and MNOs. Haig Sarkissian, Principal Consultant, Wireless 20/20 will be demonstrating the new WiROI™ Neutral Host Network Venue Tool during the conference.\nThe WiROI™ Neutral Host Network Venue Tool simulates the impact of tens of thousands of users in a venue using smartphones and enables Neutral Host Providers to simulate performance enhancements, revenue potential and cost effectiveness of an active DAS, Small Cell and Wi-Fi network over a 10-year period. The new WiROI™ Venue Tool can be used to model the SLAs and cost savings under various business scenarios, allowing MNOs to analyze how they can best utilize neutral host networks.\nMany high density environments require improvements in coverage and capacity for MNOs during high occupancy times. Passive DAS systems, deployed by individual carriers, have been overwhelmed by the tremendous growth in data traffic driven by smartphones, mobile laptops and tablets. Neutral host systems supporting multi-carrier wireless networks are becoming increasingly popular for multi-tenant building and venue network deployments. The new WiROI™ Venue tool allows neutral host providers to pinpoint the business models that can provide positive ROI for them, while offering improved economics and speed of deployment for MNOs.\nMNOs are now actively examining next generation active DAS and Small Cell networks deployed by Neutral Host Providers among their options to address the data capacity challenge. These solutions offer neutral host mobile capacity for cellular carriers across indoor and outdoor areas of the venues. Most of the neutral host systems can be more easily scaled to address continuing traffic growth and support advanced Wi-Fi services. However, the notion that new, multimillion-dollar DAS systems will be deployed in hopes that everyone will show up and participate is just not economical or viable.\nRandall Schwartz, Principal Consultant, Wireless 20/20, said, “The deployment of neutral host networks in venues is one of the most critical developments in the broadband wireless industry today. But many venues cannot accommodate separate and disjointed deployments by each MNO. Our analysis shows that the best and most economical solution is for a neutral host service provider to deploy a common and shared infrastructure that can support all MNOs.”\nMore information about the WiROI™ Neutral Host Network Venue Tool can be found at http://www.wireless2020.com/WiROINeutralHost/ .

He will also moderate the panel on Neutral Host DAS, Wi-Fi Offload and Small Cells as a Service, featuring executives from ExteNet Systems, Boingo Wireless, Zayo and Zinwave. The session will examine the business case for carrier-grade, neutral-host DAS, Small Cell and Wi-Fi networks that support multiple carriers in high-traffic areas.\nFor more information on Tower & Small Cell Summit and to receive a 20% discount off the registration fee, use Discount Code WIRELESS20.
