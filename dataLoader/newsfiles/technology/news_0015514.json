Reports Fourth Quarter And Year End Financial Results September 24, 2015 -- \nNEW YORK , Sept. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --Alliance Media Holdings Inc. (Pink Sheets:ADTR), a distributor, developer and publisher of interactive video games and gaming products, announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June30, 2015. \nNet sales for the three months ended June 30, 2015 decreased less than 1% to $12.7 million from $12 .8million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 . Net income for the three months ended June30,2015 decreased to $61,000 compared to $251,000 for the three months ended June30,2014. Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2015 includes a non-cash write off of approximating $66,000 in deferred tax assets related to the expiration of unexercised stock options granted to employees in 2005. \nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 , net sales decreased 11% to $54.1 million from $60 .9million for the year ended June 30, 2014 . Net income was approximately $326,000 for the year ended June 30, 2015 compared to $1.2 million for comparable 2014 period. \nJay Gelman , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"During the fourth quarter we continued to have fewer sources of value product than in the corresponding 2014 period. As I mentioned previously, the decline in availability reflects residual turmoil from last year's new platform introductions of Sony's Playstation4, Microsoft's Xbox One and Nintendo's Wii U, vendors who are out of business, vendors' licensing lapses, and a reduction in distress closeout opportunities. I anticipate that vendors who are concentrating on new platform products will in due course accelerate their value product offerings. \n\"Our fiscal 2015 results were also affected by approximately $550,000 in costs to develop our BlazeBlue: Battle Cards title. The introduction of the title brought positive reviews but very limited economic activity. We have substantially reduced our internal development staff and expect to outsource more of our future development activity. \n\"We are the exclusive publishers of Gianna Sisters: Twisted Dreams - Director's Cut and Brunswick Pro Bowling for North America and South America , and in the next several months expect to introduce Gianna Sisters for the Wii U and Brunswick Pro Bowling for the PS4, Xbox One and Wii U. Gianna Sisters was developed by Black Forest Games. Brunswick Pro Bowling was developed by Farsight Studios.\" \nAbout Alliance \nAlliance Media Holdings Inc., formerly Alliance Distributors Holding Inc., ( www.alliancemediaholdings.com ) is a vertically integrated video game company.
