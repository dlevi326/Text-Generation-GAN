When you call us within a day you should be able to get your problem solved,” he stated. \nMr. Owusu added that end users are not also left out as they were schooled on how to change the motor to manual incase of power failure but has assured of a 24hour power backup. \nHe said his outfit offers professional services on installation of automatic gates including services such as electric fencing, CCTV installation, access control, video intercoms and many more. \nThe unique of the product, according to him, it’s a product from South Africa which has been tried and tested in Ghana over a decade. \nHe noted that over 1000 pieces of the motors have been supplied to houses and companies which can be integrated to the electric fence. \nAccording to him, the prices are unbeatable with different sizes of motors depending on the size of the gate. \nThe challenge, he said, is the influx of fake and inferior products from countries which often creates a bad impression for the entire dealers. \nHe advices customers to conduct a background check about a particular company before they seek for their services and the supplying of security systems since they can be operating as spies on them.
