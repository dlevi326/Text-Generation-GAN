The materials could find a variety of uses in detecting chemical and biological compounds, or mechanical and thermal conditions. The material, a metallic polymer gel made using rare-earth elements, is described in a paper in the Journal of the American Chemical Society by assistant professor of materials science and engineering Niels Holten-Andersen, postdoc Pangkuan Chen, and graduate students Qiaochu Li and Scott Grindy ( \"White-Light-Emitting Lanthanide Metallogels with Tunable Luminescence and Reversible Stimuli-Responsive Properties\" ). Luminescent materials produced by the MIT team are shown under ultraviolet light, emitting different colors of light that can be modified by their environmental conditions. (Photo: Tara Fadenrecht) The material, a light-emitting lanthanide metallogel, can be chemically tuned to emit light in response to chemical, mechanical, or thermal stimuli  potentially providing a visible output to indicate the presence of a particular substance or condition. The new material is an example of work with biologically inspired materials, Holten-Andersen explains. My niche is biomimetics  using natures tricks to design bio-inspired polymers, he says. There are an amazing variety of really funky organisms in the oceans, he says, adding: Weve barely scratched the surface of trying to understand how theyre put together, from a chemical and mechanical standpoint. Studying such natural materials, evolved over millions of years to adapt to challenging environmental conditions, allows us as engineers to derive design principles that can be applied to other kinds of materials, he adds. The material can be made in a gel, a thin film, or a coating that could be applied to structures, potentia Source: If you liked this article, please give it a quick review on reddit or StumbleUpon Nanowerk Newsletter Email Digests", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T09:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T13:04:57.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
