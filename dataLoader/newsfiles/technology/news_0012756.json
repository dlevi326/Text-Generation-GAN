He watched a human-size mascot Mario blow out candles on a birthday cake.\n“I was touched when I sang a birthday song with all of you,” Miyamoto said. “Happy birthday, Mario!” Video game music composer Koji Kondo played music used for newly released Mario software on a keyboard. Other musicians, including performers on a violin and an accordion, separately performed well-known Mario music.\nNintendo's game creator Shigeru Miyamoto poses with his character in Tokyo.

I’ve been playing the series since I was four or five,” said the 26-year-old, sporting a handmade Mario red cap and blue overall.\nSince Mario first hit the screens under his own name on September 13, 1985, Nintendo has sold more than 310 million units featuring the plucky plumber’s adventures fighting off Goombas and Koopa Troopas as he races to save Princess Peach.\nThe character had earlier made an appearance in the Nintendo arcade game “Donkey Kong”, but under the name Jumpman.\nBirthday celebration ...

This allows players to create their own worlds for Mario, or use those created by other players and shared through the internet.\nSuper Mario mad ... 26-year-old Japanese fan Yusuke Suzuki poses ahead of the anniversary celebrations in Tokyo. Picture: Toshifumi Kitamua/AFP Source: AFP\nNintendo is also eyeing the booming smartphone games market — a long-awaited departure from its consoles-only policy.\nThe Kyoto-based company said in March it would create games based on its host of popular characters, but did not release any details about which characters would be made available for smartphones or tablets.\nThe company hopes to offset weakening demand for its 3DS portable game system by tapping into the smartphone games market.\nOriginally published as Nintendo’s Super Mario turns 30 Increase Text Size Decrease Text Size Print Email Share Add to Digg Add to del.icio.us Add to Facebook Add to Kwoff Add to Myspace Add to Newsvine What are these?
