The latest models, following last year’s hugely popular design overhaul that added bigger screens, may not match the success of previous releases, according to analysts.\nDemand for the new iPhones appears to be lower than last year, “possibly meaningfully so,” said Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities who studied Google search data, device shipment times and third-party surveys. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. and RBC Capital Markets also raised concerns about iPhone growth. Since 2013, iPhone sales have increased an average of about 35 percent each quarter. In October to December alone last year, Apple sold 74.6 million iPhones. That’s about 34,000 iPhone purchases per hour.\nExpectations are tempered partially because the gadget is at the point in its two-year design cycle that includes less dramatic changes. In the first year, Apple generally overhauls the device’s hardware, including its look and feel. For the following year’s model, designated with an “s” tacked on to the number, the Cupertino, California-based company makes more subtle improvements.\nThe iPhone 6s and 6s Plus look like last year’s versions but include new features such as 3D Touch, which provides a shortcut for checking mail, taking pictures and other functions when the user presses down on the screen. Apple also added an improved camera and a zippier processor.\nWhether Apple can match last year’s demand will be determined when the new handsets start hitting stores in New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, France, Germany, the U.K., Canada, the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The handsets will be on sale in more than 130 countries by year-end, according to Apple.\nA Heavyweight A smooth release is critical for Apple, which generates more than 60 percent of its revenue from the phone. Cook is attempting to expand other businesses, but the portion of sales coming from the iPhone continues to grow. The Apple Watch hasn’t become a mainstream hit since it was released earlier this year and iPad sales are in decline.\nThe iPhone’s weight in Apple’s results has put further investor focus on the device’s performance. The stock through Wednesday was down 14 percent from its high in February, in part because of concerns that the device can’t continue its run of unprecedented growth.\nApple last week predicted it would top last year’s opening-weekend sales record of 10 million units, although that figure is boosted by availability this year in China, which wasn’t part of the initial rollout last year. A better gauge for how the device is selling will come in January, when the company reports sales for the holiday quarter.\nPricing options in the U.S. vary more than for earlier releases. The two new iPhones start at $199 and $299 with a two-year carrier contract. Apple also introduced a program for paying in installments of at least $37 a month, similar to plans offered by wireless companies including AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T00:23:45.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
