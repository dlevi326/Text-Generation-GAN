Twitter \nWe all knew it was coming and we all know pretty much all there is to know about these two devices thanks to a number of leaks, hands-on, spec sheets and more being released ahead of this evening’s event, so here it is, the LG-made Nexus 5X and the Huawei-made Nexus 6P this year’s Nexus devices offering two distinctly unique choices for consumers. \nSo lets begin with the LG-made, Nexus 5X. As you’d expect, the Nexus 5X is a 5.2-inch device once again offering a top bollocks phone for a fraction of the cost of other similar smartphones on the market. \nThis device is built around Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 808 processor, a 5.2-inch 1080p display, with Gorilla Glass 3, and a new 12-megapixel camera with 1.55-micron pixels and 4K video. It also comes with a USB-C charging connector which I’m sure many are pretty pleased about. \nIn addition to those specs, the device will also be the first Nexus smartphone with a finger print sensor, which, as you may have guessed with LG, is slapped on the back of the device underneath the aforementioned camera. Google have called this the Nexus Imprint and takes only 600ms to recognise your fingerprint. Google also claims that it “gets better over time” as it learns your fingerprint each time you scan it. \nOh and as you’d probably expect too, the Nexus 5X will also run Android Marshmallow out of the box. \nIn terms of pricing and availability, the Nexus 5X will be launching in the later part of October with pre-orders now open in the Google Play Store in the United States, Canada, UK, Ireland, Korea, and Japan. It’ll be priced at the fairly affordable $379 in the US. \n\nOnto the Google Nexus 6P, this Huawei-made device will likely give Google more of a presence in Asian markets, but will also be launching in the west giving Huawei more exposure over here too. \nThis device offers a 5.7-inch WQHD AMOLED display and a very unique design. Huawei have always been the pioneers of incredibly thin devices and this is no different measuring at only 7.3mm thick. Google say it’s supposed to be about the same size overall as the iPhone 6 Plus. \nGoogle claim that the Nexus 6P is their most premium phone yet, and that’s true for a number of reasons. It’s the first Nexus device to have an all-metal body, it includes front-facing speakers, and like the Nexus 5X it also has the Nexus Imprint on the back. Also on the back is a raised camera, but not like the iPhone 6, the Nexus 6P has an entire ledge dedicated to the camera, that’s because it’s holding a 12.3-megapixel Sony sensor that features larger pixels than what you’d find in the standard smartphone. \nThis allows the phone to take better low-light pictures, Google boasts, with the whole camera optimised for indoor photography. It’ll also offer slow-mo video, 4K video, and burst mode for photos. There’s also an 8-megapixel camera on the front. \nIt’ll also come with a Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB RAM, a 3450mAh battery, and USB Type-C just like the Nexus 5X. It’ll also come with Android Marshmallow out of the box. \nThe Nexus 6P is set to also launch in the later-part of October with pre-orders opening on the Google Play Store starting at $499.
