Published in late 2014, BlueChatBox enables users to engage in text or video chats with up to four friends, or with any other member(s) of the BlueChatBox community who is in a chatty mood whether theyre located nearby or on the other side of the world. And since the app is available at no cost, users who take the text chat route dont have to worry about getting dinged to death by dreaded SMS fees. In addition, BlueChatBox integrates with Google Translates API so that users can communicate across language barriers and make new friends even if they dont speak the same language. And as noted above, this cross-border communication takes place without incurring any costs. Users can also check out public chats there are usually dozens or hundreds running 24/7 to engage in interesting conversation, fun exchanges, or passionate (but civilized) debate. Users can also use the handy Globe View to find group chats in specific locations around the world, or see which ones are generating the most approval via a public chat rating system. Groups can involve a handful of users, to well over 50. Also of note is the apps unique distinction between Friends and Temporary Friends. When chatting with the latter, users can avoid revealing certain private data, such as their phone number. The app will also automatically unfriend them from a Temporary Friend if theres a significant lapse of time without active messages. Other key features including new enhancements in the latest version include: > Full guest access and the option to post anonymously > Optional location sharing > A simple and streamlined interface > An array of chat backgrounds, including customizable options > Plenty of emoticons to decorate any message and make it more personal and interesting > Several customizable status icons that let users express their mood > Passcode locking to prevent unauthorized access > Male and female avatars for public chats > World feeds that let users share their favorite pictures across the globe BlueChatBox is unlike any other messaging app, and since releasing it weve had overwhelmingly positive feedback from both users and independent reviewers, commented Tony Jiang, the apps inventor and chief developer. And now in the latest version, weve made it even more fun and exciting to connect with old friends, and make new ones and all without paying a cent!
