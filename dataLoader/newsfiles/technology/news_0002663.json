GTEC will bring this debate to its main stage, engaging recognized privacy authorities Ramona Pringle , Assistant Professor, Ryerson University , Creative Director, Transmedia Zone, and contributor to CBC; and Jesse Hirsh , Broadcaster, Researcher, Public Speaker and Internet Strategist. \nThe debate will run the public policy gamut on this controversial issue. Ms. Pringle will argue the need for greater regulation and control in privacy legislation.  Mr. Hirsh will present the merits of transparency and openness.  The session will be moderated by the Honourable Peter Milliken, Former Speaker of the House of Commons and Special Advisor to Cunningham Swan Law Firm.  GTEC delegates will have the opportunity to engage in the dialogue and contribute questions from the floor.\n\"As we usher in a technological revolution defined by the Internet of Things, social media, big data and analytics, it is critical to explore the implications through a privacy lens,\" said Michele Lajeunesse , Executive Director of GTEC.  \"Who has control over information that is gathered about our daily lives; how is it used; and what is the impact? This debate will bring privacy issues to the top of the public sector agenda, and equip GTEC conference delegates with diverse perspective and actionable recommendations.\"\n\"Privacy is a complex issue that impacts all Canadians, and one that warrants attention,\" said Ramona Pringle . \"Privacy is not about secrecy and hiding, but dignity and freedom.  The government must take concrete steps to protect these fundamental rights.  We do not invite the public to sift through our drawers, purses and wallets. We must apply the same principles to privacy legislation and strengthen regulation to equip and empower citizens with greater control in all facets of life.\" \n\"One of the most important and often overlooked aspects of privacy is the potential for this issue to catalyze positive cultural change,\" said Jesse Hirsh .  \"In our increasingly interconnected and technology-driven world, privacy is just not always possible. We can leverage transparency and openness to facilitate greater compassion, tolerance and acceptance in our society. What does Canada's future hold if our best leaders are cast aside because of a post on social media? We must seize this opportunity for change.\"  \nThe Oxford-style Debate , \"If You Have Nothing to Hide, Then You Have Nothing to Fear\" will take place on the GTEC 2015 Main Stage, on October 20 at 3:45pm at the Shaw Centre. \nFor more information, visit : gtec.ca .\nRegister for GTEC: gtec.ca/ottawa/registration-and-pricing  \nApply for a GTEC media pass: gtec.ca/ottawa/press-centre-overview \nAbout GTEC\nGTEC is Canada's internationally recognized forum for enabling and celebrating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) leadership, innovation and impact in Canada's public sector.
