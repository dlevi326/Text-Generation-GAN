The government has dismissed the gatherings as \"illegal\".\nJosephine Mayanja-Nkangi, a spokesperson for Mbabazi, said police fired teargas shortly after his supporters gathered at a sports ground in Soroti, a town about 300k from capital Kampala.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T03:45:53.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
