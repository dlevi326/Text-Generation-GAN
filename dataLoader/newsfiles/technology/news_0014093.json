In May a Munich court ruled in favour of the start-up in a case brought by ProSiebenSat.1 and RTL Group.\nThat was only weeks after the publisher of German newspapers Handelsblatt and Die Zeit lost its case in a Hamburg court.\nAdblock Plus acts like a firewall between a web browser and advertising servers.\nThe software is mostly installed by end users on their desktop computer or laptop and blocks ads on websites including Facebook as well as video ads on Youtube.\nApple Inc is for the first time letting users install the software on iPhones.\nBut advertisers can avoid being blocked by Eyeo by asking to be added to a so-called \"white list\" in return for a fee. Requests are vetted by a panel of tens of thousands of Eyeo users before being granted.\nAxel Springer said it would appeal against the ruling.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Axel Springer announced it would buy news website Business Insider for $343 million, which depends heavily on online advertising.
