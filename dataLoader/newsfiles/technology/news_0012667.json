This major update to medical coding will impact everyone in the medical office. Following are the details to be aware of and prepared for on October 1, 2015.\nManagers\nPolicies and Procedures. Not unexpected, there will be new policies and procedures to follow with regard to codes pertaining to diagnoses, disease management, labs, tracking, or PQRI.\nTraining. Everyone in your office – staff, management, and physicians alike – must be formally trained on the changes.\nSoftware. ICD-10 compliant software must be ordered and installed on every computer in the office.\nBilling Personnel\nTraining. Everyone must be trained on the updated software. The number of codes will be increasing from 17,000 to 140,000!\nMapping and Adding Codes. Since all of the codes are changing, the new codes will have to be pointed or mapped to the old codes. Then the additional 123,000 new codes will have to be added to the system.\nPhysicians\nTraining. Physicians will also have to be trained on the code changes.\nDocumentation. The requirements now expect physicians to tell billers many more details than they have in the past. Examples include: laterality, what stage of healing is the patient in, how many weeks into the pregnancy, episodes of care, etc.\nProcedures. The huge expansion in codes is probably going to require medical offices to upgrade to electronic superbills if they haven't already done so.\nForms\nPhysician bills may not be the only changes to deal with. Health plans and vendors are likely to change their forms as well.\nSince 2000 AZ Comp Technologies ( Medisoft dealer Arizona ) has specialized in sales, installation, and training on software for medical offices.\nContact\nIf you would like more information about this topic, please contact:\nPR Contact: Lance Foster\nPhone: 480-730-3055\nEmail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
