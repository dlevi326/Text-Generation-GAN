Samahope’s crowdfunding platform allows anyone, anywhere to directly fund the work of doctors providing life-saving medical treatments for women and children in need. \n“We’re delighted to renew our grant to Samahope. Our initial grant has made a difference to so many lives, people who may have not been able to receive a lifesaving operation or treatment without Samahope’s support,” said David Figliuzzi, executive director of the Cigna Foundation. “We look forward to our continued partnership with Samahope.” \nIn 2014, the Cigna Foundation World of Difference grant to Samahope made it possible for Samahope to support the work of 15 doctors globally, along with providing training programs and making investments in technology. Samahope funded treatments for 1,065 women and children, streamlined its doctor reporting process, and developed a communications program with partners and supporters. In India, Samahope is on target to increase its medical partners after completing research and due diligence on more than 40 potential partners. \nAdditionally, when the devastating earthquake hit Nepal in early 2015, the Cigna Foundation worked with Samahope to ensure that a special disaster relief grant was directed to them to ensure that women in Nepal could regain access to a safe place for childbirth. \nThe Cigna Foundation grant renewal will make the next phase of Samahope’s work possible, enabling the organization to bring on new medical partners in India with expertise in maternal health, pediatric congenital heart, and eye surgeries, and to build an India-targeted set of advisors, including experts and thought leaders in public health and corporate and individual philanthropy. Samahope also plans to pilot a “center of excellence” program to create a laboratory for assessing the impact of their work. Additionally, Samahope will identify target geographies and determine an appropriate strategic path for expansion. \nAbout the Cigna Foundation \nThe Cigna Foundation, founded in 1962, is a private foundation funded by contributions from Cigna Corporation (NYSE: CI) and its subsidiaries.
