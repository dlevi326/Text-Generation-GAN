It also did not miss out on the opportunity to remind Modi that the national flag was above the prime minister when it came to showing respect.\nGovernment spokesman Frank Noronha denied that Modi had signed the national flag and said it had not been confiscated, as reported.\n“The story about the prime minister disrespecting the Tricolour is false and mischievous. The prime minister did not autograph the tricolour,” Noronha, Principal Director General, Press Information Bureau, said.\nHe said the piece of cloth was a work of handicraft prepared by physically-challenged daughter of the chef and the prime minister had autographed it on compassionate basis after Khanna and his family made a request.\n“The piece of cloth does not have white colour nor the wheel....It has been prepared by Khanna’s daughter with her toe and the prime minister was compassionate,” he said.\nCongress, however, refused to be bogged down by the explanation. “We are not petty like BJP. We respect the office of the prime minister,” Randeep Singh Surjewala, in-charge of the AICC Communications Department told reporters here.\nAt the same time, he said the prime minister must look within and take corrective action as respect for the national flag is the responsibility of 125 crore people, more so for the prime minister.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T06:44:57.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
