Manipulating the texture of magnetism February 3, 2012 \nKnowing how to control the combined magnetic properties of interacting electrons will provide the basis to develop an important tool for advancing spintronics: a technology that aims to harness these properties for computation ... Magnetic vortices could form the basis for future high-density, low-power magnetic data storage November 15, 2013 \nWith the ever-increasing amounts of digital information being processed, transferred and stored by computers comes a commensurate demand for increased data storage capacity. For magnetic data storage such as the ubiquitous ... Electron holography reveals the startling beauty of nanoscale magnetic vortices May 30, 2014 \nNanoscale magnetic swirls known as skyrmions can form in certain materials such as thin magnetic films. These tiny vortices pack into dense lattices that are more stable than conventional magnetic domains and can be transported ... Pinpoint laser heating creates a maelstrom of magnetic nanotextures December 19, 2014 \nA simulation study by researchers from the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science has demonstrated the feasibility of using lasers to create and manipulate nanoscale magnetic vortices. The ability to create and control ... Evidence for stable room-temperature skyrmions July 6, 2015 \nIn research published in Nature Communications, researchers from the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science in Japan, along with collaborators in Europe and Japan, have identified a class of materials that displays clear ... Recommended for you Scientists identify new way of information storage and processing based on skyrmions September 16, 2015 \nHard to unwind like knots in a rope, magnetic skyrmions are stable magnetic whirls that behave like tiny particles in magnetic thin films. These whirls, only a few nanometers in size offer great potential for next-generation ... Tracking slow nanolight in natural hyperbolic metamaterial slabs September 16, 2015 \nResearchers at CIC nanoGUNE (Basque Country) in collaboration with colleagues at ICFO-The Institute of Photonic Sciences (Catalunya) have imaged how light moves inside an exotic class of matter known as \"hyperbolic materials.\" ... New tool for studying magnetic, self-propelled bacteria that resemble compass needles September 15, 2015 \nIn the Marvel Comics universe, Professor Xavier and the X-Men are only able to fend off their archrival Magneto, the magnetic mutant with the ability to control metals, once they truly understand the scope of the villain's ... Researchers show how natural materials can self-assemble into surfaces with stunning optical properties September 15, 2015 \nThe tulip called Queen of the Night has a fitting name. Its petals are a lush, deep purple that verges on black. An iridescent shimmer dances on top of the nighttime hues, almost like moonlight glittering off regal jewels. A small, inexpensive high frequency comb signal generator September 15, 2015 \nThe manipulation of electromagnetic radiation is an essential function of today's technology. Low frequency radiation—in the kilohertz and megahertz range—is easier to generate than gigahertz radiation. Yet higher frequencies ... Researchers develop 'instruction manual' for futuristic metallic glass September 15, 2015 \nCreating futuristic, next generation materials called 'metallic glass' that are ultra-strong and ultra-flexible will become easier and cheaper, based on UNSW Australia research that can predict for the first time which combinations ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:07:13.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
