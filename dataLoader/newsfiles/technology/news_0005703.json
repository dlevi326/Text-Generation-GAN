We are currently trading on the OTC Pink® marketplace and completing the audit was one of the first steps necessary to up-list to the OTCQB®. We will continue to implement our strategic plan to up-list to a higher marketplace and become fully reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\" The OTC Markets Group organizes securities into the OTCQX®, OTCQB® and OTC Pink® tiered marketplaces.

To date the Company has raised $115,000 . Mr. Findley added, \"While we were hoping to raise the full amount of targeted capital needed to implement defined strategic initiatives, we were able to raise a significant amount of capital and make tremendous operational progress. With this capital, the Company is well positioned to implement its business plan throughout the remainder of the year.\" Management has decided to close out its current offering on September 30 th , 2015 as the stock has been trading between $.03 and $.05 per share which results in a 53% to 72% discount off of market price.
