Shamash said that sensors will feed data into software managing the grid of the future, which will require protection from outside cyber threats.\nThe Center for Biotechnology, which will also receive its $10 million over 10 years, had to compete against other New York State schools bidding for the renewed funding.\nBoth centers for advanced technology will be funded through NYSTAR, Empire State Development's division of science, technology and innovation. Stony Brook also has a third center focused on sensor technology. The CAT program was created in 1983 to push technology out of research universities and into commercial products.\nStony Brook's biotechnology CAT is focused primarily on taking to market advances from Stony Brook, Brookhaven National Laboratory and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, said Clinton Rubin, chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering and the center's director. Rubin said the center's challenge is to take a research culture whose currency is academic papers and move the science it produces toward the \"investment community.\"\nAmong the commercial products that the biotechnology CAT steered to market: ReoPro, a drug to treat cardiovascular disease, and the 3-D virtual colonoscopy, a less invasive option that requires no sedation and uses scanning technology to screen for intestinal polyps.\nThe latest LI business news in your inbox daily.
