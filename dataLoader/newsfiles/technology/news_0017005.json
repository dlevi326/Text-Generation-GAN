The decision to relocate was due to an increase in production and the number of employees at MEIsystem, which currently has a staff of 17 and includes an office manager, technicians and admininstrative and sales people, the company said. The new branch delivers machinery and provides technical support to the North American market and also has a warehouse for spare parts and tools as well as a training room.“Our branches play a crucial role that is perhaps even more important than our headquarters: to put the company’s philosophy into practice and transfer this to our customers. For this reason, we believe it is critical to invest in improving and expanding our branches,” commented Stefano Sonzogni, CEO and technical director at MEIsystem. “The new U.S. branch will support the increased production we are expecting in the coming years with the launch of new products on the market. The goal is also to optimize and enhance the customer experience in America, with our demonstration and training room for example,” he said.The address and telephone numbers for Meisystem’s U.S. headquarters are: Meisystem Inc., 959 AEC Dr., Wood Dale, Ill., 60191; phone (630) 521-8588; fax (630) 521-8580.
