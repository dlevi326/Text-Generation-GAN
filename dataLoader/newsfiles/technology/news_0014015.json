This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150921005631/en/ Alaric Instant-DevKit supporting Arria10 SoC (Photo: Business Wire). \nBased on Altera’s SoC FPGA technology, the Alaric Arria 10 SoC FMC Instant-DevKit offers developers an out-of-the box design solution that combines a compact hardware platform with an efficient, intuitive software environment. The DevKit’s unique install and graphical user interface enable an immediate start, and its reference designs enable fast turn-around for short, secure developments. \nArria 10 SoCs integrate a dual-core ARM Cortex A9 processor subsystem into a user-customizable FPGA leveraging a high-bandwidth interconnect. SoC FPGAs provide embedded systems improved performance, increased reliability, increased flexibility, while lowering system cost and board size. \nThe new Alaric Development Kit is designed for use in a wide range of applications, including high-speed data communication, video capture and processing, high-performance computing for data center and Cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), military and defense technologies, testing and measurement, networking and communications, industrial, automotive, and many other applications. \nReFLEX CES will demonstrate the Alaric Instand-DevKit at Altera’s upcoming SoC Developers Forum (ASDF). ASDF is the industry’s first series of events dedicated to investigating the technology and application of SoC FPGAs. ASDF events provide attendees an edge in developing next-generation system designs using SoC FPGAs. at ReFLEX CES booth. Come see ReFLEX CES and our Alaric Arria 10 SoC FMC Instant-DevKit at the ASDF events being held in Santa Clara, California (United States) on 30 th September, in Frankfurt (Germany) on 14 th October, and Shenzhen (China) on 3rd November. More information about ASDF can be found at https://www.altera.com/events/northamerica/altera-soc-developers-forum/overview.html \n“The Alaric Instant-DevKit provides users easy access to an off-the-shelf, high-performance hardware solution based on the industry’s only 20nm SoC FPGA,” said Chris Balough, senior director of marketing, SoC products, at Altera. “We are pleased to have ReFLEX CES join our extensive lineup of SoC FPGA ecosystem partners at ASDF and showcase their latest innovations.” \nThe Alaric Arria 10 SoC FMC Instant-DevKit is available now at a price of $3,495, directly through ReFLEX CES or our distribution network. \nAbout ReFLEX CES ReFLEX CES ( www.reflexces.com ) is an Altera DSN partner and Dev Kit Contract Manufacturer deeply engaged in mid to high complex FPGA based designs using the complete Altera product portfolio like CyClone V, Stratix V and the latest Arria 10 GX and Arria 10 SoC.In addition, the company is also releasing its own Arria 10 GX and Arria 10 SX Instant-Development Kits to the market especially aligned to the BroadBase and High Performance markets under the names of Attila, Alaric and Arminius; with version of those boards for volume cost effective production.ReFLEX CES provides turnkey custom embedded and complex systems, and is specialized in Modified Off-The-Shelf (MOTS) solutions for VPX/OpenVPX, CompactPCI, VME rugged systems, Embedded Systems, Industrial Systems, High-speed boards, FPGA and PCIe boards.
