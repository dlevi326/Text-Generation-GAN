This generates a fine mist capable of delivering much larger molecules directly to the lungs.\nRigorous lab tests have proved the device capable of delivering next generation drugs such as proteins, peptides and DNA to the lungs without a patient having to inhale. The device delivers drugs at rates of up to 3 ml/min, compared to the much smaller doses of 0.4 ml/min benchmark of current nebulizers.\nRecent trials in Melbourne also showed sheep given a DNA flu vaccine via a nebulizer had comparable immune responses to animals injected with the vaccine.\nA Professor of Chemical Engineering and an Australian Research Council Future Fellow, Yeo believes the device has enormous potential, particularly for people with lung cancer.\n“The five-year survival rate for lung cancer remains around 15 per cent despite the significant therapeutic advances achieved in recent years and currently, there are no personalized delivery devices for inhaled cancer drugs to improve these clinical outcomes,” he said.\n“Our nebulizer addresses this gap as a low-cost and convenient yet efficient method of delivering oncolytics directly to the lungs, potentially revolutionizing the treatment of lung cancer.”\nLung cancer is the leading cause of deaths by cancer and the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer in Australia.\nThe nebulizer can also be used for a range of non-pharmaceutical applications such as perfumes, cosmetics and sterilization of equipment and surfaces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:01:31.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
