The agreement includes a new 3+1 option that enables students to continue seamlessly their studies at Maricopa for up to three years before transferring to Kaplan University to complete their major requirements for a bachelor's degree. \n\"The flexible transfer pathways from Maricopa Community Colleges to Kaplan University maximize credit transfer and therefore provide a very cost-effective option for students to earn both an associate's degree and bachelor's degree to prepare for some of the most in-demand jobs in the Greater Phoenix Metropolitan area,\" said Dr. Rufus Glasper, Maricopa Community Colleges Chancellor. Maricopa is one of the largest multi-college community college systems in the United States, serving nearly 265,000 students. \nHow the 3+1 option works: \nStudents consult both a Maricopa and Kaplan University academic advisor to determine the corresponding associate's degree pathway that best matches the student's educational and career goals. While studying at Maricopa, students complete specific requirements in addition to their associate's degree requirements. The maximum number of transfer credits varies per Kaplan University degree program. After graduation and earning an associate's degree at Maricopa, the student then seamlessly enrolls with Kaplan University to complete the selected bachelor's degree program in about 54 weeks. \nThe 3+1 option delivers several important and tangible benefits for students: They save money by continuing their studies at the community college for an additional year. Additionally, Kaplan University is offering a 25 percent discount to Maricopa students who elect to take advantage of the 3+1 option. The discount is also being made available to Maricopa almni, faculty and staff. Also, course credits transfer quickly and easily. Since the student decides early in the process to earn a bachelor's degree and as a result of the agreement, the student's courses have already been evaluated and accepted by Kaplan University. By transferring the optimal number of qualifying credits combined with no admissions waiting lists, students can avoid lengthy transfer periods, complete their studies, and earn their bachelor degrees faster. \n\"America's community colleges have been called upon to increase student success and ensure a 21 st -century prepared workforce,\" said Walter G.
