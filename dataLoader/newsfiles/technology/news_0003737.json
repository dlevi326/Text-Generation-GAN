The integration provides public sector and higher education organizations access to a national database of over 900,000 vendors skilled in serving the public sector. In turn, all registered vendors gain access to even more bid opportunities as well as tools to help them better respond.\n“When we joined forces with BidSync last year, we had a vision of becoming a public procurement powerhouse, furthering our purpose of eradicating waste and maximizing the value of every dollar spent,” said Brian Utley, President and CEO of Periscope Holdings. “This integration is an important step toward achieving our goals. Buyers and vendors are the heart of procurement and must rely on each other to succeed. We believe connecting these stakeholders with tools that increase the visibility of bids and enable better interaction will improve the procurement process and result in productivity gains for both purchasers and vendors.”\nThe integration of BuySpeed and BidSync was designed to ease the purchasing process and deliver benefits to BuySpeed customers, their existing suppliers as well as vendors already registered within BidSync bid notification system. Customers benefit from gaining access to over 900,000 vendors with their bid opportunities, resulting in better pricing and better services. Their existing suppliers gain the opportunity to access more agency bids, more tools and services to respond to solicitations and a centralized location to manage certification and solicitation tracking activity through a single, simple registration step. And, vendors already registered with BidSync bid notification now receive even more bid opportunities, with automatic access to all BuySpeed customer solicitations.\nThe integration functionality is available today to all new and existing BuySpeed customers (version 12 and higher).
