MobileSmith enables non-programmers in enterprises to quickly produce flexible, connected apps for customers and employees. \n“Five years ago, everyone just wanted to launch a mobile app. Today, enterprises are realizing that they need to design for mobile first to engage with their customers and employees,” said Bob Dieterle , MobileSmith COO. “ MobileSmith 4.0 delivers to this need by empowering business leaders to quickly produce beautiful, truly useful apps in a matter of days – without having to write any code.” \nMobileSmith 4.0 new capabilities include: Easy and Quick REST API Integration for On-Demand Data \nREST services allow you to connect your app to any data source in minutes. We use JSON, the industry standard for mobile, to exchange data on-demand between your backend system and any app page. With REST services, you can easily bring out your legacy data and flexibly include them in any internal or customer-facing apps, building connected omni-channel experiences for your customers and employees. OAuth 2.0 User Authentication for Less Cumbersome App Access \nOAuth allows you to use existing authentication services in your mobile apps, without building cumbersome authentication interfaces for each app. Users can sign in with their social credentials or existing portal login. You can keep your data secure, while having the benefit of building quick native apps connected to your enterprise systems. Improved User Interface for Rapid App Development \nOur goal is to make non-programmers totally comfortable creating fully functional, native iOS and Android apps in our platform. We’ve updated our workflow and UI, making app navigation inside the app canvas easier and introducing a number of intuitive functions. \nFor more information about MobileSmith 4.0, visit http://www.mobilesmith.com/rest-services-oauth \nWe will introduce MobileSmith 4.0 at our webinar on Thursday, October 1, 1:00pm EST , and show the many use cases you can build with REST and OAuth.
