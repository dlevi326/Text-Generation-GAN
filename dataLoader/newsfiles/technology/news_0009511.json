The report said the government had also contributed to delays. For example, railroads had to stop construction along tracks on radio poles — which make the GPS technology work — because they had not gone through an environmental evaluation process.

Congress set a deadline of Dec. 31 for freight and commuter rail companies to install technology that could prevent such accidents. Credit Joseph Kaczmarek/Associated Press The report also found that the Federal Railroad Administration had not provided adequate oversight; it took the agency seven months to review the first safety plan it received from a railroad. Matthew Lehner, a spokesman for the railroad administration, said the agency had already addressed many of the issues raised in the new report, including adding more staff and creating an internal task force to collect data from the railroads on their implementation of the positive train control technology. Railroads across the country that have not installed and activated the necessary equipment could face federal fines and other mandates if they continue operating without it past Dec. 31, according to the railroad administration. Some railroads said they would not haul crude oil or hazardous chemicals after the deadline because of the potential liability. “Railroads are beginning to notify their customers of the possibility of an impending rail shutdown as they, too, have to prepare for such a worst-case scenario,” said Edward R. Hamberger, president and chief executive of the Association of American Railroads, an industry trade group. “If lawmakers want to avert a massive disruption of passenger and freight transport this fall, which will inflict significant hardships on businesses and passengers alike, it must take action now to extend the deadline.” The Government Accountability Office report bolsters assertions by some lawmakers that an extension is needed. A Senate bill that was passed in July would push the deadline to 2018. The bill would add money to the Department of Transportation’s budget to help the industry with installation of the technology because the equipment is expensive and time-consuming to install across thousands of miles of track. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T08:14:47.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
