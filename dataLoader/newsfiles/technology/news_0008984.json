Anyone?\nNow, don’t get me wrong, I’m not talking about the usual suspects: lawyers, 2 nd hand car salesmen, politicians, insurance salesmen, dieticians, real estate agents, and bank managers. These scumbags people have been with us since the Big Bang Theory – it has been hardwired into our DNA not to trust them. Ever.\nBut times have changed. New players have entered the stage.\nI’m talking about ordinary, run of the mill, people: your inquisitive neighbour; the unqualified plumber who says he can fix your geyser; the man with the eye-makeup (smelling like a rose) sitting next to you on the Gautrain; the petrol pumper at the garage who steals the dust caps off your tyres; your maid or gardener with the long fingers; your bestest best drinking buddy who never buys a round; your bestest best drinking buddy’s flirtatious wife, etcetera. ( No, Sakkie, her name is not “Etcetera,” it is “Joelientjie.” And she’s BAD news. But that’s not important right now. ) The question is: Can you trust any of these people?\nI grew up in an era where we were taught to respect and trust the local doctor, our teachers, the judge, the police sergeant, the Parson, and the Greek café owner around the corner.\nNowadays, “Doctors” have fraudulent qualifications; teachers molest the schoolchildren; the judge gets smashed and drives his drunken Jaguar into a wall; the cops are corrupt; the Parson feeds snakes and rats to his flock of gullible sheep; and the Greek café owner around the corner has sold his shop to a skelm Oriental and has gone back to his bankrupt country.\nSo who do you trust?\nI’ll tell you:\nTrust the ANC to destroy this country even further. Trust them to trash the country’s infrastructure through mismanagement. Trust the voters to believe their empty promises again. Trust them to win the next elections. Trust them to ride the gravy train until Jesus comes. Trust the people to burn tyres, block roads, loot, and destroy property because of service delivery issues. Trust the universities to degrade into skeletons of what they once were. Trust corruption, at the highest level, to flourish like never before.\nLastly, trust me when I say: “ You ain’t seen nothin’ yet! ”\nI’m telling you, this is Nannies Koepella!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T10:06:00.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
