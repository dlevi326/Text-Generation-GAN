Sacks wrote books that illuminated the human mind, approximately 600 notebooks' worth of journals, and, in his final months, frank and profound essays on living and dying . No amount of pages will be able to fill the gaping void he leaves behind.[caption id=\"attachment_81319958\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Dr. Oliver Sacks speaks at the World Science Festival in 2008.

His 2001 memoir, Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood , transports readers to the pre-World War II-era England of his youth, and to his enviable elemental explorations.Few other than Sacks could so eloquently capture the stench of hydrogen selenide , the \"angry buzz\" of a chunk of sodium metal tossed into the water from a bridge above, and, yes, the deep clink of a little bar of tungsten .No matter that Sacks didn't choose chemistry as a career. It was clear that he was one of nature's chemists, one who also had the good fortune to be nurtured by a family who encouraged his curiosity.I've always found it curious that Sacks bested the majority of chemists themselves in expressing chemistry's joy and wonder. His was a talent chemists aspire to. Sacks' words held lessons even for legendary chemist communicators, including Nobel Laureate Roald Hoffmann and University of Wisconsin professor and demo master Bassam Shakhashiri. Here's how they put it in an essay celebrating Sacks' 80th birthday :\nWe can emulate Oliver, as he writes not only about the chemical play of his childhood and 19th-century chemistry, but also when he deals with neurology, his profession. We can share the curiosity that drives our searching and the joy that rewards our efforts. The tale of the child who develops a passion for science because of their basement-crafted chemistry concoctions has been told countless times. It is a simple, tidy story of finding one's place in the world that I envied as I examined my own more convoluted career path. I look at those stories differently now. Maybe it's because I'm older and more confident in who I am. Or maybe it's because Sacks' stories are so beautifully told that they can make me appreciate someone else's moment of self-discovery without compelling me to make comparisons.It is bittersweet that as his life drew to a close, Sacks's musings returned to his beloved periodic table . At this juncture, when death is no longer an abstract concept, but a presence — an all-too-close, not-to-be-denied presence — I am again surrounding myself, as I did when I was a boy, with metals and minerals, little emblems of eternity. May everyone who wants to share chemistry with the world remember Oliver Sacks, and the power of the periodic table to provide him not with fear, but with solace in his final days.", "external_links": ["https://books.google.com/books?id=jfUJAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PT86&dq=uncle%20tungsten%20hydrogen%20selenide&pg=PT12#v=snippet&q=His%20metal&f=false", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/opinion/oliver-sacks-mishearings.html?action=click&contentCollection=CarterPromos&region=Article", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/opinion/sunday/oliver-sacks-sabbath.html?action=click&contentCollection=CarterPromos&region=Article", "http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/issues/2007/december/thechemistrysetgeneration.asp", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/81319958/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/opinion/my-periodic-table.html?action=click&contentCollection=CarterPromos&region=Article", "https://books.google.com/books?id=jfUJAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PT86&dq=uncle%20tungsten%20hydrogen%20selenide&pg=PT86#v=onepage&q=uncle%20tungsten%20hydrogen%20selenide&f=false", "http://cen.acs.org/articles/91/i27/Joy-Chemistry.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/science/oliver-sacks-dies-at-82-neurologist-and-author-explored-the-brains-quirks.html", "https://books.google.com/books?id=jfUJAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PT86&dq=uncle%20tungsten%20hydrogen%20selenide&pg=PT117#v=onepage&q=cesium&f=false", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/opinion/oliver-sacks-on-learning-he-has-terminal-cancer.html"], "published": "2015-09-01T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:11:56.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
