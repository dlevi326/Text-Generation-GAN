A consortium led by a state-owned Chinese firm has won a bid for a feasibility study into a high-speed rail link between India's political and financial capitals New Delhi and Mumbai, the company's parent said, in what could lead to a major deal between the Asian rivals.\nChina Railway, a spinoff from the former railway ministry, said the line will be around 1,200 kilometres (750 miles) long but provided few other details. \nChina has hugely expanded its own high-speed rail network in recent years, and it is now the largest in the world with around 17,000 kilometres of track in service, according to China Railway. \nBeijing has been actively promoting the technology abroad -- often with lower bidding prices and favourable loan conditions -- in a bid to capitalise on the lucrative international market and upgrade the \"Made in China\" brand. \nChina Railway said Wednesday the consortium, which also includes Indian companies, won the bid to carry out the study, saying the Indian award \"fully reflected the approval of China's high-speed rail technology by the international society and the international fast rail market\". \nIndia has also solicited bids for feasibility studies on lines between Mumbai and the southern city of Chennai, and linking New Delhi and Calcutta, the company added. \nChina in May signed a memorandum with Russia to invest billions of dollars in a high-speed rail line linking Moscow and the Volga city of Kazan. \nBut its push has also had some setbacks. \nLast year Mexico cancelled a contract for a Chinese-led consortium to build what could have been Latin America's first high-speed rail line amid questions over the legality of the bidding process. \nIndonesia earlier this month dumped plans for its first high-speed railway in favour of a slower and cheaper rail option, in a blow to Japan and China who have been fiercely competing to win the construction contract. \nBritish finance minister George Osborne on Thursday said bidding would open for �11.8 billion ($18 billion, 16.3 billion euros) in contracts to build a high-speed rail link in England. \nThe High Speed Two (HS2) project aims to create faster links between London and cities to the north, starting with Birmingham. \nHoping to woo Chinese investment, Osborne announced the impending opening of seven new contracts in the southwestern city of Chengdu, at the end of a five-day visit. \n\"It's crucial that businesses and communities from across the UK feel the full benefit of forging closer economic links with China,\" Osborne said, according to a British government statement. \nOsborne argues that the rail link will boost economic development in the midlands and north of England, but critics fear the link will destroy woodlands and countryside and turn northern cities into commuter towns for London. \n\"This government is committed to rebalancing our economy and building a Northern Powerhouse, and improving transport links and launching HS2 is key to supporting long-term economic growth across the North and Midlands,\" Osborne said. \nHS2 is yet to be finally approved by parliament but the eventual plan is to extend the line into the north of England to the cities of Manchester and Leeds. \nThe first stage of contracts will cover the construction of tunnels and the surface route between London and Birmingham, which is expected to cut journey times from one hour 20 minutes to 50 minutes. \nEarlier in his trip, Osborne announced that Chinese central bank will issue yuan-denominated bonds in London, and said a feasibility study will look at linking the London and Shanghai stock exchanges. \nThe Chancellor is hoping to confirm Chinese investment into a new power plant at Hinkley Point in England, and has pledged a �2 billion government guarantee in a bid to secure a deal. \nCampaigners criticised Osborne for his focus on investment over human rights on Wednesday as he visited Xinjiang in northwest China, homeland of the country's mostly Muslim Uighur minority and the site of increased unrest in recent years. \nChinese President Xi Jinping is expected to visit Britain next month. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:58:37.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
