McHenry said her team is most excited to begin revamping the space left empty when Croc's Mexican Bar and Grill closed last year.\n\"That whole restaurant space is dying to be something exciting,\" she said. \"That is really the best space in the whole building. It's got the exterior presence plus all the charm.\"\nThe building is the longtime home of joints like Two-Fisted Mario's Pizza and the former Celebrity Tattoo & Piercing.\nMcHenry said City Street has a long-standing relationship with some of the building's current retail tenants and that some — although she could not confirm all — will stick around.\n\"We'll meet with tenants and find out what our long-term vision is,\" she said. \"The retail on this street has not been as high quality as we will be making it. We want a higher-end presentation, and the retailers are looking for renovation.\"\nSome of the shops and restaurants along Market Street between 16th and 17th streets. Built between 1872 and 1902, the buildings are a Denver landmark that McHenry said she is looking forward to updating.\n\"We're nothing if not methodical,\" McHenry said. \"We will be interviewing architects who have a good handle on making historic buildings relevant for our times. I think it worked out really well at Union Station.\"\nThis side of Lower Downtown is rapidly changing.\nThe old Office Depot at the corner of 16th and Market has been replaced by 16M, a mixed-use building that includes four floors of luxury apartments, five floors of office space and street-level retail that soon will include the first U.S. location of the chic STK Rebel steakhouse.\nAcross Market, talks around redeveloping Market Street station are underway, but remain under wraps.\nDenver-based developers East West Partners and Continuum — forces behind Union Station redevelopment — said they have big plans for a full city block, which is public parking for the time being.\nMcHenry said whatever emerges will complement the Market Center project.\n\"Everything we hear about what they're exploring is a fabulous project that we will be delighted to be across the street from,\" McHenry said. \"We think it's huge for furthering the presence for this block.\"\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ehernandez", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0925/20150925__20150926_A17_BZ26MARKETCENTER~p1_200.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-25T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T16:15:58.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
