A nation grieving the death one of its favourite leaders readily downloaded the book. \n\nTwo months on, after watching the biographical thriller Everest, a Mumbai professional couldn't shake off the 3D experience and started reading up on the 1996 disaster on the Internet and found a downloadable audio book on it. Not much of a book lover, he saved the audio file on his pen drive and now plays it while maneuvering his way through the crawling Mumbai traffic. \"I wouldn't have picked up a fat book to read, but I wanted to know more,\" the 30-year-old marketing professional says. \n\nThe ancient narrative form of storytelling, once a bedtime experience, has now got a digital spin. \"What makes a good story doesn't change. Modern tools have helped us make the process more interesting and interactive. From paintings on the wall to tablets, the challenge lies in how to make a story interesting and interactive,\" says Manas Mohan, CEO of Publishing, Amar Chitra Katha. \n\nIt was the charm of storytelling that had Ajay Dasgupta leave his corporate job in 2013 and start the Kahaani Project in Pune. A Dialogue in the Dark experience, where visitors are led by blind guides to navigate a darkened space, had inspired Dasgupta to start a project of storytelling sessions designed for the visually impaired. Now, Kahaani crowd sources with volunteers, records stories and uploads them on the website. Dasgupta likes to call it a 'YouTube for stories.' \"The dominant form of narrative is the visual one. Reading is important but so is listening. Storytelling should be a multi-sensory experience,\" he says. \n\nApart from holding storytelling workshops with Door Step School, Kahaani Project will now set up kiosks across the city where anyone can stop and listen to a story. \n\nIf these initiatives revolve around the oral form of storytelling, there are others that aim at initiating children into the world of books. The Chennai-based Book Lovers' Program for Schools (BLPS) - backed by two IITians - Amrutash Misra and Naresh Ramamurthy - believes in making the storytelling experience live and communal and use it as a tool to encourage children to read more. \"Half the goal is achieved if the right book is picked,\" says Misra. He explains that embellishing the narration doesn't always help. \"With too much prop, children might end up saying I don't want to read the book or that the book is too boring.\" Apart from recommending a reading list, training teachers, BLPS also holds activities like group reading. \n\nMisra says the internet has opened up multiple doors to popularize and customize storytelling. The IITian duo recently released a storybook app, Storyhood, which is inspired by the popular android app Farfaria. This app features ebooks, fairy tales and bedtime stories; short stories and longer reads and loads of classic and modern stories for parents and children to read together. \n\nMohan says that though the concept of audio books is hardly new, its market has got a new lease of life with tablets, computers and smartphones. \"In the last 30 years, the percentage of book buyers has not increased. The numbers look big because of the population growth. Also, the hegemony of the large brands has ended with more number and different formats of books being published,\" he says. \n\nThe audio book sales are predictably picking up. E-commerce major Flipkart says the audio books market is growing steadily, but a lot depends on digital rights management and how policies and structures are built around it to avoid plagiarism, says a Flipkart spokesperson. \"Audio books have a very niche set of audience and we foresee a lot of potential,\" he adds, pointing out how the demand for non-fiction and mythology titles in audio books is very high. \n\nAudio books clearly have an audience ranging from the avid book readers to those only starting to learn the alphabet. Ruthu Sreebashyam's iPad is her two-year-old's favourite gadget. The toddler could be uttering gobbledegook, but knows the route to his storytelling and nursery apps on his mother's tab. \n\nStories for adults: \n\nIf reading is not your thing, then there are podcasts. Fiction and non-fiction works of some of the best storytellers are available on podcasts like The Moth, True Story, Snap Judgement and many more. \n\nOne of the oldest programmes on All India Radio's Vividh Bharati is Hawa Mahal - stories presented in a skit format. \n\nYaadon ka IdiotBox with Neelesh Misra on 92.7 BIG FM is a two-hour show where every day stories of an imaginary city is narrated by Misra, who is a journalist, author and storyteller.
