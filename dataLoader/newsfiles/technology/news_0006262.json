The proposal caught many by surprise, including the public employee union whose members man Chicago’s 311 call center. It also raised questions about just who would be answering the phone when a Chicagoan called to report a pot hole, a stray animal, or a broken street lamp. Would it be an operator who actually knew and lived in the city, or would calling in a simple noise complaint morph into the same frustrating experience as dialing up the cable or insurance company?", "external_links": ["http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/Press%20Room/Press%20Releases/2015/September/budgetaddress.PDF", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-rahm-emanuel-311-privatization-met-0923-20150922-story.html"], "published": "2015-09-29T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T22:33:27.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
