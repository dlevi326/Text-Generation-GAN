In addition, Ascentis released two major product components, support for the ACA (Affordable Care Act) and a new module, Compensation Planning , which greatly improves the management of focal increases, and bonus or stock allocations. Since the start of 2012, Ascentis has increased its monthly recurring revenue by 175% and added more than 350 net new clients. Ascentis’ growth in large part is attributed to its full suite of robust human capital management products, fanatical approach to client satisfaction and retention, and predictable relationship pricing which delivers tremendous value to clients. Key 2015 growth metrics to-date include:\nProduct bookings increased by 59% Total revenue increased by 42% Total recurring revenue increased by 45% Total recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue grew to 96% Client retention remains very strong at 98%+ Addition of Compensation Planning to Ascentis Talent Management Support for the ACA for reporting, analysis and required filings\nIn August 2015, Ascentis released Ascentis Talent Management version 15.2. The release included an enhanced user interface, upgraded performance management capabilities and a new compensation planning module to facilitate merit increases. Ascentis Compensation Planning eliminates the frequently-used approach of spreadsheets for managing increases within organizations. Executives, managers, and HR staff can effectively allocate budgets, assess increases against historical performance, determine possible retention risks and appropriately compensate the individuals that are key to an organization. Integrated analytics allows for real-time assessment of manager recommendations, pay for performance, and actuals-versus-budget trends. Workflows within the system manage the entire process from establishing a budget pool, to submitting recommendations, to finalizing the increases within Ascentis HR and Payroll. With this new module, human resources has clear visibility across the entire organization to view individual increases, team totals, and process bottlenecks. This ensures total accountability with compensation plans and gives clients the ability to pay their workforce fairly, based on real-time employee, department and organizational data and performance metrics.\nThe ACA has created many concerns within the marketplace about how to effectively analyze affordability of plans, employee eligibility parameters, and to accomplish the accurate distribution and filing of necessary documents with employees and the government for each tax year. Ascentis, starting in late 2013 and continuing through 2015, released many new product components to assist in, and simplify the process of, managing ACA compliance. Ascentis is unique in the marketplace as its HCM solution includes all the solutions organizations need to properly manage ACA compliance , which includes HRIS, benefits management, payroll and time and attendance software. In addition, Ascentis’ unique predictable pricing model provides a transparent and cost-effective approach to performing all the necessary analysis for, and the filing of, IRS Forms 1094-C and 1095-C.\n\"Forum Communications started looking for a new payroll and human resources management solution provider in 2015 after realizing we needed an up-to-date system that could grow and adapt with our company,” said Kate Freimanis, HR Director of Forum Communications. “After processing payroll with an outdated system for many years, we were looking for a provider that would help automate our HR, timekeeping, and payroll processes. With the upcoming ACA reporting mandates, we also needed a provider that would be able to help make the reporting process easier. And, with more than 1,700 employees, we needed a system that would be easy for our employees and supervisors to use and understand. Ascentis covers all of these things, and more. We are very happy with the decision we made to move to Ascentis.\"\nAscentis offers a full suite of recruiting, HR, benefits, payroll, timekeeping and talent management products to more than 1,500 clients throughout the U.S. and Canada.
