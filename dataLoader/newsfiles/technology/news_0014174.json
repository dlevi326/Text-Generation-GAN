The revised growth figure released Tuesday was better than some economists had anticipated. A preliminary estimate last month showed the world's third-largest economy contracting at a minus 1.6 percent annual rate. But economists said much of the change stemmed from an upward revision in inventories, and the general trend is weaker than expected. The higher inventories and a revision in consumer spending to minus 0.7 percent instead of minus 0.8 percent as earlier estimated helped to offset weaker government and corporate investment. \"The details were hardly reassuring,\" Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a commentary. He expects growth to be positive but tepid in the current quarter, based on the data seen so far. Domestic demand was essentially flat in the quarter. On a quarterly basis, the economy contracted 0.3 percent versus the earlier estimate of a 0.4 percent contraction. The government hopes to boost growth through inflation, but sluggish wages and exports have frustrated that effort.
