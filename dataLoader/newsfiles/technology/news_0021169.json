There are 158,671 in the U.S., 18,366 in Canada and 3,582 in Mexico. The rest were sold outside North America. \nFiat Chrysler says static buildup may occur if the wipers are used when it’s dry. Static buildup can affect the module that powers the wipers and potentially disable them. \nThe company says it’s not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the issue. \nCustomers will be notified, and dealers will repair the vehicles for free.
