CNET\nThe new iOS 9 software is now on more than 50 percent of iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches, according to Apple.\nThe company announced the figure on Monday morning, proclaiming it the fastest iOS adoption rate ever . Apple measures iOS adoption based on the number of devices that visit the Apple Store on a given date. The 50 percent mark is based on Apple's App Store stats as compiled on Friday, September 19, the fourth day into the rollout 0f iOS 9.\nLaunched last Wednesday throughout the world, Apple's latest version of its mobile operating system improves several of the existing features. Like Microsoft's Cortana, the voice assistant Siri can now remind you of calendar appointments. The Notes app now lets you create checklists, draw sketches and add attachments. And the Apple Maps app now has more mass-transit information, including schedules and subway station entrances for urban locales such as New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, Mexico City and Beijing.\niOS 9 also promises better battery life with a new low-power mode that turns off certain features when you run below a 20 percent battery charge. A new split-screen feature lets you run two apps side by side, but only if you're using the iPad Air 2 or later iPads. And Apple has added a new app called News, which aggregates different news sources to keep up with the latest stories around the world.", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150921005669/en/iPhone-6s-iPhone-6s-Arrive-Friday-September#.Vf_49JftoY9", "http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/06/05/47f9818d-b60f-4580-b6fe-15bb9c0f78e7/resize/570xauto/4bc5608b3ddd657e037904ec53490a96/ios-9-graphic-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-21T13:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T16:13:57.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
