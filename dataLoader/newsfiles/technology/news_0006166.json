The probe is in very early stages, the source said.\nThe FTC and Google were unavailable for comment.\nThe news was first reported by Bloomberg.\n(Reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington; Additional reporting by Sangameswaran S and Sayantani Ghosh in Bengaluru; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi and Ted Kerr)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-09-26T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T16:00:50.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
