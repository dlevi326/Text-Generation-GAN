Could not subscribe, try again later Rex Parents should talk about the internet and online gaming with their children rather than just blocking it \nResearch from Norton , polling 2002 UK consumers, shows that 61% think the internet has made the world more dangerous and 95% are concerned about children under 18 accessing it with new technology. \nHowever, the real danger here is in cracking down on Internet access in the home rather than parents and children understanding the issues at hand. \nNick Shaw, UK General Manager at Norton makes a good point: \"staying safe online requires not only the right technology, but also the right conversations.” \nHeadlines like this should spark dialogue rather than legislation so parents are helped to take “an interest and be a good role model.\" \nAlmost half the parents surveyed did’t know what their children are doing online, with a third concerned that children could outsmart any parental controls they might set. \nThese controls have in fact come a long way since they started appearing on devices and now offer robust settings to control who can access particular content and features on video-game consoles and other devices. Getty Many children and adults use the internet for online gaming \nAgain, more important than super-secure settings is an ongoing conversation between parents and children about the opportunities and dangers of connected experiences in the home. \nWith a bit of homework parents can take a lead in these debates. Resources like PEGI’s Quick Guide videos offer an easy way to understand the benefits and dangers of recent video-game releases. \nAsk About Games also offers parents a non-threatening and jargon-free way to engage with the benefits video-games. \nTony Neate, Chief Executive Officer for Get Safe Online added that “we encourage parents to take an active role in understanding and educating their children about online safety.” \nThis approach has been revolutionary in some families I’ve worked with, and has turned the video-game age rating debate on its head. \nSome parents have even found themselves encouraging their children to play particular older rated games that they felt offered certain benefits — much to the surprise of the child. \nEnjoying games together and setting up parental control that are agreed on by both parents and children is to, my mind, the perfect combination.
