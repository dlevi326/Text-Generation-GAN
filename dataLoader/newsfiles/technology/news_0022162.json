It's recommended to take at least an hour to observe.\nAlso, the early evening isn't the best time to see the meteors, according to EarthSky.org , although there is a chance you could see an \"earthgrazer\", described as a \"loooong, slow, colorful meteor traveling horizontally across the evening sky.\"\nThe meteors will become more common after midnight, and peak just before dawn. ( Go here to see livestreaming of the meteor shower from NASA.)\nThe Perseid meteor shower occurs each year in July and August as the Earth passes through the debris of the Swift-Tuttle comet, according to NASA.\nTonight and early Thursday morning likely are the best chances to see the meteor shower. The National Weather Service is calling for partly cloudy skies and chances of showers and thunderstorms Thursday night and early Friday morning.", "external_links": ["http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html", "http://darksitefinder.com/maps.html", "http://www.cnet.com/news/best-way-to-see-the-perseid-meteor-shower-where-you-are/", "http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-perseid-meteor-shower#when", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2015/08/11/how-watch-perseid-meteor-shower/31467383/"], "published": "2015-08-13T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:15:13.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
