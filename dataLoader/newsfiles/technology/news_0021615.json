For example, bicycle availability has a bigger effect in Cambridge than in Sheffield,\" Dr Philips told the conference. \n\"When I chose to look at some walking and cycling-related policies at a small scale – what if everyone had access to a bicycle, exercised each week to achieve a healthy BMI, and children could get to school without being escorted by parents – I found that the policy package had an effect in 99% of English Output Areas. \n\"The largest effects were found in the suburbs of larger cities usually about 5-10km from the centre. Affluent towns were less improved by the policy package possibly because of the large amount of long-distance commuting.\" \nKey area findings included: The districts at the outer edge of London's travel to work area have a particularly low capacity to get to work by walking or cycling. Districts like Epping Forest, Sevenoaks and Tandridge came in at under 35%. The Isles of Scilly was the district with the highest indicator score at around 80%. Within districts, areas classified as 'countryside' and 'prospering suburbs' were most likely to have a low indicator score. The most deprived areas had a relatively high adaptive capacity, but by comparing with the IMD some of the least resilient areas were found: these were concentrations in East London, the former Yorkshire coalfield and South Birmingham.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T16:54:29.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
