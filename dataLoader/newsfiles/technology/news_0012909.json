That’s really important.\n“We’ve backed many Australia-based start-ups and we want to keep them around. We also want our kids to be able to have jobs in this city. We think this park is an important piece of the puzzle.” Mr Cannon-Brookes said there was a ‘chicken and egg’ issue: many of the local technology players only wanted to move into the space if everybody else moved.\n“There’s a real momentum here towards it, and that’s what we’re trying to show to the government. We’re trying to tell them we’ll sign a ridiculously large lease to move ourselves, and we want to do that as long as other people are willing to come with us,” he said.\nHe said Australia was “so far behind” innovative cities like Berlin and London.\nHe said that even though the city of Sydney and NSW state government were “trying interesting things”, the federal government “aren’t interested at all” in start-ups and innovation.\nPWC’s Jeremy Thorpe told The Australian the NSW state government had talked a lot about creating the jobs of the future, particularly with its $190 million Jobs for NSW fund announced last week, and the ATP would be the perfect place to foster such innovation.\n“We want Sydney to have a globally competitive technology industry and the fact is that people want to work in places that are attractive to them,” he said. “We don’t want to lose this opportunity because there are not many opportunities like this that come around in Sydney.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T06:29:57.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
