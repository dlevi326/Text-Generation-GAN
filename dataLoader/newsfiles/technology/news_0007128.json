You will get 107 miles on a single charge? No doubt the claim is designed to ring in your ears, as the Nissan Leaf makes its introductions to the public about how it has a new 2016 Leaf which is capable of achieving that range. Sean O'Kane in The Verge wrote about Nissan's battery feature. \nHe reported on a 27 percent boost to its battery capacity, bumping it from 24 kWh to 30 kWh. An EPA-estimated range is 107 miles on a single charge . \nNissan made the announcement on Thursday. \"Nissan today introduced the 2016 all-electric Leaf with an available 30 kWh battery that provides an EPA-estimated best-in-class range of 107 miles â€“ a 27-percent increase over the previous 24 kWH battery. The new battery is standard for Leaf SV and Leaf SL models.\" \nA Nissan spokesperson noted the desire to develop battery technology striking an \"ideal balance between capacity, packaging, durability and affordability.\" The new battery comes standard on the SV and SL models of the Leaf; these are Nissan's mid- and high-level trims, said The Verge . (The Leaf is available in three trim levels: S, SV and SL.) \nThe new battery , meanwhile, is more than just a capacity boost, said Bengt Halvorson on Thursday in The Car Connection . \"Nissan says that it's upgraded the structure of the cells and improved the electrode material with a revised chemistry bringing better battery durability , too. And it weighs just 46 pounds more than the smaller-capacity battery.\" \nNissan had this explanation about its battery approach: \n\"Often when battery capacity is simply increased, the battery's durability and compatibility with quick chargers may deteriorate. The new 30 kWh battery design adds capacity without increasing battery package size by improving the cell structure of the laminated lithium-ion battery cells. Improved electrode material with revised chemistry results in higher power density and contributes to enhanced battery durability upon charge and discharge.\" \nNissan also said that \"While the 24 kWh battery is composed of four cells per module (192 cells total), the new 30 kWh battery's modules contain eight newly designed cells per module (192 cells total). Unlike conventional cylindrical batteries, the thin, compact laminated cells offer more flexibility in packaging and design applications. The 30 kWh battery pack weighs just 46 pounds more than the 24 kWh battery pack and has the same battery pack size and footprint.\" \nAnother pleasant surprise for owners is the entertainment system on the SV and SL versions of the Leaf. \nNissan in its press announcement called it \"an enhanced IT system that is more user-friendly and gives drivers greater vehicle connectivity.\" Nissan said one can expect to see improvements in the menu screen graphics and customization process; charging screen information is automatically updated each time the ignition is turned on and with every 12 miles of driving. \nAs for price, Nissan said the Leaf offers the value proposition of zero spending on gas, lower maintenance costs and a starting price after tax incentives competitive with a comparable gas-powered car. \nThe 2016 model has three new exterior colors: \"Forged Bronze, Coulis Red and Deep Blue Pearl.\" \nLeaf and its battery are assembled in the United States at Nissan's Smyrna assembly plant. \nMore information: Press release: www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150910005334/en/2016-Nissan-LEAF-Offers-Best-in-Class-107-Mile-Range 13 shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T13:45:32.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
