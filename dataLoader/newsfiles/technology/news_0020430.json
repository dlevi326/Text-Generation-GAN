He could’ve been sentenced to as long as 10 years.\nCalovskis told a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan Friday that he “wrote a little part” of the virus code, which became known as the Gozi virus. The virus infected more than a million computers worldwide, including about 17,000 in the U.S., according to prosecutors.\nHe developed “web injects” that changed the appearance of banking websites when viewed on infected computers, making the Gozi virus more dangerous, the U.S. said. Victims were fooled into providing personal information that was used by others to steal from bank accounts, according to prosecutors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:46:35.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
