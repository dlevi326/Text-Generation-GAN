The news, which was included in Cherokee’s second-quarter results, sent the brand’s shares tumbling more than 33 percent in after-hours trading.\nTarget later confirmed that it is jettisoning the brand, which is responsible for about $1 billion of its approximately $73 billion in annual sales.\n“Over the years, Target has worked with partners like Cherokee to build a reputation for providing our guests with high-quality, stylish products for a great value,” Stacia Andersen , senior vice president in charge of apparel and accessories, said in a statement. But she said the chain wants to focus on what it calls signature categories, including kids and baby. “We ... are excited to introduce several new brands in the future.”\nA Target spokesman did not have any other details about new brands.\nTarget has a licensing agreement with Cherokee but handles most of the design and production on its own. The Cherokee brand has been a fixture in Target stores, chiefly in children’s clothes, since 1997.\nTarget will keep its licensing agreement with Cherokee for the Liz Lange maternity brand.\nThe move to drop Cherokee comes as Target Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell is working to breathe new life into Target’s signature categories in an effort to reclaim its cheap-chic reputation after losing some ground to other fast fashion retailers.\nIn its most recent annual report, Cherokee said it received $15 million in royalties from Target in the last fiscal year, accounting for about 43 percent of its overall revenue. Cherokee also said then that the termination of its agreement with Target would have a material adverse effect on its business.\nCherokee CEO Henry Stupp called Target a “great partner.” In a statement, he added that Cherokee Global Brands will seek new partnerships with other U.S. retailers.", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-11T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T14:34:27.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
