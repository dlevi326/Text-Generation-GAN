We are hoping to work together with Italian companies in this area\" he explained and added \"The fund was able in a short period of time to achieve much most notably being the raising of awareness in young generations of the importance of entrepreneurship and to encourage innovation and creativity. That contributes effectively in creating the most suitable environment for the SMEs sector to grow.\" \n\"The fund succeeded in harmonising the financial technical and training needs of entrepreneurs to enable them to start up promising projects. One thing that distinguishes the fund is that it started from where others have ended as we identified the obstacles they face and work out how to avoid them which helps us to design the appropriate programmes from the economic and social needs of Abu Dhabi\" the Chairman of Khalifa Fund explained. \nThe Italian Ambassador welcomed the cooperation with the Khalifa Fund saying \"Italy is keen to provide all experiences it has that might support the SMEs sector. We encourage frequent visits and training to open dialogue between Italian and local enterprises to exchange knowledge and experience.\" \nThe Italian Ambassador also visited the permanent exhibition for Sougha products a Khalifa Fund for Enterprise Development programme which includes handcrafted heritage products. He admired the products which he said reflect the Emirati heritage but with modern taste. \n\n\nWAM/AAMIR/Moran", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:10:49.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
