They tend to employ sell stops to minimize losses and look to momentum. They think that a strong stock will get stronger and a weak stock will get weaker. \nA swing trader thinks longer term in what can be described as a rolling five-week horizon. They think where to buy on weakness and where to sell on strength. \nThe seven stocks profiled here satisfy both trading styles. All seven stocks are in correction territory -- 12% or more below their 2014 or 2015 highs. All but one are also more than 10% above their flash-crash lows set on Aug. 24. \nHere are the weekly charts for these seven popular stocks and the key levels at which to employ good-till-canceled limit orders to buy on weakness at lower key technical levels and to sell on strength at higher technical levels. \nHere's the weekly chart for Apple. \nCourtesy of MetaStock Xenith \nApple closed at $107.72 on Tuesday. That was down 2.4% year to date and was 19.9% below the stock's all-time intraday high of $134.54 set on April 28 and 17.1% above its flash-crash low of $92. From its all-time high to the flash-crash low, the stock plunged 31.6%, setting a trading range for both short-term and swing traders. \nThe stock is below its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages of $120.11 and $121.56, respectively, which is a death-cross formation. \nApple has a neutral weekly chart with the stock below its key weekly moving average of $115.70 and above its 200-week simple moving average of $87.00, which was last tested during the week of June 28, 2013, when the average was $55.22. Apple's weekly momentum reading is projected to rise to 26.91 from 22.61 last Friday. \nInvestors looking to buy Apple should place a good-till-canceled limit order to purchase the stock if it drops to $90.44, which is a key level on technical charts until the end of 2015. 1 of 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:52:23.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
