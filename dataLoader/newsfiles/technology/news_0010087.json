The Inside Out play-set is available now and a Marvel Battlegrounds adventure is expected later on.\nVideo loading\nAnother consideration is the toy-box game creator mode. Buying the disc on its own provides access to all the 3.0 toy-box features.\nHere players can spend many hours creating, sharing and downloading home-made game adventures.\nThe final piece of content to consider is the Toy Box Speed Way and Take Over packs.\nThese take the idea of last year’s toy-box mini-games to the next level.\nThe Toy Box Take Over is an action platform game that can be played with any of your Disney Infinity character collection. This is available now for £13.99 and can be used with the Disc Only or Starter Pack game.\nSimilarly, Toy Box Speed Way is a Mario Kart style game featuring all manner of Disney Characters, and again supports all your old Disney Infinity collection.\nThose new to Disney Infinity should also consider purchasing the older games. The play-set adventures for these older versions can’t be played with the new game and are some real hidden gems.\nFor example, buying Disney Infinity 1.0 Starter Pack (around £22) will grant access to play-set adventures including Pirates of the Caribbean, The Incredibles, Cars, Monsters University, Toy Story and The Lone Ranger.\nMany of these are available at a fraction of the cost second hand.\nThe Disney Infinity 2.0 Starter Pack (around £29) opens the door to various Marvel adventures for Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man and The Avengers.\nThe PC game is another good value route. The latest 3.0 game won’t come to PC for a while but in the meantime Disney Infinity 2.0 on PC offers great value as both the characters and play sets can be purchased without the associated toys as a fraction of the cost.\nThe tablet version offers similar value although it is restricted to the toy-box mode.\nVideo loading\nOn the figurine side, there are a few considerations too.\nFirstly if you are purchasing a character for use in a particular play-set that is not their original Star Wars era you need to collect the Cross-Over coins before they can be used.\nDarth Vader, for example, can’t be used in the Twilight of the Republic play-set before you have collected his Cross-Over coins in the video-game.\nIt’s also worth noting that there are special Light FX Star Wars figures releasing later will have light-up elements. Although functioning similarly in the game these look much more impressive on the Infinity Base with their lightsabers glowing.\nWhile collectors will no doubt purchase both versions, families planning to buy Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi or Kanan Jarrus may want to wait until these special light-up editions characters are released.\nWhile there is a lot to consider here, get the combinations right and Disney Infinity 3.0 has a lot of value to offer families, although this may not necessarily be via the Star Wars Starer Pack.\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23X3qJEL_vE", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ljBoXU-hO6Y?enablejsapi=1&version=3", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/jZBksPrmuzk?enablejsapi=1&version=3", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq7tLEpZtb4", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/iW04Di1iVKY?enablejsapi=1&version=3", "https://twitter.com/GeekDadGamer", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T20:50:21.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
