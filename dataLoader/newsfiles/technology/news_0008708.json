The solutions together dramatically simplify the customers' ability to scale network capacity as their wireless needs grow. \nNews Facts Organizations like Springhill Medical Center and Cumberland University are seeing phenomenal growth in their Wi-Fi infrastructure needs, driven by the rapid adoption of smartphones, tablets, and wireless devices. At the same time, Wi-Fi technology advances, such as 802.11ac with Gigabit Wi-Fi speeds, put severe demand on wired networks. This has necessitated a shift to wired networks with the performance, flexibility, and scalability to grow with enterprises' changing Wi-Fi needs. Springhill Medical Center, a full-service hospital in Alabama, selected Aerohive and Brocade ( News - Alert ) solutions to replace its outdated switch infrastructure, support its Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) and Allscripts Sunrise platform, and to anticipate the increasing demands of emerging healthcare technologies. The new network delivers robust, high availability 10 to 40 GbE for critical healthcare applications, while also providing rapid ROI with 30% savings on equipment and significantly reduced maintenance costs. The solutions together also provide unprecedented visibility into network traffic and dramatically simplified network management. Cumberland University, a private university in Tennessee, needed to replace its network core and edge to support an upgraded wireless network while also delivering high resiliency, performance, and flexibility for future needs. Cumberland replaced its wireless network with Aerohive and Brocade solutions, which now provide a highly scalable network to four campus locations. As a result, Cumberland has been able to improve its students' BYOD experience, which includes mobile courseware, collaboration tools, and learning resources. Aerohive and Brocade deliver a best-in-class wired and wireless architecture that dramatically reduces the cost and complexity of scalable distributed wireless enterprise environments.
