TCM is the world’s largest and most advanced carbon capture facility for testing and improving carbon capture. CCSL also announced that its test campaign at TCM could start as early as November this year. CCSL’s chemical solvents can remove up to 50% more CO2 with the same energy requirement, thereby reducing the size of equipment and energy demand. Tests to date have shown CCSL’s technology to have significantly improved energy efficiency and reduced solvent loss and degradation than its competitors, minimizing overall operating costs. The company is now demonstrating its technology at TCM to generate long-term testing data at full-scale carbon capture. \nRoy Vardheim, Managing Director of TCM, says: “TCM has been playing a vital role in the development of CCS technologies since 2012, helping companies like Aker, Alstom and Shell Cansolv to test and reduce the costs and risks of scaling-up carbon capture. These new test campaigns represent a new milestone in the commercialisation of this vital climate technology.” \nAniruddha Sharma, CEO of CCSL, says: “Use of ineffective amines across the industry is the root cause of high corrosion, high energy demand and solvent loss, and our drop-in solvent technology has the potential to dramatically reduce this. Having demonstrated the technology at pilot scale at the National Carbon Capture Centre, USA, we believe that this demonstration with TCM can bring the technology to commercial readiness.” \nAbout Technology Centre Mongstad: \nTechnology Centre Mongstad ( TCM ) is the world’s largest and most advanced facility for testing and improving CO 2 capture. TCM is a joint venture set up by the Norwegian state (75.12%), Statoil (20%), Shell (2.44%) and Sasol (2.44%). It aims to increase knowledge on carbon capture technologies, in order to reduce technical and financial risk, and accelerate the development of qualified technologies capable of wide scale international deployment. \nThe centre comprises two CO 2 capture plants each with a capacity to capture approximately 80,000 tons of CO 2 from the nearby refinery or 20,000 tons from a gas fired power plant. In addition the center has available space and infrastructure to sustain the next generation technologies to be tested in the future. \nMore information on TCM can be found at www.tcmda.com \nAbout Carbon Clean Solutions: \nCarbon Clean Solutions (CCSL) is an innovative company in carbon dioxide (CO2) separation technology for industrial and gas treating applications. The company’s step change technology significantly reduces the costs and environmental impacts over existing CO2 separation techniques. With prime focus on innovation, CCS aims to provide customized low cost, energy efficient solutions for carbon dioxide separation to its customers. \nCCSL was founded in 2009 with the aim to develop new carbon dioxide capture technology with a focus on flue gases from power and industrial utilities. Company’s initial research was funded by UK-DECC (Department of Energy and Climate Change) and US DOE (Department of Energy). The technology is proven in five countries and exhibits research & development agreement with TNO (Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research) based in the Netherlands, Imperial College, London and University of Leeds, UK. Carbon Clean Solutions now operates offices in India, the United Kingdom and the United States. \nFor more information visit www.carboncleansolutions.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:14:47.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
