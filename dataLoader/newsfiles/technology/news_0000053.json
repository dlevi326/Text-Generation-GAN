Could not subscribe, try again later Getty \nThe world has spent thousands of years debating the existence of life after death. \nBut on the internet, virtual immortality is easy to achieve because social media profiles do not die at the same time as their owner. \nNow bereaved families have been offered the chance to take control of their loved one's eternal online presence using a brand new social network dedicated to remembering people who have passed away. \nThe website is called Remembr and functions as a kind of virtual graveyard, allowing families to build their own virtual memorial to the dead. \nIts launch comes in response to growing demand for a new way of remembering people online. \nFacebook recently allowed people to nominate a virtual executor using its legacy contact feature , which lets families run a dead person's account as a memorial to them. \nOn Remembr, bereaved people can scan in photos, stories and videos, which are uploaded to their profile. \nThey can then invite friends to visit the simulated grave using Facebook or via a QR code which can be printed on funeral invitations. \nA Dutch firm first launched the service in 2013, but it is now being rolled out across the whole world. \nOne unnamed user of the site wrote the following testament to its services: \n\"My father passed away some time ago. One of my sisters created a memory page on Remembr and since then we have almost daily contact through this page. \n\"All kinds of pictures and movies get posted that I have never seen before of my late father and our family. Everyone writes their memories and also responds to each other’s messages. \n\"It has become a lively page and our family relationship is much closer. And the great thing is that my sister can participate from Australia.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T17:04:16.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
