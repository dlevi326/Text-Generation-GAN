However, there are tectonic shifts under way; possible consolidation of feedstock producers, the creation of more pigment focused companies, closure of pigment capacity by major producers, a lack of risk funding for new projects, China pigment consolidation, low iron ore prices influencing Chinese ilmenite supply, new environmental laws and enforcement in China.\nThese topics and more will be high on the agenda at the 2015 TZMI Congress.\nFor more information or to register please visit congress.tzmi.com or email marketing(at)tzmi.com\nAbout TZMI\nTZ MINERALS INTERNATIONAL (TZMI) is a specialist advisory services company for opaque mineral and chemical markets.
