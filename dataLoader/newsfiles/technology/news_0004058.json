Please accept the challenge that I do my job at an exceptional level of quality and quantity.\nThe article is purely speculative. Smoking is a choice of modern living. Tough if you choose to smoke or not.\nIt does not matter if we smoke or not, the branding of smokers as inferior workers is not on\nThe stats provided does not mean anything. No proof exists the we do not do our jobs properly.\nI dare anybody to provide evidence.\nI always say that I would accept everything the way it has happened in my life except maybe for the smoking.\nIf I had it all over again I would perhaps maybe choose not to smoke.\nTo all non smokers, what is your vice? After all we all have our vices. Chewing your nails, picking your nose or whatever?\nDoes this mean that we do our jobs differently?
