Babies are also clever. You might even say manipulative if you believe a new study by UC San Diego.\nResearchers say they've found compelling evidence that babies smile on purpose, not just for the sake of it. Mostly, infants are trying to get people to smile in return, especially dear old mom. \nBabies are as deft as comedians in bringing happiness, even though they exert the minimum amount of effort needed to make it happen. \n\"I used to wonder if my daughter was trying to communicate with me when she was an infant and smiled,\" said Javier Movellan, the UC San Diego psychologist who led the study. \"It might not have just been wishful thinking on my part. Babies are very goal-oriented.\"\nThe findings were published in the journal PLOS One, and involve an unusual line of inquiry. \nScientists programmed a highly social \"toddler\" robot named Diego-San to simulate how babies smile. The machine then interacted with dozens of undergraduate students who were recruited for the study. Diego-San elicited lots of smiles, with little effort. Students only seemed to tune out the robot when it smiled in a random, unnatural manner. \n\"It almost felt like the robot was alive,\" said Movellan, a researcher in the university's Machine Perception Lab.\nUC San Diego used Diego-San as part of a larger effort to use robots as a proxy for humans. \nOver the years, psychologists and other scientists have extensively studied \"smile interactions\" between babies and their mothers. No one knows precisely what's going on. But the UC San Diego study adds a bit of intrigue and insight.\n\"The results of our analysis show that by the time infants reach four months of age both mothers and infants time their smiles in a purposeful, goal-oriented manner,\" the study says. \"Mothers consistently attempted to maximize the time spent in mutual smiling, while infants tried to maximize mother-only smile time.\"\nWhy do they behave that way? \nThat, says Movellan, is a question for another day. \nGary Robbins   More from Gary Robbins UCSD wins $5.2 million for earthquake simulator Pope's plea on environment resonates in San Diego SDSU raises $121 million for research", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T08:50:44.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
