The woman, who died and was safely buried Aug. 29, was treated at home in Kafta village, so more Ebola cases are expected, Lamunu said.\nLiberia had a similar situation. A sample from a corpse tested positive in late June after the country had been declared Ebola-free in May. It was quickly contained and Liberia may again declare itself free from Ebola transmissions this week, Harris said.\nAuthorities decided weeks ago to extend a vaccine trial from Guinea to Sierra Leone, Harris said.\nThe trial for the VSV-EBOV — developed by Canada and licensed to Merck — is done where there is Ebola, she said. Experts target contacts of the infected, and contacts of those contacts to create a buffer zone around a case to prevent its spread. Now that there is a case, and once contacts are traced, they will seek participants and the trial will begin in the area, Harris said.\nThe worst Ebola outbreak in history has killed nearly 4,000 people in Sierra Leone and more than 11,300 overall.\n___\nCarley Petesch reported from Dakar, Senegal.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-01T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T02:53:02.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
