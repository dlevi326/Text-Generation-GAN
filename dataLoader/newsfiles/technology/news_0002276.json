So says a new report on the industry from Kalorama Information. Sales in the traditional glucose monitoring and diabetes management segment dominate the market, followed by continuous glucose monitoring and sensor segment, according to the healthcare market research publisher. Kalorama reports on the market for these products in its latest report, The Global Glucose Monitoring Market. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150831/262422LOGO \nThe report can be found at http://www.kaloramainformation.com/Global-Glucose-Monitoring-9294856/ \nIn addition, the medical technology industry has changed a great deal over the past decade. The number of elderly individuals is increasing, leading to a higher demand for new and better glucose monitoring technology products. New continuous glucose monitoring and sensor market is emerging in response to increased healthcare needs of an aging population, new wireless technologies, better video and monitoring technologies, decreasing healthcare resources, an emphasis on reducing hospital days, and proven cost-effectiveness. \n\"The global glucose monitoring device and diabetes management market has evolved significantly over the last four decades,\" said Bruce Carlson, Publisher of Kalorama Information. \"The number of individuals with diabetes has grown dramatically creating more demand for glucose monitoring devices and supplies. Meters are now smaller, faster, portable and more accurate that they were years ago, with many of them interfacing with computers.\" \nFour companies, LifeScan (J&J), Roche, Abbott and Bayer, have dominated the industry for years. However, other companies such as Panasonic, Sanofi and store brands such as Wal-Mart and Target are providing new competition. Changes in government and third party reimbursement in the United States and Europe have put a strain on the sales of blood glucose strips. Generic options are appearing worldwide that will continue to put pricing pressures on brand company products. \nDiabetes is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. It increases the risk for heart disease, end-stage renal disease, blindness, amputation, and complications of pregnancy and is ranked as the sixth leading cause of death. It is a chronic medical condition that has increased in its numbers at a faster pace than most other chronic conditions. In 2014, the International Diabetes Federation estimated that more than 387 million people have been diagnosed with the disease. \nThe report says the glucose monitoring and diabetes management industry, in general, is continuing to expand. However, the landscape is changing to reflect wearable, less invasive methods of monitoring glucose. Technology is advancing at a rapid pace, bringing new options to both professionals and consumers alike. \nThis report, The Global Glucose Monitoring Market , has market size estimates and forecasts for glucose meters, test strips, lancets and Hb1Ac. It also has regional markets and country estimates.
