But we are not waiting to make the game and players safer. We have been and will continue to make improvements.\"\nAnn McKee , chief of neuropathology at the VA Boston Healthcare System , told PBS: \"People think that we're blowing this out of proportion, that this is a very rare disease and that we're sensationalizing it. My response is that, where I sit, this is a very real disease.\"\n___\nOnline:\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-19T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T02:59:51.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
