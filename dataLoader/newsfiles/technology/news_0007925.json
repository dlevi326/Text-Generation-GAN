Otherwise military action makes little sense,\" Vandeput added. \n\"We must first re-establish order in Syria and then stay on the ground to protect it,\" he said, referring to the chaos in Libya that followed a NATO-backed revolt that unseated longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi. \n\"The troops with whom I am speaking are ready. We are not going to play Rambo, but if clear conditions are established, I am ready to send Belgian troops to the territory of Syria,\" Vandeput said. \nHe said it was about carrying out \"follow-up missions,\" like monitoring camps Belgian troops operate in Mali. \nIn the De Morgen interview, he ruled out having Belgian troops take part in heavy battles. \nTwo Russian planes carrying humanitarian aid landed in Syria on Saturday, state media said, amid reports that Moscow is beefing up military support to its ally Damascus. \n\"Two Russian planes arrived today at the Latakia Martyr Bassil al-Assad international airport carrying 80 tonnes of humanitarian aid provided by Russia,\" state news reported. \nCoastal Latakia province is a stronghold of President Bashar al-Assad and home to his ancestral village. \nThe reported aid delivery comes as Washington expressed concern about an alleged Russian military build-up in Syria. \nUS officials say Russia has sent ships, armoured personnel carriers and naval infantry to the country in recent weeks. \nAnd on Friday, Cypriot officials said Russia had issued an alert for Cyprus to divert aircraft next week because it is planning military exercises off Syria's coast. \nAlso Friday, US President Barack Obama said Russia's decision to send military advisors and equipment to bolster Assad was only extending a strategy \"doomed to failure.\" \n\"The strategy that they are pursuing right now, doubling down on Assad, I think is a big mistake,\" Obama said. \nMoscow and Syria have denied any Russian military build-up, but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Thursday that Damascus would receive additional help if it requested it. \n\"We helped, are continuing to help and will help the Syrian government when it comes to supplying the Syrian army with everything it needs,\" he said. \n\"Russia is sending planes to Syria with both military equipment in accordance with current contracts and humanitarian aid,\" he said. \n\"Russia is not taking any additional steps.\" \nMoscow has been a staunch ally of the Assad government throughout the uprising that began in March 2011 and later descended into a civil war. \nIt maintains a naval base in Tartus province, south of Latakia province. \nSyrian media has reported Russian deliveries of humanitarian aid sporadically throughout the conflict, but Saturday's report follows specific claims about a Russian military build-up. \nUS officials this week said two tank-landing ships had arrived recently at the Tartus base, but most of the apparent build-up was focused on the Bassil al-Assad airport. \nThey said at least four transport flights had arrived in recent days, with dozens of Russian naval infantry also coming in. \nRussia has also reportedly installed temporary housing sufficient for \"hundreds of people\" at the airport, along with portable air traffic control equipment. \nMore than 240,000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began, with Assad's government losing increasingly large parts of the territory to rebels or jihadist forces like the Islamic State group. \nThe regime has relied for support on a few staunch allies, particularly Russia and Iran. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T08:19:55.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
