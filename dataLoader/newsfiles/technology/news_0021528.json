Unlike mainframes of yore, these sensors will need to be highly specialized, and be able to operate on very low energy. \nManufacturing processes, data analytics and chip-level security will also be crucial areas of research and development. \nThe report was released Sept. 1, but its contents are based on a March 2015 NSF workshop. \nThe report calls for “a targeted and coordinated government initiative”– the “National Computing and Insight Technologies Ecosystem”– to support the semiconductor industry’s attempts to upgrade. \nVerbatim : “[P]roduct-driven investment by the private sector alone is not sufficient to create the significant advances in IT infrastructure and insight technologies needed for these innovations. Private-sector research and development must build upon and connect to government-funded programs.” About the Author \nZach Noble is a staff writer covering cloud, big data and workforce issues.
