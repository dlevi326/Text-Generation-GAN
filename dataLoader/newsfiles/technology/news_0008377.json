Photo: AP\nThe revamped Apple TV's big party trick is access to the new Apple TV App Store where you'll find apps optimised for the big screen – similar to the Android TV corner of the Google Play store . While it's frustrating that you can't load up just any iOS app on the Apple TV, it's an understandable precaution if you've ever struggled with stock-standard Android on a television.\nAdvertisement The new Apple TV's lack of Ultra HD video streaming will disappoint those looking for the ultimate home entertainment device, but it was never a certainty considering that Apple doesn't offer Ultra HD content.\nIt remains to be seen whether the hardware is capable of supporting Ultra HD further down the track when Apple launches its own subscription video service to rival the likes of Netflix. Thankfully the new Apple TV supports 801.11ac Wi-Fi for faster video streaming. You'll find an HDMI 1.4 port on the back, which can handle Ultra HD content but not the extra demands of High Dynamic Range (HDR) video.\nClick for more photos Apple unveils new iPhone 6s, iPad Pro, iPad mini 4, Apple TV and Apple Watch designs On Thursday Apple unveiled a bunch of new products and demonstrated new functionality in its devices. Photo: AP\nThe optical digital audio output has gone, which will frustrate people with older home entertainment gear.\nSiri's arrival in the lounge room will appeal to people who can't be bothered reaching for the remote control, or who pine for a QWERTY keyboard when searching for content. Just like on an iGadget you can speak to Siri using natural language commands. She can also search for content across services – a bit like what you already see on the Xbox One – but you can give Siri less specific commands, such as \"Find the best funny movies from the 80s\".\nApple users who currently ignore Siri on their iGadgets may find her little more than a novelty in the lounge room. More exciting is the potential to break out of the Apple ecosystem with access to great third-party home entertainment apps like VLC for playing practically any file format, Plex for streaming video around your home and Flixster for watching your UltraViolet movie s.\nUntil now Apple has ruled the Apple TV with an iron fist and it will be interesting to see whether it stands in the way of apps like Plex coming to the lounge room. The new Apple TV also sees the return of user-accessible onboard storage, a handy feature which was scrapped after the original Apple TV . Its return could see the Apple TV act as the heart of a multi-room audio system, as well as let third-party apps access content stored on the hard drive.\nSupport for Plex alone would certainly sell a lot of boxes but, in the short-term, the new Apple TV seems less designed to encourage entertainment fans to upgrade and more designed to win over new users with its gaming credentials.\nBlessed with Apple's A8 processor, support for Metal high-end graphics and a new controller, the upgraded Apple TV has the potential to be a decent gaming platform with multi-player support.\nLike any gaming system, the quality and range of games will make or break the new Apple TV. Apple already has a huge gaming developer base, so it's likely to focus on iOS originals rather than porting existing high-profile console titles to the Apple platform. Don't expect to see support for Valve's Steam platform, as Apple wants to be the Steam of casual gaming (Steam is developing its own set-top box).\nThe new touch-friendly remote control isn't a shrunk down iPhone, which could have been too fragile to survive the rough and tumble of the lounge room. It's just a revamp of the original remote, with a trackpad in place of the five-way rocker for navigating the menus, along with extra buttons such as volume controls. Apple has wisely retained the infrared transmitter, as a switch to Bluetooth could prove troublesome in some lounge rooms (reliance on a Bluetooth remote is a key contributor to the Foxtel iQ3 woes ).\nThe remote charges using the supplied Lightning connector, promising a three-month battery life. There's a built-in microphone for talking to Siri, so you can whisper in her ear rather than shout across the room to interact with your television.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/apple-announces-iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-new-apple-tv-and-ipad-pro-20150909-gjj1f6.html", "http://images.smh.com.au/2013/02/13/4028104/fashweek9_1024-620x414.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-10T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T23:05:15.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
