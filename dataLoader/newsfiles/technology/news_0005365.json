It is designed to enable real-time device positioning and navigation of MediGuide enabled tools (equipped with MediGuide electromagnetic sensors) used in vascular or cardiac interventions in the catheterization laboratory environment on both live and pre-recorded fluoroscopy. Athens Regional's new technology an investment into 'public safety' By Ed Morales published Sunday, September 13, 2015 close \nWhen dealing with medical matters of the heart, taking pictures of the organ means X-rays, and X-rays mean radiation. \nRadiation for the patient, radiation for the doctor, radiation for the nurses and staff. \nBut what if there was technology that essentially took the radiation away? \nTurns out there is, and today the device gets its first day of work at Athens Regional Medical Center. \nThe hospital is first in northeast Georgia to employ the innovative MediGuide Technology for cardiac procedures, a medical solution which allows doctors to use pre-recorded X-ray images instead of constant live X-rays to perform complicated procedures. To put it in simple terms — an initial X-ray is taken instead of a series of X-rays, a practice that can cut radiation exposure by as much as 86 percent. \n“We know that a continuous X-ray has some health concerns — cumulative exposure to radiation has potential long-term outcomes,” said Dr. David Woodard, an electrophysiologist at Athens Regional Cardiology. “The American Heart Association estimated that between 1980 and 2006 the U.S. population (exposed) to medical radiation increased 600 percent. So it’s a real issue and it’s going to be an issue in the future. \n“This new lab will allow us to perform the procedures that have the highest radiation exposure and cut that by 86 percent. We’ll be one of 15 in the country that offers this. We’ll be the leader in this area.” \nDuring a gauze cutting ceremony last week at ARMC, the lab was opened up for everyone to see. Woodard explained how the technology works similarly like a global positioning system, allowing doctors to see the exact location inside the heart with the use of sensors placed in the devices. Procedures using the technology include patients who have atrial fibrillation — an irregular or rapid heart rate which can cause poor blood flow to the body — or those needing a pacemaker implementation. \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 2.7 million to 6.1 million people in the United States have AFib. \n“We can tell our patients that we can do these procedures safer than elsewhere,” Woodard said. “This was an investment by Athens Regional directly into patient safety. \n“Our goal was the be able to be able to provide the best level of care for our patients in this area,” Woodward added. “If somebody could get a better outcome somewhere else, we’d send them there, so we didn’t do anything here that we couldn’t put on par with the best centers in the country.” \nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
