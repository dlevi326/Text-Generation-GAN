The online video destination, which is owned by ABC, Fox and NBC, does offer free content with limited advertisements, but the paid monthly subscription gains access to additional TV episodes and full seasons of TV series — and viewing on more devices -- in addition to movies.\nJennifer Lawrence, as 'Katniss Everdeen' in a scene from the motion picture \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1.\" (Photo: Murray Close, Lionsgate)\n“Hulu already offers some of the best and biggest titles in television programming, but our subscribers have been asking us for more, and more recent, big movies. We listened. Through this new deal with Epix, we are proud to now be able to offer a huge selection of the biggest blockbusters and premium films,” said Craig Erwich, Hulu senior vice president and head of content, in a statement as part of the deal's announcement on Hulu's official blog . “This is a landmark deal for Hulu and it marks a huge expansion for our offering of premium programming.”\nAdded Epix CEO and president Mark Greenberg: “Hulu has become one of the most popular premium streaming services and Epix’s agreement is evidence of their understanding of the value that our blockbuster Hollywood films, deep library of classic film titles and original programming brings to consumers.\nThe new beginning for Epix -- a joint venture between Viacom, Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios and Lionsgate -- with Hulu comes as its deal with Netflix enters its last month. Netflix notified subscribers on Sunday that Epix's content would be disappearing at the end of September.\nUSA TODAY\nNetflix plans for future without movies from Epix\nMeanwhile, back in February, Epix extended its agreement with Amazon to continue making its new releases, classic films and other content to the online retailer's Prime Instant Video service. Those who subscribe to Amazon Prime ($99 annually) get unlimited streaming of TV and movies in addition to free shipping and other benefits .\nHulu has recently been bolstering its catalog. An exclusive deal to stream all episodes of Seinfeld began in June and an agreement with AMC will make it the exclusive streaming home of Fear the Walking Dead . Hulu is also the exclusive streaming home to hundreds of classic, award-winning films from The Criterion Collection.\nHulu also is stepping up its original content. Upcoming shows include 11/22/63 , which is based on the Stephen King thriller, with executive producers including King and J.J. Abrams and starring James Franco.\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider\n4 CONNECT 21 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1Fd8ne0 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/635766285392726286-hulu-empire.jpg", "http://www.hulu.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/635766287049612907-XXX-HUNGER-GAMES-MOCKINGJAY-PART-1-MOV-JY-1215-69792974.JPG", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200444160", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b15fc3375736baeeff23d26ddf1049f3683dd7dc/c=0-183-3600-2217&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/08/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635765467053029059-REVIEW-HUNGER-GAMES-CATCHING-FIRE-112113-59853838.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Fd8ne0&mini=true", "http://blog.hulu.com/2015/08/30/hulu-and-epix-announce-extensive-multi-year-agreement/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4010a7dfa1a6804a933a57e63b9008e787aa4145/c=371-0-3563-2400&r=x383&c=540x380/local/-/media/2015/08/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/635766287049612907-XXX-HUNGER-GAMES-MOCKINGJAY-PART-1-MOV-JY-1215-69792974.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1Fd8ne0", "https://twitter.com/MikeSnider", "http://www.epixhd.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f34bc523d544325720e1b8e2f28896950f837dc5/c=3-0-2046-1536&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/08/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/635766285392726286-hulu-empire.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Fd8ne0&text=Epix%20headed%20to%20Hulu%20with%20Netflix%20deal%20ending%20in%20September&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-08-31T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T13:00:48.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
