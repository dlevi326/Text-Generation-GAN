Some analysts warn that the tactic risks eroding corporate financial health by diverting cash that can be used to fund debt repayments and make investments that can boost corporate earnings power over time.\nThe deals have helped fuel a deluge of debt issuance that has pushed U.S. corporate-bond sales to the highest levels on record, with companies selling $1.2 trillion in the U.S. market so far this year, according to figures from data provider Dealogic.\nShare buybacks and dividends also are at elevated levels. Over the past four quarters, companies have spent $924 billion, the most on record for a 12-month period.\nIn the second quarter of this year, S&P 500 companies spent $226 billion on buybacks and dividends, the fifth-highest quarterly amount on record, according to estimates from S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nQualcomm in March announced a $15 billion share repurchase program. Microsoft had $21.9 billion remaining on its buyback program as of June 30 and Oracle had $6.2 billion remaining as of Aug. 31, according to regulatory filings. A Microsoft representative had no immediate comment, and Qualcomm and Oracle declined to comment.\nActivist investors have agitated for buybacks, contending companies are wasting too much money and should be returning it to shareholders. Share repurchases has even caught the attention of Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton, who has called for greater disclosure of buybacks amid concerns that they come at the expense of longer-term investment.\nSome bond investors now are growing wary. They say the debt binge is weakening corporate balance sheets, which could lead to credit-rating downgrades, hurt bond prices and make it more difficult for companies to pay down their debt in the future. Debt investors dislike debt-funded buybacks because they say companies are effectively transferring capital from bondholders to shareholders, increasing leverage without investing to expand the business.\n\"We're certainly going to be more cautious or shy away from issuers that are using debt markets to fund share buybacks,\" said Henry Peabody, co-portfolio manager of the $1.3 billion Eaton Vance Bond Fund. \"In a sense, the bond market is financing equity-market returns.\"\nIt isn't clear exactly how many bonds have been sold to pay for share repurchases, because companies can be vague or list multiple uses for how they plan to spend bond proceeds. But analysts say years of low interest rates have made the debt markets look especially attractive for corporate treasurers. And despite their concerns, bond investors so far have snapped up the deals, as they look for securities that pay higher interest than what is available on safe-government debt.\nWrite to Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.com\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n 21, 2015 18:25 ET (22:25 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T15:24:31.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
