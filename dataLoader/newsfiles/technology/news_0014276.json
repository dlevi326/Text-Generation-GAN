RELATED NEW DELHI: Uber is getting close to launching its big bet on same-day package delivery, according to a report from Re/code. The programme would partner stores and fashion brands to deliver via an Uber driver. It will likely launch in New York City and may come to San Francisco as well, according to the report from Re/code. Uber already has the drivers rolling in circles around cities, so it makes sense to have them also grab items and drop them off. In April, Uber had already released an Uber Merchant Program employee manual, which was obtained by TechCrunch, that indicated that this expanded programme means that drivers will be able to multitask and haul packages and passengers at the same time. Uber has been toying around with delivery now for years. Its UberEats programme delivers food from select restaurants in cities like Chicago, New York, and San Francisco. It's even played around in the package-delivery space with its Uber Rush programme, which deploys bike messengers. This big bet from Uber will likely start with luxury goods and flashy retailers, mirroring Uber's origins. The ride-hailing company originally started as a black-car limo service -- a luxury for most -- before it added in other types or ride options, like UberX. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Uber Rush programme,Uber Merchant Program,Uber,TechCrunch Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T14:29:45.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
