it is half the width of the United States - and the smallest and furthest planet from the Sun.\nNASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute Welcome to the dark side: the sun illuminates Pluto's haze layers in a photo taken from 480,000 miles away\nNow photos taken by the New Horizons interplanetary space probe appear to show a mountainous landscape, covered by ice flows that link networks of valleys and even show dunes.\nThe images which were beamed back to the agency from millions of miles away offer up never before seen close ups of the icy plain Sputnik Planum , the smooth, bright region across the centre.\nNASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute Breakthrough: the 300-mile wide broken ice covered terrain is called Sputnik Planum\nAccording to scientists, Pluto is the only known dwarf planet with an atmosphere and while it's very thin - it would be toxic for humans to breathe - because it is made up of nitrogen, carbon monoxide and methane.\nNASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute Wide angle: this 220-mile view shows the incredible diversity of the surface and geological landforms\nWhen it is closest to the sun, Pluto's atmosphere turns to gas but in these photos it appears to be 'aphelion' or farthest from the sun and its atmosphere is frozen and falls like snow.\nA major breakthrough, these images will give scientists new opportunities to understand the machinations of the tiny planet, which was named by a nine year old schoolgirl from Oxford 85-years-ago.\nPluto spins in the opposite direction as Earth , which means the sun rises in the west and sets in the east and it takes six days, nine hours, and 17 minutes to spin once - making it the planet with the second-slowest rotation in the solar system.\nNASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute New Horizons: Pluto's bright, high-altitude atmospheric haze produces a twilight before sunset and after sunrise\n\"Pluto is showing us a diversity of landforms and complexity of processes that rival anything we've seen in the solar system,\" said New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern, according to NASA .\n\"If an artist had painted this Pluto before our flyby, I probably would have called it over the top â€” but that's what is actually there.\"\nThe latest views are based on high-resolution images from NASA's New Horizons spacecraft and show what the surface of the planet would look like from 1,100 miles away.\nThe space agency say: \"New Horizons began its yearlong download of new images and other data over the Labor Day weekend.\n\"Images downlinked in the past few days have more than doubled the amount of Pluto's surface seen at resolutions as good as 400 meters (440 yards) per pixel.\n\"They reveal new features as diverse as possible dunes, nitrogen ice flows that apparently oozed out of mountainous regions onto plains, and even networks of valleys that may have been carved by material flowing over Pluto's surface.\n\"They also show large regions that display chaotically jumbled mountains reminiscent of disrupted terrains on Jupiter's icy moon Europa.\n\"'The surface of Pluto is every bit as complex as that of Mars,' said Jeff Moore, leader of the New Horizons Geology, Geophysics and Imaging (GGI) team at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California .\n\"The randomly jumbled mountains might be huge blocks of hard water ice floating within a vast, denser, softer deposit of frozen nitrogen within the region informally named Sputnik Planum.\"\nIn July scientists revealed amazing new photos of the planet as New Horizons continues its mega journey across the universe .\nIt was launched on January 19, 2006 and will have travelled more than 3 billion miles on its journey to Pluto, its largest moon, Charon , and the Kuiper Belt beyond.\nVideo loading Watch next Watch this video again Watch Next\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/v1/unsecured/media/4221396001/201507/79/4221396001_4373141977001_PLUTO1.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-09-11T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T19:11:37.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
