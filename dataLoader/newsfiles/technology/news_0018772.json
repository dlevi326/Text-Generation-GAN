RTI Media’s products are used throughout a wide range of industries, including the hospitality, health care, financial services and transportation markets. Under the agreement, EarthBend will distribute two core RTI Media solutions to its partner network—the SH-1 On Hold Player and Time & Temperature (T&T) Wakeup.\nThe SH-1 On Hold Player plays a standard MP3 file from a microSD card, the same card used in most cellphones, and comes pre-equipped with 20 minutes of licensed, business-appropriate music. The plug-and-play device, which includes the microSD card, power supply and hookup cable, can be used to play music only or an easily installed custom on hold recording.\nT&T Wakeup enables a hotel to place a weather forecast speed dial button on guest room phones. A guest using the feature will hear the time, temperature, weather forecast and a brief promotional message for the hotel. Additionally, the solution serves as a wakeup announcer, providing the time, temperature and weather forecast to a guest receiving a wakeup call. The wakeup content complies with InterContinental Hotels Group and Marriott Hotels guidelines. T&T Wakeup leverages cloud-based applications to distribute real-time weather data to the premises-based announcer device, and incorporates natural human speech paired with high-quality audio delivery.\n“EarthBend’s distribution partnership with RTI provides our channel partners with two innovative technology offerings that affordably and intelligently address practical needs in the marketplace,” said Ryan Donovan, EarthBend's general manager and vice president of sales and service. “Our resellers can position the cost-effective SH-1 player to their existing customer base and as a complementary accompaniment to new system installations. The T&T Wakeup solution, which offers interoperability with phone systems from Mitel, PhoneSuite and others, is the perfect fit for our many partners heavily focused on the hospitality market.”\n“We were drawn to EarthBend as a distribution partner because of their commitment to offering channel partners best-in-class, innovative technologies. We look forward to expanding the availability of our unique products, while at the same time providing the EarthBend network of resellers with additional opportunities for revenue growth,” said Bruce Robertson, president of RTI Media.\nAbout EarthBend:\nEarthBend has been distributing telephony peripherals and IT solutions to a vast group of telecommunication resellers since 1993.
