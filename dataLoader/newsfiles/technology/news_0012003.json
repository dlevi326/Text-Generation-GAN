Last month it overturned a ban on 857 porn sites after widespread ridicule.\n\"It is too early to judge (the progress of Digital India). So far it's largely hype and wishful thinking,\" Stanford's Wadhwa said.\nTechnology firms have also suffered problems, with Google under investigation by India's competition regulator and a Facebook project, Internet.org, criticised for only allowing selective web access.\nIn addition, about 70 percent of Indian Internet users get online via a smartphone, many on sluggish 2G connections, creating a unique challenge.\n\"Silicon Valley had better adapt and innovate for that market or lose,\" an insider at one major US technology company said.\n- 'Investment flowing' -US investors have paid relatively scant attention to Indian start-ups in the past, but entrepreneurs on the ground say this is changing.\n\"Since the prime minister has taken over there's already a lot more investment that has been flowing into the country,\" said Prukalpa Sankar, co-founder of SocialCops, which uses data to tackle social problems.\nHer two-year-old company has already drawn funding from Google India's managing director and is taking part in the visit to gain exposure.\n\"Indian entrepreneurs are excited at being taken seriously perhaps for the first time,\" Geetika Dayal, executive director of The Indus Entrepreneurs network in Delhi, told AFP.\nEntrepreneurs from India far outnumber all other immigrant groups at the helm of US startups, data from the Kauffman Foundation shows, and a Modi-led reception for the diaspora in San Jose has seen 45,000 people sign up.\nAlthough Indians have long thrived in the Valley, observers point to a so-called reverse brain drain as a steady flow of American-educated entrepreneurs return home.\n\"There are opportunities here in India and they don't want to miss the boat,\" said Rajat Tandon, vice president of NASSCOM.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T14:12:23.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
