The MLPs can be deployed in wide range of operations, including humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, counter-piracy, maritime security, amphibious and other combat missions. \"In April 2011, the US Navy placed a contract with General Dynamics National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) for the detailed design and construction of two MLP ships.\" \nIn April 2011, the US Navy placed a contract with General Dynamics National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) for the detailed design and construction of two MLP ships. \nIn May 2011, General Dynamics NASSCO was awarded a $744m modification contract by the US Navy for the construction of the first two MLP vessels. \nThe US Navy Strategic and Theatre Sealift programme in the Programme Executive Office (PEO), Ships is responsible for the procurement of the MLP ships. The three MLP ships were named USNS Montford Point, USNS John Glenn and USNS Lewis B Puller, in January 2012. \nThe US Navy plans to procure a total of five MLP vessels by 2017. The first two ships are in service with the Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) squadrons, whereas the next three will serve as the Afloat Forward Staging Base (AFSB) vessels. MLP design features LSD Whidbey Island / Harpers Ferry Class Dock Landing Ships, United States of America \nThe Whidbey Island Class and the Harpers Ferry Class are dock landing ships which support amphibious operations including the landing of forces onto hostile shores. \nThe MLP concept was tested through a series of at-sea trials by the US Navy. A surrogate MLP ship and a roll-on/roll-off vessel were used in exercises to demonstrate the ability in high sea states. \nThe design of the MLP is based on the Alaska Class tanker. The base design incorporates core capability set accommodating vehicle scaffolding area, vehicle transfer ramp, skin to skin fenders and lanes for three landing craft air cushions (LCACs). \nThe MLP ships will have a length of 239m, beam of 50m and a design draft of 12m. The full load displacement of the vessel will be 80,000t. Each MLP will be manned by a crew of 34 personnel from Military Sealift Command (MSC). \nThe MLP ships will allow the transfer of vehicles and equipment from large medium-speed roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) and joint high-speed vessel (JHSV) to shore through LCACs in Sea State 3 conditions. The mobile landing platforms will allow the amphibious operations in the absence of ports. The ships will be equipped with a mission deck and float-off (FLO/FLO) technology, allowing loading and unloading of the floating cargo. \nThe ship will have storage tanks for 100,000gal of potable water and 590,000gal of JP5 fuel. The mission deck can accept future platform upgrades, including command and control, vehicle transfer system, cranage, accommodation module, medical facilities and a helicopter landing spot. \nThe AFSB variant features a 52,000ftÂ² of flight deck, equipment and fuel storage, berthing and repair spaces, and can accommodate up to 250 personnel. \"The MLP ships will have a length of 239m, beam of 50m and a design draft of 12m.\" Construction of MLP \nThe construction on the first ship in class, USNS Montford Point (MLP-1), began at NASSCO shipyard in San Diego in June 2011. The keel was laid for the MLP-1 in January 2012. The final block comprising exhaust stacks was installed in August 2012. \nThe final structural welds were completed and inspected by the American Bureau of Shipping and the Navy. The construction of the first MLP was completed in September 2012. The fabrication process on the second ship began in April 2012. Each ship will be installed with core capability set (CCS) modules after delivery from NASSCO. \nThe USNS Montford Point (MLP-1) was delivered in May 2013. The ship will achieve initial operational capability (IOC) in 2015. \nThe second ship in class, USNS John Glenn (MLP-2), was launched in September 2013 and completed builder's sea trials in January 2014. It was delivered to the US Navy in March 2014. \nThe US Navy placed a detailed design and construction contract for MLP 3, the third ship, in February 2012. The keel for the MLP-3 was laid in November 2013, the christening ceremony was held in February 2015 and the vessel was delivered in June 2015. A request for proposal (RFP) was issued for the core capability set (CCS) for the MLP in March 2012. \nNASSCO was awarded a $498m contract by the US Navy for the detailed design and construction of fourth MLP in December 2014. Construction is scheduled to begin in the last quarter of 2015 and will be complete in March 2018. Propulsion \nThe MLP ships will be powered by twin-screw, diesel-electric propulsion system integrating four MAN/B&W medium-speed diesel engines, 24MW diesel electric plant, and 2MW azimuthing bow thruster. The propulsion system provides a sustained speed of 15k and an endurance of more than 9,500nmi at 15k speed. \nIn August 2011, Converteam was awarded a contract by General Dynamics NASSCO to supply propulsion, electric power, generators and automation system for the MLP programme. \nThe Global Naval Surface Combatants and Warfare Systems Market 2011-2021 \nThis project forms part of our recent analysis and forecasts of the global naval surface combatants and warfare systems market available from our business information platform Strategic Defence Intelligence.
