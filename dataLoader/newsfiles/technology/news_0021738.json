Embrionix will demonstrate the new SMPTE 2022-6 SFP gateway for broadcast video applications at the IBC Show, September 11-15, 2015 at booth 6.B02, showcasing the flexibility and power of the latest emSFP platforms. In addition, Embrionix’s selected customers will showcase the integration of such SFP in SDI products equipped with an SFP cage. “The SMPTE 2022-6 SFP is a breakthrough in miniaturization, which the broadcast and networking industries can greatly benefit from,” said Sarkis Abrahamian, VP of Business Development at Embrionix. “Embrionix has focused its expertise and development to release the industry’s smallest SMPTE 2022-6 in a footprint of 1cm x 3cm. This is a first in SFP technology history, as well as a first in our industry. This SMPTE 2022-6 gateway can be used inside SDI products or inside COTS IP switches. The release of the SMPTE 2022-6 marks the direction we are heading towards: more processing and more flexibility maintained in the SFP and SFP+ form factor,” added Abrahamian.\nThe new SMPTE 2022-6 are aimed at broadcast manufacturers who are designing and selling IP switches, SDI video routers, SDI processing cards and computer processing cards. They are also developed with the broadcasters in mind to simplify their IP studio deployments using their existing equipment as the host to these new SFPs.\n“Our customers can get ahead of their competition by using our SMPTE 2022-6 and J2K SFPs to get their products to market faster and be completely SMPTE compliant right out of the gate,” said Renaud Lavoie, CEO of Embrionix. Broadcasters can now integrate this technology into all of their current SDI and IP products without a major cost investment.\nEmbrionix is showcasing its new SMPTE 2022-6 SFP+ technology in hall 6, IBC booth B02. As well, Embrionix will have a presence in more than 50 booths at IBC this year, demonstrating the flexibility and possibilities around SFP and emSFP modules.
