Computers hold a frightening amount of our personal information that is can be easily accessible to cyber hackers. Luckily, there are a few very simple steps one can take to secure his or her computer. \nPasswords \nWhether it is social media, banking, or simply unlocking the computer entirely, almost everything you do on your computer requires a login username and/or password. People might think they are secure as long as they have everything password protected but that is not always the case. Many people still use extremely simple and predictable passwords, like \"password1\", that hackers can guess immediately. To avoid this, make all the passwords you use on your computer long and complex. This might seem like a hassle but it will seriously enhance your password security. \nSoftware Updates \nSoftware updates can seem unnecessary and annoying most of the time, however they can actually help the security on your computer. A lot of software updates usually include fixes to security vulnerabilities. \nHttps vs. http \nMany people don't know that the additional letter \"s\" at the end of \"http\" in web addresses can block hackers from invading your computer through the Internet. A lot of sites already have \"https\", but some don't and it is in your best interest to avoid them. \"Https\" means that your connection to that site is encrypted so no one can see what you're sending or receiving. \nBeau Dietl & Associates is a premier private investigation company based in New York City with offices in New Jersey, Florida and California. With more than 30 years of service in the private investigations and security sector, our company differentiates itself from others by one word--experience. \nOur goal is to provide the most comprehensive and thorough investigations, along with personalized service to exceed clients' needs. As an internationally recognized firm, Beau Dietl & Associates maintains a global network of investigative and security-based resources. \nBDA has been retained by countless law firms throughout the country, and has assisted these firms and their clients in a variety of cases including asset searches, lifestyle profiles, matrimonial disputes, process service, interviews, witness location and more.
