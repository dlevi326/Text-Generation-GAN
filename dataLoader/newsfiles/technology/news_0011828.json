It incorporates Horibaâ€™s proprietary, compact interferometer, which is said to offer high performance and accuracy. The system complies with NH3 testing requirements of Euro VI, the EU regulation for heavy duty emissions testing.\nHoriba will also be showcasing its new onboard PM measurement system, the OBS-ONE-PM. The system collects particulate matter on a filter paper using a partial flow gravimetric sampling method, while simultaneously measuring real time PM. It uses a venturi flow meter which enables reliable proportional sampling and accurate exhaust gas flow measurement under transient flow conditions.\nVisit Horiba at booth 1040 at the Automotive Testing Expo China, which takes place September 15-17 at The Shanghai Everbright Conference and Exhibition Center, Shanghai, China.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/web-5_-Horiba_MEXA-ONE-FT_picture.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T17:45:29.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
