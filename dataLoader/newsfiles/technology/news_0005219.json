No deaths have been reported.\nAuthorities in Pingdingshan city said in an online statement that about 300kg of ammonia leaked for 15 minutes after a pipeline at a local coal plant ruptured, poisoning villagers near the factory.\nPhotos by local media show white fog-like gas shrouding what appear to be factory grounds. Local authorities said no ammonia was detected in the air nearly three hours after the leak.\nWorkplace safety hazards abound in China. In August, a hazmat warehouse caught fire and exploded in the northern port city of Tianjin, killing 165 and leaving 8 missing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T12:05:21.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
