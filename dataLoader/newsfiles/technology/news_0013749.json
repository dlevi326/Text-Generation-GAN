Gov. Bobby Jindal's Bid to Block Common Core \nEducation Week: A federal judge has rejected Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's quest to get the Common Core State Standards blocked on a national basis, stating in her rejection of the governor's quest for a preliminary injunction on Wednesday that the standards don't represent an improper intrusion into education by Washington.In a lawsuit filed last year, Jindal, a Republican, claimed that the U.S. Department of Education illegally used the Race to the Top grant program to coerce states to adopt the standards. The governor also said in his suit that the standards were part of an illegal attempt by the federal government to intrude into classroom instruction, and that states faced punishment under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act if they tried to drop the standards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:41:18.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
