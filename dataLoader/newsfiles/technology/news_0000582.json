Some banks have exited or drastically reduced their participation in parts of the bond trading business as a result.\nEver since, a chorus of investors have complained about having to pay more to transact, and that trades can no longer be completed as easily in large sizes, without moving market prices.\nMr Dudley's remarks come as Federal Reserve officials, himself included, are signaling that they are close to raising short-term interest rates for the first time in nine years. Low rates have delivered strong returns for bondholders for three decades in a row, but when rates rise, existing bonds are expected to become less attractive because new bonds can be issued in their place at higher yields.\nSome worry large scale selling by investors could trigger turmoil in bond funds, one that would be harder to cushion than in previous years because of many of the ways the financial system and dealer banks have changed since the rules came into effect.\nMr Dudley said the Fed's \"unconventional monetary policy may have affected recent measures of liquidity in ways that could make it more difficult to clearly discern any potential changes,\" adding that if that were the case, \"a clearer picture on liquidity conditions may only emerge as monetary policy is normalised.\"\nThe changing behavior of banks, coupled with a rise in electronic trading in bonds, have driven faster, less predictable moves in bonds. Analysts say trade sizes are shrinking and large trades are becoming more difficult to conduct in reasonable time-frames.\nResearchers at the New York Fed have concluded that liquidity is adequate from day to day; the problem is more evident when traders begin to worry about losing their capacity to buy and sell with ease at a future point in time, a concept they have called \"liquidity risk.\"\n\"There is limited evidence pointing to a reduction in the average levels of liquidity. However, there are reasons to think liquidity risk may have increased, and there are some data to support this conjecture,\" said Mr Dudley. \"If liquidity risk is high, this means that there is a substantial risk that the price received could be at a greater concession to the prior trade than anticipated.\"\nRegulators are still learning what the growth in electronic trading and activity by high-speed traders will mean, said Mr Dudley. But they have been collecting data and considering what additional steps they need to take, including which additional data feeds should be more readily available to them for a faster response to market upsets in future.\nMr Dudley conceded that so far regulators have primarily looked at data only from trades between securities dealers, instead of trades between dealers and their customers.\nHe said that since the Oct. 15, 2014 flash rally in Treasury prices, when yields plummeted within minutes before recovering, price action in the $12.7 trillion US Treasury market had changed, \"indicating some deterioration of liquidity, but [that the condition] is still not high relative to its longer-run experience.\"\n\"Only through much more careful study and data analysis can we thoughtfully address the two most important questions -- not whether regulation should be rolled back in order to return to the liquidity conditions prior to the financial crisis, but instead\" whether there is an increase of liquidity risk, Mr Dudley said. He added that it would be worth exploring \"whether financial market regulation could be altered in a way that improves the balance between the benefits of tougher regulation in terms of enhanced financial stability versus the costs of such regulation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:00:23.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
