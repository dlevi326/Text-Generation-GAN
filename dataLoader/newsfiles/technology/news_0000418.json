As a result, PCI has become a de facto security standard for protecting data within the Financial Services industry and even beyond. Altiscale's PCI compliance provides assurance that all sensitive data will be protected according to the same strict standards required for cardholder data, and allows customers who require PCI compliance as a matter of policy to use the Altiscale Data Cloud. \nTo learn more about PCI standards and Altiscale's compliance, visit here . \nHIPAA Compliance: Organizations that handle patient medical data are subject to strict legal requirements to protect the confidentiality of that information. Altiscale's compliance with HIPAA standards enables such organizations to store, process, and analyze that data at Altiscale. Additionally, Altiscale is now able to sign Business Associate Agreements (BAA) with customers subject to HIPAA and HITECH requirements. \nTo learn more about how Altiscale is enabling organizations to protect patient data according the requirements of HIPAA and HITECH, visit: here . \nSOC 2 Compliance: Version two of the Service Organization Controls standard -- known as SOC 2 -- is a widely respected set of criteria for protecting information published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). All of Altiscale's services have been certified to meet the AICPA SOC 2 Trust Service Principles criteria for Security and Availability. This certification indicates that Altiscale has undergone an in-depth examination of the controls covering its systems, processes and policies.
