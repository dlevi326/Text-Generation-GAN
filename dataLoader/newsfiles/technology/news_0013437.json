(TICC).\nAnheuser-Busch InBev NV on Wednesday said it had approached SABMiller PLC about a takeover, paving the way for a deal that would likely value SABMiller well in excess of its $75 billion market capitalization and create a brewing giant that would dominate much of the global beer market. Anheuser-Busch InBev shares were trading up 5.97% at $114.49 in premarket trading.\nRobotics systems company Adept Technology Inc. said Wednesday that it would be acquired by Japanese automation firm Omron Corp. for about $195 million, a 63% premium over Tuesday's closing price. Adept shares rose 62% to $12.92 premarket.\nThe speciality lending arm of private-equity firm TPG (TSLX) took its $450 million offer for investment firm TICC Capital Corp. public on Wednesday, after being rebuffed a day earlier. TICC Capital shares rose 11.8% to $7.01 premarket.\nB/E Aerospace Inc. (BEAV) said Wednesday that it would cut around 450 jobs as part of a cost reduction program that would also close some of the company's facilities and consolidate certain product lines.\nAmgen Inc. (AMGN) struck a research and license agreement with Xencor Inc. (XNCR), a move aimed at expanding its immuno-oncology portfolio as the biotech faces increased competition from copycat drugs.\nAscena Retail Group Inc. (ASNA), which recently closed on its deal to buy Ann Inc., swung to a loss in its July quarter amid a big writedown on its Lane Bryant brand and tumbling sales at its Justice brand.\nChip maker Integrated Silicon Solution Inc. (ISSI) said Wednesday that the review period for its pending acquisition by a consortium of Chinese investors has been extended to a 45-day investigation period.\nCracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. (CBRL) reported Wednesday a better-than-expected 21% jump in quarterly earnings, helped by higher menu prices.\nHewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) outlined plans to cut another 25,000 to 30,000 workers as it prepares to split into two separate businesses, but the company signaled it was finally nearing the end of a brutal period of layoffs.\nWrite to Chris Wack at chris.wack@wsj.com\n 16, 2015 09:30 ET (13:30 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T03:15:46.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
