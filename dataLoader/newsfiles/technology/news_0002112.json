A NATII Steering Committee, with global participation, was formed and the Asia/Pacific Region was selected as a representative area of operations for the initiative.\nThe recommended Standard is expected to be adopted at the end of 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:29:05.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
