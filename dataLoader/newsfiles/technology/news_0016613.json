The Turkish leader discussed a number of bilateral and global issues with the Russian leader. \n\"The construction of Turkey's first nuclear power plant Akkuyu (four blocks, 1200 megawatt (MW) each, the forecasting commissioning date - year 2022),\" the materials read. \nIn 2010, Moscow and Ankara signed an agreement that a subsidiary of Russia's nuclear energy company Rosatom would build, own, and operate a power plant at the Akkuyu site in the southern Turkish province of Mersin. In 2013, Ankara commissioned Rosatom to implement the project, the cost of which is estimated at about $20 billion. Construction began in April 2015. \nThe Akkuyu will produce about 35 billion kilowatt-hours per year. The NPP is expected to generate electricity for about 60 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:57:44.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
