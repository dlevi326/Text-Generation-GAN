The crossover vehicle is Tesla's third model and will join the Model S on the market. The signature series Model X will cost in the low six-figure range for customers seeking a fully loaded, top-of-the-line experience.\nElon Musk Working on Snake-Like Charger for Tesla Cars\nNew Tesla Model S Features 'Autopilot' and Supercar-Like Acceleration\nElon Musk Offers a Tesla Happiness Guarantee\nWith the same options as a Model S, the new car will cost $5,000 more because of its size and body complexity, Musk tweeted. The base Model S starts at $70,000, not including any tax incentives that could be used at the federal and state level for electric vehicles.\nThe Model X is said to be able to seat seven people in three rows of seats, with the car having wing-like doors instead of opening from the sides. It's unclear what the final pricing will be for the vehicle, which was first announced in 2012, but it hasn't stopped Tesla devotees from putting down a deposit to reserve their Model X.\nGetting the delayed Model X to customers will help Tesla clear the way for its next project -- the lower cost Model 3. Musk revealed the electric car company will show off the look of the vehicle March and will begin taking pre-orders around that time.\nThe smaller sedan is expected to cost around $35,000 and will begin production in 2017.\nElon Musk Set to Hand Over First Tesla Model X \"\nParole Board Decides to Execute Georgia Woman \"\nHouse GOP Takes Issue With Planned Parenthood Chief's Salary \"\nRubio Strikes Back at Trump \"\nWoman Reunites With Nurse Who Cared for Her as Burned Infant \"\nCheck Out This 'Airline Angel's' In-Flight Gesture of Kindness \"\nHow Rosetta's Comet Got Its Rubber Duck Shape \"\nTom Hanks Gives Advice for a Long-Lasting Marriage \"\nJim Carrey Mourns 'Passing of My Sweet Cathriona' \"\nLawmakers Renew Push for Black Lung Benefit Reform \"\nObama, Raul Castro Sit for Historic Meeting \"\nBrakes Catch Fire During Plane’s Emergency Landing at JFK Fugitive Accused of Kidnapping Arrested After 24 Years \"\nObama Urges Muslims to Reject Those Who 'Distort Islam' \"\nWhat Drivers Should Know About Volkswagen, Audi 'Action Plan' Officials: Convicted Killer Mistakenly Released in Louisiana \"\nWhy The Taliban Takeover of Kunduz Matters \"\nUS Launches Air Strikes After Taliban Takes Over Afghan Town \"\nTrump Says He's Been 'Childish,' Has Fall Back Plan Police: 14-Year-Old Boy Charged in Mom's Death Acted Alone \"\nObama, Iran's Foreign Minister Shake Hands at UN Ralph Lauren Hands off CEO Role to Old Navy Executive \"\nYogi Berra Remembered at Funeral by Family, Sports Royalty \"\nMatt Damon Clarifies Comments About Actors' Sexuality \"\nWalmart Customers Can Now Order Groceries Online \"\nMother Finds Touching Note From Son Who Died After Infection \"\nScientist Discovers 'Glowing' Sea Turtle \"\n‘Super’-Sized Hilarious ‘Avengers’ Blooper Reel Released \"\nHayden Panettiere Opens Up About Post-Partum Depression", "external_links": ["https://s.abcnews.com/assets/js/merlin-ext.js?v=1.2", "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/beta/js/custom/pages/trident_story.js?v=36", "http://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.24.0.0000/amp.premier/amp.premier.min.js?v=2", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/js/merlin-core.js?v=1.2", "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/beta/js/abcn.js?v=36", "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/js/s_code_15.js?v=4", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Elon+Musk+Set+to+Hand+Over+First+Tesla+Model+X++-+ABC+News+-+http%3A%2F%2Fabcn.ws%2F1Re9dOt&via=ABC", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FTechnology%2Felon-musk-set-hand-tesla-model%2Fstory%3Fid%3D34127454", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/email/offer?url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/elon-musk-set-hand-tesla-model/story?id=34127454&title=Elon+Musk+Set+to+Hand+Over+First+Tesla+Model+X+"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T01:26:15.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
