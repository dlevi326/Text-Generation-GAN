The Malaysians got this one right when declaring it as being from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370); particularly since the flaperon has already been positively identified as being from a 777 aircraft.It’s true that French authorities haven’t yet signed off with 100% certainty that this barnacle-encrusted wing part actually originated from MH370. But it stretches credulity to even speculate that it could be from any other aircraft than the Malaysian 777-200 which disappeared while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 of last year.Loss of such a vital piece of a 777’s wing structure would hardly go unnoticed. Just because French investigators have yet to link the flaperon’s internal part numbers to a Boeing Spanish subcontractor doesn’t discount the logical conclusion that the flaperon originated from MH370.[caption id=\"attachment_45d1e8259eab4894bb592fbe87e88b1c\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Municipal workers search Reunion Island beaches where expected debris of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 could be washed up onto the shore near Saint-Andre,on the French Island of Reunion, Monday Aug. 10, 2015 .

But those still looking for this aircraft a year and a half on, need to assume the flaperon is actual debris from the missing airliner and use everything they can glean from this tantalizing piece of the wing structure to overhaul their search efforts.To that end, as reported by the U.K.’s Telegraph newspaper, German oceanographers at the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel note that new Indian Ocean drift modeling --- which takes into account the fact that the flaperon washed ashore on Reunion --- indicates that [tweet_Quote: display=\"the actual site of the 777’s water impact may be as much as 2000 miles farther north of the current search area.\"]the actual site of the 777’s water impact may be as much as 2000 miles farther north of the current search area.[/tweet_Quote: ]\n“Our results show that the current focus of the search south-west of Australia may be too far south,” said Jonathan Durgadoo, one of the researchers told The Telegraph .The legalities of not having ultimate proof that this debris originated from MH370 can be argued elsewhere, but for the families and friends of the 239 onboard as well as the flying public at large, it’s only prudent to assume that this is the real deal.
