(reaffirmed) the ECB would take the 'necessary' steps to enhance monetary stimulus in the face of the worldwide economic risks currently threatening the region's recovery,\" Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said, noting the guardedly positive economic outlook allowed European bourses to hold \"onto their morning gains with remarkable vigour as Wednesday continued.\"\nOn the corporate front, shares in auto giant Volkswagen rebounded by 5.2 per cent on the Frankfurt stock exchange, with investors apparently feeling CEO Mr Winterkorn's resignation may help the company turn a corner on the emissions scam scandal that has battered its stock prices.\nVolkswagen lost 35 per cent off the company's market value on Monday and Tuesday alone.\nMr Winterkorn announced his resignation on Wednesday afternoon over the affair that has sparked a US criminal investigation and worldwide legal action with unfathomable financial consequences for VW.\nLater in the day, Volkswagen's senior supervisory board said it would announce a new chairman on Friday, and consider other departures necessary to respond to the scandal.\nAsian stocks closed lower after the monthly gauge of Chinese manufacturing activity in September hit a six-and-a-half-year low, sending indices across the region into the red.\nUS stocks initially followed Europe's positive lead at the open before heading downward on China concerns.\nIn early afternoon Wall Street trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.6 per cent at 16,320.62 points.\nThe broad-based S&P 500 slid 1.2 per cent to 1,942.74, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.3 per cent to 4,743.69.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T22:14:42.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
