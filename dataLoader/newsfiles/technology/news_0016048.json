Nicola wrote to me to say: ‘If she didn’t look like she’s had more [beep] than hot dinners, I’d vote for her.’\n“And then Mark emailed me back. He said: ‘I apologise, my partner stole my phone from me. I will not be voting for you, but that is nothing to do with your resemblance to an egg.’\nRob wrote to me to say: ‘Please, take me off this list. Your narcissism and self-righteous moralising really grates.’ Don’t know what he means by that.”\nCreasy concludes: “I get it, nobody wants volumes of unwanted spam. We’ve got to improve the way the Labour party communicates with itself and the way we use new technology. And if you vote for me as deputy leader, it’ll be one of my priorities.”", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXXJ3NrjplY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXXJ3NrjplY"], "published": "2015-09-04T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T17:51:44.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
