KoolSpan’s secure calling and mobile messaging technologies can empower secure BYOD programs by elevating secure mobile communication for employee’s mobile devices, especially when combined with Samsung’s portfolio of enterprise ready smartphones and tablets. These include KoolSpan’s TrustCall for encrypted wireless calling, TrustText for encrypted mobile messaging and TrustBridge for secure calls between mobile and desk phones. Enterprises can centrally administer KoolSpan’s offerings via the TrustCenter management console. \n“Many enterprises are realizing the benefits of a mobile first strategy, but security remains paramount and Samsung is committed to providing our customers with unique solutions to deploy encrypted communication capabilities across their workforce,” said Robin Bienfait, executive vice president and chief enterprise innovation officer at Samsung. “We are excited to be collaborating with KoolSpan to offer truly integrated and secure voice and messaging capabilities directly in our portfolio of devices that can meet the specific needs of any enterprise, regardless of size or industry.” \n“Today’s announcement is further validation that the demand for secure voice and messaging services in the enterprise is changing quickly and primed for rapid growth,” said KoolSpan CEO Nigel Jones. “Together, KoolSpan and Samsung are providing large enterprises exactly what they need – powerful, easy to use secure communications for the latest mobile devices backed by Samsung’s enterprise reach and superior brand reputation. We are excited about our strategic alliance with Samsung addressing a growing ‘sweet spot’ in the enterprise market that our companies are uniquely able to fulfill with secure mobile communications running on popular devices.” \nAccording to Strategy Analytics’ research, the global smartphone installed base will reach 3 billion in 2016. More business and government organizations are relying on mobile devices for sensitive communications and collaboration and these devices introduce inherent surveillance and espionage risks when used with existing, untrusted cellular networks and Wi-Fi connections around the world. To protect mobile communications activity, more enterprises are adding secure voice and messaging capabilities to employee-owned and work-issued devices. Infonetics Research expects the global mobile device security client market to grow from $1 billion in 2014 to almost $4 billion by 2019. \nEnterprise trends mirror individuals’ broader mobile communications security concerns, worldwide. According to a 2015 TRUSTe study , 28 percent of individuals cite government surveillance, specifically among their privacy concerns, ahead of companies tracking their Web-surfing behavior (22 percent) or social media sites sharing information with advertisers (19 percent). \nSecuring today’s global communications mediums has come full circle: In the past, conventional wisdom held that phone calls were safer for communications “too sensitive” for electronic messages. Yet, today many professionals’ nearest phone is their smartphone, and gaining access to just one call or call logs instantly reveals employees’ sensitive business and personal communications, their patterns of activity and contacts and other data adversaries use to steal data, profile and fine-tune surveillance efforts. \nMobile messaging is likewise perceived as a discreet, private and quick alternative to e-mail. However, many free and native messaging applications use weak or unspecified encryption and other security measures, leaving them poorly suited for trusted, enterprise-grade collaboration. \n“Security is only as ‘good’ as it is ‘easy to use,’ and this truism is at the heart of what KoolSpan and Samsung are providing our customers,” Jones added. “While the nature of adversaries and threats are always shifting, enterprises mount an effective, persistent defense when they look for security tools and partners that quickly conform to their people, devices and ways their organizations work. Complexity cannot be the enemy of security when employees need the confidence to make calls and share time-sensitive information anywhere, anytime on any network.” \nFor more information on KoolSpan and Samsung’s partnership and available solutions and services, contact KoolSpan . \nAbout KoolSpan \nKoolSpan is the leading provider of robust, cross-platform, end-to-end communication security on mobile devices and desktop phones.
