To his friends, co-workers and family, it all came with no warning. Only after his death, at just 39, did we learn that he‚Äôd been suffering from severe depression. Erik had kept this medical condition to himself. If instead he‚Äôd reached out, he‚Äôd have discovered that others close to him also struggle with depression ‚Äî including myself.\nErik came quickly to mind this weekend when Zelda Williams, daughter of the extraordinarily beloved late actor Robin Williams, posted on Instagram about her own feelings of depression since her dad‚Äôs suicide a little over a year ago. The 26-year-old Quote: :\n‚Äú[F] or those suffering from depression, I know how dark and endless that tunnel can feel. But if happiness seems impossible to find, please hold on to the possibility of hope, faint though it may be. Because I promise you, there're enough nights under the same yellow moon for all of us to share, no matter how or when you find your way there.\"\nInstagram | @zeldawilliams\nMoonrise on the lake üåï I spent this night shivering and laughing under a clear, cold sky full of stars with people I love just to witness something beautiful. We mooned the moon and laughed ourselves hoarse, and I'm so incredibly grateful for every silly second. I came to a realization this year that I feel compelled to share here, for whomsoever may need it: Avoiding fear, sadness or anger is not the same thing as being happy. I live my sadness every day, but I don't resent it anymore. Instead, I do it now so that the wonderful moments of joy I do find are not in order to forget, but to inhabit and enjoy for their own sake. It's not easy. In fact, I'd say it takes much more effort to consciously do than it does to just stay sad, but with all my heart, I cannot tell you how worth it it is. And for those suffering from depression, I know how dark and endless that tunnel can feel, but if happiness seems impossible to find, please hold on to the possibility of hope, faint though it may be. Because I promise you, there're enough nights under the same yellow moon for all of us to share, no matter how or when you find your way there.\nMore than 1,000 of Williams‚Äô followers have commented on her brave message already. Here are a few posts that caught my eye and touched my heart:\n‚ÄúYour word is majestic and comforting to persons needing comfort in darkness of sight be spoken of truth!‚Äù\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm suffering from depression and I'm trying so hard to hold on\"\n‚ÄúSimply inspiring\"\nRobin Williams, Zelda Williams and I are among nearly 44 million Americans over 18 who are suffering from some form of mental health issue ‚Äî that is, 18.5 percent of U.S. adults‚Äîaccording to the National Institute of Mental Health. The stigma of these problems is immense, compounding the painful isolation.\nAs Cher recently said in a public service video promoting more open talk about mental health, ‚ÄúMany will be too ashamed to admit it and they won‚Äôt seek the help that they so desperately need.‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no shame in it‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre not alone.‚Äù\nErik, I wish you had known that.\nZelda, thank you for taking us out of the dark.\nFor more information:\nMentalHealth.gov\nNational Suicide Prevention Hotline\nAmerican Foundation for Suicide Prevention\nSubmit your question to Steven at stevenpetrow@earthlink.net .
