To address the increasing complexity of the vehicle operation, these manufacturers developed efficient ways to diagnose vehicle issues and created pro-active maintenance indicators to enhance fuel economy and durability of the vehicle.An automotive on-board diagnostics system (also known as OBD-l) is one such integrated system with a technology that helps automobile engineers/technicians identify and diagnose issues in the engine's computerized systems. The system consists of various sensors and circuits that detect any kind of system or component failure and provide an indication regarding the system malfunction through pre-defined diagnostic codes. These codes are stored in the vehicle's computer system. In addition, the OBD-I had few basic emission measurement features such as exhaust gas recirculation valve and catalytic converter, which is a vehicle emissions control device that converts toxic pollutants in the exhaust gas to less toxic pollutants by catalyzing a redox reaction.By the early 1990s, manufacturers introduced an upgraded advanced on-board diagnostics system (also known as OBD-II) to address as the complexity of an engine and the usage of automated computerized systems to control various functionalities of the vehicle increased to a higher level.Technavio's analysts forecast the global automotive on-board diagnostics system market to grow at a CAGR of 7.41% during 2014-2019.Covered in this reportThe global automotive on-board diagnostics system market can be segmented into threshold monitoring and comprehensive component monitoring.Technavio's report, Global Automotive On-Board Diagnostics System Market 2015-2019, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts.
