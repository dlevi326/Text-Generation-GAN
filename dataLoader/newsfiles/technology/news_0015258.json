This year's results include sales in China which was included in the initial launch for the first time. \nApple said previously that preorders were so strong that it expected to surpass last year's record. \nPiper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said results came in at the high end of his expectations for sales of 12 million to 13 million. He estimates China added about 2 million in sales. \n\"Today's news suggests the iPhone 6 cycle is off to a good start,\" he wrote. \nThe new models have more memory and faster processors, along with a new 12 mega-pixel camera, and starts at $649. Apple and wireless service providers are also offering leasing and monthly installment plans. \nCupertino-based Apple says the phones will be available in 40 additional countries beginning Oct. 9 including Italy, Mexico, Russia, Spain and Taiwan and 130 countries by the end of the year. \nApple said sales completed by Sept. 26 will be included in Apple's fiscal fourth quarter results, and sales completed on Sunday, Sept. 27 will be included in Apple's first-quarter 2016 results. \nShares slipped $1.28 to $113.43 in morning trading Monday.
