There is also an option to unblock multiple senders by selecting them first and clicking on the \"unblock selected senders\" button instead. \nThis has no effect on past emails and will only affect future incoming emails by that email address or those email addresses that you have selected. \nClosing Words \nThe new blocking options makes it easier to block email addresses on Gmail without leaving the inbox. It is not as comfortable as it could be considering that you need to open the email first before the blocking option becomes available. A better option would be to add the block option to the right-click menu of the inbox as well in my opinion.
