To address the growing complexity of embedded systems, AMD embedded customers will have access to the Sourcery CodeBench technology for development and debugging applications for Linux®-based embedded systems. AMD and Mentor Graphics in 2014 agreed to create an embedded software ecosystem for developers to access powerful open-source, embedded C/C++ development tools to build embedded software in complex heterogeneous architectures based on AMD's 64-bit ARM-based processors. The AMD 64-bit ARM-based processors target next-generation embedded data center applications, communications and networking infrastructure, and industrial solutions. \"Expanding our partnership with one of the largest independent embedded Linux and tool vendors in the market today is an exciting step forward as we continue to invest in the embedded market,\" said Scott Aylor , corporate vice president and general manager, AMD Embedded Solutions. \"We are providing the embedded development community an opportunity for choice, and this agreement with Mentor Graphics brings the embedded community opensource tools to help tailor and expand their development.\" The Sourcery CodeBench Professional solution optimizes embedded development quality and productivity, critical for advanced server applications based on AMD's 64-bit ARM-based processors running Linux. Embedded developers will be able to access system insight on software execution, performance and debugging of Linux-based embedded systems. The Mentor Embedded Sourcery CodeBench product enables the development of embedded systems on microcontrollers and microprocessors for RTOS, bare metal, and Linux-based applications. The Sourcery CodeBench tool and the integrated Sourcery Analyzer tool help developers to quickly identify and fix functional and performance issues in complex embedded systems. \"AMD and Mentor Graphics' support of the ARMv8-A embedded Linux ecosystem will shorten advanced system development cycles, reduce risk and improve product reliability,\" said Charlene Marini , vice president of marketing, Embedded Segments, ARM. \"The AMD solution further strengthens the developer ecosystem and extends the choice of high-end ARM-based embedded platform offerings for data storage, connected devices and hosting applications.\" Sourcery CodeBench Tool - Key Features, Benefits and Support As part of the agreement between AMD and Mentor Graphics, embedded developers will have free access to the following customized embedded Linux development products: Sourcery CodeBench Lite for 64-bit ARM GNU/Linux Complete GNU-based C/C++ development toolchain for custom Linux target platform development GNU Debugger for Linux application debug Windows and Linux host –based development options For additional product information visit the Mentor Graphics embedded Linux solutions page for AMD support: go.mentor.com/AMD About Mentor Embedded The Mentor Graphics Embedded Systems Division enables embedded development for a variety of applications including automotive, industrial, smart energy, medical devices, and consumer electronics.
