Launched earlier this year, IRIS streamlines multiple banking channels under a single access point while eliminating the need for separate products such as internet banking, tablet banking and mobile banking. \n“With a strong history in financial services, VSoft built IRIS from the ground-up, just like its other industry-leading solutions,” said Don Parker, executive vice president of partnerships at MX. “We’re thrilled to partner with VSoft and take part in their journey as they continue to innovate and provide engaging technologies for their customers. We’re confident that by integrating these powerful technology solutions, we’re helping financial institutions elevate to the next level of financial services.” \nIn addition to DMM, VSoft will also integrate MX’s data analytics solution, Insight, and its marketing platform, Target, into its IRIS platform to provide financial institution clients with even more functionality. Insight provides financial institutions with a holistic view of its customers. When users add their internal and external accounts into the MX platform, financial institutions gain instant access to collective user data about its competitors. Institutions know where customers have car loans, mortgages, checking accounts and more, and can then use that data to fine-tune marketing campaigns against those specific competitors. \nTarget allows marketing executives to put Insight to use by creating segments based on Insight’s datasets, deploy adaptive offers and start tracking a campaign in less than five minutes. Institutions can view a number of specific segments and then adapt digital offers to their accountholder’s interest. Financial institutions are able to share the right offer, with the right user, and at the right time. \n“MX continues to define and redefine their space, making them a true industry leader and a perfect complement to our goal of delivering innovative solutions for the next era of omni-channel banking,” said Murthy Veeraghanta, chairman and CEO of VSoft Corporation. “Through this partnership, our financial institution clients will have access to a fully-integrated, best-of-breed digital money management (DMM) solution, along with superior data analytics to increase competitiveness and better market relevant offers to customers. We believe this will be a highly competitive and attractive offering to our current and prospective clients.” \nAbout MX \nMX teams up with digital banking providers to supercharge the account holder experience at banks and credit unions.
