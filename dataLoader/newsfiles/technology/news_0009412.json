There were not substantial differences in use of newspapers or radio from non-Twitter users.\n“People using social media as a news source can design their own news agenda â€” identifying the sources and topics they want to follow,” the researchers said.\n“This has led to speculation that people will become narrow in their interests without the agenda-setting influence of news organisations,” they said.\n 03, 2015 6:50 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T04:50:08.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
