The counterpoint from academia is that the industry doesn’t know what it wants.\nBut both parties agree that each could do more to make the prospect of a career in IT more enticing, at the very least to get high school students more interested in studying so-called STEM subjects (science, technology, education and maths) as a feeder to computer science and engineering courses and an eventual career in IT.\nThe lack of interest in STEM is creating a pipeline issue that poses long-term consequences. Earlier this year, the Australian Industry Group published its study Progressing STEM Skills in Australia, which found STEM jobs grew at about 1.5 times the rate of other jobs. It also reported the supply of STEM skills to the workforce remained perilous due to declining tertiary enrolments.\nThis was followed by the Australian Computer Society’s report, Australia’s Digital Pulse, developed by Deloitte Access Economics, which found Australia will need an extra 100,000 ICT workers by the decade’s end.\nFinding them will be difficult. Especially given that CIOs feel many are not up to the task asked of them. CIOs are apprehensive not of students’ technical skills, but of their ability to think about the business context within which they worked. This is essential in digital transformation, as it’s through understanding business context that the technology can be applied.\nThe most common skills gaps noted by CIOs are the so-called “soft skills” of business acumen and communication that have not traditionally been part of an IT worker’s remit. But while industry bemoans the quality of graduates, it also plays a role in creating this situation. Few CIOs have direct contact with universities for curriculum development. Fewer still have structured placement programs for students. Meanwhile, the massive growth in offshore outsourcing in the last decade has been interpreted as a signal that IT jobs would not be readily available.\nAccording to the academics, student interest in STEM has also been hindered by the secondary curriculum, which has not kept up with the digital world, and created a cohort of teachers who lack confidence with digital technology. A digital curriculum exists, but is languishing as government bodies determine how to proceed. This is all despite kids effectively growing up with technology in their hands. They may be savvy users, but all parties agree the education system is not helping them understand they can be savvy creators.\nThe start-up scene is generating some buzz in Australia, but kids aren’t making the connection between Google, Amazon and the local possibilities. Ironically they also draw away graduates who might otherwise find themselves working for traditional businesses.\nThe problem is clearly bigger than something that industry or academia alone can solve. But unless industry gets more invested in skills development, little is likely to change. Which for CIOs raises the ultimate question — what costs more, training the next generation of IT leaders, or watching your business fall prey to digital disruption?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:23:31.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
