The Cedar Grove school district added 180 new Chromebooks with charging carts for the upcoming school year, which started Sept. 2. \nThe Cedar Grove school district is keen on integrating technology in the classroom, according to its superintendent. \nWith the advent of additional Google Chromebooks and new computer-based instructional programs, the district is continuing to push the technological agenda this school year to effectively instruct a generation of savvy students, Superintendent of Schools Michael Fetherman said. \n\"I think it has been an effective transition,\" Fetherman said. \"The early returns have been good, but the key remains support to these initiatives. We need to help our teachers integrate meaningful technology to the classroom.\" \nLast year was the first for the district-wide technology committee, a group of administrators and teachers that held meetings about every other month to explore ways of utilizing technology, Fetherman said. \n\"We cover a variety of different issues, including how we can use Chromebooks more effectively, rewriting the acceptable use policy, transitioning over to a Google platform for communication and sharing agendas, and coordinating what classroom apps are used in the district,\" Fetherman said. \nThe committee helped put together \"technology academies,\" where the technology teachers from each school would conduct one or two-hour seminars on a specific Google app, like Google Classroom or Gmail, said Jeremy Luogameno, a tech committee member and technology teacher at Memorial Middle School. \n\"The teachers at the middle school enjoyed all the new technology, because there is so much more available to them,\" Luogameno said. \"With Google Classroom, teachers can send students links, post assignments and communicate with each other through the platform.\" \nThis year, Cedar Grove will implement Performance Matters, a computer-based teaching tool that allows instructors to build assessments from a rich database of questions and sample documents that mirror PARCC tests and Common Core requirements, according to the superintendent. \nOver the summer, a group of 16 teachers, four from each district school, participated in workshops to become acclimated with the Performance Matters system, and will serve as the \"turnkey to introduce the program to the rest of the district,\" Fetherman said. \nThe system, which will be used primarily between Grades 3-12, will compile assessment data for the entire school district and provide \"nearly immediate feedback,\" allowing teachers to access students' results in prior assignments and effectively see the relationship between instruction and performance, Fetherman said. \nThe district purchased 120 new Chromebooks, 30 for each school with charging carts, and received an additional 60 for South End Elementary donated by the school's Family and Schools Association, Fetherman said. \n\"A lot of teachers use Chromebooks in their classrooms regularly, for collaborative work or to practice for tests,\" Luogameno said. \"Almost every single one is signed out every day.\" \nThis increase puts the ratio in the district at about three students for every Chromebook, Fetherman added. \n\"Since I started here three years ago, the amount of tech has gone up so much,\" Luogameno said, \"and students are doing a great job using it.\" \nEmail: moroses@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T17:31:49.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
