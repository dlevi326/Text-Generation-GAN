Rife set out to cure diseases using electrical frequencies and believed he found a cure for cancer. After a trial the FDA did not approve Rife's machines for medical use. Some believe this was due to the interests of the $10 billion a year pharmaceutical industry.\nAll of QuWave's products operate by sending out specific electrical frequencies. These frequencies are similar to those developed by Royal Rife, but put to uses other than curing disease, such as producing spiritual experiences or improving sleep quality.\nPioneers of Energy Medicine is an ongoing series featuring write-ups on the famous innovators and inventors that have contributed to the field of energy healing. In the past the series has featured Nikola Tesla , inventor of scalar healing and the alternating current, and Wilhelm Reich, discoverer of orgone and founder of orgonomy.\nIn addition to the article QuWave is offering a new deal on its USB Harmonizer unit in honor of Raymond Royal Rife. The USB Harmonizer, not generally available on sale due to its already low price point, will be discounted $50 if the code 'RIFE' is entered at checkout. The USB Harmonizer is usually $159 per unit but will be discounted to $109 when purchased with the 'RIFE' code.\nThe Pioneers of Energy Medicine page can be found under the 'Research' tab on QuWave's website or at this link: http://quwave.com/pioneers.html\nAbout QuWave:\nQuWave LLC, a prominent organization in the energy medicine field, manufacturing unique and active products that block the negative effects of EMF pollution and radiation while also generating Scalar Waves, Solfeggio Frequencies, Schumann Resonance, and Chi Orgone energies to promote a healthy, balanced lifestyle.
