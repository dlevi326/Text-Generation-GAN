It is 30% smaller than the smallest MEM microphone and less than half the size of MEM microphones typically found in mobile devices. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150910006385/en/ \nMiniature microphones are sometimes referred to as “bugs.” To put this in perspective, Cirrus Logic’s MEM microphone is one-sixth the size of a bed bug. \nJim Mielke, VP of Engineering at ABI Research, comments, “Rather than simply shrinking the typical MEM microphone, Cirrus Logic’s WM1706 MEM microphone, which ABI Research named after its die markings, is the first to integrate an amplifier/interface IC and the MEM sensor.” \nAlong with the record-setting MEM microphone, the phone has a Cirrus Logic audio codec. This codec sits alongside a Qualcomm MSM8939 chipset, a Skyworks power amplifier, Qorvo RF switches and a Broadcom NFC solution. \nThese findings are part of ABI Research’s TeardownIQ ( https://teardowniq.com/ ) , which includes a parts list, high-res photos, and power and performance testing. \nABI Research provides technology market research and technology intelligence for industry innovators.
