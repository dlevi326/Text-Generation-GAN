Snapshot(TM) analysis predicted the unknown subject to be female, predominantly of European ancestry, with a small percentage of Latino admixture, and having fair skin, light brown hair and brown eyes. At the producer's request, Parabon's forensic artist, Thom Shaw, age progressed the composite to age 49 (by default, Snapshot(TM) predicts a person's appearance at age 25 years). \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150916/267218 \nDuring the show, Dr. Ellen Greytak, Director of Bioinformatics at Parabon, presented the resulting Snapshot(TM) composite to \"Cold Justice\" investigator Yolanda McClary and Sorensen DNA specialist Cami Green. McClary revealed it was her DNA that had been submitted for analysis, and she was visibly astonished at the resemblance of the composite, stating, \"Even the facial bone structure is spot on.\" She later told Walsh and the studio audience \"It was amazing!\" \nGreytak said afterward, \"Snapshot(TM) has been tested in many blind evaluations, and it has performed exceedingly well every time. Because we cannot publicize evaluations by police departments and federal agencies, it was great to have an opportunity to demonstrate Snapshot(TM)'s accuracy on television.\" \nAbout Parabon NanoLabs, Inc.: Parabon NanoLabs is a vertically integrated DNA technology company that develops next-generation forensic and therapeutic products, which leverage the enormous power of DNA.
