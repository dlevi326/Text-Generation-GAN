The robot is called the Crown of thorns starfish Detection system - COTSBot.

Photo: QUT\n\"We gave it lots of examples, we trawled YouTube for videos and provided it with thousands of images,\" he said.\n\"We're 99.99 per cent confident in its accuracy. And if it has any doubt, it takes a photo and sends it back to us for confirmation.\"\nNow, water quality management and human divers administering the injection are used to try to keep a lid on crown-of-thorns numbers.\nIt is hoped the robot will be sent out on the reef for up to eight hours at a time, delivering more than 200 lethal shots.\n\"It will never out-compete a human diver in terms of sheer numbers of injections but it will be more persistent,\" said Dr Dunbabin, a QUT research fellow. \"It can go out for long periods of time and in all weather conditions.\" After six months of intensive training, COTSbot passed its first sea trial with flying colours in Moreton Bay this week.\nThe next challenge is to see how it navigates strong water currents and more complex terrain in open ocean.\nResearchers are hoping to have the robot fully operational on the reef early next year.\nAAP\nLove science?
