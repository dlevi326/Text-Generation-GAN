Wayne Taylor Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Australian subscription beauty service Bellabox is expanding to China through a new partnership with Australia Post's Tmall service, run by Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba.\nThe business is hoping to tap into the market's love of natural cosmetics.\nIt's the first expansion for Bellabox after it retreated from Singapore earlier this year. The company has over 40,000 members, and has raised $7 million to date through investors such as Allure Media, SquarePeg Ventures, Lance Kalish, Elevation Capital and Apex Capital Partners.\nBellabox works by charging subscribers a monthly fee to receive a box of samples that beauty brands provide for free.\nChief executive Sarah Hamilton said the Singaporean market had been too hard to crack due to high levels of existing brand loyalty.\n\"Their pastime is to go to the shopping centre and shop. They love Chanel and Dior,\" she said.\n\"They're very brand focused and they're not curious.\"\nChina changes The product offering for Chinese consumers will move away from the subscription service that's offered in Australia and take on a limited edition approach.\nChinese shoppers will be able to purchase limited edition beauty boxes containing Australian-made natural cosmetics.\nAustralian products ranging from a Tasmanian lavender teddy bear to organic baby food are already hits in China.\nMs Hamilton, who founded Bellabox in 2011 with her twin sister Emily, said the website was already attracting Chinese visitors.\n\"The market potential is huge with analysts predicting the cosmetics market will become a $US113.9 billion industry by 2017, of which 25 per cent will come online sales fuelled by tech savvy millennials,\" she said.\n\"We've always been keen to expand. Australia is one feather in our cap.\"\nAustralia Post assistance Australia Post's deal with Tmall gives Australian retailers easier access to sell their products through the website. Previously Australian retailers had to have registered businesses in China to sell products on Tmall.\nMs Hamilton said Chinese shoppers would love Australian products because they were authentic and showcased what the natural environment has to offer.\n\"They want natural skin care products and other items with a detoxifying approach,\" she said.\n\"China has a high adoption rate of smartphones and online shopping, it provides the perfect platform for growth.\"\nBellabox will be the 36th brand to have a storefront through Australia Post's partnership with Tmall.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-09-22T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:18:39.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
