Having a well-designed website can be an effective way to compete with larger brands in your industry and it doesn't need to be costly or confusing. For a website to be an effective sales tool: -- Know your customer. Knowing your customer and their needs is the number one thing you should understand before beginning to build the site. Remember that your website is for your customers and what you can do for them. Create a site that welcomes your consumer and use content on the site to convert them to a customer. -- Website words. Website copy is critically important and often overlooked. Create compelling content that weaves calls to action throughout the page and if you aren't converting site visitors to customers, have the copy on your site evaluated by a professional or end-user. -- Newsletter. While social media is one way to stay in touch with your followers, the ever-changing rules make it difficult to maintain a regular presence and a newsletter is a much simpler and consistent way to reach your followers. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20110831/NY59180LOGO \nFor further discussion on the remaining seven steps to building your business website, read the latest PR Newswire's Small Business PR Toolkit post here: http://bit.ly/1gr0c7p \nPR Newswire's Small Business PR Toolkit is a comprehensive resource that provides small businesses and entrepreneurs the tools to develop an affordable public relations and marketing plan that helps generate interest from potential customers, engage with key audiences and grow their businesses.
