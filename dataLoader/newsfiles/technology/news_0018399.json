The service was slated for an early September launch in Japan, where Internet-connected users would be able to sign up at SoftBank Group Corp.'s retail shops, major electronics retailers, and through the Japanese company's website and call centers.\nNetflix has over 65 million members in over 50 countries. It plans further expansion and has borrowed $1 billion to finance the rollout.\nThe company's ambitions to enter the key Chinese market face stiff competition, however, following the announcement that e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. would partner with state-run companies to expand its video-streaming service.\nThis was the latest in Alibaba's efforts to build an ecosystem of TV and film content, which already includes a movie-ticketing website, a crowdfunding film product and the film studio Alibaba Pictures. The company also owns an 18.5% stake in Youku Tudou Inc., one of China's biggest video-streaming companies.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com\n 09, 2015 09:05 ET (13:05 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:30:43.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
