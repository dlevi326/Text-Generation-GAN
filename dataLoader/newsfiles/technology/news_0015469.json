The upgrade will allow Ideator members to more easily capture and share business ideas while connecting with the people and resources they need to grow their businesses.\n“At Ideator, we use technology to connect entrepreneurs around the world with experienced business leaders,” says Co-Founder Charlie Smith. “ We’re all about helping entrepreneurs find and connect with the people who have the experience and expertise they need to grow their businesses, and our new release will make it easier for our members to do that.”\nIdeator’s new technology, accessible on www.Ideator.com , will enable entrepreneurs to:\nCreate and view enhanced profiles. More detailed profiles of Ideator team members, advisors and investors will make it easier for entrepreneurs to identify the people who have the expertise they need. Profiles will provide information on industry experience, areas of interest, specific skill sets, and other professional information. Members can also create profiles showcasing their own skills if they want to attract interest from existing teams rather than starting their own.\nAccess a new resources portal. Ideator gathers recommendations for business tools and resources, and now makes them available in one centralized portal. Entrepreneurs can access ideas and information on how to secure a company name, get help creating a pitch deck, obtain funding, evaluate financial management tools, and more.\nCollect business ideas. Ideator members hosting a competition for business ideas can use the platform’s new Collections feature to gather and manage idea submissions.\nEngage in discussions with trustworthy sources. Ideator now also offers a discussion board – moderated by members of the Ideator team – to provide credible information on various business startup topics. Members can review current discussions and ask specific questions related to their business startups.\n“Ideator is helping people to build businesses, create jobs, give back to communities, and follow their dreams – from anywhere in the world,” adds Co-Founder Jeremy Sanders. “We do this by helping them navigate the often complex and difficult process of starting a business from scratch.
