This partnership between Gogo and Ultramain Systems highlights the value of the connected aircraft. The robust connectivity services provided by Gogo will enable Ultramain's advanced applications to be connected in real-time, which will give airline personnel the ability to assess aircraft maintenance issues as soon as they are detected. \"Aircraft maintenance reporting functions are traditionally accomplished using paper log books and analyzed by ground crews between take-offs and landings,\" said Andrew Kemmetmueller , Gogo's vice president of product for connected aircraft services. \"Ultramain's applications modernize this manual process into a digital one by building these applications into pilots' Electronic Flight Bags, maintenance technicians' mobile devices and airlines' back-office systems.\" Ultramain Systems has developed many notable aircraft maintenance applications. Applications that can now be connected using Gogo broadband connectivity include: efbTechLogs, which allow flight crews to transmit accurate data about problems on the aircraft; eReporting, an integrated flight crew reporting software that replaces paper Air Safety Reports; and eCabin, which provides passenger information such as special needs for passengers. \"Ultimately, this partnership can help improve airline efficiencies and reduce maintenance related delays and cancellations, creating a better passenger experience,\" added Kemmetmueller.
