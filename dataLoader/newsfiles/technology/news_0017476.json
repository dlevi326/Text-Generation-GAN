McDougal, President/CEO. “Using this new system keeps us more organized, takes out the guess work of timing, reduces running around, and helps ensure that all of our events are perfectly choreographed.\n“On any day, we could have two large weddings on our property or one of our large, 3,000-attendee signature events so coordination among all of our staff is critical,” McDougal explains. “Walkie-talkies were great when they first came out but sometimes information could be overheard that should have been private. The headsets with our new Kenwood system are quiet and keep details confidential as needed.”\nHQ98 is based in Scottsdale and offers more than 500 items online from leading manufacturers. The firm uses its experience and expertise to match companies, organizations and government entities with the best systems available. Shipping on items within the continental U.S. is free.
