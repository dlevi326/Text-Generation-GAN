Picture: James CroucherSource: News Corp Australia\nNational Australia Bank has fired the gun on the big banks’ entrance into low-cost, mass market online financial advice, laying claim to the first digital platform to try to engage the 80 per cent of the population that shuns financial aNAB dvisers.\nAffirming the group’s commitment to its sector-lagging wealth arm, the bank will today unveil “NAB Prosper”, an offering that provides tailored financial advice through its internet banking ­website.\nAfter 15 months in development, the offering will initially be rolled out to 40,000 customers on October 7, focused on superannuation and insurance before broadening into advice on debt, cashflow, investments and estate planning. It marks the major banks’ seemingly inevitable use of technology and online banking to better leverage their large customer bases and wealth offerings, a traditionally difficult feat.\nBut as so-called robo advice takes hold in the US, NAB’s general manager of wealth digital and direct services Anne Bennett said NAB’s offering was more personalised to life circumstances than just “shuffling” money around ­investments through algorithms and was not developed for greater cross-selling.\n“I see NAB Prosper as more than robo advice. It’s much more personalised for the individual and less about flicking money ­between different investment ­options,” Ms Bennett told The Australian.\nWhile NAB has the lowest returning wealth arm of the big four, chief Andrew Thorburn has committed to improving and investing in the “core” operations as the bank mulls options for the troublesome life insurance assets.\nThat has historically been difficult. Citi analysts told clients in July: “Wealth management has not become the fast-growing, low-capital-intensive earnings stream that integrated seamlessly, as expected. Customers appear to have sought more flexible and lower-cost investment structures that remain separate from their banking arrangements.”\nBut Ms Bennett said NAB Prosper was not developed to push the bank’s wealth products, rather to empower the 80 per cent of people who did not actively use a financial adviser.\nAfter generating a digital statement of advice, customers will, however, have the option of speaking to an adviser over the phone.\n“We won’t specify product. It’s about general personalised ­advice for that customer based on what they tell us,” Ms Bennett said.\n“Banking and wealth coming together is absolutely what NAB want to do more of in the future, and having customers engage in their retirement as opposed to picking a specific product.”\nIn the wake of fraud and poor advice across the major banks’ ­financial planning arms, Ms Bennett backed NAB’s new offering to “open up” advice for more consumers, but would not comment on its likely success following the array of advice scandals.\nBut she dismissed recent comments by Danny Gilligan, the managing director of Westpac-backed venture capital firm Reinventure, that the financial planning sector could one day be made extinct by technology.\n“I absolutely don’t agree with that. I would see that NAB Prosper helps us open up the market to those customers.\n“There will always be a place for advisers and face-to-face ­conversations,” she said.\nBut she conceded NAB Prosper could be ideally suited to the mass market, which did not need, or want, in-depth and complex ­financial advice.", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/09/1227520/114181-c23d9f02-56c6-11e5-83fc-3eca1aa25b46.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-10T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T08:13:51.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
