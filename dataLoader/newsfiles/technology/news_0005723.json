It is achieved by placing a microphone INSIDE of the buds. This is a welcome departure from the traditional headsets/microphones which tend to transmit background noise, thus making phone conversations in public places difficult and unreliable. Tiny and powerful, RippleBuds will ultimately replace those traditional, pesky headsets which have a tendency to dangle in front of one’s face.\nWireless earbuds offer the best value for those who frequent public areas with lots of activity, such as sporting events, concerts, or public transportation. Users who spend much time in quiet spaces, like an office or a baby room, will also benefit because they can keep their conversations discreet, without interfering with other people’s activities.\nBeing the smallest earbuds on the market, RippleBuds provide maximum comfort with a minimal profile. In addition, they contain a speaker which allows one to listen to all audio, including both music and calls without microphone interference.\nThe RippleBuds technology also enhances your communication with voice recognition services like Siri, Alexa, Cortana, and Google Now. Without RippleBuds, the background noise often leads to misinterpreted commands, and inevitable frustration. With RippleBuds, no longer will you need to repeat questions or commands.\nThe headphones utilize the latest Bluetooth 4.1 technology. They function clearly within a range of 30ft and last for up to 4 hours. Plus, their carrying case offers three full charges, so you’ll never have to look for the power outlets while on the go. In addition, RippleBuds have a loss prevention feature.\n“The idea of RippleBuds came from my frustration of not being understood on business calls while traveling because of noisy surroundings. In our fast paced lives, we increasingly depend on mobile devices. With RippleBuds, you can talk on the phone in a normal voice even while riding a motorcycle or attending a rock music concert, as well as control your connected home and car devices using voice commands. RippleBuds are designed to become a reliable partner for your contemporary lifestyle,” said Dusik Shin, the founder and CEO of RippleBuds.\nRippleBuds are currently in the advanced prototype stage, and will be available in retail next spring. The company plans to launch a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter this November to offer early supporters an opportunity to pre-order the device starting at $99 (or a mono-ear bud for $79), a savings of $50 from the future retail price.\nThe attendees of the upcoming TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco have an opportunity to try RippleBuds to compare them with others that are currently available on the market. The company’s founders believe that their invention will make a difference in how people communicate with each other and their gizmos.\nThe company’s website: http://www.ripplebuds.com/\nContact RippleBuds by email: This email address is being protected from spambots.
