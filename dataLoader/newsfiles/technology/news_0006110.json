She says many Americans are forced to pay a significant cost out-of-pocket if they get sick because average deductibles have more than doubled during the past decade.\nClinton would offer a refundable tax credit of up to $5,000 for families not eligible for Medicare for excessive out-of-pocket health care costs.\nHer plan also aims to protect Americans from unexpected medical bills and help states prevent insurance companies from imposing excessive rate increases.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-23T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T20:33:05.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
