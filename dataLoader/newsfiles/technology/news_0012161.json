GREEN BAY, WI, September 04,   Mike Linn, Certified Public Accountant, is using the knowledge he gained over the past decade working with U.S. and international companies, by building tools other entrepreneurs can use to start their own businesses. To launch his company, Mike Linn is reaching out to the Kickstarter community to raise $15,000, by offering the Startup Notebook, and Design Folio. The Startup Notebook is a unique exercise system to inventory one's skills and interests, and turn them into a new startup company idea. The Design Folio is designed to help the user create by keeping all their creative work in one place. The Kickstarter campaign has already received 920 visits after only 3 days and is gaining popularity on Facebook having reached over 1,600 people. www.kickstarter.com/projects/1600705548/startup-notebook-and-design-folio \"I thought of the book and folio while trying to come up with an actionable business idea, and needed a place to keep it all organized,\" says Mike Linn, Founder. \"I wanted to make the case universal to help me create on paper, or on a tablet, but also hold a notebook to keep my ideas organized.\" The Kickstarter campaign runs through September 30, 2015 and is currently 8% funded. There are early bird specials available to become part of the company by having your name listed as an original founder on the company website: www.originalcontentbooks.com . There is also a $1 pledge reward that offers the full Startup Notebook in PDF version so anyone that contributes can begin using this guide to build an amazing company idea.About Original Content Books The name Original Content comes from the term online that references a user's post as being unique and new. In a world of consumers we want to encourage individuals to stand out and be builders. This starts with finding a good idea and our tools help individuals with this, as well as encouraging goal setting and to-do lists, to follow through. Mike Linn thought of the Startup Notebook after working alongside hundreds of business owners and seeing how each founder created their company. Having always been excited to start his own company, Mike used his tax accounting position to learn from owners, and saw that each company focuses first on doing one thing well. That one thing was almost always what the founder knew best. By taking inventory one's own skills, the Startup Notebook can help them become the founder of their own amazing company. The Design Folio accompanies the Startup Notebook, and provides a convenient and universal tool to help create and design. Unlike most folios and tablet cases, this is wide enough to hold a notebook as well as a tablet, or a sketchbook. Please visit our website for more details on the Startup Notebook, and Design Folio.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T11:23:06.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
