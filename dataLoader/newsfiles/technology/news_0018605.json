Jochelle Mendonca | 02 September 2015, 9:06 AM IST Share MUMBAI: The Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks has issued new guidelines for issuance of computer-related inventions, which could make it easier for IT companies in the country to register a patent.The guidelines, issued on August 21, allow companies to show innovation in just software, rather than in both software and hardware as was previously required.They also make it easier to register a patent for technical innovation in a business methodthe basis of most patents filed in the BPO industry.\"The guidelines help the examiners judge whether a patent should be awarded,\" Bishakha Bhattacharya, senior director of policy at the National Association of Software and Services Companies, told ET.\"In the past, they were quite onerous requiring novelty in both hardware and software and if there were terms denoting business process management like supply chain, then they would be rejected. The new guidelines change that.\"But Bhattacharya said there were still some questions about interpretation that needed to be addressed. She, however, added that the guidelines open up the door for filing new patents and could speed up the process.Indian IT companies have been filing a large number of patents globally. In FY15, Tata Consultancy Services filed 509 patents while Wipro submitted 578 patent applications, their annual reports show. Infosys is reevaluating its approach to patents, its CEO Vishal Sikka said earlier this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T13:17:13.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
