You can never succeed as a national coach if one of your reasons is to settle personal scores Mr. Shakes Mashaba. We have rather given you a chance after chance with hope that you will have change of hearts with your selection policy if there's any or criteria thereof. Soccer is, but the beautiful game for a reason. It's an art where those gifted at crafting, whether be scoring goals or defending deserve to be in the starting line up. Where others blessed with an eye of an eagle deserve to pull the strings in the midfield.\nOurs is a country where we live in reconciliation; where Ubuntu is part of our being; where tribalism has a home and; hatred, well flows in our veins yet suppressed by the course to see this country succeed. My point is, but simple. You need to put your feelings aside and assemble the best squad, representative of the players current form and not one selected with a pinch of revenge, arrogance and ignorance for that is a deadly combination.\nOurs is the most blessed country in terms of soccer, whether be players, facilities and talent pool. We are a combination of Brazilian flair and skill, touch of African macho man tenacity, intelligence, perseverance and hard work, a bit of English arrogance, determination like that of an American if we set our minds to something (hosting the 2010 Fifa World Cup is testimony to that), open minded to new things like Germans.\nBut coach; you stand head and shoulders above the rest of us, not in a good way if and when we look at your mandate. You have rather taken the liberty to fail us as a nation. You subject us to bad tactics if there are any, players with no direction even in their own lives, and while at it; you have even let the cat out of the bag, showing us that you are a cry baby who blames anyone, but himself for his failures.\nFrankly speaking or writing if there's such a thing, do us a favour and resign. It would be our redemption and in the long run yours as well. South Africa deserves better and by virtue of having been the best in the past, our sense of entitlement cannot be unfounded or unreasonable.\nYours in patriotism\nLethwele L Makatoane\n@LethweleM", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/makatoane.l.lister"], "published": "2015-09-08T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:27:41.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
