On Disney, Cramer said the company has a lot of firepower and a lot of cash, but there are worries about ESPN. Cramer expects the stock will be range bound until the company can show that its new Shanghai Disney theme park and upcoming Star Wars attractions can move the needle. Cramer said he likes the stock below $100 a share. Another viewer asked whether Under Armour is a long term buy. Cramer responded that it's a stock he likes, but it's one of the high-flying stocks the market recently turned against. He put Nike (NKE) in that same category. Cramer said Under Armour could fall further. Another viewer asked whether it was time to bailout out of Ambarella, or buy more. Cramer said Ambarella is a 'gunner stock,' along with GoPro (GPRO) and Mobileye (MBLY). 'When the market's looking great, they are the ones to own,' said Cramer. 'When the market's not looking great they are the ones to sell. You make the judgement about how the market looks.'
