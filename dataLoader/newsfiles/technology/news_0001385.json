Image Credit: Screenshot \nIn an event that was supposed to be all about the latest Nexus smartphones and new Chromecast devices, Google today showed reporters a new tablet in its high-end Pixel line. \nThe new Pixel C would have been a complete surprise, were it not for a report on the launch of the device yesterday from Android Police . \nThe aluminum device will be available in time for the holidays on the Google Store, starting at $499 for the 32 GB model and $599 for the 64 GB model. The integrated Bluetooth keyboard, which will charge in the background while sitting affixed to the screen, will cost $149, Google director of product management Andrew Bowers said.

Localization and translation tips from the best minds in marketing. \nThe Pixel C comes with an Nvidia Tegra X1 quad core chip, 3 GB of memory, a 308 pixel-per-inch (PPI) screen, and a comfortable keyboard inspired by the Chromebook Pixel, Bowers said. But the keyboard might well be the best innovation here, as it provides more than two months of daily active usage without a charge, Bowers said today. \nOn the outside, the new Pixel C will have the same multi-color light as the one on the Chromebook Pixel, and just under that light are four microphones to detect speech commands. \n“Now you can have voice interactions from across the room,” Bowers said. While the inclusion of multiple microphones might help ensure the accuracy of its voice search, the company has been working hard to improve the accuracy of its voice search using artificial intelligence , and that increased intelligence should be on display in this feature in particular.

That device got a refresh, a price cut, and a USB Type-C charger in March — but it has been more demonstration project than top seller. \nThe difference here is that the Pixel C is running Android, not Chrome OS, just like tablets such as the HTC-built Nexus 9 or Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S2 .
