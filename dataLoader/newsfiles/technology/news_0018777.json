He said the move “wasn’t entirely unexpected” in light of the recent arrests.\nThe agency arrested six people and visited about 50 more who allegedly used the denial of service tool that is offered by Lizard Squad in return for a fee. The attacks, carried out in exchange for Bitcoins, targeted websites of companies including Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. although the NCA didn’t say whether they were successful.\nLizard Squad claimed responsibility for disrupting Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony PlayStation online services on Christmas Day 2014. On the day of the NCA arrests last week, the Lizard Squad Twitter account posted: “Due to recent raids, we’re going to start operations back up again.”\nDenial of service “isn’t a security breach, and it doesn’t affect our operational capability,” Niizeki said. “At worst it is a temporary inconvenience to users of our website.”\nThe website was back online by 10:50 a.m. U.K. time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T13:41:20.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
