The government is looking at accepting the best practices of sectors as part of the negotiations on joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) even as it is yet to take a call on opening up the sector completely to foreign investors.\n\n\"We have agreed for cooperation in e-commerce as part of the ongoing talks for the RCEP so that all countries can exchange relevant information,\" said a commerce department official, adding that the government has only agreed to \"cooperate\" and not undertake any commitments in the e-commerce sector under the trade agreement.\n\nThe RCEP consists of the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations and their free-trade partners -- India, Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand and Korea. The 16-member grouping has set up a panel on e-commerce in response to a Japanese proposal on easing foreign direct investment in the sector under which member countries will exchange best practices linked to online commerce, which India may incorporate in its domestic policy.\n\nAnother official from the department said India plans to seek best practices for payment mechanisms and data harmonization from its trade partners. There is no policy to govern payment mechanisms or verify frauds in delivery of products where third parties such as logistics companies are involved.\n\nIndustry experts said there is a need for regulation to protect merchants and consumers but express helplessness in maintaining confidentiality of user transaction data. \"E-commerce firms do comply with the company laws, consumer laws and banking regulations but there is no way of maintaining users' transaction data or keeping it confidential,\" said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy firm Technopak.\n\nHe added that there is no means to verify third parties involved in delivery or logistics. The government needs to put in place regulation to protect merchants and consumers, Singhal said. \"A lot of e-tailers are getting away by calling themselves as marketplaces or information technology companies. They replace products or take corrective measures only to save their reputation and as a brand-building exercise. So, they have to be covered by a legislation dealing with retail.\n\nAlso, the national guidelines should make these e-commerce companies responsible for the conduct of their vendors,\" said an industry expert not wishing to be identified. According to Mohit Bahl, a partner at consultancy firm KPMG, \"A policy is required for overseas players investing here and whether retail laws should apply to them or marketplace laws. We need business guidelines for them.\"\n\nVarious government departments -- commerce, industry, consumer affairs, electronics and information technology, telecom and financial services -- are currently in discussions to chalk out a strategy for the e-commerce sector. India's digital commerce market, including online travel and online retail, was valued at Rs 53,301 crore in December 2013 and is estimated to cross Rs 1 lakh crore (more than $15 billion) by the end of 2015, according to a report by the Internet and Mobile Association of India.\n\nThe central government has also sought comments from states, as part of these discussions, on the opening up the business-to-consumer segment of e-commerce to foreign direct investment.
