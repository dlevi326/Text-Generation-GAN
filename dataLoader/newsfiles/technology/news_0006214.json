Those guys are mostly general construction workers and or people who cannot afford to use your typical private shuttles, your glorified Gautrains, and or our best form of commuting in the form of taxis.\nIt’s just too expensive to travel mind you. Generally a typical trip in a radius of less than 10 Kilometres cost just over R50 on those fix rate maxi-cabs and or one can pay a lil’less on uber.\nTo those who have no idea what uber is: it’s not some funny movie or anything along those lines. It’s a seamlessly service that connects riders to drivers through and APP (application) on smart phones that allows you to request a driver to pick you up on that location and your predefined destination and you don’t have to pay the driver as you would’ve put in your card details and you will be automatically debited on that agreed amount as per the APP. Cheesy neh!\nNow try and imagine someone who have no freaken clue how to use a “smart phone”, let alone affording one. Now that the kind of cyclist I’m talking about.\nToday again I see that the Minister of Sport and Recreation South Africa Mr @MbalulaFikile (using his twitter handle since he loves social media) launched a program were he encourages and promote a healthy living through a # (HashTag) #ICichoose2BActive which is a great initiative I must say. Mr Minister went ahead with such tweets “Team No Mkhaba In Cabinet, Team No Mkhaba In Parliament, etc. and so on. I personally love this initiative Mr Minister I must say however my 5am cyclist have been doing for the longest time.\nThis ordinary South Africans (& possible our brothers from neighbouring countries) ride over 20 kilometres from deep Thembisa, Ivory park and its surrounding to be on the construction sites by at least 7am every day of their site contracts until the next construction resumes.\nOne of my observations I gathered while I’m trying to chase some imaginary target myself in those wee-hours of the morning which is called jogging, is that most if not all of them are very fit.\nIn this case “fit” means that those guys are not obese and seem to be very comfortable riding those bike which is the whole idea of working out.\nIn a nutshell, we can launch as much programs and initiatives as possible can however as long as those initiatives are not part of our lifestyle as a country then we will forever spend money in all these ideas and initiatives which we will not be able to sustain them. With that being said, I have to commend some cities around South Africa that already have “cyclist lanes” which promotes and encourage people to use their bicycles to travel from one point to the other.\nI have seen those lanes in Braamfontein in the city of Johannesburg however I have to say that I have seen those lanes mostly used as parking’s especially on weekends when all kinds of race and colours descend to Neighbourgoods (yes that’s the correct spelling) market for funny and interesting foods and craft beers.\nHeading back into the healthy part of my article now: we need to inculcate healthy living in our lifestyles in such a way we don’t see working out as “working” but a part of our lives.\nMy 5am cyclist depend on their bicycles to go to work and back thus it’s no problem for them to ride 5 days a week.\nlet us take our own health into our very own hands than depending on great ideas from people who come with those ideas only when its suites them thus they are never sustained for lengthy periods.\nHealthy living starts with you\nI shall rest for now.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MbalulaFikile"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T22:07:35.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
