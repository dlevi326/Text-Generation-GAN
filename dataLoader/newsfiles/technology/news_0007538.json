The integration of AOD’s EHR with Kno2 eliminates the need for senior care organizations to rely on paper for clinical document exchange, empowering the triple aim of improved outcomes, increased care quality and lower health care costs. \n“Secure interoperability across the care continuum plays an integral role in quality improvement and improved outcomes,” said Aric Agmon, President and CEO of AOD Software. “We are thrilled to include Kno2 in our EHR to connect senior care organizations with key stakeholders, including hospitals and physician practices, to transform resident-centric care and look ahead toward a collaborative healthcare system.” \nAccording to the ONC , while hospital exchange activity has grown significantly over the years, exchange of data during transitions is limited for hospitals and post-acute care providers. The partnership with Inofile will connect senior care organizations with hospitals and other care providers in their area using enterprise systems such as Epic, Cerner, McKesson, Greenway and Allscripts. Kno2 provides AOD clients a single, secure point for exchange of resident data through AOD’s EHR. Using Kno2 and DIRECT messaging standards decreases dependence on paper and fax, improving transitions of care, compliance, patient safety and workflow efficiencies. \n“The combination of AOD and Kno2 delivers instant interoperability across the care continuum. With AOD integrating to Kno2, a facility using AOD’s EHR can be fully interoperable in 24 hours,” said Jon Elwell, CEO of Inofile. “We read every day about obstacles to interoperability between hospitals and post-acute care settings; Kno2 removes those barriers, making interoperability available to everyone right now, regardless of their overall technology adoption or budget constraints.” \n“We're very excited about our relationship with AOD – it’s the latest achievement in a long line of innovation that takes DIRECT far beyond simple direct messaging and broadens our ability to drive interoperability and efficiency, producing a positive impact on healthcare everywhere and for everyone,” continued Elwell. \nWith DIRECT continuing to expand, Kno2 has the ability to electronically send and receive all clinical documents from any source through a single platform, linking all patient care environments through structured, standardized document formats. Kno2 easily adapts in all healthcare environments including those with limited technology funds or outdated, uneasily integrated equipment and enables a secure, structured, interoperable exchange of patient information. \nAbout AOD Software \nAOD is the industry’s leading provider of integrated clinical, financial, operational, home health/home care and point-of-sale solutions.
