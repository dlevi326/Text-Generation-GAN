Is it phablet? Or tablet? Or what? - Advertisement - \nSeriously this has to be one of the most confusing terminologies that we are being dealt with in recent times. Back when we didn't have a smartphone (or phablet) of this size and tablet also has its way of categorizing themselves. Anything starting from 7-inch is already considered to be a tablet; ~8.5-inch is a mid-sized tablet, and anything more than 10-inch is a full-sized tablet. Did you get it? Or still confused? \nThe Vibe Phab Plus is expected to be released anytime soon in September but will there be a demand in this market space? Another thing to consider is that you should know that it is not meant to be used with a single hand – no matter how big your hands are. Instead, you’re going to be using both your hands to comfortably manage it. \nHaving a body measurement of 186.6 x 96.6 x 7.6 mm (7.35 x 3.80 x 0.30 in), it sure is thin alright for its size. As we go for its weight, it comes weighing in at 229 g (8.08 oz) which is alright for its size. As long as you manage it with both your hands, it shouldn’t put too much of a strain on your hands. A metal unibody makes for a premium look and feel and elevates its status by a lot. \nMoving on to its huge screen, the Vibe Phab Plus will be sporting a Full HD IPS capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~324 ppi pixel density. At this size, anything short than a Full HD screen could well be a disaster. You will love its sharpness and the knowledge that you can probably share the phablet with a friend or two thanks to its IPS technology. Cool metal body and huge screen might have its own fans, but if the performance is not up to mark; you might end up with a slow device that is unable to follow your every needs. Thankfully the Vibe Phab Plus won’t be having any of that though. Blessed with the Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising a Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 405 for its graphics and 2GB RAM – there’s plenty of firepower for anyone here. - Advertisement - \nCamera-wise, it will be powered by a 13MP-5MP camera setup which is considered to be the mid-range these days. You should be able to capture a lot of photos and selfies as you seek to upload them to your favorite social media. \nIn terms of storage, a generous 32GB internal storage is there for you to install all of your favorite apps and games. Should you feel you need more space, then just put in a microSD slot, and the Vibe Phab Plus can take in up to 64GB space. Just a word of caution, though, if you do that; then you will lose the capability of the 2 nd sim slot. Still not too bad right? \nThe latest Android Lollipop 5.0 is there accompanying this massive Vibe Phab Plus. This is the perfect complement as it will be bringing with it a host of optimizations to give an increase to the performance. \nTo round it all off, the Vibe Phab Plus will be powered by a non-removable Li-Po 3500 mAh battery that technically should be enough to power up the phablet for at least a day. Based on Lenovo’s data, they are saying it could last up to 48 hours but let’s wait and see for the actual results to come in. \nNot forgetting that it has 4G LTE and dual sim capability which further adds to its value. - Advertisement - \nHaving a huge screen makes the Lenovo Vibe Phab Plus a stand-out among the crowd. It does have the necessary hardware to boot, and the metal unibody enhances its outlook even more. If you are comfortable with handling it with both hands, then it might be the right fit for you. \nThe Lenovo Vibe Phab Plus is expected to be available by this month for below $300 USD, and it will be available in Gunmetal Grey, Titanium Silver, Champagne Gold.
