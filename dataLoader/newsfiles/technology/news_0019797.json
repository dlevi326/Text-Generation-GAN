Last year, the drug brought in $5.76 billion and represented a quarter of Amgen's top line. Novartis said it would start selling the first biosimilar drug in the U.S. at a 15% discount to the original.\nXencor, also based in California, specializes in developing monoclonal antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune disorders and asthma, among other conditions. Its XmAb platform is used to make subtle changes to the structure of monoclonal antibodies, and Xencor has eight drug candidates in clinical development.\nUnder the terms, Xencor will receive a $45 million upfront payment and is eligible for up to $1.7 billion in milestone payments. Xencor may also receive royalties, the companies said.\nShares in Amgen, down about 4.5% this year, were inactive premarket. Xencor's stock, about flat year-to-date, surged 30% in premarket trading.\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com\n 16, 2015 08:53 ET (12:53 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T03:16:33.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
