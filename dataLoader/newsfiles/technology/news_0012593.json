They are aimed at protecting consumers, preventing money laundering and boosting cyber-security.\n\"Issuing the first BitLicense is an important milestone in the long-term development of the virtual currency industry,\" Anthony Albanese, the regulator's acting superintendent, said in a statement.\n\"Putting in place rules of the road that help protect consumers from loss or theft and root out illicit activity is vital to building trust in this new financial technology.\"\nCircle is backed by $76 million in venture capital from Goldman Sachs Group Inc and others, according to its website. It did not immediately comment on the license.\n(Editing by Jonathan Oatis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:36:09.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
