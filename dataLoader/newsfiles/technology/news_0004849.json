Lenovo/Motorola has partnered with Chinese company Mobvoiz to provide the search and voice recognition including the ability to dictate messages.\nAdditionally, the companies will use Sogou for maps, and downloading compatible apps means you will have to go through whatever local app store is available since Google's Google Play Store is not available in China.\nSource:\nVerge\nPermalink | Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:26:23.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
