Strat Aero wants to build on tie-ups which have already included deals to provide training in how to fly drones. Drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have traditionally been used by the military for surveillance purposes. But Strat Aero hopes to supply them to farmers for land surveys and utilities for power line and wind turbine inspections. The news came as Strat Aero appointed former Vodafone director Paul Ryan as a non-executive director. Ryan will be responsible for developing the UAV-related services that the company offers including provision of software hardware and pilot training services both military and commercial. He worked for Vodafone (LON:VOD) in a number of senior roles between 2002 to 2013. Before that he was a management consultant in European telecoms served as a strategic adviser at telecoms regulator Ofcom and was a solicitor at international City law firm Ashurst. He is managing director Europe and Africa for cellular messaging alert company CMAS Holdings. Strat Aero chief executive Russell Peck said: \"The board has recognised that the opportunity in the sector is continuously widening and as a result is looking to further strengthen its management team with similar high calibre professionals with international blue chip commercial experience. \"Additionally in line with an expanding strategy it is assessing a number of potential partnership and acquisition opportunities which would transform the company's activities.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:09:52.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
