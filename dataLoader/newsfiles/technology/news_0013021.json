Day guests are also able to purchase water park admission online, print out their receipt or display it on their smart phone at the ticketing booth, and receive a Smart Band® to gain park access. Each Smart Band® contains an RFID microchip that is assigned a unique ID number to match a guest's folio. \n\"Personal data is never in jeopardy because Smart Band® is linked to guests' hotel room number and not their bank or credit accounts,\" said Robin Barber, Vice President of Leisure and Entertainment for PDC. \nWhen Smart Band® is scanned by an RFID reader attached to hotel door locks, turnstiles and point of sale stations , guest data is automatically verified, providing a hassle-free environment without a need for cash, cards, and keys. Smart Band® is non-transferable and waterproof, so it will not get lost or become de-magnetized, which is a common occurrence with magnetic strip key cards. \n\"Unlike other RFID wristband providers, PDC provides a consultative approach and managed our entire integration process from discovery to execution,\" said Daylene Stroebe, Project Manager for Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in the Pocono Mountains. \"Now that our guests are able to enter our park and complete purchases with a simple wave of the wrist, transactions are quicker and time spent waiting in line is reduced.\" \nSmart Band® can be completely customized and features full-color printing capabilities to support company branding guidelines, graphics and text. The wristbands are available in a variety of materials including plastic , silicone and woven fabric and are offered with one-time closures for single-day use applications or rewearable styles for season pass holders. \nAbout PDC \nWith more than 55 years of experience, PDC connects people, products, and technology through innovative ID systems that deliver superior customer experiences worldwide.
