RELATED NEW DELHI: Even as the Indian IT industry continues to grapple with visa issues in the US, proposed changes in the UK's migration policy, which include limiting the number of work visas and increasing the minimum-salary threshold for skilled workers, are worrying IT services companies. The UK is the second largest market for Indian IT companies after the US, accounting for about 18 % or about $18-$19 billion, of export revenue annually, according to industry body Nasscom. Indian IT companies, including TCS, Infosys and Wipro, make use of intra-company transfer (ICT) visas, which fall under UK's tier-II visas that pertain to skilled workers from outside the UK. The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), a body which advises the UK government, has asked for suggestions from partners to help it formulate a response to the review of tier-II visas. Among the questions asked is the impact of putting tighter ICT \"restrictions on the IT sector specifically\" and the impact of the use of ICT provisions in the IT sector on existing UK companies and resident workers. \"The main issue is multi-fold — the current consultation appears to target every sort of restriction conceivable viz. ICT visa being tied up with skills shortages only, caps, quotas, increased salary levels, new levies, taking allowances outside the salary, etc. All of these measures will explicitly or implicitly make it difficult to transfer skilled workers for short duration or make the transfers expensive,\" said Gagan Sabharwal, director, Global Trade Development, Nasscom. The move to amend migration policy is part of British PM David Cameron's pledge to bring down the annual net migration in UK from outside the European Union to 100,000. According to Back-The-Mac, a group that campaigns against the use of ICT visas, the number of Indian workers on ICT visas in the UK was the highest at 36,762 as of December 2014. \"The most worrisome proposal is the restriction on numbers of tier-II visas as that will reduce deployment agility. The second one is the increased cost due to the minimum wage and additional employer levy which will increase the cost of delivery and adversely affect market competitiveness for Indian companies,\" said Sanjoy Sen, doctoral research scholar, Aston Business School, UK. Phil Fersht, founder and CEO of HfS Research, agreed that there should be some concern in the IT industry about the proposed changes. \"However, I would argue that the worry is more around protecting 'legacy' IT services models, as opposed to the 'as-a-service' models we are evolving towards,\" Fersht added. Nasscom said there will be no impact on net migration in the UK because of the ICT visa, which is similar to the L-1 visas used in the US. \"The ICT visa that our members use does not have the option of 'leave to remain' in the UK — meaning no worker can stay in the UK and has to come back after expiry of the project or visa (whichever is earlier),\" said Sabharwal.
