They have also been criticized by artists such as pop star Taylor Swift for not paying them enough. \n\nPresent in 180 countries but with the bulk of clients in France, some 4.8 million of Deezer's paying customers get access because the service is bundled with their mobile service from telecom operators like Orange, Vodafone, and Deutsche Telekom. \n\nDeezer's biggest challenges will be competing with Spotify, with its huge lead in the United States, and Apple's new Beats 1service. Profitability depends on wrangling better terms for music licenses, which now account for 80% of its costs. \n\nSpotify has 15 million paying customers and raised about $500 million from investors in June, valuing it at $8.5 billion, according to media reports. \n\nDeezer has avoided direct competition with Spotify by focusing on emerging markets in Asia and Africa. It is marginal in the US where it sells the service only via speaker maker Bose and wireless carrier Cricket, owned by AT&T. \n\nIt also has a different strategy focused less on advertising and more on distribution via partnerships with 40 telecom operators, and makers of mobile phones and wireless speakers. \n\n\"The streaming music market will not be 'winner takes all' so we are confident in our ability to carve out a place,\" said chief executive Hans-Holger Albrecht. \n\nDeezer's revenue rose 41% in the first half of this year to 93.2 million euros, and stood at 142 million euros last year. By 2018, it aims for positive monthly core earnings (EBITDA) and cash flow and sales of 750 million. \n\nThe floatation will allow Deezer to improve its product and distribution, Albrecht said, without giving details of the size or pricing of the issue. \n\nDeezer decided to go public and not do a fundraising round in part because it wanted to tap markets before Spotify. \n\nNew shares will be issued in the listing since existing shareholders are not expected to sell down their stakes. \n\nDeezer's largest shareholder with 27% is tycoon Len Blavatnik's Access Industries, while Orange owns 11%. Three music labels, Warner Music, Sony Music and Universal Music, part of Vivendi, together own about 15% of the shares. \n\nBNP Paribas and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are managing the listing, along with Citigroup and Societe Generale.
