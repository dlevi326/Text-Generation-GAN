Pre-1994 racism dictated how human-beings were treated based how differently they looked from other human species. The same treatment sadly still occurs subtly and more deadly than ever before to this day. South Africa however is not alone in this case; racism is a global phenomenon which I personally struggle to make sense of in my little head.\nI need to put up a disclaimer from the beginning that this piece is not coming from an angry human species with a brown skin colour, but a fellow human being who wants to understand the wisdom behind this evil monster called ‘racism’.\nIf someone could explain to me why a human being would treat another human being differently simply because they don’t look the same as them, treat one another unfairly because they don’t have the same hair. What are the compelling reasons that would lead to such a horrible treatment? I struggle to understand why you would treat people differently simply because they have a different skin colour; skin colour which they did not even choose to have. I struggle to understand why someone with the same qualification and years of experience as a white person would earn far less simply because they have a brown skin and an afro hair. I struggle to understand the rationale for the apartheid regime and their architects thereof; what crimes did these human beings with a brown skin colour commit that merited them to be treated so badly?\nRacism is rife and prevalent not only here in our beloved country, but worldwide; pretending that racism doesn’t exist is like denying that you are alive because of your breathing. Sounds stupid doesn’t? Yeah that’s the point.\nRacism is not funny, it’s an evil monster that has unnecessarily destroyed many lives and still doing so every day, every hour, every minute and second for no reason whatsoever. There is absolutely nothing in this universe that justifies why you should treat someone else differently not because they have been convicted of a crime or declared ‘stupid’ by a court of common sense, but simply because they look different than you. I challenge someone brainy, scholarly, but most importantly with some common sense to explain to me what justifies unfair treatment of one person to another simply because they don’t look the same as you.\nIn as far as I am concerned, nothing should differentiate a so called “black person” from a “white person”, we are all breathing the same air, there are no different statuses or classes of air, and once you have breathed your last, that’s the only time you could differentiate between the died from the living.\nIf you think racism is justifiable and acceptable that some people are superiors than others simply because of the colour of their skin, I would love to hear your views and your thinking. However, if you are battling to understand this phenomenon as I am, won’t you take up the challenge and start treating every person equally irrespective of their colour skins as human beings breathing the same colourless, economically free air as you? Let’s stop classifying and comparing ourselves to other people to inflate or deflate our egos. Deep inside you are a human being, a son and a daughter not a colour, never reduce who you are to a mere meaningless colour. Remember it’s not how you look that defines you, but how you look within yourself that defines who you truly are.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T18:09:04.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
