Leaders of the project, codenamed Titan, have been given permission to triple the 600-person team, the people familiar with the matter said.\nApple has hired experts in driverless cars, but the people familiar with Apple’s plans said the Cupertino, California company doesn’t currently plan to make its first electric vehicle fully autonomous. That capability is part of the product’s long-term plans, the people familiar with the matter said.\nApple’s commitment is a sign that the company sees an opportunity to become a player in the automotive industry by applying expertise that it has honed in developing iPhones — in areas such as batteries, sensors and hardware-software integration — to cars.\nThere are many unanswered questions about Apple’s automotive foray. It isn’t clear whether Apple has a manufacturing partner to become the car equivalent of Hon Hai Precision Industry, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer that builds most iPhones and is known by the trade name Foxconn.\nMost major automakers build and run their own factories, but that hasn’t been Apple’s strategy with iPhones or iPads. Contract manufacturing in the auto industry usually is limited to a few niche models.\nThe 2019 target is ambitious. Building a car is a complex endeavour, even more so for a company without any experience. Once Apple completes its designs and prototypes, a vehicle would still need to undergo a litany of tests before it could clear regulatory hurdles.\nIn Apple’s parlance, a “ship date” doesn’t necessarily mean the date that customers receive a new product; it can also mean the date that engineers sign off on the product’s main features.\nIt isn’t uncommon for a project of this size and complexity to miss ship-date deadlines. People familiar with the project said there is scepticism within the team that the 2019 target is achievable.\nThe global market for electric cars has been weak because of low gas prices and concerns about vehicle price and battery range. To date, Tesla Motors and Nissan sell two of the best-known and highest-volume battery-powered vehicles, but volumes are only a sliver of the industry’s 85 million annual vehicle sales.\nEmissions standards are tightening around the world, however, leading most major car companies to invest billions of dollars in plans to launch electric cars between now and the end of the decade.\nBy the time an Apple car would make its debut, brands spanning General Motors Chevrolet to Volkswagen AG’s Audi and Porsche will have long-range electric vehicles aimed at the mass market.\nEarlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple had several hundred people investigating an electric vehicle with an initial design resembling a minivan.\nApple has ramped up hiring since then, pulling in veterans from the auto industry as well as battery and machine-vision experts. People inside Apple said employees from across the company have been reassigned to Titan, similar to how Apple assembled a team for the Apple Watch.\nThose involved include DJ Novotney, an Apple veteran with a history of successfully shipping products. Mr. Novotney, one of the first hires to the program last year, is a vice president of program management, overseeing a growing team of managers who co-ordinate activities among various teams. He didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nAsked last week by late-night talk-show host Stephen Colbert about Apple’s interest in a driverless car, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said: “We look at a number of things along the way, and we decide to really put our energies in a few of them.”\nGene Munster, an equity analyst with Piper Jaffray, in a September 1 research note estimated Apple’s chances of making a car at between 50 per cent and 60 per cent. He said he expects any Apple car to have three distinctive features: a unique design; the ability to work with other Apple devices; and some autonomous capability.\nAs Apple pushes forward, the company is finding it difficult to keep its automobile interest under wraps.\nIn May, Apple employees met with officials from GoMentum Station, a 5,000-acre former Navy weapons station east of San Francisco that is now a secure testing facility for autonomous and connected vehicles.\nIn emails obtained by The Wall Street Journal through a public-records request, Apple expressed interest in scheduling time at the facility.\nThen in August, an Apple lawyer met with officials from California’s Department of Motor Vehicles. In an email, the DMV said the meeting with Apple focused on “the autonomous-vehicle testing regulations that went into effect in September of 2014”.\nBoth meetings were earlier reported by The Guardian.\nUpdated profiles of recent Apple hires on LinkedIn, the professional social network, provide other hints. They include, for example, an engineer who specialises in automobile chassis.\n— Mike Ramsey contributed to this article\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T04:14:18.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
