Brown, legislative Democrats scale back climate package Thursday, 10 September 2015 (2 minutes ago) (AP) — Gov. Jerry Brown and legislative Democrats announced Wednesday that they are scaling back their ambitious proposal to address climate change by dropping a mandate that the state cut petroleum use by 50 percent amid ongoing opposition from the oil industry and some lawmakers. Brown and Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, a Los Angeles Democrat, had pushed a far-reaching proposal to cut petroleum use by half, boost renewable-electricity use to 50 percent and double energy efficiency in existing buildings. Brown said the primary sticking points for moderate Democrats in the state Assembly concerned the California Air Resources Board, an unelected body with broad power to set vehicle emissions and fuel standards to decide how the state will reduce oil use. Many Assembly Democrats — including moderates and those representing less wealthy districts — expressed concerns that the proposal would hurt California's economy and working-class residents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T05:19:12.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
