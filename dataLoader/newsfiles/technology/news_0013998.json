Belorossov, who used the online alias \"Rainerfox,\" downloaded one version of Citadel in 2012 and eventually gained access to more than 7,000 computer systems, U.S. authorities said. \nMicrosoft Corp and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, working with authorities in dozens of countries, launched an assault in 2013 on the malicious computer networks that were used by the Citadel gang. The company said the attack had freed as many as five million personal computers from the malware. \nThe global crime ring was believed to have stolen more than $500 million from dozens of financial institutions, including American Express Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse AG, PayPal Holdings Inc, HSBC Holdings PLC, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Royal Bank of Canada and Wells Fargo & Co, Microsoft said in 2013. \nBelorossov was extradited from Spain in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T04:23:31.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
