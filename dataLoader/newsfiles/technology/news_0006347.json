(Photo: Apple)\n16 CONNECT 61 TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Q. I upgraded my first-generation iPad mini to iOS 9 and everything seems to have gone well--but the Maps app isn’t offering transit directions. What happened?\nA. This happened to me earlier this week when I downloaded Apple’s latest iOS update on the afternoon of its release . It was the most perplexing experience I’ve had with this iPad mini since I bought it in the fall of 2012 : Instead of offering the advertised transit directions, Maps made the same suggestion to install a third-party app for transit guidance as iOS 8’s version.\nSo I did what most users do — I thought I’d done something wrong and tried to make it right. I reset my iPad’s settings while keeping my apps and data, then wiped the tablet and restored it from a backup, then factory-reset it as a new device.\nEach time, Maps would only offer driving and walking directions in the cities where it’s supposed to offer transit help (in the U.S., only Baltimore, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington). I’ve since found reports of the same problem from users of older iPhones and an older iPad .\nApple’s description of iOS 9, from the press release to its sales pitch for Apple Maps to its listing of iOS 9-compatible devices , doesn’t mention any device-specific hangup with transit navigation.\nThat last page does warn iOS users that Siri and some multitasking options don’t work on vintage devices, so it’s not as if Apple doesn’t know to give a heads-up about compatibility issues on devices of a certain age.\nApple PR confirmed that transit navigation is confined to a subset of iOS 9-capable devices: the iPad Air and newer versions, the iPad mini 2 and its successors, the iPhone 5 and subsequent models, and the sixth-generation iPod touch.\nWhy that wasn’t spelled out on Apple’s site remains a mystery, as does what exactly made those older iDevices ineligible for transit navigation.\nParsing the company’s technical documentation and quizzing two longtime iOS developers did, however, bring up a couple of reasons why a new iOS app might not work on a device running the latest version of iOS.\nOne is a graphics framework called Metal that many recent apps use for smoother, faster visuals. Metal requires the A7 and A8 processors in new iPhones and iPads — starting with the iPhone 5s, released shortly before the first iPad mini, and then the iPad Air and iPad mini 2.\nAnother is the shift from 32-bit processors like the one in the 2012-vintage iPad mini to 64-bit processors that work with larger chunks of data. That’s made some iOS 9 features off-limits to old hardware. For example, Safari’s new support for ad-filtering extensions requires a 64-bit processor, as developer Marco Arment tweeted Thursday to answer questions about his ( since-withdrawn ) Peace add-on .\nEither factor could also explain why iOS 9’s Proactive Assistant app (it should occupy the screen to the left of your home screen) doesn’t show up on my iPad mini. Its absence on older iOS devices has occasionally confused even iOS developers .\nWhatever the cause, the effect is clear. If you have an aging iPhone or iPad, you’d best stick to a non-Apple navigation app like Google Maps--which not only tolerates Metal-incapable, 32-bit processors but has long provided the bicycling directions that remain missing from iOS 9.\nTips: Shush the iOS Tips app\nIn both iOS 8 and iOS 9, Apple’s Tips app can be a pointless source of distraction as it pops up notifications about shortcuts you learned long ago. You can’t uninstall that app (Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowski that the company might allow that eventually ), but you can banish it from your iPhone or iPad’s notifications.\nTo do that, open the Settings app, tap Notifications, scroll down and select “Tips,” then tap the slider button next to “Allow Notifications” so that it’s no longer highlighted in green.\nRob Pegoraro is a tech writer based out of Washington, D.C.
