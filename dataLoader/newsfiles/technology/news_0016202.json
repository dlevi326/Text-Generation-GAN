By Marlowe HOOD Paris (AFP) Sept 8, 2015 Scientists glean social insights from sperm whale dialects Halifax, Nova Scotia (UPI) Sep 9, 2015 - In decoding the dialects of sperm whale chatter, researchers are beginning to understand why and how the Pacific whales form clans.\nNew research suggests Pacific sperm whales -- like chimpanzees, killer whales and some species of birds -- are social learners whose existence includes a cultural component. \nThe revelation is the product of a combination of extensive field work and computer modeling. Through decades of observations, scientists have shown that Pacific sperm whales form clans, and their socializing patterns correspond with unique behaviors and language patterns -- combinations of clicking sounds called \"codas.\" \nAs part of the latest research effort, researchers from Canada zeroed in on two clans near the Galapagos Islands. Even among sperm whales inhabiting the same close quarters, codas dictated which groups of whales traveled and hunted together. \nNext, scientists used their data to build computer models that might explain the clan's formation. Researchers plugged different scenarios into their model, examining the possibility that codas formed individually or innately via genetic coding. \n\"We try to backtrack the patterns we observe in the wild to infer how the clan segregation could have evolved,\" Mauricio Cantor, a marine biologist and PhD candidate at Dalhousie University, said in a press release. \"The computer will simulate the life of several sperm whale populations that acquire codas in different ways over thousands of years. At the end, we see which case could produce clans with different dialects.\" \nThe scenario that made the most sense mathematically was social learning. Researchers say whales copy and learn codas from other whales, but that their learning is likely biased -- meaning the whales don't choose their clan and coda freely. They likely pick their clan's coda in a variety of ways: by conforming to the group, learning codas that are most similar to their natural intonation, and by mimicking the codas of their family and thus the larger clan. \n\"Our findings show that biased social learning is a required ingredient for the segregation of clans of sperm whales with different 'dialects',\" said Cantor, lead author of a new paper on the subject, which was published this week in the journal Nature Communications. \nThese codas serve to reinforce social cohesion among groups of whales that hunt, migrate and talk together. \n\"This gives us evidence that key features of human culture -- which we think makes us so different from everything else in nature -- might be at play in populations of other animals,\" Cantor concluded. \"Maybe we're not as different as we thought.\" \nSperm whales create social cliques based on a shared dialect of vocal clicks, evidence that humans are not alone in having culture, according to research published Tuesday. \nCombining data gleaned from decades of field observation and computer models, the study suggests social learning, rather that genetic transmission, explains how these giant sea mammals cohere into distinct \"clans\". \nScientists have long known that sperm whales living in stable communities -- composed mainly of females and their calves -- communicate using patterns of vocal clicks, called codas. \nThey have also determined that these highly intelligent creatures, boasting the largest brains in the animal kingdom, interact most frequently with other whales using a shared dialect. \n\"It is quite rare to find groups of animals of the same species in the same area with unique behaviours,\" said lead author Mauricio Canto, a biology professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. \n\"What we didn't know, was how these different sperm whale 'dialects' evolved,\" Canto told AFP. \nIt might be chance variations, or genetically imprinted patterns passed along to offspring. \nBut Canto, building on previous work, suspected it was something else: whales learning directly from their peers, especially those closest to them. \nTo test his theory, Canto and colleagues fed 30 years of field work on sperm whales living near the Galapagos Islands into data-crunching computers. \n\"Basically, we translated all we know about sperm whale biology into computer models, which simulated the life of different whale populations over time,\" he explained. \n- 'Culture war' - \nThe researchers devised 20 different scenarios that might generate codas -- based on genetics, learning, even random improvisation -- and then let each virtual whale population evolve over thousands of years. \n\"Computer models help us make an informed guess of what has generated clans of whales with distinct 'dialects',\" he said. \nThe results, published in Nature Communications, all pointed in the same direction: the formation of whale communities with a common dialect was rooted in \"behaviour that is socially learned and shared with a subset of the population\". \nAs it turns out, this is also one definition -- albeit a broad one -- of culture, thought by many to be a unique and defining characteristic of the human species. And that's where opinions divide sharply. \nOver the last 15 years, another kind of \"culture war\" has pitted experts, notably anthropologists, against a small but growing band of biologists on the question of whether whales, dolphins, great apes, elephants and some song birds could be said to have culture. \nMost of the debate revolves around how you define it. \n\"We do not suggest that animal cultures are the same as the diverse, symbolic and cumulative human cultures,\" Cantor said. \n\"But like us, animals can discover new things, learn and copy things from each other, and pass along this information over generations.\" \nOther research, for example, has shown that the complex songs of humpback whales -- different across regions -- change so quickly over time that only learning can account for it. \nAnd orcas, also known as killer whales, have been observed teaching each other hunting tricks. \nHowever it is defined, research on shared learning among animals also raises the intriguing question of how culture, and not just environmental pressures, can shape long-term evolution, researchers say. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T17:55:31.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
