The upgrades include new speech, language and vision tools that IBM said will help organizations tap what is projected to be a $143 billion app market next year.\nAfter Watson's \"Jeopardy\" success in 2011, IBM moved to commercialize the system which has differentiated itself from other analytical software in its ability to \"learn.\" For example, the company has been testing Watson with researchers at Cleveland Clinic, among others, and has hoped Watson will learn to interpret imagery, medical records and other data to reveal patterns relevant to diagnosis and treatment that a human physician may miss.\nOn Thursday, IBM said about 100 of its Watson partners, including developers at startups and established businesses, have introduced cognitive enabled apps, products and services into the market.\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"NIRI Demo Co\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US4592001014\n 24, 2015 10:45 ET (14:45 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US4592001014", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T00:04:43.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
