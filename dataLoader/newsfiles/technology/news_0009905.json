The two firms will work together to integrate TrellisWare TSM mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) radio technology into Aeryon’s SkyRanger sUAS. \nThis partnership will deliver new and unique capabilities to Aeryon SkyRanger sUAS operators, including the ability to: Deploy SkyRanger, carrying an integrated TrellisWare TW-600 Ocelot radio payload, as an airborne communications relay node extending the bubble of the TSM network beyond-line-of-sight (for example, to the far side of a hill or building) and ensuring communication is maintained between ground-based personnel Distribute real-time video from the Aeryon SkyRanger into the TSM network, enabling remote personnel up to 26 miles (42 km) away to benefit from the aerial situational awareness obtained by the aircraft \n“Our partnership with TrellisWare exhibits the extensible and secure architecture of the Aeryon SkyRanger, making it ideal for military sUAS operators,” commented Dave Kroetsch, President and CEO of Aeryon Labs Inc. “The integration of SkyRanger and the TrellisWare TSM solutions illustrates how sUAS provide a safe and reliable way for ground-based and remote personnel to make informed decisions in high-risk situations.” \n“Small UAVs are an important operational asset to our customers across the globe,” said Tom Carter, TrellisWare’s President and CEO. “The combination of Aeryon’s sUAS and TrellisWare’s TSM technologies deliver enhanced situational awareness and extended network coverage to every user.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:36:53.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
