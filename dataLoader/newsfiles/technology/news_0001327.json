Firstlogic Solutions will be introducing their new Firstlogic® DQ 9.1 “In-Cloud” services for USPS®, CASS™, NCOALink® and DSF2® address cleansing, data de-duplication and USPS PAVE™ Gold postal presorting and showcasing the “On-Premise” SAP Data Services (DS) 4.2 and Firstlogic Data Quality (DQ) 9.1 solutions. The SAP® Data Services (DS) 4.2 platform provides printers and mailers with the ability to profile, analyze, parse, standardize, correct, enhance, match, consolidate and monitor their U.S. and international data across multiple languages. SAP DS users are able to assess the quality of inbound data and perform batch and real-time address cleansing, geocoding and duplicate detection. Printers and Mailers can also leverage the matching capability of SAP Data Quality Management (DQM) to de-duplicate customer databases or to perform householding for target marketing campaigns.\n“The new Firstlogic® DQ 9.1 “In-Cloud” services provide customers with additional processing capabilities to augment their current “On-Premise” capabilities to include USPS®, CASS™, NCOALink® 18 & 48 month and DSF2® address cleansing, data de-duplication and USPS PAVE™ Gold postal presorting leveraging the world-class Firstlogic ACE®, DataRight IQ®, Match/Consolidate® and Presort IQ™ solutions,” said Alex Kucera, Director of Solutions Sales. “These new service options provide a much more cost effective approach compared to the costs to acquire the licensing required to run these services on-premise,” says Kucera.\nThe Firstlogic® DQ 9.1 “On-Premise” platform includes DataRight IQ®, Match/Consolidate® and ACE® CASS™/NCOALink®/ DSF2® platform. Many Firstlogic DQ 9.1 customers use ACE for address cleansing and geocoding, DataRight IQ for data cleansing and standardization and Match/Consolidate for de-duplication and householding. The Firstlogic DQ 9.1 applications are built from the proven SAP Postalsoft platform based on 30-years of world-class development.\n“The Firstlogic DQ 9.1 “On-Premise” platform is fully supported on the proven Windows®, Linux®, AIX® and Solaris® operating systems. This means that customers can remain on their existing infrastructure without disruption. And for those customers already running Job-Files, the upgrade to Firstlogic® DQ 9.1 is a simple process,” said Jeff Hay, Director of Solutions Support. “Customers simply run their Job-Files through the Edjob utility with no need to change any scripts, status codes or business processes,” says Hay.\n“We’re excited to be exhibiting and announcing our new Firstlogic DQ 9.1 “In-Cloud” services at Graph Expo 2015. We’re also encouraged to see so many of our SAP Data Services and Firstlogic Data Quality printer and mailer customers attending and exhibiting at Graph Expo,” said Ken Kucera, Managing Principal at Firstlogic Solutions. “We’re also looking forward to meeting new printers and mailers seeking simple and cost effective data quality solutions based on their specific needs,” says Kucera.\nTo learn more about the SAP Data Services and Firstlogic Data Quality (DQ) products, please call 1-888-725-7800 or visit the website at http://www.firstlogicsolutions.com .
