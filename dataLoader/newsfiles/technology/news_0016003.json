The fastest blue hedgehog we've ever seen, @sonic_hedgehog has arrived to the Golden Island.

It seems that he’s found a new lease of life on mobile. \nRovio recently launched Angry Birds 2 , six years after the original, but the company has been branching out into too many things — as such, it recently announced it was cutting up to 260 jobs as it looks to refocus its efforts. And Sonic, it seems, is only too happy to help out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T13:47:40.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
