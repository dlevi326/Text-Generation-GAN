The main difference between the two is in the design of their faces -- the Gear S2 Classic looks more like a regular watch, while it's obvious the Gear S2 is a smartwatch with apps.\nThey run Samsung's Tizen operating system and can sync with any device having 1.5 GB of RAM or more, running Android 4.4 or later.\nDesigned by Italian post-modernist designer and architect Alessandro Mendini, both watches are round and customizable, have various sensors, and come preloaded with apps.\nOptional 3G connectivity includes an e-SIM card with voice capability, allowing greater functionality without a smartphone nearby.\nThings of Beauty \"I like the approach,\" enthused Ramon Llamas, a research manager at IDC . \"First and foremost, they look like watches.\"\nEarlier Samsung Gear smartwatches \"look like miniaturized computers. The aesthetics weren't really there, and the navigation was pitiful,\" he told TechNewsWorld. \"These new watches are elegant and look like high-end watches.\"\nThe circular look \"is a smart choice for a smartwatch design, because the most popular traditional watch designs are round,\" remarked Angela McIntyre, a research director at Gartner .\nWhat It's Got and What It Does The Gear S2 (and Gear S2 Classic) has a 1.2-inch circular Super AMOLED screen with 360 x 360 resolution at 302 ppi. It has a 1-GHz dual-core processor.\nThe watch is always on, and it has a battery life of two to three days, Samsung said. It can be charged wirelessly.\nThe Gear S2 has 4 GB of internal memory and 512 MB of RAM. Users can access contacts, notifications, messages and email.\nIt supports voice input, emoticons and keypads, and comes loaded with preset text responses.\nOther features include voice memo, Find My Device, power-saving mode, safety assistance and a privacy lock.\nThe Gear S2 comes preloaded with health and fitness apps and can display news, maps, navigation, weather information and the user's schedule. It also has a music player and a gallery.\nIt is IP 68 certified , effectively making it dustproof and waterproof.\nIt supports WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1 and near-field communication.\nPacked inside the 11.4-mm thick Gear S2 are an accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate and ambient light monitors, and a barometer.\nSmartphones Are So Yesterday A rotating bezel lets Gear S2 users navigate the interface. Side buttons access various preset apps and functions.\nThe apps on the Gear S2 show Samsung \"can utilize the whole watch face, which is still a challenge for the Moto 360,\" Gartner's McIntyre told TechNewsWorld.\nNFC technology enables mobile payments on the S2 and the inclusion of FidMe allows users to store digital loyalty cards.\nFidMe is one of Samsung's five global partners for the Gear smartwatch, the others being Yelp , Baidu, Apposter and CNN. Samsung is working with partners across various industries to broaden the applicability of its smartwatches.\nThe S2 can be used to control smart locks powered by UniKey and Yale Real Living locks.\n\"Samsung likes to be out on the leading edge, and their vision is an NFC wearable hooking up with an IoT ecosystem,\" IDC's Llamas remarked.\nCalling all Devs! Developing Tizen apps will be critical for the success of Samsung's Gear line, said Al Hilwa, a program director at IDC.\nThe Galaxy S2 can connect to Android phones from other makers, which \"is key, because most of the buyers of this watch will likely have Android phones,\" he told TechNewsWorld. However, Samsung \"has to work hard with specific publishers to bring them to the platform.\"\nSamsung \"will have to fight for the attention of app developers,\" observed McIntyre, \"who are busy coding for Apple Watch OS2, Android Wear watches and Pebble watches.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.euroboxenclosures.co.uk/IP-Ratings-Explained.html", "http://www.fidme.com/en", "http://www.ectnews.com/images/end-enn.gif", "http://www.gartner.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED"], "published": "2015-09-10T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:28:38.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
