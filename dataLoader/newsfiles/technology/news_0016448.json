That is what we set out to examine in this study,\" said one of the researchers Thanos Tzounopoulos, associate professor at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. \nThe research was conducted on mice. The researchers found that resilience to tinnitus was linked to reduced activity of KCNQ channel. \nThe investigators believe a combination of drugs that enhance KCNQ channel activity and reduce activity of another called hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel could promote resilience and reduce susceptibility to tinnitus. \nThe findings were published online in the journal eLife.
