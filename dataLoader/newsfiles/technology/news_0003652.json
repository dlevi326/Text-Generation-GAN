Today, over 14 million consumers actively use Olo's platform to expedite their restaurant orders to Skip the LineÂ®. The addition of Dispatch provides them the option of having orders conveniently delivered as well. \nOlo's new service was built in response to increasing consumer interest for on-demand restaurant delivery, reflected by the weekly use of delivery services nearly doubling over the past five years. With the industry awash with a new class of technology enabled Delivery Service Providers (DSPs) like Postmates, Caviar, DoorDash, and OrderUp (recently acquired by GRPN) seeking to service local delivery needs, there has not been a sustainable option for larger regional and national brands until now. Dispatch creates a national network of DSPs that augment a restaurant brand's existing digital ordering program and enable its locations to offer delivery service regardless of location. \n\"The missing link in restaurant delivery today has been a logistics stack to synchronize orders - from the kitchen to delivery courier and the restaurant guest,\" said Noah Glass, Founder & CEO of Olo. \"Dispatch helps our clients properly coordinate delivery orders seamlessly, while supporting our mission to help them maximize restaurant revenue per square foot.\" \nDispatch integrates with today's growing number of DSPs to provide a comprehensive delivery network and real-time price quotes for food delivery. Restaurant brands can now rapidly deploy delivery at scale with a service fully integrated into their point-of-sale platform and kitchen production systems, all the while maintaining a sovereign relationship with their loyal guests instead of forcing them to order from third-party marketplace websites. \n\"The growing use of delivery services is a great way for us to build our business, but today the delivery networks are very fractured,\" said Dave Lehn, CIO of Noodles & Company (NASDAQ: NDLS), an Olo partner. \"We need a way to consolidate the providers so we can offer delivery across all of our 450+ restaurants.\" \nHow Dispatch Works:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T11:16:37.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
