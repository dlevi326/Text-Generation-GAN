The short point is it (the case) has to go through the process as prescribed in the Competition Act... The parties (concerned) have to be heard and then the Commission will come to a decision,\" Chawla said on the sidelines of a summit here. \n\nThe investigation report has been sent out to parties on both sides and their comments are awaited. The regulator refers cases to its investigative arm's director general (DG) for a detailed probe. \n\nThe DG report is believed to contain comments and inputs from a host of entities present in the internet business, including some well-known e-commerce firms and web portals. \n\nWhile submissions from some of them appear to suggest violations on part of Google, others have sided with the US-based global giant. \n\n\"We are currently reviewing this report from the CCI's ongoing investigation. We continue to work closely with CCI and remain confident that we comply fully with India's competition laws,\" a Google spokesperson had said in August. \n\nCCI, which first received a complaint against Google back in 2011, has been looking into allegations that the company abused its dominant position in the search engine space for well over three years. \n\nParticipating in the Skoch summit on 'Transformative Governance', Chawla said transformative governance is critical as it helps to ensure efficiency, transparency as well as strengthen institutions.
