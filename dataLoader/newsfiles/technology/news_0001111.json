The vessel has an overall length of 75m, waterline length of 72m, draught of 3.3m, breadth of 10.8m and displacement of 1,250t. \nThe vessel can carry 60 members and is equipped with a flight deck to support the operation of one helicopter or one unmanned aerial vehicle. It is capable of carrying two rigid hulled inflatable boats (RHIBs) for boarding operations. \nA lightweight, rapid-fire naval gun, designed and manufactured by Oto Melara, allows the vessel to engage shore-based targets. The vessel can be armed with secondary guns and torpedoes. Mission systems aboard Al-Ofouq class vessel Austal High Speed Support Vessel (HSSV) 72, Oman \nThe HSSV 72 vessel is intended for the transportation of military personnel and cargo, and can support helicopter operations. \nThe patrol vessel is operated and controlled from an on-board integrated bridge, which is equipped with navigation systems, multifunctional workstations and a standardised human machine interface. \nThales Nederland's Tacticos combat management system (CMS) provides a high-degree of automation, situation awareness, weapon deployment, recognition and identification of targets, as well as threat evolution. \nAl-Ofouq vessels are equipped with the Variant lightweight, multi-purpose, short-to-medium range 2D air and surface surveillance radar, which is capable of operating in both X-band and C-band and offers a low probability of interception. \nThe vessel uses Thales Nederland's STIR 1.2 EO Mk2 radar and EO tracking system, operating in both I and K-bands, for gun and missile fire control. It is also fitted with Thales' Vigile electronic support measures (ESM). Propulsion and performance \nThe Al-Ofouq class vessel is powered by two 20V 8000 M91 combined diesel or gas engines with a power output of 9,100kW each. It is installed with two controllable pitch propellers . \nThe vessel has a maximum speed of 25kt and a range of approximately 3,000nm at a speed of 16kt. Contractors involved \nThales Nederland was awarded a contract by ST Marine to supply and install sensors and a combat management system for the Al-Ofouq class patrol vessels in July 2012. \nRaytheon's German subsidiary Raytheon Anschuetz was selected to provide new-generation integrated bridge and navigation systems for the vessels in April 2013.
