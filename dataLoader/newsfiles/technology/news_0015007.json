Falcone Becomes Second Italian MONOPOLY World Champion, Wins $20,580 USD MONOPOLY Fortune Macao, China After ten hours of property space purchases, paying rent, and passing GO, Nicolò Falcone of Venice, Italy defeated 27 fellow competitive MONOPOLY players to win the 2015 MONOPOLY World Championship and take home the grand prize of $20,580, the equivalent of the “bank” in a standard MONOPOLY game. The 2015 World Championship gathered players from several nations around the world, including France, Peru, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the United States, and Mexico to The Venetian® Macao, China. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150908006259/en/ Nicolò Falcone of Venice, Italy is named the champion of the 2015 MONOPOLY World Championship at The Venetian Macao, China, Tuesday, September 8, 2015. Falcone defeated several top MONOPOLY players during the tournament to win the title and grand prize of $20,580, the equivalent of the “bank” in a standard MONOPOLY game. (FM Event Limited for Hasbro) The intense final game pitted Falcone against Tsutomu Doita of Japan, Brian Valentine of the United States, and reigning MONOPOLY World Champion, Bjørn Halvard Knappskog of Norway. After several masterful plays by the table, including a multi-player trade that secured each player his own property color set, Doita, who played as the top hat token, was the first to become bankrupt, followed by Valentine, who played as the battleship. Falcone, playing as the racecar and owning the orange property set, and Knappskog, playing as the thimble token and owning the green property set, battled head-to-head before Knappskog landed on two orange property spaces in succession and had to pay a fateful amount of rent to Falcone that he inevitably couldn’t recover from and led him to bankruptcy. Falcone has been playing the MONOPOLY game for 26 years and won his spot in the MONOPOLY World Championship by winning the 2015 MONOPOLY tournament in Italy. He now follows in the footsteps of several notable MONOPOLY Champions, including Lee Bayrd, the first-ever MONOPOLY World Champion who took home the prize in 1973 and was in attendance to cheer on and offer advice to players at this year’s MONOPOLY World Championship. “We are thrilled to celebrate the MONOPOLY brand’s 80 th anniversary by gathering players from around the world for the 2015 MONOPOLY World Championship,” said Jonathan Berkowitz, senior vice president of global marketing, Hasbro Gaming. “This group of competitive MONOPOLY players brought true dedication and talent to the game, especially the winner Nicolò Falcone whose winning strategy and technique helped pave his way to victory.” The first MONOPOLY World Championship tournament took place at Grossinger's Resort in New York in 1973. Since that time, 13 MONOPOLY tycoons have earned the title of World Champion, hailing from United States, Ireland, Singapore, Italy, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Japan, Netherlands, Hong Kong and Spain. The 2015 MONOPOLY World Championship was sponsored by The Venetian Macao, which is celebrating its 8 th anniversary this year. The event was organized by FM Event Limited and supported by the Macao Government Tourist Office and Aristo Securities Limited. The MONOPOLY brand will also celebrate its anniversary with the new MONOPOLY HERE & NOW: World Edition and U.S. Edition games, on shelves this fall. Earlier this year, Hasbro, Inc.
