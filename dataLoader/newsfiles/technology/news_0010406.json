One was about the destruction of Municipal property by striking workers in Soshanguve and the other about the greater chance of dying on the road in Gauteng than by any other form of crime. I use the word crime when referring to road accidents as, from my observation, they mostly result from a disregard for the rules of the road. The common denominator in so many of the headlines and articles carried in our media these days is CRIME!\nIt has become common place, in our rainbow nation, to lay the blame for crime on lack of education, unemployment, hunger, drugs, alcohol, ineptitude, lack of leadership, the list could go on and on, however is it as simple as that?\nDissatisfaction and destruction have gone hand in hand throughout the history of mankind-\"I am unhappy so let me kick the cat or dog, punch a door, smash or burn something.\" There are countless instances of this behaviour every single day. If these individual acts fail to get the desired result family violence, and death is often the result, sometimes with the use of two hand grenades! How did the alleged killer obtain two hand grenades? Obviously it involved a criminal act and/or a gross dereliction of duty on the part of someone else, in the same way, military weapons, police uniforms and other equipment find their way into the wrong hands.\nClearly there are serious issues that our Government should face up to and address before we slide into anarchy, I think it would be na√Øve to believe otherwise but perhaps there is an aspect to the whole situation that we overlook.\nOne does not need to go back too far in western history to see the impact of criminality and wanton destruction in European societies. Dissatisfaction lies at the heart of every revolution and in the anger exhibited in recent riots in the USA and the UK during which destruction of property and looting became the norm. Even the heroic firefighters in New York, many of whom gave their lives on 9/11, have, in their history, riots, arson and an element of racial fear little more than 150 years ago.\nDissatisfaction based destruction can be seen on the screen almost every day, Greece, Lebanon, Libya, Egypt, USA, South Africa, and many more. All bad examples to those dissatisfied individuals watching!\nSo what makes criminality any worse in the new South Africa, the apparent gratuitous violence and obscenity of some of the crime?\nAre we living in a world filled with unrealistic expectation, over population and the rapid consumption of dwindling resources which will ultimately lead to the most destructive dissatisfaction known to man, a crime against nature and mankind, nuclear war?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T20:14:20.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
