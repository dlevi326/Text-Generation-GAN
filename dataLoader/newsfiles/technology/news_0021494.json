Leddar optical time-of-flight sensing technology is based on direct time-of-flight measurement, but rather than working directly on the analog signal, Leddar light processing starts by sampling the receive echo for the detection range of the sensor. Leddar expands the sampling rate and resolution of this sampled signal. Finally, it analyzes the resulting discrete-time signal and recovers the distance for every object in its field of view.\nWhere other methods implement detection and ranging mostly through hardware, Leddar light processing utilizes complex algorithms implemented in software. Through signal processing, Leddar is capable of computing an accurate distance for an object with a very weak return echo. Using various filters, it is also able to detect objects in the presence of nuisance signals caused by dust, snow or raindrops.\nTo read the entire article, go to: http://bit.ly/1MhJpBU\nEngineering.com brings the most influential voices in engineering to a worldwide audience of engineers.
