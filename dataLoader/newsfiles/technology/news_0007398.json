Credit: NASA JPL/Doug Tyler \nTropical Storm Vamco lived for two days in the South China Sea. On the day it developed into a depression the RapidScat instrument aboard the International Space Station provided forecasters data on its surface winds. \nOn Sunday, September 13, Tropical Depression 19W developed and quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Vamco near Hainan in the South China Sea. \nThe RapidScat instrument measured Vamco's sustained winds on September 13 at 4 p.m. EDT. Maximum sustained winds were near 21 meters per second (46.9 mph/75.6 kph) on the storm 's southwestern side, along the coast of southeastern Vietnam. \nAt 1500 UTC (11 a.m. EDT) on Monday, September 14, 2015, Tropical Storm Vamco had maximum sustained winds near 35 knots (40 mph/62 kph). It was located just 42 nautical miles (48 miles/77 km) southeast of Da Nang, Vietnam near 15.5 North latitude and 108.3 East longitude. It was moving to the west at 8 knots (9.2 mph/14.8 kph). \nThe Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) noted that animated enhanced infrared imagery depicts the majority of the convection (thunderstorms and rain) over central Vietnam and north of the system. The position of the low-level center appears to be within 10 nautical miles of the Vietnam coastline. \nForecasters at JTWC expect Vamco to move west over the rugged terrain of Vietnam and Laos and completely dissipate. At 11 a.m. EDT, JTWC issued their final warning on this short-lived system. NASA's Aqua Satellite sees Tropical Depression Kujira at landfall June 24, 2015 \nTropical Depression Kujira made landfall in northeastern Vietnam early on June 24 as NASA's Aqua satellite passed overhead. RapidScat measures Typhoon Halola's concentrated winds July 14, 2015 \nTyphoon Halola's typhoon-force winds are tightly concentrated around its center. The RapidScat instrument that flies aboard the International Space Station measured those powerful winds. NASA's RapidScat sees winds increase in Tropical Storm Kevin September 3, 2015 \nNASA's RapidScat instrument observed tropical storm-force winds in the Eastern Pacific Ocean's Tropical Depression 14E or TD14E that helped forecasters see it was strengthening. RapidScat sees Tropical Storm Jimena's strong side away from Hawaii September 9, 2015 \nThe strongest winds in Tropical Storm Jimena were on its northern side when NASA's RapidScat instrument measured the storm's surface winds. The following day, NOAA's GOES-West satellite saw the strongest thunderstorms east ... NASA's RapidScat sees Typhoon Kilo hold strength September 9, 2015 \nTyphoon Kilo is maintaining strength as it continues to move through the Northwestern Pacific Ocean. NASA's RapidScat instrument measured the typhoon-force winds and the extent of tropical-storm force winds in the storm. RapidScat looks at Tropical Storm Henri's winds September 10, 2015 \nNASA's RapidScat instrument analyzed the sustained surface winds of Tropical Storm Henri on Sept. 8 as the storm was intensifying. Recommended for you World's longest continental volcano chain in Australia September 14, 2015 \nScientists have discovered the world's longest known chain of continental volcanoes, running 2,000 kilometres across Australia, from the Whitsundays in North Queensland to near Melbourne in central Victoria. Sierra Nevada snowpack lowest in 500 years September 14, 2015 \nSnowpack in California's Sierra Nevada in 2015 was at the lowest level in the past 500 years, according to a new report led by University of Arizona researchers. How to beat the climate crisis? Start with carrots September 10, 2015 \nTo speed up progress in tackling climate change, policymakers need to build political support by investing in clean-energy industries rather than first penalizing polluters, according to a new policy paper by researchers ... Burning remaining fossil fuel could cause 60-meter sea level rise September 11, 2015 \nNew work from an international team including Carnegie's Ken Caldeira demonstrates that the planet's remaining fossil fuel resources would be sufficient to melt nearly all of Antarctica if burned, leading to a 50- or 60-meter ... Researchers find unintended consequences of geoengineering to slow climate change September 9, 2015 \nLike the leaves of New England maples, phytoplankton, the microalgae at the base of most oceanic food webs, photosynthesize when exposed to sunlight. In the process, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, converting ... Should countries honor their climate debts? September 8, 2015 \nAll countries have contributed to recent climate change, but some much more so than others. Those that have contributed more than their fair share have accumulated a climate debt, owed to countries that have contributed less ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T23:30:29.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
