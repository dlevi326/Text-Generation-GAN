We had to wait for another three years, but now the two-stroke V4 powerhouse worthy of any GP500-era racing legend is here. This limited production pure racer from the past is definitely one for people with deep pockets and an appetite for outrageous power. \nPowered by a 576 cc V4 two-stroke with two counter rotating crankshafts, Suter’s racer produces 195 hp (145.4 kW) at 13,000 rpm. This power may not sound all that superhuman at a time when all contemporary production superbikes revolve around the 200 hp mark, yet we cannot think of another motorcycle that deploys so much power to move a mass of just 127 kg (280 lb). Even more intriguing is the undersquare geometry of the engine’s cylinders; at 56 x 58.5 mm (2.2 x 2.3 in) this beast must produce enough torque to make simply hanging on to it a serious challenge. In 2012 Suter was planning to offer a choice between perfectly square 54 x 54 mm (2.1 x 2.1 in) cylinder dimensions for a 494 cc capacity and the current configuration. In its final form the tech specs of the MMX 500 refer only to the 576 cc undersquare version. \nControlled by a Mectronic ECU and clean of any electronic tomfoolery, the MMX 500 is a display case of race-proven gear by Suter Racing Technology. The six speed cassette-type gearbox, the dry SuterClutch and the tailor-made CNC aluminum twin spar frame and swingarm have been developed through Suter’s heavy involvement in all MotoGP classes as well as the World Superbike Championship (WSBK). The frame itself is adjustable for steering angle, wheelbase, ride height and riding position. \nTo these we add a set of MotoGP-spec Ohlins suspension, Brembo’s finest braking offerings with steel discs and a foursome of titanium exhausts from Akrapovic. The 17-inch wheels are made by OZ and the client can opt for either magnesium or aluminum versions. Suter adds a very nice touch by offering the chance to order the MMX 500 with its carbon fiber costumes painted as an exact replica of your favorite rider’s livery. \nThe starting price is CHF120,000 (US$123,500) for each of the 99 motorcycles to be built. This collectible Suter 500 is part of an extremely rare breed, as we can think of only one other similar GP replica available today anywhere in the world – the Ronax 500 . There is though one fundamental difference between the two, as the Ronax is “restricted” to 160 hp (119.3 kW) for 145 kg (319.7 lb) in an attempt to comply with its road-legal status. This is a notion that Suter can simply ignore, unleashing its track-only weapon with a power-to-weight ratio comparable only to world class racing machines; those that are usually inaccessible to the wider public and, on those rarest of occasions, attached to high six-figure price tags. \nThis video that surfaced just a few days ago provides glimpse of the beast during final testing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T05:48:35.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
