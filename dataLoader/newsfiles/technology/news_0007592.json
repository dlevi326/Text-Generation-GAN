His session is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. (PDT) on Wednesday, Sept. 9 . \n\"Because of its origin as a consumer-focused technology, many businesses continue to struggle with the best way to adopt, deploy and support mobile solutions,\" Robinson noted. \"What is the best way to deploy devices? Where is data traveling? How should it be secured? Most importantly, how are businss operations changing to get the most use out of smartphones, tablets and apps?\" \nRobinson's presentation will focus on three critical areas of mobility in the enterprise: How mobility is creating a significant shift in front-end computing systems. The varied approaches organizations are taking to implement mobility strategies. The impact of mobility on business-critical processes. \nRobinson will share data from the latest CompTIA research on how organizations are using mobile solutions to change the way they do business; the benefits they hope to achieve; and the challenges they face. For example: 51 percent of companies say enhancing employee flexibility is the leading driver of their adoption of mobile solutions. 53 percent of firms have adopted a \"no BYOD\" policy, while 40 percent embrace a partial BYOD model. Small and large companies say their most significant mobility challenge is integrating devices, while mid-sized firms are wrestling with balancing the needs of employees and the IT department. \nComplete presentation slides will be posted on CompTIA's SlideShare account ( http://www.slideshare.net/comptia ) at the conclusion of the live program. \nCTIA Super Mobility 2015 is the largest forum in the Western Hemisphere for the mobile innovations that power our connected life.
