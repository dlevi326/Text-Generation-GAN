The new camera system’s light sensitivity achieves ISO 40,000 for monochrome and ISO 16,000 for color, as measured to the ISO Ssat 12232 standard. High-G, compact, and only 120 mm (4.7 in.) H x 120 mm (4.7 in.) W x 94 mm (3.7 in.) D in size, the affordable Mini AX100 provides 1,024 x 1,024 pixel resolution at up to 4,000 frames per second (fps) and 540,000 fps at reduced resolution, making it the fastest, most light sensitive high speed imager available. The lightweight, 1.6 kg (3.5 lbs.), one-piece camera joins the recently introduced FASTCAM Mini AX50 to deliver high frame rates with excellent image quality and 4GB, 8GB, and/or 16 GB memory options. For applications that require higher frame rates, resolutions are reduced to achieve the imaging performance needed. For example, 10,000 frames per second are delivered at 768 x 528 pixel image resolution; 20,000 fps at 384 x 384 pixel image resolution, and so on, up to 540,000 fps at 128 x 16 pixel resolution. Applications include on-board and off-board automotive safety testing, defense/aerospace research, biomechanics, material sciences, fluidics (PIV), and life sciences. “The FASTCAM Mini AX family of high speed cameras offers an unprecedented ISO light sensitivity of 40,000 for the monochrome version, which is verified and measured to the true Ssat 12232 standard,” notes Andrew Bridges, director of sales and marketing at Photron. “This is critical when capturing high speed events because it means that less additional lighting is required. With the heightened light sensitivity, faster frame rates, shorter shutter speeds, and greater depths of field can all be achieved under the same lighting conditions.” Slow motion video data from the FASTCAM Mini AX100/50 is easy to view and analyze from a desktop or laptop PC, via the convenient Gigabit Ethernet interface.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:04:04.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
