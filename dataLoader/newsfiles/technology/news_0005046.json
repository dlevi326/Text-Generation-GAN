The company will release its first mobile game several months from now.\nThe Show Must Go On It's good news that Nintendo was able to announce a successor in such short time, noted George T. Chronis director of qualitative analysis at DFC Intelligence .\n\"As Kimishima has been with the company for 15 years, it is obvious that the desire was for a known quantity and steady hand to continue initiatives already in place,\" he told TechNewsWorld.\nKimishima previously served as CEO of Nintendo of America, before Iwata claimed the position. During his time as CEO of the division, he ceded the spotlight to Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime.\nThough Kishimima is relatively unknown to the public, Nintendo watchers included, his work speaks for itself, said Sartori Bernbeck, manager of insights and analytics at EEDAR .\n\"As new product launches emerge, Kimishima will likely become more consumer facing and gain further merit amongst shareholders and fans alike, but it is likely not his prioritization to become the new face of Nintendo,\" Bernbeck told TechNewsWorld. \"This is fine, as there are already others who fit that role very well.\"\nKimishima's Challenge The attention now turns from Kimishima's resume to results -- the ones he'll have to produce from a strategy he has adopted, noted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group .\n\"This is one of the worst problems for a new CEO, as they are basically on rails with regard to their near-term moves, and they'll likely be compared unfavorably to the unrealistic perceptions surrounding the person they are replacing,\" he told TechNewsWorld. \"Add to this the fact that the firm actually does need to change desperately, and this becomes a job that is almost impossible to do.\"\nIt may be a near-impossible task, but making big changes is something Kamishima eventually will have to do. Specifically, he'll have to restructure a company that's preparing a new console and a move to mobile.\n\"Kimishima has already mentioned that he will be focusing strongly on redeveloping the leadership structure at Nintendo, and hopefully this results in more effort in growing the younger talent pool at the company,\" remarked Bernbeck.\n\"As Kimishima, Miyamoto and Takeda grow older,\" he said, \"Nintendo is in need of younger rock star management members to continue driving the company's vision.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.dfcint.com/", "http://www.enderlegroup.com/", "http://www.ectnews.com/", "http://www.ectnews.com/images/end-enn.gif"], "published": "2015-09-15T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:10:14.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
