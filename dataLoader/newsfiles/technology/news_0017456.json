The event will spotlight UNESCO World Heritage Sites to bring additional recognition to these internationally acclaimed locations. \nLiz Peck, President of the Society of Light and Lighting, said, \"The Night of Heritage Light will be a great example of the whole industry coming together to bring the magic of light and lighting to the world. By combining light with some of the UK's most beautiful sights, we can capture the public's attention in a way that showcases the best that the lighting industry has to offer.
