We are taking forward our discussions and at this stage we have shown that the concept absolutely works.”\nThe company rolling out the NBN has welcomed the program and the role it can play in fostering greater competition at a retail level.\nNBN Co said it supported the “intent” of the program and ­welcomed the initiative if it helped to create greater competition.\n“We look forward to further dialogue with the ACCC on how the program will work in practice, and how the data will be presented and made accessible to consumers,” a NBN Co spokesman told The Australian.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T04:30:32.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
