We issued the advisory in the best interest of our customers and with an abundance of caution to ensure their health and safety. I commend the fast and professional work by SWB employees from several departments and the excellent cooperation of DHH officials.\"\nThe order was issued Wednesday night electrical service was interrupted at the Carrollton water treatment plant causing two of four active pumps to briefly shut down, resulting in a drop in pressure in the city's network of water pipes.\nWhen the pressure in the system drops below 15 pounds per square inch, contaminated groundwater can begin to penetrate leaking pipes and commingle with treated water on its way to houses and businesses. Pressure in parts of the system dropped as low as 6 psi.\nWater samples were taken for testing from about 90 sites around the city. It takes about 24 hours to complete the tests.\nThis was the 10 th time in the past five years that the Sewerage & Water Board has issued a boil-water advisory. City officials say they are pursuing changes in the system to reduce future problems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T03:11:14.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
