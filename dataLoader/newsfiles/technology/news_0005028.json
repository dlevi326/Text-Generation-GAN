You grab your smartphone, take a look at an app and it tells you that, yes, you've been ironing air for the past hour. Then, without having to go back home, you turn the iron off. These remote energy monitors don't just monitor the amount of energy your appliances use, they actually enable you to turn them on and off remotely. An example: if you want the aircon roaring before you come home, buy one of these energy monitors, plug it in to the plug you connect your aircon to, add it to the app, and use the app to turn it on before you get home. You'll need one energy monitor for each appliance/power board but they can be individually loaded onto the one app. What I love about these small devices is that you can turn off that stuff that you have on standby (the TV, DVD player etc.) from your phone. Sure, it's lazy if you're in bed in the next room, but much easier than flicking off the power point. Great for holiday lighting to trick would-be burglars while you're away.\nThe Belkin WeMo Insight Switch.\nTHE VERDICT\nAdvertisement In set-up and ease of use, the WeMo was great. The WeMo app's good too, clearly displaying how long it's been connected and how many watts it's currently using, though a graph like the Ego's would be better.\nBelkin WeMo Insight Switch\nRRP $99.95\nThis worked first time, no dramas. I plugged it in, turned it on and connected it to my home Wi-Fi. . It has an \"away mode\" for when you're away. There's no graph on the app, so you can't see spikes of usage.\nEfergy Ego\nRRP $69.95\nI found this harder to set up than the WeMo, but it got easier. The history it shows seems accurate and is mighty useful. It shows a change in power usage visually so if the children get home and switch on the TV, you'll see it.\nCHECK THIS OUT\nRecently I put my 3-year-old iPhone 5 through a washing machine cycle. I Googled what to do, and put it in a sealed bag with rice for three days. I plugged it in and it came to life (just). By day five it was as good as new, though it still only takes selfies (the other lens is stuffed).
