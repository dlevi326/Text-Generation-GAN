It’s also an incredibly MTV-in-2015 way to unravel a mystery: ridiculous, meme-obsessed, self-mocking, and fun if you don’t think about it too much. Which basically sums up the first season of the network’s Scream, a TV reboot of Wes Craven’s 1996 film that follows Emma, a high-school student, and her friends as they’re targeted by a mask-wearing psycho murderer.\nRelated Story 'I’m Into Survival': A Nightmare on Elm Street’s Nancy, 30 Years Later\nTuesday’s finale ended with the unmasking of a killer, plenty of blood spatter, a long victim list, and an even longer roster of survivors. In other words, the show, which was renewed for a second season, didn’t stray much from convention. As with the original movie, kids and adults were picked off one by one in gleefully graphic fashion, the town’s blundering police force couldn’t keep anyone safe, there was a requisite film nerd who was constantly analyzing the story through the lens of cinema history, and mysterious phone calls from a killer with a voice changer. Only instead of “ Hello, Sidney ,” the taunt was, “Hello, Emma,” and the call was coming from an iPhone, not a landline with an antenna.\nIn many ways, Scream set itself an impossible task in trying to replicate the self-referential winkiness of its predecessor, given that audiences are more fluent in pop-cultural references these days than ever, and horror specifically is a genre that’s constantly adapting and manipulating other works in an effort to stay fresh. It was certainly buoyed by its connection to Craven, an executive producer who had little involvement in the show, and whose recent death has prompted multiple reflections on his uncanny ability to constantly reinvent horror. In that sense, Scream the show failed to offer any new insight into what’s changed in slasher stories over the past 20 years—its conclusion: not much—even if it was nevertheless pretty fun to watch.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ht0uR5jWz0"], "published": "2015-09-02T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:29:49.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
