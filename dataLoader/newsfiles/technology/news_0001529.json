More and more businesses are expecting its technology solutions to provide actionable insights to make informed business decisions. Since deploying ProcessMAP's safety management platform , GrafTech International, a leading manufacturer of innovative graphite solutions, has harnessed the power of big data to take preventative actions to further strengthen its global health and safety program. \nGrafTech first engaged ProcessMAP in 2011 to streamline its global employee health and safety management processes and correlate disparate data. Prior to deploying the ProcessMAP platform, GrafTech was consolidating its injury data manually. \nProcessMAP enabled GrafTech to further enhance its processes to solve critical health and safety challenges facing global companies by: -- Deploying a global cloud platform that provides real-time dashboards to increase transparency and company-wide visibility to safety performance indicators -- Revamping and establishing globally standardized incident reporting, investigation and corrective actions management processes -- Empowering business process agility and increasing efficiency with mobile capabilities \n\"Our CEO and executive leadership team have always been passionate about building a world-class company where consideration for employee health and safety is the first priority. We were well aware we needed an improved enterprise system to provide us with real-time visibility to key operational metrics,\" said Tom Jacques, Vice President of Health, Safety & Environmental Protection and Security of GrafTech. \"We knew that if we wanted to take injury prevention to the next level, we needed to expand our capabilities.\" \nGrafTech completed a comprehensive analysis of injuries in 2014. \"Thanks to the robust multi-dimensional analysis and actionable insights delivered to us by ProcessMAP, we've been more targeted in our approach toward injury prevention, honing in on key departments and business activities. \nKey findings from GrafTech's analysis uncovered that hand and finger injuries associated with material handling were most common to its business. As a result, the company focused on minimizing and/or eliminating exposure associated with this activity. Moreover, managers and supervisors have been armed with the power of data discovery to be more strategic in their observations, focusing on specific actions presenting hazards and risk. Initial results from this effort are promising - the company has seen reductions in both serious and total injuries. \n\"The results GrafTech has realized by taking preventative actions to strengthen its health and safety program are truly exceptional. Their efforts are a clear example of how the cloud and big data are transforming the way we work and process information,\" said Dave Rath, CEO of ProcessMAP. \"We are proud to be part of their success.\" \nProcessMAP recently announced the rollout of its latest software - Version 15.2. This release features improved usability, enhanced data visualization tools, customer-driven enhancements, more robust analytics and new modules, including its new Ergonomics Module. With nearly 50 percent of manufacturing industry injuries being related to ergonomics, the new module allows customers to perform ergonomic evaluations using four analysis types based on common industry standards, such as NIOSH Lifting Equation and Strain Index. \nAbout ProcessMAP Corporation ProcessMAP Corporation is the leading provider of cloud-based enterprise software solutions that empowers organizations to manage risk in three key areas: Employee Health & Safety; Environment & Sustainability; and Enterprise Compliance.
