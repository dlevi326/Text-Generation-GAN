This form of brain cancer (see picture) kills half of those so identified within a year, and almost all within three. The life-extending benefits of existing therapies are measured in a few short months. But that may change, and change soon, if the results of experiments on mice, conducted by Douglas Hanahan of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, and reported this week in Cancer Cell , can be replicated in people. The reason to hope for such speed is that Dr Hanahan’s method employs two drugs already approved for human use, and whose safety profiles are thus well known. Curiously, neither of the drugs in question was developed for use against cancer.\nOne is imipramine, an antidepressant that boosts levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, two messenger molecules which transmit signals between nerve cells. Dr Hanahan knew from research conducted by others that those who take drugs which work this way seem to have a lower-than-normal incidence of gliomas. He and his colleague Ksenya Shchors thus tried giving imipramine to mice that had been genetically engineered to develop glioma. When they dosed animals whose tumours had developed only recently, they found a marked effect. Treated mice lived for an average of 31 days. Untreated controls lasted a mere 13. On mice with late-stage tumours that had spread throughout the brain, though, imipramine had little effect.\nIn this section Welcome to the Drone Age Astrobusybee Parenting Eating themselves to death Cancer Health and fitness\nPost-mortem examination of the rodents suggested the drug was working by stimulating a process called autophagy. This is a cell’s natural response to lean times, involving breaking down less-crucial cellular components in order to keep the more crucial ones going. Imipramine seemed to be tricking the glioma cells into autophagy, leaving them unable to grow and reproduce.\nThis deception was the result of one of imipramine’s side-effects: stimulation of the production of an intracellular signalling molecule called cyclic AMP. This chemical has many roles, but one is to regulate autophagy, so the next question the two researchers asked themselves was whether that effect could be enhanced still further, causing the tumour cells to digest themselves completely to death.\nTo this end, they turned to a second drug, ticlopidine, which is normally employed as an anticoagulant and which works by stimulating cyclic AMP. When Dr Shchors and Dr Hanahan combined it with imipramine, and gave the mixture to some more mice, they found that those with early-stage tumours lived for 90 days on average—three times as long as on imipramine alone—and even those with late-stage disease lived for 36 days. Subsequent dissection showed that the cells were indeed dying of autophagy.\nWhether this combination therapy will have similar effects in people remains to be seen. But because both drugs have been around for a long time, the process of testing them will be greatly simplified. And, if they do work, the prognosis for those with glioma will be greatly improved.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20150926_STP001_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:12:38.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
