My decision (to send Maltman home) was one of those occasions where it was really a no win for anyone, but it had to be done.”\nFriend zone ... Despite having an initial multitude of sparks, Wood says he realised he’d never be more than “just friends” with Maltman. Despite this, he said that watching the events unfold once more on TV was “horrible”.\n“It was hard at the time, then reliving it last night was just horrible,” said Wood.\n“I understand that so many people have fallen in love with Heather because she’s such an incredible girl, so it wasn’t a terribly popular decision.”\nHaving not spoken to Maltman since he said goodbye to her at the mansion, Wood said he is keen to now check in and see how she is faring post-heartbreak. However he added that he will have to run it past the woman he chooses on the show first.\nThe right choice ... Sam Wood says that he is in love with the girl he chooses in Thursday night’s finale. “I would obviously never do anything to jeopardise my relationship, but if all of us were friends and it was all amicable then I would love to sit down with Heather and make sure she’s okay and see what she’s up to now,” he said.\nLISTEN TO OUR VERDICT ON LAST NIGHT’S SHOW", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9eff9f7e84d76bc62c48a22584066ec6?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cc61b189a2d38d791f14ba5922d998e5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/17adbf0abc3059061fd2084512b7fbd4?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/524f4517f20a2d39a4e94ed88452de75", "http://resources.news.com.au/files/2015/07/17/1227446/561017-itunes.png", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/47e1109e0009b022c8af38bb169fe2d7", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7f79850cb8606d7ecc2b734ae3d12ccf", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3b7bbc3e5334a8be7fd6493d1d721706", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/223312897&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8037bf1c40a43d587b971fa28d5a6726?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/00b0f4cbc5942edffdb11383172cd63d", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-11T13:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T10:03:55.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
