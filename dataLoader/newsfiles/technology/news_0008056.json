Through the partnership, Healthe will donate a portion of the sales of its EyeSafe products that reduce exposure to harmful digital UV and High-Enegergy Visible (HEV) blue light to Prevent Blindness in support of its children’s eye health programs.“Protecting eyesight when it comes to the progressive use of digital technology and screen time addiction in young people is our number one priority and we offer a wide variety of EyeSafe products to do just that,” said Justin Barrett, CEO, Healthe. “By supporting programs such as those offered by Prevent Blindness, that seek to provide sight-saving services for our children, we can help to raise awareness, provide education and promote services around eye health, including digital device emission, that will have a positive impact on kids for years to come.”According to a recent study, children’s eyes absorb more blue light than adults from digital device screens. This is a growing concern due to the popularity of cell phones, computers and tablets for educational as well as recreational purposes. Healthe, a Minneapolis-based company, has taken on a mission of designing and developing EyeSafe products, technologies and standards for digital devices in conjunction with the medical community for a global audience. Healthe’s products are designed to provide relief for frequent users of digital technology from prolonged exposure to harmful UA and HEV blue light. Through the proprietary HEV blue light blocking screen covers and glass, Healthe provides advanced products that make artificial digital light more like natural light. “Today in the United States, vision disorders are the most prevalent forms of disabling childhood conditions,” said Hugh R. Parry, president and CEO of Prevent Blindness. “We thank Healthe and all of its customers for supporting our efforts to address the need to protect our children’s vision today to help make for a brighter future tomorrow.”For more information about EyeSafe or to purchase a product to help support Prevent Blindness visit Healthe’s website .
