The water leaves long, dark stains on the terrain that can reach hundreds of meters downhill in warmer months, The Guardian reports . The water then dries up in autumn when surface temperatures fall. \nGeorgia Tech doctoral student Lujendra Ojha first discovered the streaks in 2011 while an undergraduate student at the University of Arizona. Ojha explained that the streaks “absorb light at specific wavelengths associated with chemicals known to pull water from the Martian atmosphere in a process known as deliquescence,” according to the Guardian. Those chemicals not only help the water continue to be liquid at lower temperatures but also help keep it from boiling away in the thin air. \nEven early Mars missions revealed signs of water. Pictures from the 1970s showed a surface covered in dried-up rivers and plains that were once underwater. This year, the agency also provided evidence of an ocean that may have covered half of the planet’s northern hemisphere. \nImages taken from this recent orbit show cliffs, as well as steep walls of valleys and craters, covered in streaks from the summer flows. Scientists are not certain where the water comes from, though they hypothesize that it could rise up from underground ice or salty aquifers, or condense out of the atmosphere. The next round of research will delve into just what causes the mysterious phenomenon, Meyer said. \nThe current findings will be included in new paper that is to be presented this week at the European Planetary Science Congress in France.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:42:32.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
