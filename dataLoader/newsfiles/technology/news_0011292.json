[Click to enlarge image] AUO's circular OLED display for wearable devices [Click to enlarge image] AUO's semi-transparent LCD display for wearable devices [Click to enlarge image] \nTaiwan-based manufacturers are making efforts in developing and mass-producing new displays including 65-inch 8k LCD and circular OLED displays. \nInnolux Corp and AU Optronics (AUO) Corp, which are major LCD panel makers, unveiled new displays at Touch Taiwan 2015, which took place in Taiwan at the end of August 2015. \nInnolux's 65-inch 8k LCD display \nThe main exhibit in Innolux's booth was a 65-inch 8k LCD display with a pixel count of 7,680 x 4,320. Its model number was \"V650AJ1-KD1.\" 8k LCD displays have already been announced by Sharp Corp, LG Display Co Ltd, Samsung Display Co Ltd, BOE Technology Group, etc. This time, the Taiwan-based maker newly announced one. \nThe main specifications of the 65-inch 8k LCD display are as follows. Its brightness, color gamut and frame rate are 700cd/m 2 , 88% (NTSC standards) and 60Hz, respectively. The thickness and weight of its panel are 29.4mm and 13.4kg. It support 3D display. \nAUO's circular OLED display \nAUO exhibited new displays designed for wearable devices including a circular OLED display and semi-transparent LCD display that the company claims features an ultra-low power consumption. \nThe screen size, pixel count, resolution and panel thickness of the circular OLED display are 1.4 inches, 400 x 400, 287ppi and 0.45mm, respectively. \nThe (1.3-inch) screen of the semi-transparent LCD display also has a circular shape. For the display, AUO reduced power consumption from 15mW to 0.1mW or less at the time of displaying a still image by employing a reflective display technology and using a low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) technology to form memory in pixels, AUO said. \nIn AUO's booth, a 4.7mm-thick 65-inch 4k LCD panel and a curved LCD panel whose color gamut was increased to 100% on NTSC standards by using quantum dots were drawing attention. The company announced a partnership with 3M Company on quantum dot technologies Aug 27, 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T21:23:59.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
