This facility will allow better access to their clients and recruit for new team members for their rapidly growing organization.\nINTEGRIS began working on plans to put roots down in the Milwaukee region in early 2015 and after several trips from Central Illinois were finally able to find a great landing spot in New Berlin, with the help of Kevin Crary of Capital Commercial. This will be their 2nd office and will initially support 5 members of their team including Engineering and Talent Management to deepen relationships with clients in their northern territory. They hope to double the size of their Wisconsin presence within the next 12-18 months.\nINTEGRIS Group is challenging the status quo of product development for both small and large companies. For small companies they provide the resources needed to compete and with larger companies INTEGRIS provides Skunkworks style development. Their ability to be dynamic and nimble, while retaining flow and consistency allows them to get the product to market faster, giving their clients a significant competitive advantage.\n“This expansion will allow us to better support our clients, engage the best engineering talent, and continue our growth,” said Eric Myers, Business Director. The company chose the New Berlin area due to ease of access, quality of life and proximity of potential partners within a close distance.\nAbout INTEGRIS Group\nFounded in 2011, INTEGRIS Group is a product development group organized around the principles of engineering. INTEGRIS utilizes various disciplines to ensure that the products created are game changers, and that their clients realize their visions.
