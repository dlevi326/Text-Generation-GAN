Do you get the feeling that Indian startups are doing innovative stuff, or merely copying US ventures? \nTill recently, Silicon Valley had not taken the Indian entrepreneurship ecosystem seriously because there was not much happening there. Now, with the emergence of billion-dollar technology companies and the internet boom, it is becoming clear that everything is changing: India is becoming a hub of entrepreneurship and opportunity.\n\nAt first, Indian entrepreneurs will need to catch up and learn. They will take advantage of the opportunities that are becoming available as hundreds of millions of Indians come online through their smartphones. They will do what the Chinese did: Copy. Then they will start developing innovative technologies for India and the developing world. Eventually, they will take on Silicon Valley. This is what InMobi did. It first mastered and dominated advertising and mobile in the developing world. Now it is leaping ahead of everyone with its innovations. I expect that by 2020 there will be dozens of companies like this.\n\nDo you think there's a startup valuation bubble in the US and India? \nYes, in some sectors valuations are inflated. The majority of today's socalled unicorns are going to go bankrupt. There is a lemming-like mindset in which investors follow each other off the cliff. But there are some real companies that are building new markets. These will be the next Googles and Amazons.\n\nDespite fears that Indian startups are overvalued, this is generally not the case. The market is about to explode there. We are at the beginning of a technology boom in India, not at the end of it.\n\nIf and when there is a bust, what kind of impact do you think it will have? Which segments of new age ventures will survive and eventually come out stronger? \nThe fact is that this is the most innovative period in human history when advancing technologies are enabling us to devise solutions to the grand challenges of humanity. Existing industries are going to be wiped out because of technology change and new trillion-dollar industries will emerge. The companies that build value, solve real problems, create new business models and new industries will be worth billions.The overhyped me-too companies will perish. Most of India's IT services companies and many of its older businesses will decline and some will perish because they have not kept up with change.\n\nWhat would be your advice to Indian startups that want to make an impact in the US market? \nIn general, I advise startups abroad not to focus on the US, but to dominate their markets first. They have no advantage here because they really can't understand this market unless they are part of it. And it is a crowded, competitive field here. Best to test your ideas in other markets, perfect them, and when you have developed a solid solution, then bring to the US -from a position of strength.\n\nIndian entrepreneurs, in particular, should consider that they are in a market that is about to grow exponentially. India has become the world's fastest-growing market for smartphones. Over the next 3-4 years, half a billion Indians are going to be coming online using these devices.This market will dwarf the US market.It is a wide-open competitive field in India and there is room for 20-30 billion-dollar technology companies. Why waste your time and efforts in Silicon Valley's mature and fiercely competitive market, when you have the whole of India and the developing world?\n\nWhat about an area like healthcare in the US? Considering that it's so expensive, couldn't some Indian startup disrupt that? \nThe US market generally is highly regulated, extremely expensive to enter, and not welcoming of foreign technology companies. If Indian entrepreneurs are smart, they will figure out how to develop new business models that let them thrive in the larger (Indian) markets. Once they have done this, they can come to the US because when they have health devices, for example, that are being used by hundreds of millions of people, regulatory agencies such as the FDA will have a hard time blocking their innovations.\n\nThere are good opportunities for Indian entrepreneurs in telemedicine, by the way , and they can pursue this from India. Americans are used to getting advice from Indian doctors -so they will feel comfortable with doctors in India.\n\nYou have been talking about jobless growth in the future, given the advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, etc. Past predictions of jobless growth on account of mechanization and computers have not really panned out the way the doomsayers anticipated. Why do you think it will be different this time? \nThere has never been a time such as this when multiple technologies are advancing at exponential rates and converging. Amazing -and scary -things are becoming possible. In the long term, robots and AI will do most of the jobs that humans do. But that is at least 10-15 years away in the developed world. For India this is 20-30 years away because the country needs to first catch up and build a new infrastructure. The next 20 years will be the best for India because there are so many problems to be solved and Indian entrepreneurs will have the ability to solve these.
