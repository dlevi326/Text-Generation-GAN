In addition to data from traditional administrative systems, they now have explosive emerging data sources, such as social media and the Internet of Things (IoT). Add to that expanding online services. All this data can fuel efficient and innovative city management -- if cities can harness it. To advance analytics as a cornerstone of city management, analytics leader SAS has joined Envision America. \nAn effort to launch smart-city initiatives in communities across the US, Envision America is the national expansion of the work done by Envision Charlotte. \nSAS® Analytics has helped cities, states and countries worldwide improve citizen services, prevent losses from fraud, preserve natural resources, promote transportation alternatives, and more. Yet we're still at the early stages of helping American cities use data to serve their residents more effectively. As a member of Envision America, SAS will team with other leading companies to help cities use their vast stores of data to solve complex problems and improve quality of life. \nMore and more data will come from the IoT, in which devices communicate to each other and to databases via the Internet. Water, gas and electric meters, sensors on streets and bridges, street lights and countless other devices all provide invaluable data. For instance, bridge sensor data, communicated automatically to city engineers, might indicate a bridge is at a higher risk for collapse. But it takes advanced analytics to recognize and direct information into action. \nSAS CEO Jim Goodnight said, \"Combining IoT data with traditional administrative data opens up unimaginable opportunities for cities to drive down costs and raise up services and infrastructure.\" \nCities will adopt technologies such as: Event stream processing, which analyzes data in massive volumes in near-real-time. Contextual analytics, which spots trends and topics buried in unstructured data such as social media. Data visualization, which presents large amounts of data in easy-to-grasp charts and graphs. \nLearn more about the Internet of Things and how event stream processing helps you understand the IoT's rapid fire data streams . \nSAS technologies and solutions for government are used in government agencies in all 50 states to transform their operations to deliver the right services, at the right time, with the appropriate resources. SAS offers a wide array of data management, business intelligence and analytics solutions, and collaborates with governments to create innovative offerings tailored to specific departmental and agency goals. \nAbout SAS \nSAS is the leader in analytics.
