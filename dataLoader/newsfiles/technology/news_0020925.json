The V-Moda Crossfade Wireless over-ear headphones are the company’s first Bluetooth-enabled product after so many years of cable-only models. The Crossfade Wireless is designed to offer virtually-identical analog and wireless playback while maintaining V-Moda’s iconic silhouette. \nThe V-Moda Crossfade Wireless is essentially a refined and improved version of the award-winning Crossfade M-100 over-ear headphones . Users new and old can appreciate the signature sound driven by patent-pending, dual-diaphragm 50-mm drivers, which came about from crowdsourcing and audiophile feedback. Just as with the rest of V-Moda’s lineup, the Crossfade Wireless features lightweight and metal materials meant for long-lasting comfort and durability. \nBut the big deal behind the the Crossfade Wireless is the built-in Bluetooth, which can pair with two devices simultaneously and last up to 12 hours per charge. Historically, V-Moda had expressed disinterest with wireless audio, favoring cable connections. While cables are consistent and trustworthy, they tend to be inconvenient at times. \nThe Crossfade Wireless headphones feature simple controls that operate much like V-Moda’s 3-button remotes on its cables. Users can adjust volume, change tracks, and activate voice and call controls through buttons built into the ear cup. And by including an antenna designed for greater sensitivity to the weaker Bluetooth signals from many wearables such as smartwatches , the Crossfade Wireless is capable of a smoother, more consistent audio experience without the need for a smartphone. \nV-Moda's Crossfade Wireless on-ear headphones are available now for US$300 in a choice of gunmetal, rouge, phantom chrome, and white silver. Those who order through V-Moda.com will receive an extra pair of custom 3D-printed fiber or laser-engraved aluminum shields, with an option to upgrade to other 3D-printed materials including steel, raw metals, gold, silver, and platinum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:20:42.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
