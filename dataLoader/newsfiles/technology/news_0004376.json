The third in line -- InFocus M350 was launched in June. \nMy first impulse was amazement at the extremely good display and resolution of the phone. As I started using it, I explored more pluses on the phone. For example, the battery; InFocus M 350 has a 2500mAh battery which lasts all day long for average-users. For heavy gamers and video viewers, the phone would definitely not disappoint. \nIn terms of size and handling too, it snuggles comfortably in your hands and has a wide-enough (5 inch) display screen to watch movies and videos. The phone is quite slender and has a matte finish back panel. However, its rear cover is quite thin and thus damage-prone. \nThe USP though is the camera, which is absolutely amazing! InFocus M 350 has an 8 MP rear camera but the highlight is an 8 MP front auto-focus camera, which is a rarity for smartphones. It gives you great opportunity to click clear and well-lit selfies and camera-facing pictures. The phone has Normal, Live Photo, Panorama and Motion Track modes as well. Of this the Live Photo mode captures a two second video while motion track mode allows one to capture moving objects. \nOne major lag in this phone is its operating system, Android 4.4.4 KitKat. An upgraded OS would have been a definite attraction for users. \nWith 2 GB RAM and 1.5 GHz, 64 bit quad-core processor, the smartphone offers plenty of muscle to handle high end games with ease. Also the phone doesn’t hang, even while heavy usage. Also plenty of storage space is provide -- 16 GB inbuilt and a 64 GB micro SD card slot. \nAl in all, InFocus M 350 is a smart buy in its price range. Though it has completion from Zenfone and Micromax models in the same range, it stands out because of its display, camera and processor which are few of the most important factors behind smartphones’ purchases. \nSPEC-BOX \nNo of SIM: 2 Operating System: Android 4.4, Kitkat Display: 5 inch HD display Battery: 2500 mAh, non-removable Camera: 8 MP auto-focus rear and front Processor: 1.5 GHz, Quad Core RAM: 2 GB Memory: 16 GB internal, upto 64 GB expandable Price: Rs. 7,999/-", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:34:54.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
