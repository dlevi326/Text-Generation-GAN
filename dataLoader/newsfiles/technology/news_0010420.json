He said authorities are trying to gather more information. He didn't elaborate on who may have carried out the attack.\nYemeni coast guard officials said on Tuesday that a Saudi-led coalition attacked more than five boats off the Yemeni coast, the same day the Indian boats were bombed. Officials with the rebels, known as Houthis, said the boats were carrying fishermen and weren't connected to them. It wasn't immediately clear if the two incidents were the same.\nSaudi Arabia is leading a coalition of mainly Gulf nations fighting the Houthis, who seized the capital, Sanaa, last September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T08:45:03.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
