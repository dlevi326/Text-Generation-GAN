It includes 1,000 people in the UK, who are part of the 1958 Birth Cohort - a study which follows the lives of 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week in 1958. \nThe study by Professor Nazneen Rahman and colleagues provides a baseline of gene variation in a general population and, unlike most published exome series, the individual exome sequences are available for use by other researchers, on application to the 1958 Birth Cohort committee. Other clinical data and samples are also available regarding these individuals which increases the potential usefulness of the exome data to other researchers whilst ensuring anonymity for the individuals. \nA high quality analysis pipeline was applied to the data including accurate detection of indels, a very important class of gene variation that can cause disease. This sets the study apart from many other datasets which exclude all or some indels because they have proved tricky to identify, or state that indel calling is not of a high quality. \nProfessor Nazneen Rahman said: \"We have analysed all the genes in 1,000 members of the general UK population. It has proved invaluable to us in both our disease gene discovery research and our work to translate gene testing into the clinic. \n\"We have found this data to be of tremendous value and it continues to be useful for us every day. Hundreds of research and clinical laboratories are doing similar work and we thought they would also find it valuable, so we decided to make our data available to them via F1000Research.\" \nMichael Markie, Associate Publisher of F1000Research, said: \"Vast quantities of genomic data currently reside in disparate silos making it difficult for scientists to access it and utilise it for their own research. \n\"F1000Research provides a simple and effective way to make genomic data publicly available to further disease research and we hope that more members of the genomic community will embrace it.\" \nProvided by: Faculty of 1000 5 shares Surprising findings from Exome Sequencing Project reported November 6, 2012 \nA multi-institutional team of researchers has sequenced the DNA of 6,700 exomes, the portion of the genome that contains protein-coding genes, as part of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-funded Exome Sequencing ... Researchers identify variation in gene PLD3 can increase risk of late-onset Alzheimers disease December 24, 2013 \n(Medical Xpress)—A new study, part-funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Wellcome Trust and Alzheimer's Research UK, has shown that a fault in a gene called phospholipase D3 (PLD3) can contribute to the overproduction ... Poor coverage of specific gene sets in exome sequencing gives cause for concern June 1, 2014 \nResearchers have analysed 44 exome datasets from four different testing kits and shown that they missed a high proportion of clinically relevant regions.
