This prestigious honor recognizes innovative big data initiatives that have delivered significant business value. \nLoyola University Maryland feared the possibility of falling victim to a fate that other major universities around them had experienced: a major data breach. In the months following the early 2014 attack on a major university nearby, Loyola's CIO, Louise Finn, proactively explored various solutions that could mitigate risk in the event of a similar attack, but the technologies she probed could not provide reliable and detailed insights. That's when Finn and her IT team discovered Varonis Systems, Inc. and its DatAdvantage solution. Now, with Varonis, Loyola is able to track all access to data and assess it against baseline end-user activity and know when abnormal behaviors occur. \nDavid Gibson, Varonis VP of Strategy and Market Development, said, \"Loyola University Maryland has done a phenomenal job implementing and using DatAdvantage to secure its sensitive data. As an academic institution, they carry staggering amounts of all types of unstructured, sensitive data, including emails, word documents and spreadsheets that belong to and contain information about employees, students and partners. Investing in the security of these files is incredibly important in today's threat environment. We are thrilled that Computerworld has chosen them for the 2015 Data+ Editors' Choice Awards.\" \n\"We are pleased to announce the 2015 Data+ Editors' Choice Awards honorees,\" said Scot Finnie, Editor in Chief, Computerworld . \"This year's honorees have used analytics to solve vexing business and humanitarian problems. They are taking data analytics to the next level – mining data to make fast business decisions, measure risk, create efficiencies and much more.\" \nThe Data+ Editors' Choice Awards honorees and their achievements will be highlighted in a special September feature on Computerworld.com . \nAdditional Resources Read the Loyola University Maryland Case Study here .
