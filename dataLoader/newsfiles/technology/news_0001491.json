(AP) - A zoo in southeast South Dakota has taken in two black bears that caused some trouble at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.\nThe Great Plains Zoo and Delbridge Museum of Natural History in Sioux Falls will now be home to a 12-year-old female bear and her young cub. Zoo officials say the older bear has a long history of nuisance behavior at Grand Teton, where she had raided backpacks and campsites for food for several years.\nThe bears have been placed in quarantine and will join an exhibit in about a month. The exhibit already includes a 16-year-old male black bear.\nZoo President and CEO Elizabeth Whealy says the facility is proud to be able to provide the bears \"a new lease on life.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
