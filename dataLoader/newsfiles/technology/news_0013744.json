This significant platform update includes Keyword and IP Ranges targeting, both of these options are now available in Admin Panel > Advertisers > New Campaign > Advanced Settings. ExoClick's new Keyword Targeting feature is designed to help advertisers reach relevant audiences with traffic-driving keywords to lift their campaign's performance. Key functions of this feature include:-\nAdvertisers can input or block any keyword in any language\nKeywords can be composed of single or multiple keywords e.g. milk chocolate\nKeywords can be specific niches, names of people/celebrities, brands or products\nExoClick's new IP Ranges Targeting allows advertisers to target or block specific IP addresses/ranges. This is particularly useful for 3/4G carrier targeting where advertisers can use additional IP ranges instead of/as well as ExoClick's current options.\nTo use these features simply enter an item into the Keyword Targeting or IP Ranges Targeting text area, each item needs to be put on a separate line. To block items place a minus sign before the Keyword or IP Range e.g. -milk\nExoClick's founder and CEO Benjamin Fonzé commented, “Keyword Targeting is becoming increasingly relevant for niche marketing. Before, advertisers could select 32 available categories on our platform, our new Keyword Targeting now allows advertisers to obtain traffic from very specific or small niches. For example, perhaps you have an offer targeting fans of Kim Kardashian or you want to reach traffic that watches videos from specific brands, simply add these keywords into your campaign and your ads will show on sites next to content about Kim or next to relevant videos from brands. Our new IP Ranges Targeting now gives advertisers the flexibility of using their own databases of IP Ranges to reach specific carrier traffic.”\nFonzé continued, “We want to give our advertisers the same concise targeting and full flexibility that is offered by companies such as Google and Bing. With our already existing targeting options for language, GEO, contextual, browser, OS, device, mobile carrier, site, frequency capping and day-parting, we are now offering the most comprehensive targeting solutions to the entertainment industry. This is the first of three major features we are releasing in the next few days.”\nExoClick will be demonstrating these new platform features at the following shows:-\nWebmaster Access, Amsterdam 18-21 September\nThe European Summit, Prague 22-25 September\nRACE 2015, Moscow 8-9 October\nad:tech, London 13-14 October\nGDI Conference, London 14 October\nBelarus Gaming Congress, Minsk 14-15 October\nBerlin Affiliate Conference 22-25 October\nENDS\nFOR FURTHER PRESS INFORMATION:\nGiles Hirst\npress(at)exoclick.com\nhttp://www.exoclick.com\n+34 931810272\nABOUT EXOCLICK\nLaunched in 2006 and based in Barcelona, Spain, ExoClick is an innovative global ad network serving 125+ billion geo-targeted ads a month to web and mobile advertiser/publisher platforms via its proprietary software.\nFounded by current CEO Benjamin Fonzé, ExoClick is ranked as the 4th largest ad network in the world by W3Techs and the #1 ad network for the entertainment market.
