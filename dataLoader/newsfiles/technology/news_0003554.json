Previously disadvantage schools were now identified as part and parcel of beneficiaries from government towards enhancing the quality of education. However, given these concrete changes which do indicate that the system was quite efficient during the dispensation of democracy, although not satisfactory, it is still the worrying factor that the effects of changes in our education system are not progressive and sustainable.\nIt should be known that Outcome Based Education (OBE) was much better compared to the existing Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS). Since it breached the gaps and misconceptions which were prevalent in the system, this curriculum (OBE) did encourages the independence of a learner in terms of production of knowledge and acquisition of language as a primary goal for learning. We can if not all, agree that indeed these are the changes which one can discern and appreciate. However, the staggering question will be how sustainable are these changes given the fact that we keep on changing from one pillar to the next, from one curriculum to the next. Change is not static in any process as teaching and learning process is not an event but process. In contrast, change is informed by extrinsic developmental factors such as economy, politics and socio-economical factors.\nIt is impressive that the department of basic education is vigilant to implement the curriculum (CAPS) on vast majority of its beneficiaries by inculcating the culture of learning indigenous languages. Although learning a language it’s a complex process that requires sound system and definitive one that can be above board. As much as all subject matters are concerned, the dynamics of education are not covered holistically within our basic education because of prevailing challenges which affect not only the quality of education but also the acquisition of knowledge and skills on languages. It is clear that our education system is shaky and bond to collapse since rudimentary skills which are covered on curriculum are not in accordance to the set goals as much as their manifestation is concern.\nA first year tertiary student still struggle to write a comprehensive academic essay, which brings into light the curiosity of preparatory phase of these learners during their 12 year tenure as learners. Were they prepared to be able to withstand academic challenges by showcasing independent and critical thinking? Were they prepared to bring innovative ideas in the sphere of academia? Were they prepared to creatively bring the impeccable experiences they have acquired throughout their learning preparatory phase on solving problems and making sound decisions? To all the aforementioned questions the answer will be a definite no, learners cannot evidently show that they have learned and they have concrete knowledge to solve abstract problems.\nIt is therefore my deduction that the goals which are enshrined in our current curriculum are not significantly feasible to upscale the normative need of ascertaining that our graduates are compatible, versatile and innovative. We need a curriculum that is sustainable and progressive in terms of bearing tangible fruits on learners’ abilities to manifest social skills on complex matters. As much as our learners are still insatiably occupied to their misdemeanor of delinquency and disobedience, we should just know that the curriculum does not carter their needs to make them sustainable, progressive and independent citizens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:05:47.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
