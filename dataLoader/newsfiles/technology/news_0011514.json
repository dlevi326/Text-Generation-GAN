With the Canvas Spark 2, we are yet again reaffirming our commitment to increase the smartphone and Internet usage in the country,\" said its chief executive Vineet Taneja. \n\"Currently, smartphone penetration stands at 12% in the country and 3G adoption is also barely 10 percent, which presents a huge opportunity to upgrade. We believe that the e-commerce channel is also expanding and the 3-4K category will be the next frontier,\" he added. \nThe new smartphone will be powered by a 1.3Ghz quad-core processor and will have an internal memory of 4 GB while running on the latest Android Lollipop. \nIt will also sport a five-inch display with a five-megapixel rear camera and a two-megapixel front camera.
