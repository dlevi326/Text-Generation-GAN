(Photo: Business Wire) \n“Consumer phone cases today are either too bulky, low quality, or have one simple design,” said Shane Pope, co-founder of ClickBack. “Many iPhone users own multiple phone cases that they change frequently for a different look. ClickBack phone cases provide the ability for users to change their case without changing their case by simply clicking in a new back. We believe this fills a significant gap in the phone case market.” \nAt launch, the ClickBack case will be offered in both black and white and will be available for Apple iPhone 5/5s and Apple iPhone 6/6s. Initially, backs are available in more than 100 different designs. \n“Smart phone users are increasingly looking for their device to be a fashion accessory as much as it is a communications tool,” said Collin Sommerhauser, co-founder of ClickBack. “With its interchangeable backs, ClickBack phone cases gives people the power to easily change their phone case design for any occasion.” \nGREEK LICENSING \nClickBack Phone Cases has established a licensing agreement with Greek Licensing to offer college sorority and fraternity letters, logos and insignias on its interchangeable phone case backs. Over time, ClickBack plans to arrange additional licensing deals with larger organizations to use popular trademarked logos, symbols and images on its backs. \nPRE-ORDER \nAt launch, ClickBack cases will be on sale only on www.ClickBackcase.com for $20 with all backs priced at five dollars. ClickBack has also partnered with Nothing But Nets , an organization that delivers mosquito nets to families in Africa to help stop the spread of malaria. ClickBack will be donating one dollar to this organization for every case that’s pre-ordered. \nABOUT CLICKBACK \nClickBack Phone Cases Inc. was founded in January 2015 with the goal of creating an innovative, new phone case design that combines style and protection with simple interchangeability.
