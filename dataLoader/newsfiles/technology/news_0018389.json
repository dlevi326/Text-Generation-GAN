With Nasuni, SHI UK customers can store all their files in a NAS service that provides the speed of a local NAS, as well as properties made possible by the Microsoft Azure cloud: unlimited capacity, automatic backup and accessibility from anywhere in the world. \nNasuni is able to achieve this kind of functionality because it combines on-premises hardware with its proprietary UniFS cloud file system. All data is encrypted using keys that only the customer controls; Nasuni, SHI UK and Microsoft never have access to customer files. \n\" SHI UK's knowledgeable sales teams and trusted customer support make it the perfect partner to bring Nasuni to customers throughout EMEA,\" said Warren Mead , Vice President of Business Development and Channels at Nasuni. \"Demand for our cloud NAS solution is growing quickly, so we're glad to have an organization like SHI working alongside us as we continue to expand internationally.\" \n\"This partnership is yet another example of the interest we're seeing in Nasuni,\" said Scott Sinclair , analyst at the Enterprise Strategy Group. \"The storage status quo simply isn't working in the face of the exponential growth of file data, and large organizations are looking for alternative solutions like Nasuni that leverage the cloud.\" \n\"Every partnership we explore and sign begins with our customers' needs and demands,\" said Darren Brodrick , SHI's UK General Manager. \"Our partnership with Nasuni grew out of the increasing pain that businesses are facing with files. The amount of files that IT needs to manage is doubling every two or three years, while they're facing growing demands to increase access globally while cutting costs. With Nasuni, customers gain unlimited capacity, automatic backup and fast access for about half of what it typically costs to refresh their file backup systems alone.\" \nAbout SHI SHI is a $6 billion provider of information technology products to companies across the world, ranging from SMBs to international enterprise companies. SHI UK was established in 1998 as the EMEA headquarters for SHI, allowing SHI to deliver exceptional service and specialist knowledge to new markets. Since, SHI has provided support to customers large and small through its dedicated staff of software volume licensing experts, hardware procurement specialists, and certified IT services professionals. \nFor more information, please visit www.uk.shi.com . \nSocial Media Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T11:11:50.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
