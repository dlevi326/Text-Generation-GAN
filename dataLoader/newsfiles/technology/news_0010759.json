Actifio helps businesses speed up their data protection and application development processes, while transitioning them to the cloud. \n“We’ve been using Actifio successfully for years to backup our critical databases, and provision data for our development and engineering lab environments,” said Paz Tal-Shachar, IT Manager at Kenshoo, the global leader in agile marketing software. “Now with Actifio Sky in AWS, we’re enabling Disaster Recovery in the cloud without the constant expense of running a second datacenter. It is also accelerating the data refresh processes for our developers working in AWS.\" \nAt Amazon Web Services (AWS) re:Invent 2015 , Actifio will showcase its capabilities to deliver AWS-based backup, disaster recovery and test data management solutions for enterprises and managed services providers. The sold-out AWS re:Invent conference takes place from October 6-9th at The Venetian in Las Vegas and represents the AWS community’s most influential developers, IT managers, executive decision makers and cloud thought leaders. \nLive Actifio demonstrations at booth #754 in the AWS re:Invent Central (exhibit hall) will show enterprise IT organizations how they can modernize their backup and disaster recovery processes by vaulting their data securely to AWS, or by protecting AWS-resident workloads with Copy Data Virtualization. In addition, Actifio will show how developers and test teams can access virtual copies of multi-TB databases in less than 5 minutes with Actifio Sky for AWS . \nVisitors to the booth can learn first-hand from Actifio’s team of copy data management experts, cloud engineers and company co-founder and Senior Vice President of Solutions Development, David Chang. Conference attendees will also have the opportunity to receive a $100 credit to trial Actifio Sky in the AWS Marketplace , and to win a $500 “Fly Anywhere with Actifio Sky” airline flight voucher. \nParticipation at AWS re:Invent builds on the July announcement of Actifio Sky for AWS availability as a listing in the AWS Marketplace making it easier for enterprise customers to leverage the cloud for critical functions such as backup, recovery and application test and development. \n“Our focus is on helping enterprise customers get the public cloud economics they want with the enterprise features they need,” said Actifio Founder & CEO Ash Ashutosh. “More and more of our enterprise customers are using Actifio as a means of extending their data management model into AWS, eliminating the need for capital intensive remote sites while enhancing the protection and accessibility of their data, and the speed and quality of their application development efforts.” \nMeet with Actifio at AWS re:Invent.
