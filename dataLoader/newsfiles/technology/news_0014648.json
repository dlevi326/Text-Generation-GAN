Corals provide clues for climate change research July 16, 2014 \n(Phys.org) —Just as growth rings can offer insight into climate changes occurring during the lifespan of a tree, corals have much to tell about changes in the ocean. At Caltech, climate scientists Jess F. Adkins and Nivedita ... New study shows three abrupt pulse of carbon dioxide during last deglaciation October 29, 2014 \nA new study shows that the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide that contributed to the end of the last ice age more than 10,000 years ago did not occur gradually, but was characterized by three \"pulses\" in which C02 rose abruptly. Permafrost soil: Possible source of abrupt rise in greenhouse gases at end of last Ice Age November 20, 2014 \nScientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) have identified a possible source of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases that were abruptly released to the atmosphere ... Carbon release from ocean helped end the Ice Age February 11, 2015 \nA release of carbon dioxide from the deep ocean helped bring an end to the last Ice Age, according to new research led by the University of Southampton. Copepod migrations are important for the ocean's uptake of CO2 September 9, 2015 \nIn a scientific article recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), researchers from DTU Aqua, the University of Copenhagen and the University of Strathclyde, Scotland, have shown that the ... Recommended for you How fossil corals can shed light on the Earth's past climate September 24, 2015 \nIn a paper published today in Science, researchers from the University of Bristol describe how they used radiocarbon measured in deep-sea fossil corals to shed light on carbon dioxide (CO2) levels during the Earth's last ... Tiny plankton can play a major role in CO2 storage in the oceans September 24, 2015 \nTiny zooplankton animals, each no bigger than a grain of rice, may be playing a huge part in regulating climate change, research involving the University of Strathclyde has found. Nearly half of US seafood supply is wasted September 23, 2015 \nAs much as 47 percent of the edible U.S. seafood supply is lost each year, mainly from consumer waste, new research from the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future (CLF) suggests. Economist suggests world needs to price coal correctly to reduce reliance on it (Update) September 18, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—Economist Ottmar Edenhofer with Technische Universität Berlin, has published a Perspectives piece in the journal Science outlining the reasons for coal dominance as a means for producing electricity around the ... Global warming: Are trees going on strike? September 23, 2015 \nTrees, crucial absorbers of climate-harming carbon dioxide gas, may finally be balking at an ever-earlier spring season brought on by global warming, researchers said Wednesday. Researchers reveal when global warming first appeared September 22, 2015 \nThe indications of climate change are all around us today but now researchers have revealed for the first time when and where the first clear signs of global warming appeared in the temperature record and where those signals ... 1 comment", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T21:54:39.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
