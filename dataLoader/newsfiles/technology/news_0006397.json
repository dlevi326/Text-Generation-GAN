(Ask her to explain the businesses’ full, cheeky name. “It always sparks a conversation whether you take it negatively or positively.”)\nKanto is open Tuesday to Saturday. You’ll find Joyce and/or her 70-year-old mom Catalina Libunao running there, preparing everything from scratch.\nJoyce has ambitions, namely to share her food with everyone and “make it mainstream.”\nAll right, then. Let’s cook.\nJoyce comes to the test kitchen — which is more spacious than Kanto — carrying all the fixings for her $7.50 tapsilog, which she calls “the steak and eggs” of Filipino cuisine.\nShe thinly slices a handsome hunk of marbled rib-eye, marinates it ever so briefly and pan-fries the meat while transforming jasmine rice into garlic fried rice and frying eggs sunny side up.\nAll of this — the backbone of tapsilog if you will — comes together in a snap.\nBut, let’s be honest: the embellishments (fried garlic bits and papaya slaw) were prepared in advance. Joyce talks me through those recipes. They are worth the extra effort.\nVince Talotta/Toronto Star\nEvery good tapsilog starts with a gorgeous hunk of beef, preferably with some marbling. Other key ingredients: jasmine rice, green papaya salw, fried garlic bits and bottled calamansi (a citrus extract).\nThis is the abridged version of her life story. Born in Oroquieta City. Went to university. Worked in pharmaceutical sales and marketing. Came to Canada “kinda by accident” when she was 26 in 2001 after driving a friend to drop off her visa application and being enticed to apply for landed immigrant status.\n“Canada? Where is it?” she asked.\nEight unusually short months later, Canada said yes and Joyce hopped a plane. She knew one person here, her friend who soon died of cancer. She found work at McDonald’s. They made her clean toilets and regret her big move. “I was crying. ‘What did I do? I had a good job in the Philippines.’ ”\nShe later moved on to telemarketing and became an insurance broker, as she fell in love with cooking. She started catering in 2007 and opened Kanto in 2012.\nNow 40, Joyce can call herself an award-winning cook. She won the people’s choice award during the street eats competition at the Kultura Filipino Arts Festival in August.\n“It was my third year in the competition and I’m always the bridesmaid. I always have the most sales and the most lineups, but I never won until now.”\nShe competed with taho, homemade silken tofu with tapioca pearls and simple syrup garnished with her mom’s famous peanut brittle. She also sold tapsilog, turon (banana spring rolls) and sisig fries (her Filipino poutine with pork offals and lemon garlic aioli) so who knows what dish really clinched her win.\nThe prize was pretty sweet — a business class ticket to the Philippines. Joyce’s 22-month-old daughter flies free and her husband bought an economy-class ticket. It will be his first trip there and her first time back in 14 years. They leave next week.\nYou don’t need me to tell you that Joyce is going to revisit and analyze the dishes that she grew up with.\n“Different cities, different delicacies.”\nShe will bring the best of them back to us.\nKanto’s Tapsilog (Filipino Breakfast)\nVince Talotta/Toronto Star\nTapsilog, a Filipino breakfast that of course can be eaten any time of day, combines marinated beef, garlic fried rice and a fried egg with a green papaya and carrot slaw.\nKanto chef/owner Diona Joyce shares her recipe for tapsilog, a meal that combines marinated beef (tapa), garlic fried rice (sinangag) and fried eggs (itlog) that can be eaten any time. Calamansi (a.k.a. calamondin) is a citrus fruit that grows wild in the Philippines. I found a bottled version at T+T Supermarket near the soy sauce. It brightens the meat.\nTapa (Marinated Beef):\n1-1/2 lb (675 g) boneless beef, preferably rib eye, sliced as thin as possible in thumb-size pieces\n1/2 cup (125 mL) soy sauce\n1 tbsp (15 mL) white vinegar\n1 tbsp (15 mL) fresh or bottled calamansi extract/liquid seasoning (or combination of fresh lemon/lime/orange juice)\n1 tbsp (15 mL) pressed or puréed garlic\n1 tbsp (15 mL) light brown sugar\n1 tsp (5 mL) black pepper\n1 tbsp (15 mL) canola oil\nGarlic Fried Rice:\n4 cups (1L) cooked jasmine rice\n1-1/2 tsp (7 mL) Fried Garlic Bits (recipe follows)\nPinch kosher salt\nCanola oil for frying\nFor serving:\n4 fried eggs (preferably sunny side up)\nAtchara (Green Papaya Slaw), optional recipe follows\nFried Garlic Bits for sprinkling\n***\nFor beef, in mixing bowl, combine beef, soy, vinegar, calamansi or citrus juice, garlic, sugar and pepper. Mix well by hand. Refrigerate, covered, at least 30 minutes but preferably overnight.\nTo cook, heat large, non-stick skillet over high heat. Discard any marinade/juices from meat. Add meat to pan. Drizzle with oil. Cook, stirring, until just cooked through and starting to brown, draining juices if needed, 4 to 5 minutes.\nFor rice, you can simply stir together hot rice, fried garlic and salt. Or make fried rice by warming cold rice in a large, non-stick skillet with a splash of oil over high heat, and then stirring in garlic and salt.\nTo serve, divide beef, garlic rice and fried eggs among 4 plates. If desired, add spoonful atchara to each serving and sprinkle with Fried Garlic Bits.\nTo eat, break the yolk over everything to make it saucy.\nMakes 4 servings.\nFried Garlic Bits\nThis is how Joyce fries her garlic so it doesn’t burn and stays consistently browned. You can make any amount of garlic that you like.\n2 heads garlic, cloves peeled, minced or puréed (about 1/4 cup/60 mL)\nCanola oil for frying\n***\nFill a small saucepan with about 1-1/2 to 2 inches (4 to 5 cm) oil and heat over medium. If you have a heatproof, deep-fry thermometer, heat to 325F (160C). Add garlic. Cook, whisking with a wire whisk constantly so it doesn’t clump, until garlic is deep golden brown, about 2-1/2 minutes.\nTransfer with slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Cool completely. Refrigerate in sealed container.\nMakes about 1/4 cup (60 mL).\nAtchara (Green Papaya Slaw)\nJoyce’s sweet slaw recipe really pulls the tapsilog together, but it’s extra work and optional. Buy green papayas (unripe papayas with crunchy, pale green, fairly tasteless flesh) in Asian supermarkets, usually beside the root vegetables, not near sweet, ripe papayas. Shred with a food processor or grate with a box grater.\n1-1/2 cups (375 mL) white vinegar\n1-1/2 cups (375 mL) granulated sugar\n1 tsp (5 mL) kosher salt\n1-inch (2.5-cm) piece fresh ginger, peeled, minced\n1/2 each: red and green bell peppers, julienned\n1 medium carrot, peeled, shredded/grated\n1/2 medium green papaya, peeled, seeded, shredded/grated\n***\nIn medium saucepan, stir together vinegar and sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat, whisking until sugar is dissolved. Add salt and ginger; return to boil. Add bell peppers; return to boil. Add carrots; return to boil. Add papaya; return to boil. Stir well.\nCool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. You can eat immediately, but it’s better if you refrigerate at least 12 hours. This should keep several weeks in the fridge.\nMakes about 3-1/2 cups (875 mL).\njbain@thestar.ca\nMore on thestar.com\nCotton Candy grapes are like a carnival in your mouth", "external_links": ["http://kanto.ca/", "http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "http://www.kultura.ca/"], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T21:02:08.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
