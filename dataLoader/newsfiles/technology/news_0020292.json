This new alliance will allow InfoRelay customers to utilize Amazon’s diverse set of cloud technologies, which are designed to help organizations work more efficiently, reduce IT costs and scale based on business needs. Even with the numerous business advantages cloud-based applications offer, physical hardware colocated at a data center can offer cost and performance benefits. By becoming an AWS Partner, InfoRelay has effectively converged cloud and colocation , allowing existing and new customers to virtually extend their physical infrastructure with on-demand cloud computing resources. The seamless platform will allow clients to spin up cloud instances for development or production use, on the same network as their physical infrastructure.\nIntegrating physical servers and network equipment with cloud-based capacity enables businesses to deploy hybrid data center solutions. Enterprises with predictable computing requirements that have occasional or seasonal bursts in traffic can save money by colocating equipment to handle their typical requirements. With InfoRelay’s hybrid model, these businesses can burst into the cloud during peak traffic times to accommodate additional network activity. Conversely, companies that have complex storage requirements can operate their own hardware in conjunction with cloud-based storage services, such as Amazon S3. These services can be accessed via direct connection to the customer's cabinet or cage at the InfoRelay data center.\nAccording to InfoRelay’s executive team, becoming a Technology Partner with Amazon has long been a part of their growth and customer support strategy. “Connecting to AWS is part of our overall goal of empowering our customers through colocation and cloud services,” explained Director of Product Development Josh Abraham. “We want them to be able to succeed and have seamless connectivity whether they run services on their equipment, on the InfoRelay cloud or on AWS.”\nInfoRelay President, Russell Weiss, continued with the same sentiment while reinforcing the importance of utilizing these tools based on business needs. \"I've been a long-time proponent of leveraging the benefits of cloud technologies, however, many of our clients have found that cloud is not always a replacement for colocation or data centers. It's all about using the right tool for the job, and now InfoRelay offers both,” stated Weiss.\nAmazon’s Web Services suite will be available to customers at InfoRelay’s four Northern Virginia data centers and three locations in Los Angeles, California.\nAbout InfoRelay Online Systems, Inc.\nInfoRelay Online Systems, Inc. delivers enterprise-level managed services and wholesale data center services to thousands of clients, including Fortune 500 companies and federal agencies. InfoRelay improves its clients' efficiency and profitability through the company's array of reliable IT services.
