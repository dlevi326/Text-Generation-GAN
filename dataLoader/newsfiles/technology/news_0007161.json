The problem of leadership can be identified in the highest position of the land and across various sectors of society, be they private or public. I am arguing that the more we scathe Zuma for being corrupt and incompetent, we are to some extent doing something correct but to some extent we are unconsciously fundamentally running away from putting the blame on ourselves as a society and individuals.\nZuma did not elect himself (may be did vote for himself); but it is a South African society that elected him to the position of presidency. ‘If’ Zuma messes up, before we are angry with him we should, I insist, to a large extent also turn to ourselves. Surely, the signs were all around us but we went on to elect him. It is us who gave the man our trust and rights to exercise authority as a leader of this country.\nTo an extent that we democratically gave him trust and authority we should not only regret our actions, we should also blame ourselves. We must in a serious way come to realize that we are as much of a problem as he is.\nSeveral fundamental questions should strike at the core of our democratic responsibility as South Africans. Did we seriously ask ourselves probing questions about the quality of the character we were about to elect?\nDid we do some analysis of roles he had played in the past and saw what progress or regress followed him? Did we seriously think about the needs of the post-colonial and post-apartheid South African when we elected him?\nDid we vote for a party or did we vote for a leader? Has our fear and silence to criticize the man been also part of the problem? Saliently, these questions are not so much concerned about Zuma but they are concerned about us citizens and the responsibilities we have to shape the direction and content of this country.\nSome people may simply retort and argue that they did not vote for Zuma; so, it is better to blame the majority of ignorant black people for this crisis. But this response also imbibes waters from a shallow stream that excuses and eschews responsibility on the part of the agent. What did you do to address this problem?\nDid you try to educate these people? Did you take time out to go where these ignorant people live and try to intervene somehow? The key question is not what they did and how ignorant it is; but what did you to to change or challenge the problem. Or, did you sit back, blame, criticize and did nothing to progressively contend and contest a reality that you think is problematic.\nSo, the quality of our leadership says something about the quality of agents/citizens in our society.\nYes, Zuma might be a bad leader; but, what about you in your social space? Do you have a company?\nCan your employees say we have our own ‘Zuma’ or do they see a leader who is progressive to social, economic and political issues? Do you have a family – does your family see a Zuma or do they see a leader?\nIs your son/daughter attending some school – are you involved and engaged on issues in that school? It is easy to see big problems in the presidency since they are before our eyes and the media is bringing them to us. But, we need to zoom into the micro level and ask serious questions of leadership. If we are also equally mediocre at the micro level then we are also bad leaders equally, except, luckily, that there is no media to announce and expose us.\nSo, are you a social problem or an agent of solutions?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:05:40.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
