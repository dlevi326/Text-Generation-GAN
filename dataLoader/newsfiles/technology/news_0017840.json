Red Herring editors were among the first to recognize that companies such as Google, Facebook, Kakao, Twitter, Rakuten, Salesforce.com, Xiaomi and YouTube would change the way we live and work.\n“Choosing the companies with the strongest potential was by no means a small feat,” said Alex Vieux, publisher and CEO of Red Herring. “After rigorous contemplation and discussion, we narrowed our list down from hundreds of candidates from across Asia to the Top 100 Winners. We believe AELOGICA embodies the vision, drive and innovation that define a successful entrepreneurial venture. AELOGICA should be proud of its accomplishment, as the competition was as strong as ever.”\nRed Herring’s editorial staff evaluated the companies on both quantitative and qualitative criteria, such as financial performance, technology innovation, management quality, strategy, and market penetration. This assessment of potential is complemented by a review of the track record and standing of startups relative to their peers, allowing Red Herring to see past the “buzz” and make the list a valuable instrument of discovery and advocacy for the most promising new business models in Asia.\nFounder and CEO, Steven Talcott Smith believes the Red Herring Top 100 Asia award signals an exciting new phase for AELOGICA: “Good things are happening! This is a great boost to our team and recognition for the hard work everyone has put in to make AELOGICA such a great company.” He further adds, “We look forward to launching our new service, appexpress.io , soon and realizing the high expectations placed on us through this award.”\nAbout Red Herring\nRed Herring is a global media company, which unites the world’s best high technology innovators, venture investors and business decision makers in a variety of forums, including print, online and exclusive events worldwide.
