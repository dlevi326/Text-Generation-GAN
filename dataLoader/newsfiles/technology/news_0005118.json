These include salt lakes, brine from desalination plants and saline ground water,\" says Dr Helfer. \n\"The largest Australian urban centres are located near the ocean and close to river mouths, ideal conditions for the construction of osmotic power plants.\" \nA unique aspect of the study is the suggestion of the use of brine-which is rejected during the desalination process--as a source of osmotic energy. \n\"Even taking into account the current inefficiencies of PRO, and based on the power generated under laboratory conditions and published by other institutions, a mixture of seawater and brine could generate power in a PRO plant adjacent to a desalination plant,\" says Dr Helfer. \n\"This power would be used in the desalination process while the PRO plant, in turn, would use the reject brine as the draw solution and seawater as the feed solution.\" \nDr Helfer and Professor Lemckert agree that significant technical and economic improvements are required to ensure the commercial viability and credibility of PRO membrane technology. \nHowever, they also consider PRO-assisted desalination a promising alternative for the industry worldwide, one that provides power to the desalination process--thus reducing the industry's reliance on fossil fuels--and the opportunity to minimise environmental impacts caused by the discharge of concentrated brine into the sea. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:02:15.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
