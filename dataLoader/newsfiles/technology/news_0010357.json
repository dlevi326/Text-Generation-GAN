While the resilience of the financial system has continued to improve, downside risks have risen,\" the committee said.\nThe panel, chaired by BOE Governor Mark Carney, said investors have pulled $US90 billion from China and other emerging markets in the past year amid concerns about those regions' economic outlook and the prospect of an interest rate rise in the US\nThe committee said upcoming stress tests for the UK banking system will determine how vulnerable lenders are to the risks emanating from overseas. Banks have loans and other claims on emerging markets equivalent to three and a half times their equity, and asset managers are also materially exposed, the BOE said.\nThe FPC also flagged concerns, shared by the Federal Reserve and other regulators, about recent episodes of volatility in financial markets caused by a shortage of liquidity, when investors find it difficult to easily buy or sell assets.\nTo date, these episodes have been short-lived and haven't undermined overall financial stability, the panel said. But it warned \"heightened volatility and reductions in market depth could have more widespread and persistent effects.\" Officials said they are particularly concerned that a more severe disruption could hit lending to households and businesses.\nThe FPC asked staff and regulators to prepare a fuller report on market functioning for its next meeting in December.\nThe committee added Friday that it doesn't see any reason to suspend a flagship government initiative to help first-time buyers onto the housing ladder. The UK treasury had asked the BOE to review its Help-to-Buy program once a year to determine whether it was fuelling a bubble in prices and needed to be scaled back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T12:09:17.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
