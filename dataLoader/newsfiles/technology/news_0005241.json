RELATED NEW DELHI: Social networking site Facebook has remained defiant about its free internet initiative Internet.org and said it is looking at innovative ways to provide connectivity in the country. Facebook vice president for mobile and global access policy Kevin Martin said at the India Economic Convention 2015 that the social-networking giant is planning to launch a special Wi-Fi service in India which would aid in subsidizing the cost of accessing internet. READ ALSO: Net neutrality: Facebook won't withdraw controversial Internet.org from India \"We are rolling out a kind of Wi-Fi service at a lower cost which is trying to adjust cost issue in other countries and looking out to do that in India,\" Martin said at the convention. Martin added that Facebook's internet service would come without advertisement and videos, thereby consuming lesser bandwidth and benefiting users. He added that Facebook's connectivity lab has been working with drones and unmanned aerial vehicles to lower the cost of service to people. Martin also reiterated that the social networking giant supports the concept of net neutrality and Internet.org initiative is to enable people to realize the importance of internet by providing access to basic web service free of data cost. 7 tips to get the most out of your home Wi-Fi of 8 Most people don't bother with the Wi-Fi router -- it's typically set up by the service provider or IT guy and it remains in that state for its usable life. However, you can fix many issues like low coverage, add features to your Wi-Fi setup and stop people from stealing your Wi-Fi quite easily. We show you how. If you have trouble with the Wi-Fi coverage in your home, it is most likely because of where the router is kept. The range of a typical home router is around 100 feet. Ideally, you should place your Wi-Fi router in a central location, away from walls, mirrors and other electrical equipment. The router signal is omnidirectional -- it travels in every direction, so placing it centrally would increase the coverage throughout your home. Plus, make sure that your router is placed in a high position as the Wi-Fi signals travel downwards. We recommend placing it at 3/4th the height of your room as that is far enough from the ceiling to avoid any signal interruption. The default antenna on your router is not necessarily the best one available. Most manufacturers cut costs by using the cheapest available antennas on their router. The good thing is that you can easily switch the default antenna on most routers with enhanced versions. The antennas can be easily removed as they can be screwed off by hand.You will see multiple options starting from as low as Rs 500 with free shipping. Keep in mind that high-gain antennas typically emit signals in one direction -- so you might have to place your router accordingly. Otherwise, get a booster antenna that works the same way as the standard antenna but increases the range and strength. Most of us never bother to look at the various settings and tweaks available in the router software interface itself. Some routers come with settings for adjusting transmission power (also marked as TX power) -- increasing the transmission power will lead to improvements in coverage area instantly. You can also switch from the default wireless broadcast channel to another one to improve your Wi-Fi signal. Most routers work on a default channel -- if there are too many routers around using the same broadcast channel, it leads to drop in performance due to interference. In your router software setting, try and switch between various channels to find the one that shows improved performance and then use that channel. Another easy way to increase your Wi-Fi signal is to install repeaters in your home. A repeater takes signal from your Wi-Fi router and pushes it forward to increase its range. You can easily get compact repeaters the size of a smartphone wall plug -- these can be permanently plugged into a wall outlet. You need to make sure that the router and repeater have the same Wi-Fi SSID name and security settings. Next, you will need to configure the IP address of the routers -- give them static IP address so that they do not conflict with each other and switch off the DHCP setting on the repeater. In addition, the router and repeater will have to be configured on separate broadcast channels. Once you are done with these settings, place the repeater at such a place where it catches the signal from the router.
