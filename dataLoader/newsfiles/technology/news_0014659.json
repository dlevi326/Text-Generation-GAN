She expects major growth in fiscal 2016 as her team finishes transitioning contracts over to SEWP V. She said 138 of the 147 SEWP V contract holders received at least one order since the vehicle’s May launch. \nNITAAC also rolled out a new vehicle this past spring, the Chief Information Officer-Commodity Solutions (CIO-CS) contracting vehicle, which replaces ECS III, one of the three GWACs NITAAC manages. \nGSA’s GWACs are closing in on $4.5 billion in contract awards for fiscal 2015, according to the agency’s GWAC portal. That’s just under fiscal 2014’s $5 billion total, but still well above fiscal 2013’s $3.5 billion. \n“I think the GWACs have done a better job recently in explaining the benefit for CIO’s and other IT and acquisition planners in using already existing, well-established contracts like the GWACs to reduce their acquisition costs and time while providing more insight and control over their agency purchases,” she said. \nCoen said other GWACs, including SEWP V and the GSA’s Alliant and STARs, aren’t competing for the same pools of federal business, even though there is some overlap among their markets. \nCoen contends there is enough demand to support GWACs across the federal government as budgets for trained IT staff and support have tightened. NITAAC, SEWP and GSA GWACs, he said, “play off each other,” covering some of the same federal IT acquisition territory, but with emphasis on different areas. NITAAC’s CIO-CS, for instance, provides pre-competed contracts for IT products and services, especially those used by health agencies. \nNITAAC has been offering assisted acquisition consulting services for civilian agencies for about a year, said Coen. The program acts as an IT consultant for the customer, from initial market research through the contract’s completion. On Oct.1, Coen said NITAAC will expand the assisted acquisition services into the Department of Defense. “It’s a natural move,” he said.
