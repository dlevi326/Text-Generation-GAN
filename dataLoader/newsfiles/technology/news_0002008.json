Odell. Stretching Time: Mastering the Art of Long Exposure Photography is a complete guide for anyone interested in transforming scenes into dynamic works of art. Photographs are presented as a static medium, capturing moments in time. With long exposures, photographs take on new properties, as moving objects blur or even disappear.

Starting with the fundamentals of exposure and composition, readers will learn about the techniques and equipment needed to capture fine-art long exposures.\nStretching Time goes beyond basic photography techniques, too. Photographers will learn how to use camera movement, multiple exposures, and Adobe Photoshop to create unique images that go beyond simple bulb exposures. Readers will learn about the types of filters used in long exposure photography and how to use them properly in the field. They will also learn a variety of other techniques for creating images that stretch time, including composite stacking in Photoshop.\nStretching Time is delivered in full color as a printable, high-resolution PDF eBook format.
