James Martin/CNET\nWhen you think of the words \"world domination,\" you probably envision a James Bond villain or some cartoon figure. Maybe you should conjure Travis Kalanick instead, complete with socks that read \"carpe diem.\"\nKalanick, CEO of the ride-hailing service that's become the world's highest-valued startup, said the perfect future he sees is one in which every car driving around is connected to Uber, available to give you a lift whenever you need.\n\"We want to make transportation as reliable as running water,\" Kalanick said, touting the benefits of this approach as less traffic congestion, fewer cars competing for parking spaces and more jobs for drivers. But, he said, normal people would benefit too because they could rely on the service, rather than getting behind the wheel themselves. \"Our whole thing is about making Uber cheaper than owning a car.\"\nKalanick was speaking at a \"fireside chat\" with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff during Salesforce's annual DreamForce convention in San Francisco on Wednesday. Decked in a dark suit with a pastel shirt and hot pink socks printed with the words \"carpe diem\" (Latin for \"seize the day\"), Kalanick discussed the latest facts and figures from his company, as well as his hopes for Uber's future.\nKalanick isn't just some overzealous Silicon Valley executive. As the head of Uber, he's leading a company valued at more than $50 billion. The idea seems simple: pair drivers with passengers via a smartphone app, essentially creating a taxi service out of any phone with an Internet connection. Uber has become the biggest ride-hailing service on the planet, operating in 60 countries. It serves up thousands of rides per minute, on average, Kalanick said. And 100,000 people use its carpooling service, called UberPool, each week in every city where it's available.\nBut the company isn't stopping here, Kalanick said: Uber is looking to expand to every street corner, from small-town America to the Middle East and Africa.\nJust like any Bond villain with the perfect plan, Kalanick has some roadblocks to overcome. Uber has been beset with controversies about how it classifies drivers for tax purposes, whether it properly vets drivers before sending them on the road to pick up passengers and when it disregards local laws not just in the US but in many other countries as well. Uber has even been criticized because its drivers have reportedly broken laws that protect passengers in wheelchairs .\nSome of these controversies threaten to unravel Uber's business model. But Kalanick largely ignored them all, saying instead that the company is \"pumped to give rides around the city\" and provide drivers with \"an income opportunity.\"\n\"We give riders high-fives,\" he said. \"We give drivers hugs.\"\nAs far as what's in Uber's future, besides transforming every car on the road to an Uber, Kalanick said the company will continue to look into driverless cars and expand into the delivery sector, as with its food delivery service, UberEats .\n\"Once you can deliver cars in five minutes, there's a lot of things you can deliver in five minutes,\" he said. \"If something is moving from somewhere to somewhere else in a city, that's our jam.\"", "external_links": ["http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/16/8f5570a9-0efd-49fd-afdf-a8b86e77b717/resize/970x546/d3c74526a0b67f4d5d4ace6c1760da22/travis-kalanick-uber-dreamforce-2015-3668.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-16T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:52:57.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
