Few buildings could be expected to rival the space-age angles of Gehry’s iconic 2003 structure, but the Broad certainly tries, presenting itself as a work of art on par with the contemporary masterpieces it was built to house.\nRelated Story Over the Moon Apple: The Media Swoon Over Frank Gehry's Disney Hall\nWhen it opens on September 20, the Broad will become the city’s second richest museum behind the Getty—its endowment of $200 million is more than the endowments of the neighboring Museum of Contemporary Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art—as well as the latest edition to the developing downtown arts district. Commissioned by the billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad and his wife Edythe, the $140 million museum will showcase and store the couple ’s more than 2,000- piece collection.\nDiller Scofidio + Renfro, the New York architecture firm best known for the High Line in Manhattan and the Contemporary Institute of Art in Boston, designed the 120,000-square-foot museum with the dominating Walt Disney Hall in mind . In contrast to Gehry’s smoothly curved titanium panels, which make up a haphazardly layered, extroverted facade, the Broad is solidly square with an asymmetric base and a matte exoskeleton of an exterior made of fiberglass-reinforced concrete. The honeycomb facade diffuses natural light inside the building and compliments the skylights on the roof while keeping the Broad’s considerable collection of post-war art safe from overexposure.", "external_links": ["http://www.dezeen.com/2015/09/03/diller-scofidio-renfro-releases-first-official-photos-of-the-broad-museum-los-angeles-iwan-baan-hufton-crow/"], "published": "2015-09-16T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:26:00.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
