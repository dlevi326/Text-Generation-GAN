DCS is distributed in such a way that each component or sub-system of a manufacturing plant is controlled by one or more controllers, thereby providing instructions to different parts of the plant. Thus, instead of having a centrally located control system, each section of the plant has its own control operations. DCS solutions, hence, enable the effective and efficient control and management of the entire plant. Further, they facilitate a reduction in downtime errors and an increase in the productivity of the plant. DCS is adopted by industries that require multi-step processing such as power, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, pulp and paper, food and beverage, chemical, automotive, and packaging.
