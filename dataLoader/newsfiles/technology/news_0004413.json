According to Wired’s correspondent, after putting on your Oculus Rift or equivalent, you are plunged into the middle of the orchestra, with a sophisticated interface that changes the sound and what you see depending on which way you’re facing. Where Wired was bowled over - “no programming [of VR] has moved me as much”, over at Slate, there was less overwhelm-ment , and more frustration about the lack of real flexibility in the software, as well as a plea to make the VAN experience last as long as a whole movement or whole symphony rather than a virtually bleeding chunkette.\nNone of which would probably impress Anthony Tommasini at the New York Times , who makes a plea this week for “classical music as a haven for device-free absorption in live musical performances … Where else in society, right now, are the web-free spaces? … We’re down to the concert hall and the opera house. Now, that’s a selling point.” Tommasini writes, somewhat unfashionably, about classical music’s demands on our collective attention spans in the face of our withering abilities to concentrate throughout our culture.\nWhat was I saying? Oh, right, sorry...\nTommasini may have a point, but there are many examples of the opposite trend, what with our obsession with box-set binges and Netflix marathons. Tommasini rails against “even older audience members” checking their emails until the first downbeat is given in the concert hall – “most then put their devices away – though not everyone, I’ve found to my amazement”. (I’m with him on that particular phone-free stricture for orchestral concerts.)\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Even older audience members’ check their emails until the first downbeat is given. Photograph: Alamy\nFollowing through his ideas, however, the suggestion that classical music concerts need to be sold as these tech-free oases of un-networked bliss is, I think, missing the point and the opportunity of our digital age. There are many contexts in which some kind of technological interactivity isn’t just an intrusion but an essential part of the experience, and there are imaginative ways of delivering much more meaningful information about a piece and a performance thanks to the infinity of little blue screens we all carry around with us.\nFor me, it’s a question of respect for the performers and your fellow audience members. The supposed passivity of the conventional concert situation is a myth: the audience has always been essential to the experience; their attention is almost as much a performance as, well, the performance! But there are a growing number of contexts – in the concert hall and across broadcast media – where that isn’t true any more; in which audiences are experiencing classical music in multiple enriching dimensions thanks to the wizardry of their manifold devices, phones, tablets, computers, talking fridges and networked toasters. And that’s OK too.\nSo while the US west and east coasts might be offering these diametrically different takes on the possibilities for the future, the beauty for all of us is that we can have both the web-free oasis and the heightened-reality technopolis. Long live the new flesh!
