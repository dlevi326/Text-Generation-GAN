Startup InsiteVR created an online service that lets architects or interior designers transport people into projects to see them from the inside.\nThe service is available on-demand or by subscription and has 30 customers, according to co-founder Angel Say.\nInsiteVR charges about $200 for the virtual equivalent of a one-bedroom apartment, Say said.\n- Big business by 2020 -\nResearch company Tractica recently estimated that global revenue related to virtual reality gear and content has the potential to reach $21.8 billion by 2020, with a huge chunk of that resulting from professional uses.\nHowever the market remains far from critical mass.\nWhile virtual reality is a hot topic, there are not a lot of sales for now, Rousseau said.\nThat sentiment was shared by Canada-based Retinad, which was in San Francisco showcasing software that can collect usage statistics on virtual reality applications, with the potential to distribute advertising in faux worlds.\nBeverage giant Coca-Cola has started some testing, but \"there are not enough players in the market to justify that big brands are starting to advertise,\" said Retinad co-founder Samuel Poirier.\nBut the market is ever-expanding. Already, Samsung Gear VR and inexpensive Google Cardboard have let people have virtual reality experiences using smartphones as screens fitted into headsets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T14:11:33.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
