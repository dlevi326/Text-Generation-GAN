The tie up would be completed next year if all approvals are obtained.\n\"We are on track for completion of the BG combination in early 2016,\" a Shell spokesman said in an email.\nBut investor concerns have been reflected in the broad spread between the fluctuating value of BG's share price and Shell's offer for each BG share.\nThe gap -- known as the \"arb spread\" -- serves as an indicator of what traders stand to make when investing in an acquisition target ahead of a deal's completion. Wider spreads sometimes suggest declining confidence in the value of a target, like BG, because investors don't believe the deal will close. According to data from Jefferies, the spread is around 11.5 per cent, after widening to nearly 18 per cent at one point in August.\nAnalysts said the steep discount at which BG is trading compared with the deal value reflects the sharp slump in oil prices over the past few months and concerns over regulatory approvals that are pending.\nOil prices have plumbed new lows in the past month, with Brent crude, the international benchmark, falling as low as $US42 a barrel. The deal was announced when oil prices were around $US57 a barrel, raising speculation that Shell would consider walking away. Shell executives have said repeatedly they are committed to the deal.\nOn the regulatory front, the deal has been approved by authorities in Brazil, the US and the European Union, but it still needs the green light from Australian and Chinese antitrust bodies.\nThe tie up would give the combined company a substantial position in gas in eastern Australia. China is a growing buyer of LNG and its main antitrust agency has become increasingly forceful in recent years.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission gave some investors pause when it extended its review of the takeover last week. It postponed its decision to approve the deal or extend the process once more until September 17.\n\"There's a huge array of uncertainties...they're moving through them, but investors still harbor concerns,\" Bernstein Research analyst Oswald Clint said.\nIn response, Mr van Beurden and other executives have tried more forcefully to convince investors and analysts that the deal is a good one.\nFor Shell, the deal marks a bold move at a time of deep market uncertainty. Shell and its competitors have committed to deep spending cuts, cutting costs and slashing jobs. So far, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant is the only one among the big four oil companies to commit to enter the deals market.\nMost analysts have praised the logic of the deal and have predicted that it will be completed.\n\"I think it's highly probably that this deal goes through,\" Jason Gammel, equities analyst at Jefferies, said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:14:13.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
