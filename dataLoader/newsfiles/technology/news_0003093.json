Among Nintendo executives, Mr. Miyamoto is by far the best-known because h e created franchises such as Donkey Kong, Mario and Zelda.\nBut after two months in which the chief executive's role was vacant, the company tapped the lesser-known Mr. Kimishima to replace Mr. Iwata. The appointment is effective Wednesday, and Messrs. Takeda and Miyamoto will keep their current posts, the company said.\nMr. Kimishima, 65 years old, was a banker for more than 25 years at Sanwa Bank, which is now part of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. Osaka-based Sanwa had close relations with Nintendo, which is based in nearby Kyoto.\nMr. Kimishima joined the Nintendo fold in December 2000 as representative director of Poké mon Co., which manages licenses and other businesses related to Nintendo's Poké mon characters. From 2006 to 2013, he was chief executive of Nintendo of America Inc. He assumed his current post of managing director in June 2013.\nThe new CEO takes over as the company is embarking on its first foray into mobile gaming. In recent years, Nintendo's share price and market presence lagged behind with the rise of games on smartphones, a trend which Mr. Iwata was long reluctant to join.\nMr. Iwata's final major move as president came in March of this year, when he appeared at a news conference to say that the company would develop videogames for smartphones based on its classic characters in a partnership with DeNA Co., a Japanese game provider.\nWrite to Takashi Mochizuki at takashi.mochizuki@wsj.com\n 14, 2015 04:15 ET (08:15 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T13:38:36.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
