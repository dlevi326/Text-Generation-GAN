(NASDAQ: CONN) will celebrate the grand opening of its new Thornton, Colorado store on Saturday, September 26. The new store represents the Company’s ongoing growth in Colorado, with it being the fifth Conn’s HomePlus in the Denver area and the seventh in the state. The grand opening event will feature gift card giveaways, storewide promotions and an opportunity for local customers to enter to win a $10,000 shopping spree. \nConn’s HomePlus offers high-quality and affordable products, specializing in furniture and mattresses, home appliances, consumer electronics and home office products. \nThe new 46,000 square-foot Conn’s HomePlus at 550 E. 102 nd Avenue in Thornton has created 27 local jobs for the area — driving the Company’s job creation count to almost 200 across its seven Colorado stores.

The Company currently has more than 90 stores in 12 states and will open their 100 th store later this year. \nThe core of Conn’s continued growth and success is its in-house credit program called “YES MONEY ® ,” which offers consumers the chance to purchase high quality goods at low monthly payments they can afford, even if they have been turned down elsewhere. The ability to make aspirational items affordable has led to more than 90 percent of surveyed customers stating that they would recommend Conn’s to family and friends. \n“Opening our fifth store in the Denver area reflects the positive reception we’ve received in this market and reinforces the popularity of our YES MONEY in-store credit program,” said David Trahan, President of Conn’s Retail Division. “We work hard to give our customers smart financing options through YES MONEY, and this program is driving our growth not only in Denver but across the country as well.” \nCustomers can enter to win the $10,000 shopping spree at all seven Colorado Conn’s locations now through October 30. \nAbout Conn’s, Inc. \nConn's is a furniture and specialty retailer currently operating more than 90 retail locations in 12 states: Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
