The revolving loan will be used in part to pay off $US11.1m in pre-bankruptcy debt owed to Wells Fargo and $US19.5m owed to General Electric Capital, according to Quiksilver's bankruptcy attorney, Van C. Durrer of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom.\nThe financing package is directly linked to Quiksilver's agreement with Oaktree, which proposes to swap $US279m in senior debt for all the equity in the restructured Quiksilver. Because Oaktree holds 73 per cent of that debt, it would get a majority stake in the restructured company. Unsecured creditors would receive $US7.5m in the deal.\nMr Durrer said that Quiksilver tried to resist linking the financing to the restructuring plan agreement, but without it, Oaktree wouldn't have provided the financing, he said. If another party is interested in participating in Quiksilver's restructuring, that party would have to buy out the Oaktree loan, Mr Durrer said.\nBankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon's sign off on the financing was on an interim basis. Final approval is still required.\nThe company also received permission to continue closing more than two dozen stores and liquidating extra inventory. Quiksilver has an agreement with Hilco Merchant Resources and Gordon Brothers Retail Partners to hold going-out-of-business sales at 27 stores that together lost $US5m last year, and to sell extra inventory at pop-up stores located outside current locations. Judge Shannon's approval of this agreement was only on an interim basis and also still requires a final sign off.\nA final hearing on each of these matters is scheduled for October 6.\nAdditionally, Judge Shannon granted a number of other preliminary approvals, including permission to continue paying Quiksilver's 1,500 employees and allowing the company to pay $US30m to vendors, some of whom Mr Durrer said are struggling to pay their own employees after being stretched thin in Quiksilver's lead up to a bankruptcy filing.\nQuiksilver is one of the best-known and longest-operating surf and snowboard clothing brands, designing and distributing its products under the Quiksilver, Roxy and DC brands. The company, which traces its roots to Torquay in Australia, began making boardshorts for surfers in the US in the 1970s and is now based in Huntington Beach, California. Its products are also sold internationally; however, the European and Asia-Pacific businesses aren't part of this bankruptcy filing.\nThe cash-strapped company has struggled in recent years, plagued by business issues that slowed the delivery of Quiksilver products to stores in North America. It has been working to turn around the business since 2013, selling such assets as Mervin Manufacturing, a snowboard maker; Hawk Designs, named for skateboarder Tony Hawk; and a stake in an online retailer called Surfdome Shop.\nAlthough those deals did raise funds, operational troubles and continued weak results caused Quiksilver to enter negotiations on a chapter 11 filing in mid-August, according to its lawyer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:42:06.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
