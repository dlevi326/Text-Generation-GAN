Photo by Masixole Feni.\nCape Town - There’s silence as Margaret Constant and her brother George Lawrence walk through lush Fynbos to the stone ruins of Redhill Village, the place they once called home.\nNestled in the mountains overlooking Simon’s Town, Redhill was once home to more than 70 predominantly coloured families, before they were forcibly removed from the area in the late 1960s.\n“I was about 9 years old. My parents got a letter and we were told that we couldn’t stay here anymore. I couldn’t understand why. To us, this was our home. I was heartbroken,” says Margaret.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/718/a0d3b5868721407eb000c9033bf93e5b.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-28T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:04:51.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
