Carbon prices vary across these pilot sites, ranging from $US1.9 per tonne in Shanghai to $US7.3 per tonne in Beijing. \nLow-carbon sources of electricity will also be favoured in the country’s grid, complementing the US’s plan to reduce emissions in its power sector by 32 per cent by 2030. Both countries are also developing heavy-duty vehicle fuel efficiency standards.

The US already pledged $US3 billion to the fund last year. \nChina has also agreed to work towards controlling public funding of projects with high pollution and carbon emissions in its own country and overseas. \nWHY IS THIS SIGNIFICANT? \nClimate policy expert Associate Professor Peter Christoff told news.com.au that Australian climate change policy had so far been held back by the belief that other countries were not doing enough. \n“Now it’s clear the US and China are pushing together very hard to provide global leadership,” the University of Melbourne academic said. \nHe said the announcement, along with what the European Union and other countries were doing, meant that about 40 per cent of global emissions would now be covered by a carbon price. \n“In Australia the question of an emissions trading scheme is firmly back on the agenda and Malcolm Turnbull will have to address that question,” Prof Christoff said. \nOn Saturday, Opposition environment spokesman Mark Butler described China’s move as “spectacular” and said many Australians had hoped Mr Turnbull would “drag his party back to the sensible centre on climate change” and commit to his previously preferred emissions trading scheme. \nWhile China could have multiple motivations for acting on climate change, Prof Baldwin said it was interesting to note that China was also the world’s largest producer of renewable energy systems, both solar and wind. A solar farm under construction in Gansu province, China, is five times the size of Australia’s largest operating solar farm.

A country could also argue for punitive measures, to place a higher premium on imported goods that don’t already include a carbon price,” he said. \nIf China did take this approach, Australian products would become more expensive for Chinese to buy. \nWhen asked why China wouldn’t consider Direct Action to be an effective measure to reduce carbon emissions, Prof Baldwin said it was not funded to a sufficient level to create the change that a carbon pricing scheme could achieve, despite being effective at reducing emissions.

Another option would be to force fossil fuel based electricity generators to become more efficient, forcing them to “compete on fair grounds with renewables in terms of impact”. \nECONOMY COULD SUFFER \nWith nearly 50 jurisdictions now committed to an effective climate pricing mechanism, Prof Baldwin said change was now possible. \n“This represents now a critical mass of the world’s nations, which could enable a carbon pricing scheme to be introduced globally,” Prof Baldwin said. \n“No doubt it will have a negative impact on the economy, unless Australia itself adopts an emissions trading scheme or other measures to reduce emissions,” he said. \nBut Prof Baldwin said there were also opportunities for Australia to provide goods and services that have a low carbon content, and that assisted other countries, particularly in the region to transfer their economies towards a low carbon future. \nAs an example, Prof Baldwin said Australia could act as a regional centre for the development of renewable energy, such as micro grid systems, which could transform areas in less developed countries that were not already connected to the grid, or had unreliable electricity supplies. \nTHE FUTURE \nEnvironment Minister Greg Hunt said Australia would still take its 26 to 28 per cent 2030 emissions reduction target on 2005 levels to the Paris climate change conference but there could be scope to make more ambitious cuts. \n“It’s highly likely that the outcome from the Paris meeting will be a process for review of global and national targets, perhaps every five years, and that will prepare us for 2020, 2025 and 2030,” Mr Hunt told Fairfax . \nProf Baldwin said the conference provided an ideal opportunity for the Turnbull Government to review its climate change policies. \n“It could trigger a new set of policy directions that would more effectively meet Australia’s response to addressing climate change in the lead up to the next election,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T17:29:11.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
