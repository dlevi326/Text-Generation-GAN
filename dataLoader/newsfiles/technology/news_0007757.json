LONDON Sept. 10 2015 /- In li... http://feeds.bio-medicine.org/latest-medical-technology Date:9/10/2015 \nLONDON , Sept. 10, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- In light of an alarmingly rising incidence of cancers and limited treatment options, physicians are being forced to look beyond conventional treatments. In such a scenario, Proton Therapy, the most advanced radiation technique available, is being projected as the Rolls Royce of Radiation Oncology. Unfortunately, access to proton therapy is limited for many patients due to a low number of proton therapy centers. Hence, many research institutions and hospitals have started investing in proton therapy to make it more accessible to patients.According to the \"US Proton Therapy Market Outlook 2020\", report by RNCOS, the United States will be home to 29 such centers by 2020. Consequently, the market will breach a Billion dollar mark to attain revenue of around US$ 1.22 Billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of 11.4% during the forecast period (2014-2020).

The document covers a historical trend (2008-2014) of cancer incidences, deaths and prevalence along with state-wide and site-wide cancer incidences in the country.Based on a complex correlation-regression model accounting population demographics, disease statistics, macro & micro economic indicators of the country, etc., we have performed an opportunity assessment for the potential of proton therapy in the US.
