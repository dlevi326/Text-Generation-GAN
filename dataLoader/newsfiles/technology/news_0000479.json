Bill Walker says Royal Dutch Shell's decision to stop exploratory drilling in the Arctic shows the state needs to drive its own destiny through oil and gas development.\nShell said Monday that it was ending operations in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska after a test well gave disappointing results. The company has spent $7 billion on its Alaska drilling program.\nWalker says he's contacted the White House to set up meetings about the impact of Shell's decision on the state. The governor also says he will stress the importance of the federal government allowing oil and gas drilling along the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\nAlaska's budget relies heavily on oil revenue, but production from the once-prodigious North Slope now barely fills a quarter of the trans-Alaska pipeline.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T21:17:47.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
