Since the speed of light in air changes very little over normal temperature and pressure extremes, and its order of magnitude is faster than the speed of objects to be measured, optical time-of-flight measurement is one of the most reliable ways to accurately measure distance to objects in a contactless fashion.\nConventional optical time-of-flight sensors fall into three broad categories: direct time-of-flight, range-gated imaging, and phase detection. Leddar is a new and unique technology for performing time-of-flight measurement.\nRequest the entire paper at: http://bit.ly/1N301xF\nAbout LeddarTech\nLeddarTech is the owner and provider of the patented, leading-edge Leddar sensing technology which enables advanced detection and ranging systems.
