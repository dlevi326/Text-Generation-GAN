It will also streamline manufacturing, supply and distribution of fertiliser in the region. \nThe complex will be built in two phases. A nitrogen potassium calcium (NPK) production plant will be built in the first phase and a plant for production of diammonium phosphate (DAP), urea and calcium ammonium nitrogeWe expect the cost of production of fertiliser to reduce significantly upon completion of the local plantn (CAN) fertilisers in the second phase. \"We expect the cost of production of fertiliser to reduce significantly upon completion of the local plant.\" \nVision 2030 Delivery Secretariat acting director Gituro Wainaina said: \"We expect the cost of production of fertiliser to reduce significantly upon completion of the local plant.\" \n\"It is estimated that 40% of the cost of fertiliser is due to freight and port handling charges.\" \nThe complex is expected to roll out the first batch of fertiliser in June 2016, and produce 150,000t of fertiliser a year. \nKenya Deputy President William Ruto was quoted by Standard Digital as saying: \"Agriculture is a key sector for our economy, offering over 60% employment. \n\"Our main impediment to level competition with other countries has been the high cost of inputs, which we are systematically addressing with such projects.\" \nEarlier this year, Toyota Tsusho was awarded a $1.2bn contract to build the fertiliser complex.
