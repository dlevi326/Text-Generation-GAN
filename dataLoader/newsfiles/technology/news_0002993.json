Although business leaders know talent shortfalls prevent their companies from achieving their business goals, the HBR-AS survey reveals that they have not aligned their workforce planning process to manage the issue:\n--Almost half (44 percent) of respondents consider their workforce plans to be driven by finance and to not take talent availability considerations into account.\n--Although 72 percent would like to be able to model and compare staffing strategies across locations, teams, seniority, skills and other factors to develop better workforce plans, fewer than one-fourth (22 percent) are able to do so now.\n“For many organizations, workforce planning is a finance-driven process focused primarily on managing headcount within the cost budget. But the budgets created by finance are disconnected from the actual talent needed to execute the business objectives,” says John Schwarz, Co-Founder and CEO of Visier. “Consequently, the important decisions related to recruitment, retention, compensation, and productivity are constrained by budgets that do not reflect the people reality. It is urgent that businesses invest to bridge this critical and potentially fatal gap with a workforce intelligence solution.”\nTo improve planning, 57 percent of respondents say they need data on what positions/talent are required to meet business objectives, and 57 percent say they need data on what is happening with talent acquisition and attrition. Companies already have this type of information distributed across business functions and in multiple Human Resource Management systems. With Visier Workforce Intelligence, HR leaders can connect and analyze workforce data — from unlimited sources — to forecast and model trends, such as workforce costs and historic turnover, and then collaborate with business leaders on the scenario that is most optimal.\nTo learn more about effective workforce planning, read the Q&A between Visier’s John Schwarz and Harvard Business Review Analytic Services (HBR-AS).\nFor more information, visit: http://www.visier.com\nFind data-driven HR insights and tips at http://www.visier.com/blog\nFollow Visier on Twitter @VisierAnalytics\nLike Visier on Facebook\nAbout Visier\nA leading innovator in Applied Big Data cloud technology, Visier provides Workforce Intelligence solutions that are enabling a rapidly growing number of the world’s best brands to maximize their business outcomes through their people.\nVisier’s solutions let organizations understand and plan -- with precision -- how to best and most cost-effectively recruit, retain, and develop their workforce.
