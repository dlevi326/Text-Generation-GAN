He said the arrangement meets the requirements of U.S. fisheries and environmental laws.\nThe 26-member nation Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, which regulates fishing from east and southeast Asia to waters around Hawaii, set a limit of about 3,500 metric tons for Hawaii longline fishermen this year. That's about 7 percent less than last year.\nThe National Marine Fisheries Service enforces these limits in the U.S. This year, the Hawaii fishery reached its annual limit in August, several months earlier than in the past.\nThe agency has also proposed rules that would allow Hawaii longline fishermen to bring in more bigeye tuna by shifting some of their catch to territorial fleets, which do not face the same limits from the commission.\nIn exchange, the Hawaii longline fleet would pay the territories money to support the development of local fisheries.\nThe agency has put similar rules in place in recent years after Congress, in a 2012 appropriations bill, directed the agency to create a quota transfer program. The late Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii was Senate appropriations committee chairman at the time the bill was passed.\nLawyers in the case explained to Kobayashi their views on the validity of the agency's quota shifting rule, whether Congress' directive was still applicable or had lapsed and what federal fisheries laws require the agency to do.\nKobayashi gave the attorneys two weeks to file additional arguments.\nThe Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission counts major fishing nations such as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and the U.S. among its members along with small island states such as the Marshall Islands. About 40 percent of the global supply of bigeye is caught in waters regulated by the commission.\nHawaii longline fishermen - who string long lines in the ocean from which they run shorter lines with baited hooks -account for only 1.6 percent of the bigeye caught in this region. U.S. purse seine boats also catch bigeye in the area. They use giant nets to surround and scoop up masses of fish.\nBigeye is one of two types of tuna known as ahi. The other is yellowfin.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
