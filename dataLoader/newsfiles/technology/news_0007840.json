The tools available today allow advertisers to target the right audience and greatly increase ROI. Key themes for the upcoming summit include data-decision making, multi-channel platforms, social advertising and personalization. Advertising is not a new topic. But digital advertising has only just come to fruition. With online becoming more and more targeted, segmented and personalized, the digital advertising space is moving onwards and upwards. Video advertising is one area receiving increased investment, and Vice President of Insight & Innovation at Discovery Communications is set to discuss just that with his presentation on ‘Where is Digital Advertising Heading?’ Todd Richards looks at where the industry is moving and how people are innovating to make this function work & optimize new technology.\nAs well as increasing audience and brand awareness, digital advertising poses a great revenue stream for media companies hosting the ad space.
