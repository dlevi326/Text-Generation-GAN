The article is available free on the Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking website until October 23, 2015. \nIn the article \" Romantic Partner Monitoring after Breakups: Attachment, Dependence, Distress, and Post-Dissolution Online Surveillance via Social Networking Sites ,\" Jesse Fox, PhD, The Ohio State University, Columbus, and Robert S. Tokunaga, PhD, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Honolulu, report that individuals who were most distressed by a breakup were most likely to monitor their ex-partners online. This behavior could make it more difficult for them to recover. In the study, the authors evaluated associations between factors such as attachment (anxious versus avoidant attachment), investment in the relationship, level of commitment, responsibility for termination of the relationship, emotional distress after the breakup, and seeking relationship alternatives. \n\"Since stress may trigger problematic internet use, psychologists may wish to assess for increased usage by their patients during periods of stress, such as a relationship's dissolution,\" says Editor-in-Chief Brenda K. Wiederhold, PhD, MBA, BCB, BCN, Interactive Media Institute, San Diego, California and Virtual Reality Medical Institute, Brussels, Belgium. ### \nAbout the Journal \nCyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking ) is an authoritative peer-reviewed journal published monthly online with open access options and in print that explores the psychological and social issues surrounding the Internet and interactive technologies.
