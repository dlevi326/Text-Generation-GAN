For sale is a unique, niche opportunity for an entrepreneur looking to either launch successfully into the Internet space, or for one already in the space looking to expand with a fully-branded, highly successful, proprietary line of products in the Massage sector. The business primarily sells its products on the Amazon.com platform as well as other Amazon platforms all over the world. The business also has a wholesale element and a website storefront, both of which can be scaled tremendously as these have not been the focus of the seller. The founder of this great online Company originated it 20 years ago because he recognized firsthand the benefits of applying direct pressure to tight, sore and knotted muscles. Direct pressure can provide relief, more flexibility and better circulation. As such, the founder began the process of designing and creating from scratch, a completely proprietary and new line of self-massage tools that comfortably and effectively treat muscle pain, while remaining light, versatile, affordable, and simple to use. The products sold by this company are the result of this process, and the results speak for themselves - and the company continues to grow year over year, with no end in sight. With a library of raving customer testimonials under its belt covering the last two decades, and a near perfect 4.9 Seller Rating with thousands of ratings, this expanding, profitable and unique offering represents a truly one-of-a-kind opportunity for an entrepreneur to step in and take the wheel of an extremely well-established brand in a highly competitive and difficult to penetrate market - all with the benefit of a fully functional eCommerce storefront and Amazon seller account, currently reaching all corners of the globe.
