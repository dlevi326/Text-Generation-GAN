In the case of this deal, TPG will be laying down and maintaining the physical network, while Vodafone will be controlling what parts of the network are used and how they’re used. \nThe technology behind it all is quite complicated, but the benefits of this for Vodafone is that it allows the telco to expand its bandwidth at any rate it wants, while being more affordable than its old data network provider. For the customer, this means that they won’t have to worry about slow mobile data speeds, receive better coverage and see cheaper plans. Mr Berroeta said we could expect data caps to continue to rise at the speed they have in the last 12 months as a result. This means that we could see the likes of 12GBs of data included in a $60 per month sim free deal this time next year. \nThe rollout of the dark fibre will begin immediately and is expected to be completed by mid-2018. TPG General Manager of enterprise and wholesale Mark Rafferty and Vodafone Australia CEO Inaki Berroeta.

Alongside that, TPG has announced three new prepaid plans, including one priced at $19.99 a month that offers 1.3GB of data. \nThat migration will happen gradually and customers will be informed when they are being put on the new network. If you’re an existing customer, it’s also worth checking whether your current device supports Vodafone’s network, with the telco confirming around 15 per cent of phones that supported Optus’ network will not support the new one. \nBoth the companies have been putting serious pressure on competitors recently, with TPG kicking goals through its cheaper fibre-optic NBN competitor and takeover of iiNet, while Vodafone has seen renewed success with great value data plans. \nIt has been long rumoured that the number two internet provider and number three telco could be involved in a merger to create a mobile phone and internet company that can create even more pressure for competition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T07:10:04.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
