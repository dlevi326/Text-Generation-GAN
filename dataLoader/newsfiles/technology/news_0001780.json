The annual competition is sponsored by SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics, and Photonics Media to recognize new products and inventions that break with conventional ideas, solve problems and improve life through application of optics and photonics.\nBELLINGHAM, Washington, and PITTSFIELD, Massachusetts, USA\nEntries are being accepted through 9 October for the prestigious 2016 Prism Awards for Photonics Innovation . The international competition honors new technology and product inventions from the multi-billion dollar optics and photonics industry, and is sponsored by SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics , and Photonics Media .\nThe awards celebrate creativity and persistence as well as the versatility of photonics, said SPIE CEO Eugene Arthurs.\n\"As we have celebrated the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies around the world throughout 2015, there have been examples at every turn of new photonics-enabled applications that change individual’s lives and solve society’s challenges,” Arthurs said. “It is inspiring to see so much insightful research applied not only to the increase of human knowledge, but in the form of new products and processes that save lives, secure our communities, enrich communication across the planet, drive sustainable lighting and energy sources, and enhance education around the world. Our Prism Awards honor the companies and individuals who bring the best of these new products to market.”\nThe Prism Awards boost visibility and credibility for companies with the most novel and innovative products on the market. To be eligible, products must be sold, delivered or launched between 1 January 2015 and 1 February 2016. Companies may enter one product per category. However companies may apply with multiple products. Entries are being accepted in the categories of:\n Additive Manufacturing Alternative Lighting Biomedical Instrumentation Detectors and Sensors Displays Imaging and Cameras Industrial Lasers Materials and Coatings Optics and Optical Components Optical Communications Other Metrology Instrumentation Scientific Lasers.\nFinalists will be announced in November. Winners will be announced 17 February 2016 at a gala banquet held during SPIE Photonics West in San Francisco, California.\nThe competition is judged by an independent panel of industry experts including innovators from top companies, leaders in academia, business developers, previous award winners, financial experts, and other photonics industry leaders.\nPast winners have collected more recognition since last February’s presentation of the 2015 Prism Awards. Among them:\n The Seek Thermal Camera developed with Raytheon earned high marks in a review of the smartphone heat-vision camera attachment in the Wall Street Journal. Raman spectroscopy technology developed by Verisante has shown to be a life-saving tool in noninvasive removal of tumors, as reported by BBC News. Hyperspectral video technology commercialized by Rebellion Photonics was featured on CBS News as a tool to detect methane leaks in the oil and gas industry.\nAbout SPIE\nAbout SPIE\nSPIE is the international society for optics and photonics, an educational not-for-profit organization founded in 1955 to advance light-based science and technology.
