However, the number of Canadian tourists this summer decreased and cars dropped by about 20 percent.\nThe drop in the exchange rate led to the downturn of Canadian tourist arrivals.\nDecreased visits and spending by Canadian visitors due to the drop in the exchange rate will likely keep this tourism season from seeing a record high, said Christopher Fogg, head of the Maine Tourism Association.\nThe Canadian dollar fell to an 11-year low this year. One Canadian dollar is worth about 75 cents of United States currency. Hotel owners also blame the low exchange rate for the lack of visitors.\nYet, the Maine Turnpike Authority and the Portland International Jetport both are reporting record-breaking summer traffic this year. Restaurants also did not see as much of a profit loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:50:38.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
