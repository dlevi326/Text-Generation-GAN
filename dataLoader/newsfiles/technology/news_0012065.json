September 15, 2015 -- \nKYOTO, Japan and SANTA CLARA, Calif. , Sept. 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- ROHM has recently announced the development of a new class of power controller ICs compatible with the latest USB Power Delivery (Rev2.0) and Type-C (Rev1.1) specifications. The BM92TxxMWV series supports not only conventional USB power supply modes up to 7.5W ( 5V@1.5A ), but also newly expanded power levels up to 100W (20V@5A) for USB Type-C connected devices. This will make it possible to drive equipment with higher power requirements such as PCs, Monitors, Docking Stations and Peripherals via USB while at the same time enable new compatible USB-equipped portable devices (i.e. smartphones, tablets) to be charged up to 4 times faster than the previous standard. \nRecent years have seen a greater demand to reduce e-waste in many regions, including Europe , for example by utilizing or developing common connectors and chargers for a variety of electronic devices. As such, the latest USB connector and power transmission standards developed by USB-IF, which includes USB Type-C, USB Power Delivery (along with USB Superspeed), and the new DisplayPort Alternate Mode standard for carrying video, are garnering increased attention as a true all-in-one cable solution by making it possible to deliver high power, high-speed data, and even 4K video simultaneously over a single USB cable. This will eliminate the need for multiple dedicated cables, providing greater convenience while reducing clutter and waste. \nCombining the new Type-C connector, which boasts a smaller, reversible, flippable cable design robust enough for laptops but slim enough for mobile phones, with USB PD that offers scalable power using multiple power delivery modes, results in a common, future-proof interface. ROHM leverages leading BiCDMOS processes and circuit technologies to develop USB PD controller ICs optimized for these latest USB standards. \nKey Features \n1. Supports up to 100W of power supply using USB Type-C connectors With the new USB Power Delivery standard, optimized power delivery (scalable from 7.5W to 100W using multiple power delivery modes) 5V@1.5A is enabled in both directions between USB Type-C connected systems through a power contract that determines the Provider (Supply) and Consumer (Receiver) devices. This achieves maximum efficiency, since only the required amount of power is requested and only the amount of power available is provided. \n2. DisplayPort Alternate Mode compatibility eliminates the need for separate dedicated video cables. Support for DisplayPort Alternate Mode is also provided for carrying video signals over USB. The capability to deliver high-speed data, video, and an unprecedented amount of power over a single cable represents a breakthrough achievement that is expected to improve convenience while minimizing clutter and waste. \n3. Fewer parts required Advanced 0.13um BiCDMOS processes and circuit technology make it possible to eliminate the FET and separate power supply for power receiving operation. This reduces the number of external parts by more than 20 (including the external power supply IC), contributing to greater miniaturization.
