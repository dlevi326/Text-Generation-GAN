But changes on the inside matter, from camera improvements to new sensors that enable quicker access to tasks. How iPhone 6S' 3D Touch display actually works SAN FRANCISCO: Don't let looks deceive you. The new iPhones look the same as last year's models on the outside. But changes on the inside matter, from camera improvements to new sensors that enable quicker access to tasks. I had only about 90 minutes to try out the new Apple products unveiled -- not enough time, given that Apple has a larger iPad, a new Apple TV device and new software for the Apple Watch, alongside the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. I wasn't able to test the new iPhone cameras in natural settings, for instance, to say whether pictures are really better with 12MP, instead of 8MP in the previous iPhones. But I was able to try 3D Touch, a new way to interact with the iPhone. You save a few taps by pressing and holding on an app icon to go directly to a particular function. Microsoft's Windows phones let you create shortcuts as home screen icons, but few people have Windows phones. On iPhones, the 3D Touch feature isn't about enabling new functions, but getting you there quicker. If you want to take a selfie, for instance, you currently have to launch the camera app and hit a corner button to switch to the front camera. If you were taking video before, you need to slide the camera to \"Photo\" first. With the new iPhones, just choose \"Take Selfie\" when you press down on the Camera app. The phone makes all the switches automatically. With Maps, you can use 3D Touch to get directions home, find nearby businesses or message your location to a friend. With Mail, go directly to your inbox or create a new message. I used 3D Touch to quickly post a status update -- \"Hi\" -- on a test Facebook account. From a message, you get a preview of a web page by pressing on a web link. Similarly, you get a map preview by pressing on an address. Press harder to switch to the browser or Maps app. A new iPhone software update adds a back button so you can jump right back to what you were doing, even in a different app. As for the camera, selfie fans will appreciate having the phone's display mimic a flash. It's not a real flash like the main camera, but the display lights up briefly so that you can see faces in low-light settings. With a feature called Live Photos, the iPhone camera records an extra second or so before you take still shots so that images appear in motion. You need an iPhone, iPad or Mac with the latest software to view it, though, which could limit sharing with your Android and Windows family and friends. The changes aren't revolutionary, but the new iPhones have enough new features to consider buying over an older model. Of course, wait for a full test rather than just first impressions. The new phones aren't coming out until Sept. 25 anyway, although advance orders begin Saturday. Apple iPhone 6S, 6S Plus: 10 things to know of 11 Apple's new iPhones are here. The tech giant unveiled the two updated iPhones -- iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus -- at an event in San Franciscoâ€™s mega Bill Graham Civic auditorium. Talking about the new smartphones, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, \"They look familiar, but we have changed everything about these iPhones.\" One of the key new features of the new iPhones is the new touch capability called 3D Touch which allows the screen to sense multiple types of pressure. Here are 10 things you need to know about Apple's latest iPhones. Most smartphone users are accustomed to 'multi-touch' -- the ability for phones to recognize touches from multiple fingers, enabling such capabilities as pinching to zoom. With new iPhones, Apple brings in 3D Touch. Pressing down hard on the new iPhones will launch additional capabilities. For example, you can get quick access to tasks such as taking a selfie or getting directions home. From a message, 3D Touch will give you a preview of a web link without launching the browser. Similarly, press for a few seconds on a document icon, and a preview pops out. Press on an address in an email, and a map opens up. On some video apps, the pressure determines how quickly you forward or rewind. After being stuck with an 8MP camera sensor since iPhone 4S, the iPhone range has finally received a substantial megapixel upgrade. iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus sport a 12MP rear camera, with 50% more focus pixels to ensure faster autofocus. Apple says that the new iPhones' camera will deliver more detailed photos than ever before. It can also capture panorama shots in 63MP resolution and capture videos in 4K (movie hall quality) resolution. The selfie camera has also got an upgrade this year, jumping from 1.2MP in iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to 5MP in iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. Though it is not backed by a front-facing LED flash, Apple has used a technology called Retina Flash to deliver brighter selfies. This feature increases the brightness of the screen by three times, which Apple claims is comparable to that of its rear dual-LED flash. The front camera also gets an upgrade. It'll be 5MP FaceTime HD camera that uses the phone's Retina display for a flash for \"detailed selfies.\" Apple claims that the new capabilities will now let the display light up 3-times brighter for a flash that's comparable to that of the TrueTone flash on the back. Apple has also debuted a feature called Live Photos in the camera app, which will capture a 1.5-second video before and after you click the shutter in order to create animated GIFs. The new iPhone 6S Plus will also come in a rose gold colour, as well as the standard silver, gold, and space gray hues. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=iphones 6s,iPhone 6S Plus,Apple Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:50:08.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
