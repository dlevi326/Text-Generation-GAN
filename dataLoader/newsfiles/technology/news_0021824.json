The UN Chief had expressed regret over the calling-off of the meet, which was to take place on August 23-24 between Sartaj Aziz and Ajit Kumar Doval. Ban ki-moon said he hopes that the National Security Advisors of India and Pakistan will use \"all opportunities\" to resume talks as soon as possible.\nWhen asked about the civilian casualties on both sides and the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan being aware of the situation, Dujarric said he had seen the reports and was waiting for some guidance on these latest incidents. Last week, three persons were killed and 17 others were injured when Pakistani Rangers heavily shelled civilian areas and Army posts along the International Border in R S Pura and Arnia sectors of Jammu district on Friday, drawing retaliation from the BSF.\n United Nations India Pakistan Ban Ki-moon World Also Read WHO slaps travel restrictions on Pakistan over polio fears NSA Ajit Doval meets John Kerry, discusses India-US security cooperation Indian men lose 1-2 to Japan in Asian Champions Trophy hockey Rain continues to hamper Team India's chances", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/150901/world-americas/article/un-chief-calls-direct-dialogue-between-india-and-pakistan", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/150901/world-americas/article/un-chief-calls-direct-dialogue-between-india-and-pakistan", "http://d2yhexj5rb8c94.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Ban%20Ki%20Moon_1_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://d2yhexj5rb8c94.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Ban%20Ki%20Moon_1_0_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-01T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:41:02.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
