CB Insights compared the $1.6 billion public market valuation of Box (NYSE:Box) with the $10 billion valuation that investors placed on Dropbox when it raised $350 million in Series C funding in January 2014. \"The Dropbox valuation is irrational,\" is CB Insights conclusion. Of course, San Francisco-based Dropbox's \"decacorn\" valuation (what Silicon Valley wags call companies that have hit 10 times a $1 billion \"unicorn\" valuation) was figured before there was a correction in cloud-based business software companies on Wall Street. A cloud stock index from Bessemer Venture Partners dropped by about 30 percent between March and May last year and has yet to recover that drop completely. That Wall Street market correction forced Box and others to postpone plans to go public last year. Box was valued at $2.4 billion when it raised its last round of venture funding in July 2014 and briefly surpassed that in public market capitalization after going public in January. Its market cap has since dropped by about a third. CB Insights compared the multiples on annual revenue of the two companies in its analysis, showing that Box is trading at between seven and eight times its 2014 revenue of $216 million. Dropbox, which earlier this year set up a permanent New York City presence with offices in the Flatiron district , is valued around 25 times its rumored revenue for last year of about $400 million. The research firm figures that Dropbox would need to at least double its revenue this year to about $800 million to justify its $10 billion valuation, something CB Insights figures is not an easy feat. \"Given its current valuation, comparable valuation multiples and the very high bar for revenue growth required, it looks like Dropbox is overvalued,\" the report concludes, but it also adds a few caveats: \"Other factors such as margins, future expected sales growth, customers composition, etc. will play into these valuations.\" We won't really know how Dropbox's private valuation will fare until it hits Wall Street, and there doesn't appear to be an appetite for many tech companies to brave that test at the moment. But CEO Drew Houston hired Vanessa Wittman, the former chief financial officer of Google's Motorola unit, in February in a move which is often a sign of a pending IPO. Dropbox didn't immediately respond when contacted for comment on the CB Insights analysis and its plans. The Y Combinator graduate's investors include Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners, Benchmark, Greylock Partners and Index Ventures. \nGet New York  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:18:39.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
