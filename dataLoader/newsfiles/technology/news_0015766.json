It operates two business segments, including Enthone and Alpha. \nEnthone offers electroplating chemistry to electronics, automotive and industrial markets, while Alpha is an assembly materials business that supplies interconnected materials, primarily for electronics applications. \nIn 2014, Alent generated revenues of £413m, with adjusted profit before tax of £91.5m. \"Platform has received a notice of early termination of the antitrust waiting period under the US Hart-Scott Rodino act, and approval from South Korean authorities.\" \nSo far, Platform has received a notice of early termination of the antitrust waiting period under the US Hart-Scott Rodino act, and approval from South Korean authorities. \nSubject to certain other closing conditions and approvals, the transaction is expected to conclude by early 2016. \nFollowing the deal, Platform will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange as a US domiciled company. \nPlatform founder and chairman Martin Franklin earlier said: \"The proposed acquisition of Alent marks a further step in the Platform strategy of building a portfolio of best-in-class 'Asset-Lite, High-Touch' businesses in the specialty chemicals industry.\" \nThe company expects the combined business to generate $50m in annual pre-tax cost savings.
