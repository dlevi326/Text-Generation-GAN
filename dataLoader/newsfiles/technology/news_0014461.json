Regions customers can use this new payment product to load an existing Regions card to Android Pay and use those cards to make purchases in stores that accept contactless payments. \nAndroid Pay is supported by industry standard tokenization, which does not transmit actual credit or debit card numbers with a payment. Instead, a virtual account number is used to represent the customer’s account information—providing an enhanced layer of security. Additional security features also include payment confirmations and the Android Device Manager, which allows users to lock a device remotely, secure it with a new password or wipe it clean of personal information if the phone is ever stolen or lost. \n“Regions was one of the first banks in the nation to be announced as a participant in this service. This is another step forward in enabling our customers to manage their finances when and where they choose,” said Scott Peters, head of Regions Consumer Services. \n“We're excited to bring the simplicity and security of mobile payments to Regions customers with Android Pay. With Android Pay, people will be able to use their Android device to pay at more than one million stores in the US and we're adding more every day,” said Pali Bhat, Director, Product Management, Google. \nAndroid Pay will be available for download on Google Play in the next few days, and will come pre-installed on new NFC-enabled Android phones from major carriers. \nMore information on Android Pay is available at www.android.com/pay . \nAbout Regions Financial Corporation \nRegions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF), with $122 billion in assets, is a member of the S&P 500 Index and is one of the nation's largest full-service providers of consumer and commercial banking, wealth management, mortgage, and insurance products and services.
