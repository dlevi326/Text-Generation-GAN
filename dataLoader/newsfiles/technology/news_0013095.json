Express expedites the process of digitizing and tokenizing MasterCard accounts through the MasterCard Digital Enablement Service (MDES) . \nFinancial institutions of all sizes gain immediate access to the latest digital payments services, while MasterCard partners – digital wallet providers, device manufacturers, card on file merchants and other digital payment providers – have a simple onboarding process to engage with all participating banks. Together, they are able to deliver new services more quickly, and at scale, to consumers around the world. Capital One , Fifth Third Bank and KeyBank are among the first issuers to announce their support of Express. \nConnected devices increasingly play a prominent role in all aspects of our daily lives. As every connected device can potentially become a secure payment device, it has created both an opportunity and challenge for financial institutions looking to provide secure digital payments to their consumers at scale. For several years, MasterCard worked closely with technology partners and financial institutions to bring tokenized payments to market. The Express global framework now enables every MasterCard issuer to securely digitize tokens into millions of devices, Internet of Things (IoT) environments and Card on File systems, providing consumers with easy access to secure digital payments. \n“MasterCard is working relentlessly to increase payment security and enable innovative new digital services for consumers, to the benefit of all participants in our network,” said Ed McLaughlin, Chief Emerging Payments Officer at MasterCard. “Express now allows key technology partners to make their offerings available to all MasterCard issuers in a simple, safe and consistent manner, extending our network model into digital enablement.” \n“At Capital One, we are intensely focused on bringing innovative and secure technology advancements to our tens of millions of customers to help them succeed and simplify their lives. Express provides a streamlined and efficient way for companies to create and rapidly bring to market new products and services as the pace of the evolution of digital payments continues to accelerate,” said Frank LaPrade, Chief Enterprise Services Officer, Capital One Financial Corporation. \nKey Benefits of Express Global Scale, Speed and Consumer Reach : One set of standard terms for participants expedites the process of digitizing and tokenizing MasterCard accounts, and creates efficiencies in delivering secure digital payments globally. Economics : MasterCard does not facilitate pass through fees between financial institutions and token requestors under the Express program. Increased Security and Data Protection : Express furthers MasterCard’s longstanding commitment to privacy by limiting the use and sharing of sensitive cardholder data and transaction information, and enabling the use of tokenized credentials to protect payment integrity, decrease fraud rates and protect merchant rights. \nSince the announcement of the MDES in 2013, millions of MasterCard accounts have been tokenized for use in popular digital wallet services. MasterCard Digital Enablement Express is available today.
