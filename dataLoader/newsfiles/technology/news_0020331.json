Burns \nAt the beginning of the school year, I like to access a website like https://www.futureme.org , to write my future self a letter that will be delivered to me on the last day of school. In this letter, I write out my goals for my classroom and students, my professional goals, and my personal goals. When I do this, it helps me organize and prioritize my goals for the school year. It also holds me to them because I have written them down and know that I will see them at the end of the school year. Do I achieve every goal? No. Do I make mistakes when trying to achieve the goals? Yes. When I do make mistakes, I reflect on how to improve on them and place them in next year’s letter. \nA few year’s back, the seniors in the Norwell School District had to write their future self a letter with these purposes: To provide a record of your life and who you are now To anchor in time your current views, attitudes, philosophy, and outlook To explore your feelings and opinions about a variety of issues To create a document that, years from now, will have significant value to you. \nTo see the full assignment, click here . \nIf you were to write your future self a letter to be delivered on the last day of school, what would you write? I hope that you will try it this school year. A. Burns Amy M. Burns is an elementary music educator, clinician, author, and musician.
