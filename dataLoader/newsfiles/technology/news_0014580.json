Firefox 41 - Warnings continue to show up. Firefox 42 - Warnings are still displayed if unsigned add-ons are run. Firefox 43 - Add-ons without signatures are blocked by default, but there is an override that is available in all versions of the browser. Firefox 44 - Only signed add-ons can be installed in Firefox Stable and Beta. There is no override anymore for those editions of the browser. The override remains in Firefox Developer and Nightly. \nFirefox 44 is scheduled to be released on January 26, 2016. \nMozilla plans to release unbranded versions of Firefox to provide add-on developers with options to test their add-ons in Stable and Beta releases of Firefox without having to go through the review process each time they update the add-on during development. \nIt is unclear why Mozilla made the decision to postpone the enforcement of signed add-ons in the web browser.
