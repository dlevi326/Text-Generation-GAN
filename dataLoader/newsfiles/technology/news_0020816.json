The Paris agreement is meant to slow the march of dangerous global warming by slashing climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions from mankind's unbridled burning of fossil fuels \n\"Only through direct, inclusive and interactive negotiations will parties be able to narrow down differences, find convergence and ultimately achieve consensus,\" he said in a statement. \nMost developed nations, while agreeing the pace was too slow, believe line-by-line revision at this point would slow things down, and want to hand the job of reworking the text over to the co-chairmen of the UN negotiations. \nStakes are high \nThe Paris agreement is meant to slow the march of dangerous global warming by slashing climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions from mankind's unbridled burning of fossil fuels. \nThe overarching goal is to limit average warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels. \nFundamental divisions remain over how to share out carbon-emissions cuts between rich nations, which have polluted for longer, and emerging giants such as China and India powering fast-growing economies and populations. \n\"Everyone thinks it's up to the other guy to move things forward,\" said Pierre Radanne, a climate analyst who advises African countries on policy. \n\"Everyone says: 'we're not making progress' but no one says: 'I'll withdraw this or that proposal'. Nobody wants to give up anything essential.\" \nThe last attempt at forging a universal climate deal , at a UN conference in Copenhagen in 2009, came undone, and nations are loath to repeat history. \nA timely reminder of the urgency came on Wednesday, when scientists warned that on current carbon-cutting pledges, the world was on track for warming of three degrees Celsius, a sure recipe for catastrophic storms, droughts, disease spread, water shortages, and sea level rise .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:36:12.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
