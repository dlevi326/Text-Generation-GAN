Simple. Make some. \nOn those hot, sunny days when the solar chimney is supplying more than demand, any extra energy can be diverted to power electrolysis. \nThis process would split water into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas, and generate a fuel that can be stored until needed. \nMr Joneydi's team considered the desert city of El Paso, in Texas, and determined how much of the city's power the hypothetical plant could provide, for every hour of a typical year. \n\"We used a genetic algorithm, trialling different calculation 'parents' to optimise outputs or 'children' over multiple cycles,\" Mr Joneydi says. \nHe found the plant could theoretically provide all of El Paso's electrical needs between 9am and 3pm during the winter month of January, stretching to 6am to 6pm over summer. \nCalculating that the system can optimally produce 0.28kg of hydrogen fuel every second, Mr Joneydi determined the plant could supply nearly 80 per cent of El Paso's summer energy requirements, and 37 per cent of its winter demand. \nAnother bonus, he says, is that heat of the fuel cell reaction can be used to drive turbines or a steam generator.
