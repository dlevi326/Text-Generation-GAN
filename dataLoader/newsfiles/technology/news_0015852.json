The news sparked a rally in Alcoa's shares, which were up nearly 6 percent at $9.60 in premarket trading. Falling commodity prices and a glut of aluminum have battered Alcoa stock, which before the news, had fallen more than 42 percent this year. The split will separate the cyclical commodity business that excels during demand upswings from a high-technology business benefiting from rising demand for new alloys and titanium for planes and automobiles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:43:23.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
