After that, those who rely on Autodesk's software will need to buy subscriptions for the products, all delivered via the cloud.\nThe move means near-term pain: shares of Autodesk have lost almost a quarter of their value in 2015, with investors grappling with the fact that the shift to the cloud will hurt earnings temporarily.\nBut Barron's notes that five years from now Autodesk could be earning over $4 a share, double its fiscal 2013 peak. The stock could benefit much sooner than that.\nAutodesk officials were not immediately available for comment.\n(Editing by Andrew Hay)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T03:29:02.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
