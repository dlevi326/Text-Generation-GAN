[Native Advertisement] \n\"I am thrilled to be joining Lucid Energy and its team,\" said Kelly. \"Fostering the commercialization of products in the utility sector motivates my best work, and I've been working closely with Gregg Semler and the Lucid Energy team for several years in my role as president of Isle Utilities and administrator of the North American TAG Forum. Lucid Energy is an exciting, dynamic company with a truly innovative product, and I look forward to continuing to build on the strong momentum they have achieved to drive widespread deployment of LucidPipe and other products across North America and around the world.\" \nKelly has a broad range of experience working with utilities, technology companies and investors in the water sector. He became the first U.S.-based employee at Isle Utilities and served as its business development director until he was named president in early 2014. He was responsible for establishing the growing Isle Inc. Company presence in North America and facilitated and grew its Technology Approval Group (TAG), an innovation forum that brings new step change technologies to the municipal water and wastewater sector. \nAccordingly, Kelly grew Isle's North American customer base from one to more than 50 municipalities in just two years, forming seven different regional TAG groups and developing a thriving consultancy business. He also established the JetStream Program that connects manufacturer's representatives with emerging technologies. \nThrough his consulting work with SkyH20 and Clean Power Capital, Kelly has helped companies define and develop new product lines, build industry relationships, grow staff, and garner project and corporate financing.
