Malware and server malfunctions often damage the OST files that MS Exchange Server uses to store email messages and supporting files. DataNumen Exchange Recovery allows users to recover as much of the damaged data as possible, and rebuild normal email and support files such as posts, notes, appointments, and contacts. Users can even store recovered messages as HTML pages or ordinary text files.\nNew features in version 5 include support for 64-bit versions of MS Outlook, the ability to recover invalid segments of damaged data, and the ability to recover items that have been deleted, hidden, or lost and found. The latest version can also fix the dreaded \"CanÂ´t move the items\" error that often makes OST files unusable.\nExchange Server's offline mailbox files are vulnerable to both hardware glitches and software problems. DataNumen uses a unique data recovery engine to examine every element of a damaged OST file, character by character. The software can recover files that exceed the 2GB size limit. It can work with files stored on local drives, network drives, and all popular types of removable media.\nLike all of DataNumen's recovery applications, this program can be launched from the context menu. It also supports command line processing.\nPrice and availability\nDataNumen Exchange Recovery v. 5 runs under Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10 as well as Server 2003/2008/2012, and supports all versions of Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook. A single-user license is priced at $199.95 (US). DataNumen will refund the purchase price if any competitive product can recover more data from an OST file than DataNumen Exchange Recovery.
