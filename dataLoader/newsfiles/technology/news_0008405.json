TriWest Healthcare Alliance will open the call center in November with 285 employees.\nThe company will focus on recruiting veterans to fill its jobs, officials said. The average salary: $35,700.\nGov. Bobby Jindal's office and the Jefferson Econcomic Development Commission announced the plans, but neither specified TriWest's planned location. A JEDCO spokesperson said the company isn't ready to disclose the site.\nTriWest is one of two companies contracted to run the federal Veterans Choice Program, which offers private medical care outside the Veterans Administration system. The goals are reducing wait times and improving access for veterans who live more than 40 miles from a VA center.\nVeterans Choice was created as a temporary program . It is scheduled to end in August 2017, earlier if its $10 billion funding runs out. A TriWest spokesperson said the company hopes recent legislation will let its New Orleans operations continue beyond 2017.\nThe call center, which will serve veterans across 28 states, will process medical care requests and schedule appointments. TriWest plans to spend $1 million on the new office.\n\"We are seeking qualified applicants (who) have a deep desire to serve our nation's veterans,\" TriWest Healthcare Alliance chief executive David McIntyre Jr. \"If every position was filled with veterans themselves, we would be most pleased.\"\nJindal said Jefferson Parish was selected in a competition with eight other metropolitan areas. The state said it offered TriWest a \"competitive incentive package\" that includes Louisiana Economic Development's FastStart workforce development and Quality Jobs program, which provides a 5 percent or 6 percent cash rebate of annual gross payroll for new direct jobs for as long as 10 years.\n\"TriWest Healthcare Alliance has a long history of providing health care services for our nation's heroes, and we extend a heartfelt welcome to its operations center in Jefferson Parish,\" Jindal said.", "external_links": ["http://www.va.gov/opa/choiceact/documents/FactSheets/VACAA_Provider_Fact_Sheet_Choice_Program_508c_Internet.pdf", "https://www.triwest.com/en/"], "published": "2015-08-31T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:50:21.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
