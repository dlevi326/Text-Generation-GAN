From the pine forests of Michigan to the spruce, fir, and redwood stands on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, Stimson has been a consistent name for more than 160 years in forest products. Today, the company owns and operates seven mills in Oregon and Idaho. All the mills are located adjacent to the vast Stimson Lumber Company land holdings. The objective of the milling operations is to add value to the logs derived from the company timberlands. Half of the logs consumed in Stimson Lumber Company mills originate from company tree farms. Milling operations are designed to utilize 100% of the fiber from the log. Employees embrace a Continuous Improvement Culture resulting in higher utilization and efficiencies in the milling process. Effective use of capital for process improvements and employee empowerment has resulted in top tier mill performance within the industry.
