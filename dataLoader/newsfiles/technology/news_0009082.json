PENETRON products conform to international building standards and are a major force in the trend toward “greener” construction practices.\nEast Setauket, New York (PRWEB) September 21, 2015\nEngineers behind the sustainable design of the new Agri-Hub Office Park in Pretoria, South Africa, looked to PENETRON crystalline technology for a durable solution. PENETRON products conform to international building standards and are a major force in the trend toward “greener” construction practices.\nSituated at the foot of the Brondberg Ridge close to downtown Pretoria, the Agri-Hub Office Park features three multi-floor office blocks surrounding a central basement structure that houses a parking garage for 300 cars. The complex also has a conference center and coffee shop.\nDesigned by Royal HaskoningDHV, a Dutch engineering firm, Agri-Hub integrates state-of-the-art sustainable building technologies that comply with South Africa’s SABS SANS 204 environmental guidelines for sustainable construction. Highlights throughout the complex include: energy-efficient technology, such as high-performance windows and insulation in the walls and roofs of the main structures; the use of natural building materials; and solar lighting.\n“Many new commercial developments in South Africa have made great efforts to comply with stringent ‘green’ guidelines,” notes Jozef Van Beeck, Director of International Marketing & Sales for The PENETRON Group. “It’s part of a growing awareness of the importance of sustainable construction – and the need for highly durable and non-toxic materials – to provide a natural and healthy environment for the tenants.”\nWith a total of 6,000 m2 (64,583 square feet) of office space aimed primarily at small and medium-sized companies, the Agri-Hub put a premium on durability for all the concrete structures. The contractor, JTSON Construction, specified the PENETRON System for all major concrete elements.\nThe concrete used in the post-tension parking deck and basement structure was treated with PENETRON ADMIX , which was added during mixing. PENBAR SW-55 waterstop was used to permanently seal all resulting construction joints. PENETRON crystalline topical material and PENECRETE MORTAR were used on the roof slabs of all three office blocks, the guardhouse and the guesthouse to provide waterproofing and concrete durability.\n“Because PENETRON products are non-toxic and free of volatile organic compounds (VOC), extremely durable, and easy-to-use, our crystalline technology is increasingly part of sustainable construction efforts across the globe,” adds Mr. Van Beeck. “By substantially extending the life of concrete structures – and avoiding costly repairs – PENENTRON makes a tangible contribution to sustainable construction projects.”\nThe PENETRON Group is a leading manufacturer of specialty construction products for concrete waterproofing, concrete repairs and floor preparation systems. The Group operates through a global network, offering support to the design and construction community through its regional offices, representatives and distribution channels.\nFor more information on PENETRON waterproofing solutions, please visit penetron(dot)com or Facebook(dot)com/ThePenetronGroup, email CRDept(at)penetron(dot)com, or contact the Corporate Relations Department at 631-941-9700.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12959765.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.penetron.com/products#penecrete-mortar", "http://www.penetron.com/products#penebar-sw-55", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12959765.htm", "http://www.penetron.com/the-penetron-system", "http://www.penetron.com/products#penetron-admix", "http://www.penetron.com/products#penetron"], "published": "2015-09-21T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:35:13.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
