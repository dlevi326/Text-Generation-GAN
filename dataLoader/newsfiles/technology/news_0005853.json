For many of the hundreds of attendees from the oil and gas industry, the conferences will be an introduction to the “new” Oildex, formed in June when the company acquired ADP’s Procure-to-Pay business and the OpenInvoice product. Today’s conference was held in Houston, Texas with others to follow in Denver, Colorado (September 29) and Calgary, Canada (October 20). The locations were selected based on their accessibility and convenience for the majority of Oildex customers, partners and prospects.\n“We are very excited about hosting these smaller regionally-focused gatherings,” said Richard Slack, president and CEO at Oildex. “We look forward to updating our customers about the future of our growing company while deepening our own understanding of their unique needs.”\nAt each of the conferences, attendees from the company’s customer base of more than 1,100 customers and 50,000 suppliers will benefit from unparalleled networking and sharing of best practices with peers in the oil and gas industry. In addition, the format of the meetings will allow for educational break-out sessions where customers will be encouraged to engage in open discussions with Oildex employees about the company’s products and services. Those in attendance also will be invited to have questions and concerns addressed face-to-face in real time by Oildex representatives. Following the conferences, the company will use the valuable input collected at the sessions to help fine-tune products and processes moving forward.\nWhile Oildex learns more about its customers needs, attendees will learn more about Oildex’s vision for the next year; specifically, the company will share its plans for product innovation and building upon its growing supplier network.\n“As promised, it’s been ‘business as usual’ for our customers since adding OpenInvoice to our portfolio,” said Slack. “But at the same time we’ve been working hard toward our vision to connect and auto-mate the oil and gas ecosystem. These conferences will help inform our planning process and keep us focused on what’s most important to the people who rely on our products.”\nAbout Oildex\nOildex provides a complete, broad B2B automation offering for oil and gas companies.
