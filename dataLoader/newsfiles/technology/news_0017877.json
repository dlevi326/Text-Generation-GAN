All times local.\n___\n7:45 p.m.\nCzech carmaker Skoda Auto, which belongs to Volkswagen AG, says 1.2 million of its vehicles had the engine that manipulated emissions data.\nSkoda Auto spokesman Jozef Balaz told Czech public television on Monday that Volkswagen plans to recall all those cars and will cover the cost.\nVolkswagen previously said 11 million vehicles worldwide contain software involved in the emissions-rigging scandal.\nThe company has set aside $7.3 billion to pay for the scandal.\n___\n3:40 p.m.\nA presentation about the car industry by former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn in Hungary has been canceled.\nThe cancellation was confirmed Monday - when German prosecutors said they were investigating Winterkorn over VW's emissions-rigging scandal - by the Hungarian subsidiary of Audi, majority-owned by Volkswagen.\nWinterkorn was scheduled to hold a presentation titled \"The future of the car? - Challenges and solutions from Volkswagen's perspective\" on Wednesday at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.\nThe university's website says Winterkorn has been its honorary professor since 2003 and has been holding presentations there for years.\nThe Hungarian subsidiary of Audi makes cars and engines for Audi AG and other Volkswagen companies like Seat at its plant in the city of Gyor, northwest Hungary.\n___\n12:55 p.m.\nGerman prosecutors have opened an investigation against former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn in the company's emissions-rigging scandal.\nProsecutors in Braunschweig said Monday that the investigation would concentrate on the suspicion of fraud committed through the sale of vehicles with manipulated emissions data.\nIt added that the probe aims to establish who was responsible.
