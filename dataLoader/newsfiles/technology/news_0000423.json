Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup A trio of University of NSW graduates, who have attracted the attention of blue-chip companies globally, is launching intelligent ski helmets on United States crowd-funding platform Kickstarter on Wednesday.\nUNSW industrial design graduates Alfred Boyadgis, Julian Chow and engineering graduate George Constantinos have developed the world's first smart snow sports helmet, which has an inbuilt HD camera, GPS technology, stereo speakers and a noise-cancelling microphone which lets users communicate with their friends on the slopes.\nForcite Helmet Systems' director of business strategy, Michael Drysdale, said it had chosen to sell the product through Kickstarter to test the market.\n\"People can say they love your product, but the only way you really know they do is when they have to open up their wallets,\" he said.\nForcite Helmet Systems' Alpine helmet features an in-built HD camera, GPS technology, stereo speakers and a noise-cancelling microphone which allows wearers to communicate with their friends while on the slopes. Supplied \"We're an Australian company, so we also want to get some exposure on a global stage which Kickstarter helps us do. About 85 per cent of the pledges are usually from the United States.\"\nThe Forcite Alpine helmet lets wearers film their snow sports adventures in ultra-high definition and includes a function to automatically generate a highlights reel based on when you hit top speed, got the most airtime or made sharp transitions.\nThe helmet includes multiple sensors which track speed, altitude, distance and air time which can be compared with friends' stats through the app.\nIf the product sells well on Kickstarter, the company will formalise some distribution arrangements. It is hoping to raise $200, 000 through the campaign.\nGeorge Constantinos and Alfred Boyadgis, co-founders of Forcite Helmet Systems, with the Alpine helmet. Supplied The Kickstarter orders will be delivered in January.\n\"We've already accumulated 15,000 Facebook likes and we've asked people to register their interest and we've had about 2500 through that,\" Mr Drysdale said.\n\"We've been focusing a lot of our efforts on the US market ... But we're looking at Europe too... and we're getting a lot of traction in Japan. As a country Germany has the highest percentage of people who are skiers, at about 38 per cent.\"\nThe business has raised just under $1 million to date, mainly through angel investors.\nIf the Alpine helmet sells well the business intends to diversify into other areas such as mining and defence.\nThe technology underpinning the product has been in development for some time. The first version was a prototype police motorcycle helmet created for Mr Boyadgis' final-year university project and it won a number of international awards.\nThe business is remaining tight-lipped about the conversations it is having with major companies and defence forces, but Mr Boyadgis previously told The Australian Financial Review that it has been working with a mining company to develop catastrophe-aversion technology for helmets.\nIt has also assembled a think tank of high-profile scientists to help develop the helmets, including Dr George Habib, who worked on the bionic eye and Dave Lorenzini who helped create Google Earth.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-09-29T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:18:04.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
