Among the First to Carry Brand New Canon CINE-SERVO 50-1000mm Ultra-Telephoto Zoom Lens September 08, 2015 -- DMN Newswire--2015-9-8-- New York, NY ? September 8, 2015 ? Adorama Rental Co . (ARC), the industry source for professional cinematographers, videographers and photographers, today announced it is one of the first rental houses in the country to carry Canon?s newest camera lens, the Canon CINE-SERVO 50-1000mm Ultra-Telephoto Zoom Lens . The CINE-SERVO lens was recently used to capture once-in-a-lifetime shots of David Byrne?s star-studded production, ?Contemporary Color? at the Barclay?s Center in Brooklyn. The production featured artists including Nelly Furtado, St. Vincent, Ad-Rock and Money Mark, Ira Glass and Nico Muhly, Zola Jesus, Tune Yards, Dev Hynes and more. Celebrating the traditional American art form of color guard with a modern musical spin, the artists were accompanied by 10 high school color guard teams from across the country. In order to capture specific shots of the production, the team needed a long zoom. ?As a DP, it was an incredible experience to work with the ARC team lead by Daniel Gurzi [managing director at ARC]. It was much more of a collaboration than a traditional rental house relationship,? says Jarred Alterman, the director of photography for the ?Contemporary Color? video shoot. ?Daniel was involved very early on with the project and was gracious enough to indulge my film references. We were trying to mimic a very long zoom from Pink Floyd?s Live at Pompeii that starts from the top of an ancient Roman coliseum and lands onto a small stage where Pink Floyd is playing. We couldn?t pull it off with the zoom lenses we had, but when Daniel got his hands on the new Canon CINE-SERVO with its built-in 1.5x extender, we were able to pull off the incredible move. We were so happy with the lens that we moved it down to the floor on one night to capture close-ups of the artists on stage from a distance.? The Canon CINE-SERVO lens is now available for rent through Adorama Rental Co., or for purchase as a pre-order through Adorama online .
