D’Arcy became involved with Greene’s recovery after watching a documentary about him.\nHe asked Greene to partner with him in a research project to explore how brain plasticity affects motor functions. Plasticity refers to the brain’s ability to reorganize its neural pathways and synapses in response to different behaviours, thoughts or emotions.\nThe two have since met regularly for D’Arcy to collect functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of Greene’s brain, which D’Arcy uses to track how the brain rewires itself.\nIn an article published in The Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation this month, D’Arcy and his research team challenge the current assumptions that after a traumatic brain injury, any further recovery ceases to happen over the long term. His team discovered physical functions can be recovered through rehabilitation even six years after an injury.\nIn 2014, D’Arcy called on Carolyn Sparrey, a professor in the School of Mechatronic Systems Engineering (MSE) who has extensive experience in biomechanics, to see if she could customize an exoskeleton that would suit the unique requirements of the 6’4” Greene.\nExoskeletons are typically designed for those with spinal cord injuries as an assistive robotic technology providing lower leg movement. Sparrey notes that this is the first time exoskeleton technology has been used for a person with a brain injury.\nToday, Greene is able to walk upright with assistance, outfitted with a custom-made exoskeleton from Israel-based company, ReWalk. In the future he plans to walk unassisted. Ultimately, he says his goal is to make it to Everest base camp.\nA ReWalk company trainer has supported Greene by customizing the motorized exoskeleton so that Greene can wear the battery pack as a backpack.\n“Trevor has been extremely committed to his rehabilitation program,” says D’Arcy, who is also co-chair of Innovation Boulevard .\nGreene’s positive attitude was never more poignantly demonstrated than when he stood, using parallel bars, at his 2010 wedding to wife Deborah.\n“This newest dimension in his rehabilitation, wearing exoskeletons to walk again, enables SFU faculty members to track research milestones in a real-life scenario while making a positive impact on his life,” says D’Arcy.\nJoy Johnson, SFU’s vice-president, research, says: “This is such a heartwarming story of courage and determination, and of the power of collaboration to push beyond seemingly impenetrable boundaries. This is why SFU places such value on interdisciplinary research and open innovation—they help turn ideas into action, so that people may benefit.”\nThe Royal Canadian Legion raised funds for the ReWalk device. SFU investigators are donating their time, expertise and specialized equipment to assist with the project.\nOther SFU researchers involved in the Trevor Greene exoskeleton research project are SFU engineering professor Carlo Menon, and mechatronics engineering professors Edward Park and Siamak Arzanpour.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/6s-7MDpYvuk", "http://www.innovationboulevard.ca/"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:19:52.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
