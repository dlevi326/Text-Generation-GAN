More recent cuts have also impacted BlackBerry manufacturing facilities in Cambridge, Ont.\nThe company, which confirmed some job reductions earlier this summer but refused to disclose numbers, declined late Thursday to say how many jobs were part of more recent cuts.\nBlackBerry said it had 6,225 full-time global employees as of Feb. 28, its most recent filing with regulators, but though those employee numbers are likely much lower after various other waves of cuts throughout its international operations this year.\n More Related to this Story Analysis As economy falters, the tech sector continues to climb\nBlackBerry plans for premium Android device may miss market\nShopify, Google boosting presence in BlackBerry’s hometown\nTopics: Technology Comments A A", "external_links": ["http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/79c/video/article26230747.ece/ALTERNATES/w140/Video%3A+O%27Leary%3A+No+one+knows+what+a+Blackberry+is+anymore"], "published": "2015-09-25T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T15:05:01.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
