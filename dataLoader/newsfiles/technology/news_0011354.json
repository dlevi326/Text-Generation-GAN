The jewelry connects to the Ringly app where women can customize which phone calls, texts and app alerts filter through to the ring. They select how to be notified -- via vibrations or flashing lights emitted from the ring. Women can then stash their phones away and not miss a beat. D’Avignon -- whose background is in product development -- cofounded the startup in 2013. \n\nRingly has raised $6.1 million, with its latest round led by Andreessen Horowitz. The device now links up with 50 apps including Uber, Tinder, and eBay. This week, Ringly released a new limited edition ring -- with a blue lapis gemstone -- for $195. What do you actually do all day in your job? I wear a lot of hats, but I spend most of my time overseeing the different areas of the company: product management, software, hardware, design and marketing. 1 How many hours do you sleep? I try to get at least six hours of sleep each night. 2 What do you eat for breakfast? Coffee & a KIND bar. 3 If you could pitch to one person, who would it be? Angela Ahrendts from Apple. I wouldn’t necessarily pitch her, but I’d love to have a conversation with her about the increasingly intersecting worlds of fashion and technology. 4 What’s on your home screen? 5 How often do you exercise? My weekly exercise routine consists of yoga classes and short runs. 6 What app can’t you live without? Ringly and Google Maps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:06:28.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
