Under the agreement, KORE will provide an advanced Machine-to-Machine (M2M) business solution, including all data requirements, for Intelligent Telematics' new operation within North America. KORE will also deliver business development support to help Intelligent Telematics tap into growth opportunities within key sectors across the region. \nIntelligent Telematics was launched in 2013, initially in the UK, and has since expanded its presence to over 12 countries worldwide. The company’s IT1000 3G vehicle camera is the most sophisticated solution currently available with unrivalled accuracy and technology that is sixteen times more powerful than existing devices in the marketplace. The forward facing camera transmits footage of road collisions, near misses and harsh driving events via a secure 3G private network to a web-based interface with live email and SMS alerts, so a triggered event can be viewed almost immediately. \n“Our partnership with Intelligent Telematics North America provides strategic new opportunities for both businesses,” said Pete West, senior director of business development, KORE. “3G vehicle cameras present significant potential for the fleet, insurance and telematics markets in the U.S. Through our alignment with Intelligent Telematics, we look forward to leveraging the growing opportunities to improve road safety, identify areas of risk, minimize costs and save lives.” \n“Teaming up with a key data partner that could handle all our connectivity requirements was an important part of our expansion within the U.S. What quickly became apparent was the added support KORE could offer us in terms of driving growth and differentiating our business, so we look forward to working closely with them to effectively roll out our ongoing strategy,” said Richard Baxendale, president, Intelligent Telematics North America. \nAbout KORE KORE is the world’s largest managed communications solutions provider specializing in Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine to Machine (M2M) markets.
