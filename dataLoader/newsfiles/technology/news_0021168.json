LD Products is a multifaceted printing and office supply company. LD Products is a company centered on accurate order fulfillment, cutting-edge print offerings, and unmatched customer support. While meeting all of the standards to qualify for LEED-certification, the new system allows for future expansion, including increased capacity, accuracy, and speed.\nThe system is comprised of many energy efficient and unique applications of Hytrol technology. A key component of the system is the use of Hytrol’s E24™ 24-volt technology, which is used to transport totes and shipping cartons from an A-frame system to one of several areas, including the consolidation put-to-light system, manual small package area, and the USPS packing area.\nChris Ferrer, Director of Warehouse Operations at LD Products, said, “The E24™, the EZLogic® technology—it just seemed like it was more versatile. It was more plug-n-play. It is going to be more reliable for us. Hytrol is a good, solid company….been around for a long time and made in the United States.”\nThe objective for Hytrol and McCombs-Wall was to create a flexible, efficient, and smart material handling system capable of producing optimal results for the customer. The new system gives LD Products the ability to meet current demands, while allowing for future growth.\nBased in Orange, CA, McCombs-Wall Engineering, a Hytrol integration partner (IP), delivers innovative materials handling solutions that are used to improve profitability and sustainability in manufacturing supply chains.
