Monroe"], "text": "By R.A. Monroe September 29, 2015 \nIn our gadget-happy world, older adults have been slower to jump on the new-technology bandwagon. In fact, just 59% of Americans aged 65 and older go online, compared with 86% of all adults, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center study . \nAs advisors shift to a more technology-centric model to appeal to the next generation of clients, they’d be well served to keep the particular needs and preferences of their older clients in mind. \nWhy? Americans over age 50 make up the world’s third-largest economy, says Eileen Paddock , president and founder of the Elderflower Group , a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based consulting firm that helps businesses capitalize on demographic changes associated with an aging population. Advisors who don’t accommodate the needs of older clients could lose out. Fortunately, that accommodation doesn’t mean ditching the tech entirely — the common stereotype that older clients don’t appreciate or understand technological innovations is often untrue, Paddock says. \n“To best serve an older population, advisors need to rethink the whole client experience — not just technology,” Paddock suggests. In short, advisors need to be aware of common age-related disabilities and how they impact their clients’ ability to engage with technology. For example, an advisor who typically projects slides and charts on the wall during face-to-face meetings with clients may notice that an older client isn’t responding and attribute that lack of engagement to a dislike of technology. But Paddock points out that many older adults have untreated hearing loss, which they compensate for by being good lip readers. “The frustration is not the technology, but that advisors are expecting the client to be able to look at the screen and hear what they’re saying at the same time.” \nOn the other hand, technology can also solve some problems caused by age-related disabilities. “Skype could be really useful for clients who are no longer driving,” Paddock says. “It allows for a more personal meeting than a simple phone call.” But she cautions that it’s important for advisors to take each situation on a case-by-case basis — other elderly clients may prefer to meet in person because they’re socially isolated and appreciate the opportunity to interact face-to-face. \nLars Phillips , an associate advisor with Bellevue, Wash.-based Avier Wealth Advisors , which manages $280 million, agrees that generalizations about older people and technology don’t always hold true. “We have 70-year-old clients who are very comfortable with new technologies and 50-year-olds who don’t even want to use email,” he says. \nWhen Phillips’ firm adopts a new tech solution, such as using e-signatures to authorize documents, the company makes sure to have other options in place for clients who aren’t comfortable with the new procedure. It’s also important to check in with clients on an annual basis to see if their feelings have changed. “We’ve had folks who have said they’re not comfortable with the technology, but then two years down the road they’ve become more comfortable — or the technology has become more user-friendly,” Phillips says. \nAdvisors trying to incorporate more technology into their work with older clients should also appreciate that client education is an ongoing process, rather than a one-time event. Phillips’ firm now provides clients with online access to their financial plans. Instead of just showing the clients the software once, the advisors build in time to walk them through it during each meeting. Such repetition can help older clients become more comfortable with a complex tool. Lars Phillips \nAccording to Steve Lockshin , principal of Los Angeles, Calif.-based AdvicePeriod , which manages more than $500 million, the biggest obstacle to getting older clients to adopt new technologies is advisors themselves. “Our firm went paperless years ago, and it hasn’t been a problem for any of our clients — even those in their seventies and eighties. They all have iPads,” he says. “I think there’s a fear within the advisory community that they’ll alienate older clients with technology — but that’s mostly because many advisors are themselves technologically inept.” \nLockshin does have some older clients who aren’t fully tech savvy, such as a 91-year-old woman who lives in another state. In that case, Lockshin enlisted her daughter as a kind of tech go-between. “I did a screen share so she could see exactly what I was doing, and I’d already prepopulated the information so all she had to do was click accept,” Lockshin recalls. \nEven so, there will always be some clients who resist new tech. Lockshin has one client who has a hard time faxing paperwork; instead, the firm sends her paperwork via FedEx, and she mails it back. “There are outliers to everything, to be sure,” Lockshin says. “But in my experience, the general trend is that the older clients really appreciate the technology. It’s like everything else — people figure out how to adapt.” September 29, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T15:23:47.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
