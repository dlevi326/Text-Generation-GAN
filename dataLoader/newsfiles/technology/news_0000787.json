China has denied involvement.\nU.S. government officials and cyber analysts say Chinese hackers are using high-tech tactics to build massive databases that could be used for traditional espionage, such as recruiting spies, or gaining access to secure data on other networks.\nThe Post said the sanctions would be the first use of an executive order that President Barack Obama signed earlier this year to authorize freezing the assets of overseas entities and individuals suspected of commercial cyber espionage.\nA White House official had no immediate comment on the report. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Post Quote: d an administration official as saying the possible sanctions move “sends a signal to Beijing that the administration is going to start fighting back on economic espionage, and it sends a signal to the private sector that we’re on your team. It tells China, enough is enough.”\nThe newspaper said the sanctions would not be imposed as retaliation for the suspected hacking of the U.S. government personnel records, as they were deemed to have been carried out for intelligence reasons rather than to benefit Chinese industry.\nFirst Published on August 31, 2015 9:00 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T08:55:30.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
