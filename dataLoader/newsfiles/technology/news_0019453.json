It consisted of a central window where the 3D model of the object would be displayed, along with a group of sliders that represented the parameters of the object's design. The system would automatically weed out all the possible parameters that would make the model unprintable. \nFor instance, moving one of the sliders — perhaps changing the height of the shoe's heel — would allow the system to sweep through all the associated geometries and, in real time, make changes that ordinarily would take hours to calculate. \n\"We envision a world where everything you buy can potentially be customized,\" said Masha Shugrina, an MIT graduate student and one of the system's designers. \"A technology such as 3D printing promises that that might be cost-effective.\" About the Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:31:00.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
