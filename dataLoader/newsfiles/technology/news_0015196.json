The competition was open to all AIM Members and partners around the world to help promote collaboration and knowledge sharing within the industry. \n“We are honored to be selected by AIM for an award that underscores the collaborative effort of our business partners and customers” states Pietro Todescato, CEO of Datalogic ADC. “As this application shows, Datalogic is focused on listening to our customer’s needs and developing digital imaging technology that can identify items by detecting a bar code or by using image processing.” \nThe entry by Datalogic presents innovative AIDC technology applied in the Netherlands to the problem of processing high numbers of item level product returns. This problem is common for ecommerce retailers and retailers using pre-stocked promotional displays. Vierpool, a Certified Datalogic Business Partner, developed a complete solution. The heart of the solution is the Jade X7 automated scanning portal that uses digital imaging to detect and identify items. The system was installed at Simon Loos, the warehousing and value added logistics supplier for many of the largest retailers in the Netherlands, for processing returns of pre-stocked promotional displays. \nThe traditional method for handling returns was very labor intensive. Presentation scanners and handheld scanners were used to individually scan items as they were unloaded from the displays. The speed of the process was dictated by the speed of the manual scanning. Vierpool automated the process using a Jade automated scanning portal placed at the start of the process providing much faster scanning of items. Now a single employee places Items onto a fast moving belt. The items pass through the Jade system and they are identified at speeds significantly faster than manual scanning. \nThe implementation of the Jade X7 automated scanner significantly improved the returns process increasing productivity without additional manpower. The results were significant; the implementation tripled productivity generating a very fast return on investment. \nA video of the case study submission is available.
