Launched in March, Unbill has seen steady growth in its initial Austin-only phase. Unbill’s customer base increased by 200% in July 2015 alone, and projections for August 2015 maintain a similar growth trajectory. \nAdditionally, Comfy today announced a strategic partnership with Conservice, one of the world’s largest utility management providers. Conservice is also an investor. \n“Nothing is more exciting than to invest further into teams and technologies with rampant user traction and addressing massive market opportunities,” said Chris Shonk, General Partner, ATX Seed Ventures. “The keys, wallet and mailbox all converge on the mobile device, even more so for students and millennials.” \nComfy’s initial August 2014 seed round raised $800,000. ATX Seed is also a principal investor in FantasySalesTeam, recently acquired by Microsoft. \n“Conservice is very excited about the opportunity to be a partner with Unbill both strategically and financially as we invest deeply in a product that will change the way bill delivery happens for our industry,” said Conservice CEO David Jenkins. “This partnership is the ideal blend of experience and technology that will benefit our customers by providing more options and simpler methods.” \n“We’re thrilled to be working with Chris and ATX Seed Ventures,” said Comfy CEO Jordan Wright. “Along with our new agreement with Conservice, the investment allows us to go to market with a pretty amazing solution. We’ve seen fantastic growth and our customer retention is extremely high. \n“Almost everyone has a memory of a roommate who stiffed them on a bill, or the power going out because someone forgot to pay. Unbill solves these problems like no other product we’ve seen for people that want transparency across all household bills.” \nTo learn more about Comfy, visit rentcomfy.com . \nAbout Unbill \nUnbill is an app for Android and iOS that allows roommates to split and pay household bills easily by credit or debit card, without logging onto a website or writing a check.
