Nikki's coffee date rules include: -- Rule #1: The More Coffee Dates The Better Coffee dates are like days of vacation. You can never have too many! -- Rule #2: Make A Statement With Your Order Say it loud, say it proud. There's no shame in your favorite large-caramel-pumpkin-no whip-soy-macchiato. -- Rule #3: Make Sure They Get Your Name Right You don't want your date to put you in their phone as Dana when your name is Dan. -- Rule #4: Smiling is Always Good A confident smile is a turn on. Resting cranky face is not a good look. -- Rule #5: Don't be a Coffee Shop Cliche Leave your slam poetry skills and book of haikus at home. -- Rule #6: Just Be Honest Get it all out in the open. But maybe save your awkward puberty story for the second date. -- Rule #7: More Talking, Less Posting Save your selfies and hashtags for later. -- Rule #8: End an Awesome Coffee Date with Orbit Gum Get back that clean feeling after enjoying your coffee, so there's a chance for a second date. -- Rule #9: Don't Be Afraid to Fall in Love Telling your loved ones you met in a coffee shop is way better than in a bar. -- Rule #10: Today is the Perfect Day for a Coffee Date Today is National Coffee Day, so get after it and don't forget your Orbit gum. \nTo see more from Nikki's coffee dates in honor of #NationalCoffeeDay today, visit www.YouTube.com/OrbitGumVideo , Twitter.com/OrbitGum and Facebook.com/OrbitGum. \nOrbit gum is celebrating National Coffee Day so everyone can have a just brushed clean feeling after enjoying their coffee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T09:08:57.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
