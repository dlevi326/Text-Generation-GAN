One of the biggest venture bets was the $US1.19bn funding of Elon Musk’s SpaceX made at the beginning of the year by Google and Rothenberg Ventures.\nThe internet search giant has been plugged into the scene for a while, starting its investment spree following a half-a-billion-dollar acquisition of satellite start-up Skybox Imaging last year. Since then it has invested in drone start-ups Airware and Skycatch; VR start-ups AltspaceVR and Magic Leap; and space start-ups Orbital Insight to name a few.\nSmartphone chip maker Qualcomm is keen to adapt its Snapdragon processors for drones and has also made a push into this space by making investments in 3D Robotics and Skycatch.\nOther strategic investments include movie studio Legendary Entertainment’s investment into the much-hyped Magic Leap AR platform — an investment that chief executive Thomas Tull believes has the potential to disrupt the entertainment landscape.\nWhile SpaceX and its mission of launching reusable rockets to space has dominated overall funding, there are other well-funded VC-backed space start-ups within segments like satellite operations and imagery.\nThese include Planet Labs and Spire, which aim to rapidly capture images of Earth via satellites on a daily basis in addition to Orbital Insight and Windward, which use satellite imagery to derive unique insights about Earth to a wide range of industries ranging from maritime, wildlife conservation to weather.\nOneweb plans to put more than 600 satellites in space to enable global internet access and has raised a total of $US500 million. Kymeta has raised $US82m to help develop a new form of satellite antenna to connect to mobile networks and communication satellites.\nIt’s expected that more than 2000 nano-satellites will be launched by 2020 when the global satellite imagery market will be worth more than $US5bn.\nWhile space-related start-ups might have raised the lion’s share of equity financing since 2014, there’s growing investor interest in drones or unmanned aerial vehicles, according to Michael Dempsey, who helped compile CB Insights’ report. “We’re starting to hear that every venture capitalist wants a drone investment,” he said.\nDrone investment activity has picked up markedly over the past three quarters, reaching an all-time high in the second quarter of 2015, with $US109m invested on 16 deals. The funding was buoyed by the $US75m financing to DJI Innovations, the largest consumer drone manufacturer in the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:56:35.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
