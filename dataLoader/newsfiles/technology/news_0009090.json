I'm sure there will be more countries which will be interested,\" added Jin, a former Chinese vice finance minister who was put forward by Beijing to head the bank and was elected in August by the prospective founding members. \nThe AIIB has been viewed by some as a rival to the Washington-based World Bank and the Manila-based ADB, which has been headed by Japan, its biggest donor, since it was founded in 1966. \nThe US and Japan -- the world's largest and third-largest economies, respectively -- have notably declined to join the AIIB although they are members of the ADB, but Jin said the door is open to both. \n\"It takes longer for some countries to reach their internal consensus in making their decision,\" he said. \n\"We've been very much patient. As you know, the door is open to all of the countries and if they make a decision just pick up the phone, make a call and we can handle the rest of the business,\" he said, referring to the US and Japan. \nOf the 57 AIIB potential founding members, 50 have already signed, including Australia, while the seven others have until the end of the year to affix their signatures. \nThe bank will be based in Beijing and will have a capital of $100 billion, with $20 billion paid initially. It is expected to start operations next year. \nChina will be the biggest shareholder with 30 percent. Among non-Asian participants, Germany is the largest shareholder with 4.5 percent, followed by France with 3.4 percent and Brazil on 3.2 percent. \nJin said the AIIB is not aimed at challenging the ADB and the World Bank for influence in Asia as the region's funding requirements are so massive. \nHe cited ADB estimates that Asia's infrastructure demand could reach $730 billion per year by 2020, vastly exceeding available resources from existing multilateral lenders. \n\"Creating AIIB has never been about challenging existing institutions. The world stage is spacious enough to allow many actors to perform,\" Jin said. \nSub-Saharan Africa's first modern tramway opened in the Ethiopian capital on Sunday, marking the completion of a massive Chinese-funded infrastructure project hailed as a major step in the country's economic development. \nEven before the ribbon was cut, several hundred residents were queueing for a ride on the Chinese-driven trams, which have the capacity to carry 60,000 passengers a day across the capital of Africa's second most populous nation. \nThe two line, 34-kilometre (21 mile) system was built by the China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) . The project cost $475 million, 85 percent of which has been covered by China's Exim bank. \n\"I'm very excited and very proud as an Ethiopian. We have been waiting for this for a long time. It will curb the transportation shortage,\" said Dereje Daba, who had waited for two hours to become one of the first passengers on the new line. \nCurrently working in a cafï¿½ in the city centre, he said the tram would cut his daily commute from one hour to just 20 minutes. So far only the north-south line is open, with the east-west line due to open next month. \nThe tramway is designed to relieve the mounting strain on the city's roads, where up to now public transport for the five million and growing population has consisted of aged buses and so-called \"blue donkeys\" -- a network of cramped, polluting minibuses. \n\"I have had many problems with the blue donkeys, with the long lines and the fights to get a seat. I hope this will no longer be a problem,\" said Tigist Dekele, a young woman who lives in the city. \nTicket prices have also been set at the low, accessible rate of no more than $0.30. \nThe light rail has been hailed as a milestone in fast-growing but impoverished Ethiopia's development, and part of a cluster of major infrastructure projects -- most of them also Chinese-funded -- that include railway lines, motorways and dams. \nThe project is also a symbol of China's continued strong economic presence on the commodity-rich African continent. Beijing even built the $200 million African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa in 2012 as a gift expressing \"friendship to the African people.\" \nEthiopia's transport minister, Workneh Gebeyehu, said the tramway project would also boost Ethiopia's bid to make the city \n-- already the seat of the African Union -- the undisputed continental hub. \n\"This is a sign of modernity. This is a very modern train that will serve the capital city of Africa. We are very proud of that,\" he said. \"The light rail is not for commercial purposes. Tickets are very cheap. It will serve the people with low income.\" \nAuthorities have also promised the scheme will not be beset by power cuts, with a separate power grid set up to feed the lines. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T11:41:08.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
