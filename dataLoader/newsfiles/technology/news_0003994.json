They want to see real delivery on that commitment.\nThe Moolman family , as reported previously in news24.com , whose name has been etched on the City’s housing waiting lists since 1993 is still awaiting the promise of a new home from the City. Supposed to be recipients of social housing already, they must be content with being just a reference number on a waiting list for longer instead. In 2014 the City refused to include them in the Belhar-Pentech Housing project. They nonetheless persisted in engaging with the Mayor’s office and it was decided to submit their names to the Pelican Park housing project in Strandfontein.\nWith a strenuous screening process completed in April 2015, they were naturally excited by the possibility getting their own home. They told family and friends, collecting the few household possessions they have, in readiness for the big day. But their joy was short-lived and their hopes shattered when on July 6 the project developer broached the sad news - their housing application had been declined. For this family, who had seen more trials than most, the news was heart-wrenching. They contacted the office of the Mayor of the City of Cape Town to lodge an appeal against the decision. But after several phone calls and numerous emails, the Mayor’s office has yet to respond to their appeal.\nEmpty promises\nThis pretty much sums up the scenario for many homeless families in the Western Cape that need assistance. Once their names are validated, they receive letters to report to a particular housing project office where a housing project is due to commence or underway, to complete a formal application. Wanting to escape the cruel indignity of homelessness makes them subservient to the red tape tyranny of a gruelling application screening process, one that demands many costly trips to certify and submit all the required supporting documents – payslips, ID documents, affidavits, signed the deed of sale and so on.\nWith the prospect of a new home finally within reach, the future looks very bright for these shack dwellers and backyarders. Brimming from ear to ear, they await keys to their new residence. What happens in reality is a far cry from such happy ending. In the place of keys to a new home, all they ever get is more empty promises - shunted from pillar to post through the bureaucratic maze, they remain homeless and hopeless. No one can give clear answers. For them the painful wait continues.\nAccording to its 2013/14 Annual Report , the City of Cape reported delivery of 5 718 social housing units. But this is a drop in two oceans considering the estimated 65 000 (a staggering figure) housing applications that are processed yearly.\nUnfair Treatment\nIn all my interactions with the City’s housing department, I am often struck by a horde of inept desk-bound functionaries, scaling mountains of paperwork, annoyed when the average Joe enquires about a housing application.\nThe queues at housing site offices in Pelican Park, Belhar and elsewhere are infinitely long. You sense the bond of comradeship amongst the homeless; their mutual plight resonates and is well-understood by each other. There are those whose destitute situations scream for help from City officials but none is forthcoming. It’s the only hope they so desperately cling to. But why has the City, whose mantra is “making progress happen together,” not come to their aid, yet? These people do not want handouts; all they ask is to be treated with fairness and dignity.\nThe reasons for the growing housing backlog are not entirely clear but complaints of unfair treatment only compound the housing crisis. Government’s social housing program is aimed at benefiting the poor with earnings under R3500 per month. Yet, it is alleged that recipients earning more than the income threshold were beneficiaries of social housing and allocated homes in the recent past. Furthermore, some names on housing waiting lists were bumped up ahead of those whose names are on the waiting lists for much longer. So, you have to wonder whether these allegations of foul play are true indeed.\nWas the bona fides of those questionable applications properly vetted and has the necessary background checks been conducted or not? Are city officials aware of these complaints regarding improperly approved housing applications and has anything been done about it? Or are these conveniently overlooked?\nLacking proper governance\nWhat is most concerning about the City’s social housing program is the lack of a proper governance oversight or monitoring framework and structure. Thus there is not much transparency and accountability in the whole process. Names that are drawn from waiting lists are assigned to housing projects and those hopefuls who apply sometimes get houses, if they’re lucky. This all seem very slapstick and haphazard. But what kind of due diligence has been put in place? How is the process (allocation of names to housing projects, application, application approval/ rejection, hand-over of keys, assignment of new home owners, etc.) being audited by independent auditors, if at all?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:06:28.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
