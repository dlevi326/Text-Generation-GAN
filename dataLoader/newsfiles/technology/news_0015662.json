As always, I tried to make the quiz extra challenging, and today and next week – in response to your e-mails – I’ll discuss some of the questions that flummoxed readers.\nIf you haven’t taken the quiz yet, you can find it online . Now to the questions.\nSeveral readers were tripped up by No. 4:\nSteve contributed $3,000 when the tax-free savings account was introduced in 2009. He withdrew $2,000 in 2010 and contributed $12,000 in 2012 but made no other deposits or withdrawals. How much TFSA contribution room would he have today?\na) $10,000\nb) $26,000\nc) $28,000\nd) Impossible to say, as the 2012 contribution exceeded the annual maximum\nThe first thing you need to know is that TFSA contribution room is cumulative. So, if Steve had never put a penny into his TFSA, he would have $41,000 of contribution room as of 2015 ($5,000 for each of 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, $5,500 for each of 2013 and 2014, and $10,000 for 2015). From $41,000, you would subtract Steve’s total contributions of $15,000 ($3,000 plus $12,000), and then add the $2,000 withdrawal (because TFSA withdrawals are added back to contribution room the following year). So, $41,000 minus $15,000 plus $2,000 equals $28,000, which is answer c).\nQuestion No. 7 also stumped a few readers:\nWith mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, reinvested or “phantom” distributions are:\na) Added to your adjusted cost base\nb) Subtracted from your adjusted cost base\nc) Broken out separately on your T3\nd) Not taxable since no cash is received\nReinvested distributions aren’t reported separately on your T3 and they aren’t subtracted from your adjusted cost base (that’s how you treat return of capital), but they are taxable. So that rules out answers b), c) and d), which leaves the correct answer: a).\nWhy are reinvested distributions added to your ACB? Think of it as a two-step process: You receive a distribution from the fund (and pay the tax). The fund then turns around and reinvests the money on your behalf. Although you never actually receive any cash, you’re paying tax as if you did. So, when the funds are reinvested, you are in effect putting new money to work.\nIf you have shares in a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP), it’s the same principle: Every dollar reinvested is added to your ACB. If you don’t increase your ACB, you will end up reporting a larger capital gain when you sell your shares and paying more tax than necessary.\nFor more on reinvested distributions, check out my previous columns online at tgam.ca/ELdV , tgam.ca/ELdW and tgam.ca/ELdX .\nFinally for today, let’s look at question No. 9:\nSarah has a fixed-rate mortgage at 3.2 per cent and a marginal tax rate of 43 per cent. She has $10,000 and wants to either pay down her mortgage or buy a non-registered GIC. What interest rate will the GIC have to pay to match the after-tax return of paying down her mortgage?\na) 3.2 per cent\nb) 4.5 per cent\nc) 5.1 per cent\nd) 5.6 per cent\nIf Sarah puts the $10,000 toward her mortgage, she will save 3.2 per cent in interest annually (or $320). This is an after-tax return because there are no taxes payable. If she puts the $10,000 into a non-registered GIC, on the other hand, she will pay tax at her marginal rate of 43 per cent on the interest earned.\nOn an after-tax basis, she will therefore keep 57 per cent (100 per cent minus 43 per cent) of the GIC interest. So the question becomes: What interest rate (call it X), when multiplied by 0.57, is equivalent to 3.2 per cent?\nIf X times 0.57 equals 3.2, then X equals 3.2 divided by 0.57, or 5.614 per cent, which can be rounded down to answer d): 5.6 per cent. In other words, Sarah would have to make $561.40 in pre-tax interest on a $10,000 non-registered GIC (which is impossible at today’s interest rates) to match the $320 after-tax return of paying down her mortgage.\nI chose this question to illustrate that, if you are looking for the highest guaranteed after-tax return (emphasis on the word guaranteed), you can’t beat paying down your mortgage.\nFollow John Heinzl on Twitter: @johnheinzl\n Topics: Investor Clinic Financial Services Comments Print /\nLicense A A", "external_links": ["http://license.icopyright.net/g2/3.8425?icx_id=26439537", "http://tgam.ca/ELdX", "http://tgam.ca/ELdV", "http://tgam.ca/ELdW", "https://twitter.com/@johnheinzl", "http://license.icopyright.net/3.8425?icx_id=26439537"], "published": "2015-09-19T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T01:34:25.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
