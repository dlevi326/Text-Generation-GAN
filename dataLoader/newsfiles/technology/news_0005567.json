It is one more innovative product for the Internet of Things (IoT) Market that Tatsoft has been pioneering since 2010, with the introduction of “Cloud Engineering” tools, and in 2011 with the launch of native runtimes for multiple platforms; including a native-code HMI for Apple iOS devices, and the ongoing certifications for Linux, Raspberry PI and Android. With FactoryStudio Compact Framework , Tatsoft continues to demonstrate its strength in providing state-of-the-art automation software, as a platform-independent provider for real-time and historical data aggregation, application development and advanced visualization projects. This Smart News Release features multimedia.

Tatsoft has unique and incomparable experience in embedded software, as Tatsoft’s founder Marcos Taccolini led the creation of the very first HMI/SCADA solution for Windows CE devices, brought to the market as UniSoft CE, nearly 20 years ago . \nTaccolini has fond memories of that time: \"... in 1996, even though Windows was already evolving as an OS, I had customers asking me to continue to develop DOS-based HMI tools, as they wanted software with a smaller footprint. That was when I had the idea to use the recently launched Windows CE, originally created for Handheld PCs and was not yet being applied in Industrial Automation, but I was sure it would follow that visionary path. \" For the younger generations that perhaps never saw a handheld PC, take a look at www.tatsoft.com\\first-windows-ce-hmi-scada . \nThe Taccolini premonitions in 1996 were right, in the 2000 decade Windows CE was adopted by dozens of companies as the platform for OEM, machine editions, and small footprint HMI’s. It is estimated that the software components created back in 1996, were used in more than 300,000 applications around the globe, and they are still in use by products from major market players. Green cubes in icons and the \"UniSoft\" name in the binary files are clues that the HMI software may be using the technologies of which Taccolini was a pioneer some 20 years ago. \nFactoryStudio Compact Framework helps you to create graphical displays with complete resolution independence (via Tatsoft’s WPF vector-based graphics editor), alarms and trends, with store-and-forward capability, built-in communication protocols for most PLCs and networks, database access to both local databases and remote servers, and you can use C# and VB.NET as scripting languages for advanced customization, using the platform-agnostic engineering workspace, which allows you to open and edit multiple projects concurrently. \n“With FactoryStudio for Compact Framework, you now have a fourth generation modern toolset to build applications that leverage lower-cost runtime environments to their full potential,” says Dave Hellyer, Tatsoft LLC Vice-President. System Integrators, Panel Builders, as well as OEMs now have a state-of-the-art low-cost solution to quickly deploy their applications in any kind of device powered by embedded OS that requires smart and powerful software. \nAbout Tatsoft LLC: \nTatsoft was created in Houston and after years of pure Research and Development brought the next generation automation platform to the market. Tatsoft’s core product, FactoryStudio, is an all-in-one integrated solution including a built-in SQL database, data-acquisition protocols, web server, alarm and event management, batches, recipes, scheduling, data logging, WPF graphical designer; all combined with an intuitive engineering user interface.
