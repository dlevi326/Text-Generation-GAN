Credit: NASA/NOAA GOES Project \nNOAA's GOES-West satellite spotted the eye in a strong Typhoon Kilo moving through the Northwestern Pacific Ocean. \nAt 11 a.m. EDT on September 2, Typhoon Kilo's maximum sustained winds were near 90 knots (103.6 mph/166.7 kph). It was centered near 24.3 North and 179.1 East, about 762 nautical miles east-northeast of Wake Island. Kilo was moving very slowly at 3 knots (3.4 mph/5.5 kph). \nAt that time, Typhoon Kilo's eye was visible in a satellite image from NOAA's GOES-West satellite. The image also showed powerful bands of thunderstorms wrapping into the low level center of circulation. \nGOES-West is managed by NOAA. The image was created by NASA/NOAA's GOES Project at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \nFortunately, Kilo is in open waters and is currently no threat to land areas . \nThe Joint Typhoon Warning Center expects Kilo to re-strengthen and continue tracking west. It is expected to peak in intensity on September 6.

NASA sees Tropical Storm Kilo wrapped halfway around itself August 27, 2015 \nWhen NASA's Aqua satellite passed over Tropical Storm Kilo early on August 27, infrared imagery showed that bands of thunderstorms wrapped more than halfway around the system. NASA sees Hurricane Kilo headed for International Date Line August 31, 2015 \nNASA's Aqua and NOAA's GOES-West satellite saw Hurricane Kilo moving west in the Central Pacific Ocean as it neared the International Date Line. NASA spots Kilo, now a typhoon in the Northwestern Pacific September 1, 2015 \nHurricane Kilo may have formed in the Central Pacific Ocean, but on September 1 it crossed the International Date Line, so it was classified as a typhoon.
