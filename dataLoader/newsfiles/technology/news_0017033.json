The CMO Club cares program brings influential CMOs together with the causes they care about most to drive value to all. \nThe CMO Club's mission is to help its members connect and solve their biggest challenges within a candid, trusted and sharing environment. The members of The CMO Club are made up of senior marketing leaders who have little time to help the charities dearest to them but have a great deal of insights and advice they could offer. The CMO Club will serve as the catalyst to help its members with their commitments to charities. \nCMO Club Founder and CEO Pete Krainik said, \"We are thrilled to have a passionate and engaged group of CMOs in The CMO Club that have the capacity to give back to so many charities at the same time and allow our members to work alongside each other supporting a particular cause they feel strongly about. Stronger relationships will inevitably be built. This is what The Club is all about.\" \nDuring the Summit, The CMO Club will facilitate problem-solving and creative brainstorming sessions for the charities with the CMOs in attendance. Together, the CMOs will collaborate with the charities to solve some of their biggest business challenges. \n\"This is an outstanding opportunity to take a cause so close to my heart and help expose it to some of the greatest strategic and creative marketers in business,\" said Judy Hackett , club member and CMO of Dun & Bradstreet, Emerging Businesses. \"Many of these charities have minimal marketing expertise in-house and are working with restrictive budgets. The CMO Club Cares program can make all the difference.\" \nAfter the Summit, The CMO Club will continue to support CMOs with their commitments to help. Commitments will be made by CMOS at the Summit; small or large, financial or non-monetary in nature. Future summits will showcase progress and success stories of these commitments. The CMO Club will continue to serve as the catalyst of networking by bringing senior executives together with the charities that they care about and with the charities that will benefit most from our members' insights. \nCEO of SOS Children's Villages - USA, Lynn Croneberger says, \"SOS Children's Villages is thrilled to team up with such talented, creative individuals through the CMO Club Cares Program. Their combined skills and expertise will help further our reach and help us build awareness and support for the millions of vulnerable children living in our world today.\" \nThe CMO's in The CMO Club have helped recommend charities, varying in size and initiative, to be a part of this initiative. Some of these charities include: \nClearity Foundation The Clearity Foundation was launched in 2008 to help ovarian cancer patients and their physicians make better-informed treatment decisions based on the molecular profile of the tumor.
