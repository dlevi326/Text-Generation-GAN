The service provider has already successfully deployed its first WebRTC-based service, and used the Oracle Communications product to do so. \nThe WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications) standard has transformed communications in the browser. It enables both browser-to-browser and native mobile application capabilities such as voice calling, video chat, and peer-to-peer data sharing, opening a new platform for enterprises and service providers to develop additional product offers for customers. Prosodie-Capgemini recognized the opportunity in WebRTC as well as the challenges in connectivity, security, and control that it can present. To meet those challenges head-on, the company selected Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller for its ability to simplify and speed the development of WebRTC-based products and deliver carrier-grade service quality for web-based communications. \n\"We are constantly looking for ways to create new, valuable services to offer our customers. The WebRTC industry standard is a huge opportunity that enables us to develop these offers -- and Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller is what allows us to deploy them efficiently and successfully,\" said Erwan Le Duff, COO, Prosodie-Capgemini. \"The Oracle product has already helped us launch our first service -- Odigo WebCall -- which enables voice calls in the browser. With this service, our enterprise customers -- such as Air Liquide ALEHOS , which has already adopted it -- now have the potential to deliver the targeted, timely assistance that consumers need, all without leaving the browser, which can in turn yield a better experience and increased satisfaction.\" \nProsodie-Capgemini selected Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller because the product offers a software development kit (SDK) to accelerate application development and interoperability between any WebRTC device and any Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) network. It also gives the service provider carrier-grade availability and performance -- as well as advanced security with authentication, encryption, and attack mitigation -- for any WebRTC-based products. Prosodie-Capgemini has also been using Oracle Communications Session Border Controller since 2011 to maintain trusted interactive communications across IP network borders. \n\"People are constantly online, rapidly moving from device to device, but are demanding a totally seamless experience -- whether they are buying skis online and need advice, or approving transactions for work,\" said Doug Suriano, senior vice president and general manager, Oracle Communications. \"We are at the core of what enables these kinds of experiences, and the real-time communications over the web offered by Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller is a prime example. Both enterprises and service providers like Prosodie-Capgemini are taking advantage of WebRTC technology, and they're choosing Oracle Communications to make it possible.\" \nAdditional Information To learn more about Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller and other Oracle Communications products, please connect on Twitter @OracleComms and at facebook.com/oraclecommunications , or visit oracle.com/communications . \nAbout Oracle Oracle offers a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of cloud applications and platform services.
