It’s just me, one parent, saying to William’s parents, I feel for you. I am sorry for you and I am writing this column to share your son’s story in the hope that it goes some way in helping to find him.\nI sat and watched 60 Minutes last Sunday night as it marked one year since William’s abduction and, I’ll be completely honest with you, several times I wanted to turn it off. It was hitting too close to home and making me uncomfortable.\nThen I caught myself and released that William’s parents don’t get to look away when things get too painful. There is no off switch to their enormous sense of loss and grief and I imagine their anguish is relentless and must feel infinite.\nAs William’s father tearfully explained how he worries about William wondering “Where are my mum and dad?”, and his mother sat clutching William’s favourite toy sobbing, I found myself wanting to reach through the TV and hold them both. I wanted to give them strength and love; they were just so distraught. Mums and dads aren’t built to deal with the loss of their children, that’s not how things are supposed to be.\nWhat happened to this child? Source: News Corp Australia\nWilliam has been missing for a year. Source: Supplied\nAs my two daughters slept close by, I felt a strong and primal need to protect them.\nI wanted to go into their rooms, put my arms around them and shut the world out. When these type of stories hit the headlines, I almost always react with fear. I pull the reins in on my girls, I triple check all the locks on the doors and have the stranger danger chat with them. Essentially I put the fear of God in them to try and make myself feel better and them safer.\nMy daughters are 13 and eight. William Tyrell was too young for those type of talks.\nIt must be said that Michael Usher did an outstanding job reporting the story for 60 Minutes. Due to the “complicated family situation”, he was hamstrung by strict legal parameters, but still managed to get William’s story across with accuracy and compassion.\nThat aside, Michael is a father of three and, as I watched him unable to contain his emotions, it hit me hard that this situation is big, raw and real.\nI can’t imagine anyone not being touched by William’s abduction. It’s easy to forget your humanity when dealing with these types of occurrences. We can become casual and dehumanise victims of tragedy and crime for reasons of self preservation, complacency and distance. For me, though, the anniversary of William’s disappearance has brought things sharply back into focus.\nMany times during the interview I couldn’t help but put myself in his parents’ shoes and it took my breath away. I can’t even begin to fathom how they cope, but I suppose if I it were me, I’d never stop looking either. My sole reason for putting one foot in front of the other would be to find out what happened to my child.\nPolice with a replica Spiderman suit that William was wearing the day he vanished. Picture: Nathan Edwards Source: News Corp Australia\nWilliam has been weighing heavily on my mind since watching his story. I worry the legal complications surrounding his family have hindered the amount of coverage in the media, thereby reducing public awareness. So I am adding my voice, small profile and national platform to the cause. Someone, somewhere MUST know something. Little boys don’t just vanish into thin air.\nDo you have any information? Are you afraid to come forward because it has been too long or perhaps you’re afraid of the legal ramifications? Make an anonymous call, buy a pre­paid mobile phone just for that purpose and set it on fire after if you have to. I don’t really care, just do it if you have any knowledge of what has happened to William Tyrell.\nSomeone, somewhere MUST know something.\nTo William’s parents, I am in awe of your grace and courage and I dearly hope that your little boy is returned to you safe and unharmed.\nEm Rusciano is a comedian, writer, singer and regular news.com.au columnist.
