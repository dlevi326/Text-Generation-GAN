It is also the goal of the task force to develop recommendations and model legislation on cost-effective strategies to protect patient access to Medicaid and improve Medicaid reimbursement, among other initiatives.” \nT. Scott Law, founder and CEO of Zotec Partners states, “We are thrilled that Ed will chair a task force that addresses these critical issues in emergency medicine.
