Samsung will issue a firmware update that will enable its 2015 SUHD and UHD TVs to display a broader library of High Dynamic Range (HDR) content now from external devices. HDR delivers a much higher level of contrast between light and dark to produce an image that is more realistic and closer to what the content creator imagined. The firmware update is available now at no additional cost to owners of 2015 Samsung SUHD and UHD TV’s. \nHDMI 2.0a enables the transmission of HDR metadata from external HDR-compatible sources, such as the Ultra HD Blu-ray players that will soon become available. Combined with Samsung’s Nano-crystal technology and picture quality enhancements, such as Peak Illuminator, this update will further provide owners of SUHD sets with the most lifelike picture quality available today. \n“Samsung provides cutting-edge technology that our consumers expect from an industry leader, and our SUHD TV’s are our best ever” said John Ryu, vice president of the visual display business at Samsung Electronics. “While our 2015 SUHD and UHD TV lines are already capable of delivering HDR capability from internal sources such as streaming services, this firmware update will enlarge the spectrum of available HDR content for our customers.” \nHDMI 2.0a will be supported on all 2015 SUHD and UHD TV models via the firmware update and does not require new HDMI cables. \nFor more information on Samsung’s SUHD TV lineup or upcoming announcements, visit the official website at www.samsung.com and the blog at global.samsungtomorrow.com . \nAbout Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. \nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd. inspires the world and shapes the future with transformative ideas and technologies, redefining the worlds of TVs, smartphones, wearable devices, tablets, cameras, digital appliances, printers, medical equipment, network systems, and semiconductor and LED solutions.
