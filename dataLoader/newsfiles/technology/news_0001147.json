Bloomberg by Peter Moon There's a lot to like about Apple's upgraded operating system for iPhone and iPad, but for us there are two standouts: a new power saving mode for iPhone and major improvements to the Notes app, both of them a bonus for business users.\nYouthful readers won't even remember the days when a fully charged mobile phone stayed alive for three or four days. Along came smartphones with their power-hungry screens and processors and we had to get used to the idea that going 16 hours without a recharge was tempting fate. For some, power management became an art form.\nEven though Bluetooth is less of a drain these days, we still keep it off by default. Likewise Location Services for apps that engage it in the background. Even then, we pack a 10,000 mAh Mi power bank in our carrybag, together with mains and car chargers.\nYes, we worry about losing power. That's why iPhone's low-power mode interests us so much.\nUnsurprisingly, you turn it on via the battery options in Settings. Flick the switch, your battery icon turns yellow to indicate that you have entered economy mode and a package of power reduction settings is applied. The processor is throttled back, email stops automatically updating, apps cease refreshing in the background, a couple of inconsequential visual effects are disabled and an untouched screen will darken and lock faster than usual.\nHow much extra battery life that delivers depends on how you use the phone but for us it translates into several extra hours.\nThe beauty of low-power mode is that, with the exception of automatic email downloads, your handset still works. In power emergencies, users have always had the options of turning off mobile data or even engaging flight mode, but those kinds of solutions hobble the unit's functionality.\nLow power leaves the phone fully operational, but running slower than normal. An iPhone 6, for instance, is clipped back to a processor speed more like an iPhone 5.\n No notable performance lag Speed-limiting the processor makes little difference to anything we regularly use an iPhone to do. While Apple pitches low power as a strategy when your handset dips to 20 per cent battery, many users will adopt it as standard operating mode, and treat normal power setting as a turbo mode if and when required.\nApple hasn't twigged to that option yet, because low-power mode is automatically switched off next time you recharge. But expect a full-time low-power option in future.\nWe also have to admit that losing real-time email updating isn't a bad thing. Instead of being pummeled by automated new mail, you manually check for messages when it suits you. A small victory for quality of life.\nUnfortunately, low-power mode hasn't yet arrived in iPad, or at least the models we tried. Hopefully it will appear in iOS 9.1, likely to be released in November.\nTaking notes Long ago we recognised that our working memory wasn't up to the task of retaining and managing the plethora of phone numbers, web addresses, to-dos, reminders, commitments and other details that life generates. Even though we have specialist apps for holding particular data, nothing beats a good notepad where you can jot things down on the fly.\nFor 20 years, we have mapped our Windows F9 function key to the very basic Notepad utility. Whenever we need a scratch pad, tapping F9 pops up Notepad and away we go.\nApple's enhanced Notes app can handle sketches, something like the veteran Windows Paint utility, images and other attachments, more sophisticated text formatting and checklists.\nWe really appreciate the ability to take a photo within the app that is automatically inserted into the current note. Because we're hopeless at retaining paper expense receipts, we photograph them as soon as they're handed to us.\nThat's great as far as it goes, but they end up in a monster camera roll with no easy way to search for them. Now we can image them directly into Notes and add some text, perhaps only the word \"Visa\" and a Spotlight search can retrieve them all in a moment.\nFor our needs, Notes now does the same things we use Evernote for, and since Notes synchronises across devices via iCloud, our jottings are available wherever we go. So the free iOS upgrade has saved us a $75 annual Evernote subscription.\nPeter Moon is a technology lawyer with Cooper Mills. peter.moon@coopermills.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:24:09.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
