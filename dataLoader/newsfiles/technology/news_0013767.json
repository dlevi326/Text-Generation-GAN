Smartphones from the big brands aren't made to take that type of abuse and will quickly accumulate damage that's quite expensive or even impossible to repair. Stepping up to present a solution to this problem is the leader in rugged smartphone and smartwatch technology SNOPOW Australia . SNOPOW Australia recently announced the launch of two remarkable products their flagship IP68 rated M8-LTE 4G Smartphone and IP68 rated W1S 3G Smartwatch. With IP68 standing for the smartphone and smartwatch being waterproof, dust proof and shock proof, the news of their release has been greeted with enthusiasm.\n“Here in Australia things can get pretty rough, at work and at play,” commented a spokesperson from SNOPOW Australia. “We wanted to offer people a high end smartphone and smartwatch that can handle the rough stuff. From the beach to the outback, from the perils of home to the dangers of the worksite. We got sick of replacing our fragile 'handle with extreme care' smartphones and watches and decided to do something about it. Now we have a range of 'handle without care' mobiles and watches that we really can take everywhere. Things are getting tougher all round, so we wanted something that can go the distance. The range of SNOPOW products was the answer.”\nAccording to the company both their new smartphone and smartwatch have very impressive statistics.\nThe M8-LTE smartphone is the company's lead product, and has recently had both its hardware and software upgraded dramatically. Now the smartphone features full 4G connectivity and is running the latest Android operating system Android 5.1 Lollipop. This puts the M8-LTE neck to neck in performance with the latest releases from Samsung and LG in both speed and data connectivity, but with an addition of an IP68 rating, which means the smartphone is waterproof, shockproof and dustproof. The M8-LTE even has a UHF Walkie Talkie function, making it even more versatile in nearly any situation.\nThe W1S 3G Smartwatch combines a stylish appearance, with the same rugged and waterproof functionality that has built the SNOPOW remarkable reputation. The W1S 3G has been crafted to the same IP68 rating standard as the brand's smartphones, making the smartwatch waterproof, shockproof and dustproof. It contains a 1.2GHz dual-core processor and runs Android 4.4, making the W1S 3G more advanced than what many other companies leading smartphones. Rounding out the features, the smartwatch has a high performing 2mp camera and a 1.6\" touch screen that's so responsive a user can easily text from it.\nBoth products are available directly through SNOPOW from the company website.\nFor more information be sure to visit http://snopow.com.au/\nContact:\nContact Person: Martin Carroll, Sales and Marketing Manager\nCompany: SNOPOW Australia\nPhone: +61413423307\nAddress: 402 Horner Street, Rockhampton, QLD, 4701, Australia\nEmail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
