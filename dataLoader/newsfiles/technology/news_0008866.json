Published on : Friday, September 25, 2015\nA tornado near Charleston, S.C., wreaked havoc in the West Ashley and Johns Island areas early Friday, according to media reports.\nCharleston County Sheriff’s Office informed there was “significant property damage” on Johns Island, but no injuries were as yet reported.\nNational Weather Service Meteorologist Douglas Berry said radar and damage reports indicated a tornado probably touched down in Charleston County early Friday morning.\nThe weather system was reported at around 12.40 a.m. ET and tornado warnings were issued.\n“The tornado was especially dangerous because it spun up quickly when it did,” AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said. “That can make the situation even more dangerous as people go to bed for the night and are not aware of the tornado warning that may be issued.”\nThe tornado warning for the area has expired, but a flash flood watch was in effect until 8 a.m. Friday for a swath of southeast South Carolina that includes the metro Charleston area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T21:19:00.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
