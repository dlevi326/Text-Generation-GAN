How then is it possible that he couldn't remember that the speech is familiar, unless of course like all old people, he suffers from memory loss and other old-people related problems?\nAnd let's say it's true that there was a mix-up in the office as his Spokesperson claims. Did the old man not prepare for his speech days before? If so, why isn't that speech fresh in his mind? If it was, he would have known immediately when he started with the wrong one that it wasn't the correct one for the occasion.\nThere's no amount of spinning and rhetoric this matter that will convince a reasonable person that president Mugabe is still a fully functioning person. He is an old man. As a matter of fact, he has BEEN an old man for a long time.\nHe must rest. Otherwise he will start spilling state secrets at press conferences, thinking he's in his office with Mnangagwa alone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T11:55:07.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
