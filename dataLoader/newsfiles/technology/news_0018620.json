Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\n“Why is 4K needed? There are 76 display resolution variations but only nine content resolution variations, none of which include 2K, so if you’re going to go higher than 1080p, 4K is the answer,” said Takao Yagi from Sony’s Xperia display technology group in Japan.\nWhether a resolution as high as 4K on a screen as small as 5.5in makes a material difference for consumers remains to be seen.\nDespite having a super-high resolution, Sony promises up to two-days battery life, using the same image processing and power saving technologies it used within its Z3 and Z3 Compact , both of which had two-day battery lives.\nThe Z5 Premium has 32GB of storage, 3GB of memory and runs Qualcomm’s octo-core Snapdragon 810 processor, which caused overheating issues in several smartphones, including Sony’s Z3+, and could only record 4K video for less than a minute before overheating.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The 5.2in Sony Xperia Z5 with new 23-megapixel camera sitting flush with the back in the corner. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\nThe smartphone will also use Sony’s first new smartphone camera sensor in two years, which integrates phase detection technology from the company’s Alpha cameras for the world’s fastest focus time of 0.03 seconds.\nThe 5.5in Z5 Premium will be joined by a standard 5.2in Z5, the successor to Sony’s Z3, with a 1080p screen with 423ppi and similar specifications to the Premium.\nSony will also update its smaller, top-end smartphone range with the Z5 Compact, which promises the same performance as its larger smartphones but in a more manageable frame with a 4.6in 720p screen.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The 4.6in Xperia Z5 Compact promises to be easier to use due its smaller size. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\nAll three smartphones are waterproof and will have Sony’s new fingerprint sensor, which is hidden under the power button on the side of the phone – the first fingerprint scanner not to be placed either on the front or the back of the smartphone.\n“People press the power button 100 times a day, having a fingerprint sensor under it on the side means it’s not awkward to activate and keeps the phone secure,” said Jun Makino from Sony mobile.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The fingerprint scanner is on the side of the phone under the power button, rather than on the front or the back as with Apple, Samsung or Huawei smartphones.
