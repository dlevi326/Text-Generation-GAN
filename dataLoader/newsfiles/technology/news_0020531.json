Inductors are formed with the help of a wire tightly wrapped around a solid central core, to concentrate their magnetic flux. The inductor market has been segmented with respect to types including fixed, variable, couple, surface mount, multilayer, and power inductor and also by core type including air core, ferromagnetic core, ceramic core, toroidal core, and laminated core.The global inductor market was valued at USD 2780 million in 2014 and is expected to reach USD 3750 million by 2018, at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2014 to 2019. Continuous research and development in the field has resulted in size minimization, weight reduction, and easy surface mounting methods along with, reducing the time and money, thereby driving the rapid growth of the inductor market. Additionally, factors such as the increasing usage of passive components and the roll-out of sophisticated electronic components are driving the growth of this market.Inductor is an integral part of antennae. The increasing demand for wireless devices such as routers, access points, gateways, and broadcasting systems, along with smartphones and tablets is driving the RF & Telecommunication inductor market. Other application areas of inductor are automotive industry, power industry, industrial sector, military & defense, and consumer electronics.The global inductor market has been segmented on the basis of regions into the Asia-Pacific, North America, Europe, Latin America, and Rest of the World. Asia-Pacific (APAC) is expected to grow at the highest CAGR of 7.6% during the forecast period due to various factors such as demographic changes, increasing demand of smart devices, rise in purchasing power, and growing population.This report provides an in-depth study of the global inductor market with expert opinion of the related industry experts. The report also includes the drivers and inhibitors for the inductor market along with, the demand and supply side market analysis. The competitive product portfolio analysis of the key players in this market has also been covered in detail. The report also provides financial details, strategy, and recent developments of the major companies present in this market along with, the current and future trends for the global inductor market.
