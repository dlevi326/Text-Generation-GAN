Safety inspection, testing and certification of this equipment are essential for the safety of users, meeting stringent health and safety regulations, and for planned preventative maintenance programmes. \nTo remove manual data entry errors, double handing of data and high admin overheads, and expedite the inspection and certification process for customers, CoreRFID proposed and implemented its CheckedOK inspection management system. Central to the power of this solution is the M3 Sky handheld PDA device from Maxatec. \nThe M3 Sky is a slim yet rugged (IP 65 sealing) PDA with radio frequency (RFID) tagging capability and multi-function QUERTY keyboard, making it a flexible yet reliable workhorse in challenging environments. Used in CoreRFID's CheckedOK system, the M3 Sky reads data from the equipment's identification tag. This displays location, inspection task lists and collects inspection result data, considerably simplifying the engineer's role, reducing the risk of error and speeding up the inspection and certification process. All data is sent from the PDA via wireless connectivity and held securely on a central database hosted by CoreRFID on Hoistech's behalf, eliminating wasteful data duplication issues, providing back-ups and data security, and significantly reducing reporting time. \nMaxatec hand-picks robust mobile products suitable for a range of applications and industries including construction, plant hire, field services and other industrial and multi-site operations. CoreRFID, a leader in safety and survival systems, is one of its many satisfied and loyal resellers. The company chose Maxatec and the Windows Mobile-powered M3 Sky PDA unit thanks to an all-round fit in terms of form factor, ruggedness, performance, features and price. \nCoreRFID Director Richard Harrison said: \"Maxatec help us find the best products and deals and assist with project pricing, maintenance contracts and technical support. \n\"We have a long-standing relationship with them and they understand our needs and those of our clients so well, better than any other supplier we work with.\" \nMaxatec's range of ergonomic M3 Mobile rugged PDAs delivers optimum value and reliability. \nTo find out more about the company's range of Windows and Android-powered products and services, contact the Maxatec Sales Office on +44 (0) 161 942 7850 or e-mail sales@maxatec-europe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:36:54.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
