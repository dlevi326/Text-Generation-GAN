They validate the power of our model – continually improving technology and expert services to ensure our clients get the most from the platform,” said Carl Prindle, President and Chief Executive Officer of Blueport Commerce. “With the right technology and marketing strategies in place, consumers will buy furniture online, rather than just using the Internet for research. This is a key shift in consumer behavior and a very promising trend for our furniture retailers as we head into the holiday season.” \nSeveral factors contributed to the Labor Day success, according to Blueport Executive Vice President of E-commerce Randy Goldstein. \n“Earlier this year we launched our new platform, which provides our retail clients with best-in-class e-commerce tools and technology,” said Goldstein. “Labor Day was the first major holiday during which all of Blueport’s clients were live on the new platform, whose responsive design framework accommodates the accelerating shift toward mobile shopping. The power of the new platform, combined with client execution and strategic guidance from our in-house e-commerce and marketing experts, is evident in the financial success our clients have enjoyed this year, and particularly on Labor Day.” \nIn addition to the platform’s responsive design, its improved product discoverability, powerful merchandising capabilities, and a smoother checkout process are all attributes driving greater conversion. Additionally, partnership between Blueport’s in-house experts and its retail clients on marketing, event planning and execution have driven increased and higher value traffic to the retailers’ sites. \nBeyond a consistent stream of innovation and platform upgrades, Blueport also provides regular data-driven recommendations to help clients optimize their online productivity. “Site measurement and analytics are critical to our clients’ success. By poring through data and uncovering customer insights, we help our clients make continual improvements to their furniture shopping experience, which has resulted in measurable and direct impact on conversion rates,” added Goldstein. \nAbout Blueport Commerce \nBlueport Commerce helps leading furniture retailers capture their e-commerce opportunity.
