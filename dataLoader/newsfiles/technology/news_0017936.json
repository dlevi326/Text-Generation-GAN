The applications go back nearly two decades and officials said some applicants may have died years ago.\nThe report also says VA workers incorrectly marked thousands of unprocessed health-care applications as completed and may have deleted 10,000 or more electronic \"transactions\" over the past five years.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-02T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T23:40:43.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
