The baby orca was swimming with her mother L91, a 20-year-old orca. \nThe researchers were in the area conducting aerial measurements of the whales when they spotted the pair near Sooke, British Columbia. \nThe mother and calf spent most of Monday \"fishing\" in Haro Strait, just west of San Juan Island, and were later joined by J and K pod members. \nResearchers say they hope this year's 'baby boom' represents a turn-around in what has been a negative population trend in recent years. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
