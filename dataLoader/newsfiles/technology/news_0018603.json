But that is just about the only detail of the encounter on which the two companies can agree. \nMr Cheng says Mr Kalanick and his team were dripping with condescension. “We could tell from the way they looked at us — they thought of us as just another local taxi app from Sichuan,” he told an audience at the Yabuli summit, an internet forum, held last weekend. More Google under fire for India market abuse \nHe says Mr Kalanick ended with an ultimatum: sell us 40 per cent of your company or else face “embarrassing defeat” in a war with Uber. \n“I told him, ‘In 1840 when the first western powers arrived in China, they put forth a similar proposal. Give up Taiwan, open up Guangzhou, or else we will take the war all the way to the gates of the Forbidden City!’,” says Mr Cheng. \n“Foreign companies see China as a territory to be conquered,” he continued. \nUber says its “recollection of the conversation is very different”, adding that the meeting was “super friendly”. \nMr Kalanick has admitted to getting “passionate” in dealings with competitors in the past. Lyft, a US rival, has accused Uber of everything from poaching investors to clogging its system with fake orders. \n“I realise that I can come off as a somewhat fierce advocate for Uber,” he said in a speech in June. “I also realise that some have used a different ‘a’ word to describe me.” \nThe next few months will show whether Uber has bitten off more than it can chew in China. The country is notorious as a market that big US internet companies, from Amazon to eBay to Google, have all failed to crack, either due to being blocked outright or outmanoeuvred by a local competitor. \nLike the initial meeting between Mr Cheng and Mr Kalanick, how Uber is doing in China is a matter of perspective. The company says it has about 50 per cent market share in private taxi hailing, while Didi says it controls about 80 per cent of the market. \nBoth sides are also gunning for each other with massive subsidies — in June Uber said it would spend $1bn in China on subsidies and was logging 1m rides per day. Didi, meanwhile, raised $2bn in a funding round in June and has not yet said how the money will be spent. \nDing Daoshi, founder of Sootoo Research, a Beijing-based internet research group, says the phase of explosive growth for both companies may have passed. “The height of the cash-burning phase is over for both companies,” he says. “They are now focusing on their core customers — those in the cities whose demand does not disappear when it is more expensive.” Mumbai taxi drivers strike over Uber incursion \nCommuting in India’s congested financial capital of Mumbai was made even trickier when thousands of the city’s famous “black and yellow” taxi cabs went on strike on Tuesday against the growing threat posed by Uber and other ride-hailing services. \nContinue reading \nTo counter Didi’s local advantage — and raise more money to wage war — Uber has tried to go local, setting up Uber China. It is the only time the business has set up a separate company in a foreign market. It has tried to raise local finance, partly in an effort to build ties to China’s business establishment. \nBut Didi’s own funding round makes it clear that China’s establishment is closing ranks around its local champion. Even existing investors in Uber, such as Hillhouse Capital, are backing its competitor Didi in China. \nDidi’s local advantage is also clear to drivers, who say their counterparts at Uber face police discrimination — private taxis are technically illegal in China, but enforcement is selective, according to Mr Ding. “If the police pull you over, and you say you’re a Didi driver, they let you go. If you’re an Uber driver, you’re fined,” he says. \nAdditional reporting by April Ma Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:01:01.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
