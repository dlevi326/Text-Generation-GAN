With 3G service capabilities, the EnduroPro 3G allows users to avoid coverage gaps caused by the phase out of 2G services expected by mobile carriers over the next year. The Enduro Pro 3G tracker offers expanded territory coverage, particularly for those in remote, weak signal areas. The device is ideal for vehicle tracking, employee monitoring, asset tracking, and surveillance or covert tracking applications. A newly designed thumb-sized button with vibration confirmation on the front of the device serves as an easy-to-access, larger-sized panic button.\nWater resistant and durable, the Enduro Pro 3G offers superior sensitivity and faster times to first fix. Depending on the specific application and user preferences, the GPS tracker is capable of both real time and periodic tracking through a backend server.\nFor extended battery life, the new 3G tracking device includes a built-in 3-axis accelerometer for motion detection, allowing for power conservation when the device is stationary. Brighter LED indicators provide greater visibility for monitoring the status of the tracker day or night, and the Enduro Pro 3G comes with PTCRB, CE and FCC identification certifications. Full power management includes external DC power and battery operation.\nA Mini-Mag magnetic mounting device is available as an optional accessory for convenient mounting to any magnetic surface.\nTrackingTheWorld, based in Burlingame, California, has exclusively specialized in GPS tracking devices and GPS tracking software for more than 12-years.
