It said that after a two-month investigation it had taken action against a ‘co-ordinated group’ behind the frauds by barring 381 editor accounts and deleting 210 articles that they created. \nOne business hit by the scam was Hertfordshire-based holiday firm Quality Villas, where manager Dan Thompson had made his own attempts to establish a Wikipedia page. Thompson said he was contacted by someone he assumed worked for Wikipedia and told that, although his initial efforts ‘did not meet Wiki requirements’, they promised to ‘rewrite the content to make it acceptable and publish it’. \nThompson said: ‘Shortly afterwards, a modified version was posted online. The “editor” presented me with a charge of $400 (Raround R5,300) for the work. I duly paid this, then the posting online was deleted again. Maybe I was naive, but I suspect I am not alone.’ \nAnother victim was singer Paul Manners, a former contestant on Britain’s Got Talent. \nAlthough Wikipedia said the entries struck from the website as a result of the investigation were ‘generally promotional in nature’, the businesses and people concerned should be considered ‘victims’. \nIn a blog produced by the Wikipedia Foundation – which is behind the online encyclopaedia – Ed Erhart and Juliet Barbara said: ‘Although it does not happen often, undisclosed paid advocacy editing may represent a serious conflict of interest. – Daily Mail Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T10:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T20:34:54.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
