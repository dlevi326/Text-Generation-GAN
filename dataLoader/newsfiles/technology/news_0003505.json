Instead of sentencing it to a lonely existence in a desk drawer, there are plenty of ways to reuse, recycle or resell older phones. A nonprofit group called Cell Phones for Soldiers will take your \"gently used\" phone and sell it to a recycling company. The group also accepts other electronics such as laptops, video game systems and digital cameras. There will likely be a flood of the gadgets soon after people start getting their new phones, so it might make sense to wait a little. The video game retailer GameStop, meanwhile, offers cash or store credit for old iPhones (along with iPods and iPads). Bryan Ware is on a mission to take crayons that would normally be tossed out, recycle them and give them to kids who need them most.
