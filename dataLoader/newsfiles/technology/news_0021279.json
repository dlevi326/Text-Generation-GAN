The only caveat?\nJust four smartwatches can pair up with your iPhone: the Huawei Watch , Asus ZenWatch 2 , new Moto 360 and LG Watch Urbane. The second caveat is that only the Urbane is out.\nWe're currently testing out how well the LG smartwatch works with our iPhones and will update this review shortly. In the meantime, here's how to setup your LG Watch Urbane with iOS devices .\nOriginal review continued below...\nFrankly, LG's first smartwatch didn't offer much. Though, its second, the LG G Watch R , has proved to be far superior despite being a bit plasticky. It seems like the third time's a charm for LG, with the LG Watch Urbane looking the sleekest of the bunch.\nHowever, the Urbane is essentially a dressed up G Watch R with nearly identical dimensions and innards.\nWith more premium materials, the watch is, of course, going to cost more. Though at $349 (£259, AU$459) - the same price of the cheapest Apple Watch - it doesn't seem like LG is asking for too much. Still, you can pick up its predecessor for $100 less and pretty much have the same smartwatch.\nYou can now get the Watch Urbane for a little less than the original asking price, I found it online for $300, £230 - making it slightly more acceptable.\nPricing aside, the Urbane has a distinct look that's certainly polished, but it's clearly been tailored for a certain demographic. Despite images of women sporting a variation of the Urbane, it looks like this watch was made for businessmen. This isn't a huge problem, of course, but good luck getting women interested in wearing a chunky piece of metal and leather that won't fit right.\nThe Urbane has the advantage of being the first Android wearable with the latest Lollipop 5.1.1 software. But again, the other smartwatches will get updated soon, meaning there's really nothing special about the latest LG timepiece save for its style.\nDisplay\nThe LG Watch Urbane sports a 1.3-inch P-OLED display (320 x 320, 245ppi) which matches the LG G Watch R to a tee. The Urbane is also a bit smaller than its rounded rival, the Moto 360 , which comes in at 1.56-inches.\nLike the G Watch R, the Urbane's screen is lovely to stare at but sometimes looks pixelated, depending on which watch face you plop on the front. I found the Classic face had the most pixelation on the dial. The moons on the Moonphase face also look a little blotchy.\nPut it side by side with the Apple Watch and it's the Cupertino firm's timepiece which has the better screen, but on its own you're unlikely to have an issue with resolution.\nDirect sunlight is an issue for the Watch Urbane, as it is for the G Watch R, and I did find myself having to cup my hand round the device a few times to see what was on screen. Viewing angles meanwhile are more than acceptable, something is has over the Pebble Steel and Pebble Time .", "external_links": ["http://cdn1.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Watches/LG/LG%20Watch%20Urbane/Review/LG%20Watch%20Urbane_pixellated-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn0.beta.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg", "http://cdn2.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Watches/LG/LG%20Watch%20Urbane/Review/LG%20Watch%20Urbane_on%20wrist-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn1.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Watches/LG/LG%20Watch%20Urbane/Review/LG%20Watch%20Urbane_pixellated-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn2.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Watches/LG/LG%20Watch%20Urbane/Review/LG%20Watch%20Urbane_on%20wrist-650-80.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T01:49:35.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
