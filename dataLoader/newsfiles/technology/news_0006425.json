The buildings include the county's King Street Community Services building, law enforcement administration facility, juvenile detention center and correctional facility. Coconino County is buying the solar power generated by the systems through a 25-year power purchase agreement, and estimates that they will save $2.7 million over the life of the agreement. \"By powering their buildings with clean, cost effective solar power, Coconino County is saving taxpayer dollars and driving economic growth in the community,\" said Mark Domine , SunEdison senior director for channel sales. \" Coconino County is a leader in renewable energy, and these high performance SunEdison systems will ensure that the county is putting their abundant sunlight to good use.\" \"This solar project meets multiple county objectives: it saves taxpayer dollars through smart fiscal planning, improves county infrastructure, and demonstrates our leadership in the deployment of renewable energy technologies,\" said Art Babbott , Coconino County Board of Supervisors chair. \"We look forward to reaping the economic and environmental benefits of this partnership with SunEdison for years to come.\" The solar systems are expected to generate enough energy each year to power more than 190 homes and avoid the emission of more than 3 million pounds of carbon dioxide, the equivalent to taking 300 cars off the road. Operation and maintenance of the solar installations will be performed by SunEdison Services, which provides global asset management, monitoring and reporting services.

Forward Looking Statements This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements involve estimates, expectations, projections, goals, assumptions, known and unknown risks, and uncertainties and typically include words or variations of words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"seek,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"goal,\" \"guidance,\" \"outlook,\" \"objective,\" \"forecast,\" \"target,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"would,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" or \"may\" or other comparable terms and phrases. All statements that address operating performance, events, or developments that SunEdison expects or anticipates will occur in the future are forward-looking statements. They may include estimates of expected cash available for distribution (CAFD), earnings, revenues, capital expenditures, liquidity, capital structure, future growth, and other financial performance items (including future dividends per share), descriptions of management's plans or objectives for future operations, products, or services, or descriptions of assumptions underlying any of the above. Forward-looking statements provide SunEdison's current expectations or predictions of future conditions, events, or results and speak only as of the date they are made. Although SunEdison believes its expectations and assumptions are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these expectations and assumptions will prove to have been correct and actual results may vary materially. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, a variety of economic, competitive, and regulatory factors, many of which are beyond SunEdison's control and are described in SunEdison's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 , as well as additional factors it may describe from time to time in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and, consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. SunEdison disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, or expectations, new information, data, or methods, future events, or other changes, except as required by law.
