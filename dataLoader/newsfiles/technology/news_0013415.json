Fellow board member Dana Evan was formerly the chief financial officer at Verisign and is currently a venture partner at Icon Ventures.\nThis is Ms Whitman’s first external board appointment since she took charge at HP in 2011 and a reunion of sorts with SurveyMonkey chief executive Bill Veghte, who left HP in June after completing a five-year stint. He had previously spent close to two decades at Microsoft.\nMr Veghte joined SurveyMonkey in August following the passing of former CEO Dave Goldberg in May.\n“I have followed SurveyMonkey for many years,” Ms Whitman said.\n“I’ve also worked closely with several of the current board members and there is a tremendously experienced and talented team in place.”\nThe company, which started in 1999, has been busy adding more strings to its bow in recent times, especially when it comes to enhancing its product portfolio. It acquired TechValidate, a web-based software platform that gives customers the ability to publish marketing content from their survey findings, soon after the appointment of Mr Veghte.\nThe company has also launched its SurveyMonkey benchmarks offering -- where organisations can compare their performance against peers, competitors and companies of similar size -- in April.\nAustralia is one of the first countries outside of the US to have access to all of SurveyMonkey’s products. The platform's current list of high-profile customers includes Qantas, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, BHP Billiton and Hocking Stuart.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T05:44:25.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
