ACCEO Solutions and its employees have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for children from vulnerable communities, and we're very proud of our commitment to the Fondation and of the participation of our teams,\" explained Gilles Létourneau, president and CEO of ACCEO Solutions, who himself took part in the final relay. \nLast year, the Course pour les enfants ACCEO raised nearly $40 000. In 2013, nearly $30 000 was donated at the first edition of the race. This increase is in keeping with ACCEO Solutions' desire to focus its social commitment on children's causes in order to maximize the impact of its charitable activities. The funds raised will mainly gotowards the development of the Main dans la Main CSPC (community social pediatrics centre) in Cowansville , which opened its doors in June 2014 . Part of the money will also go to the other centres which participated in the Course pour les enfants ACCEO, as well as to the Fondation du Dr Julien. There are currently 18 community social pediatrics centres throughout Quebec . Their mission, in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, is to give all children in vulnerable environments the chance to realize their full potential. \n\"ACCEO Solutions has become an invaluable partner of the Fondation and has found a unique and powerful way to help collect funds in order to better raise awareness of our mission, while involving its employees as well. We're very grateful to them,\" said Dr. Gilles Julien . \nDoing the Race Solo: One Runner Stands Out Joan Roch , a well-known ultramarathoner and ACCEO Solutions employee, ran the entire distance between Québec and Montreal (over 250 km) on his own. Having just recently returned from the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc at the end of August, Joan was certainly pushing his limits by participating in the Course. \"Québec- Montreal was a real challenge, but Dr. Julien's cause is one that deserves our best efforts. I gave my very best, and I'd like to thank everyone who generously contributed to this fundraising event,\" said Joan Roch , who in a few weeks will be running in the Grand Raid de l'île de la Réunion. \nAbout ACCEO Solutions \nLeading Canadian IT company ACCEO Solutions specializes in the design, implementation, integration, and support of management software; e-business development; and payment, professional, and technical services.
