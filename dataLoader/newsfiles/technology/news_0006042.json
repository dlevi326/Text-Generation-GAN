Stephen Shankland/CNET\nYour smartphone is putting your privacy at risk, and the people who made it aren't doing enough to protect you. That's the warning from the makers of Sikur GranitePhone, a new security-focused smartphone which is available to pre-order today.\nAs our world becomes more connected, maintaining our security and privacy become increasingly fraught with difficulty. With illegal hackers and even our own governments working to get their grubby mitts on our data and communications, our privacy is under attack from many directions. Well-known brands have reacted by beefing up the security of their devices, as Samsung's done with its Knox system. But there's still space for phones like the GranitePhone and the Silent Circle Blackphone , which were designed with security as a priority.\nThese phones may be more useful for businesses and governments than they are for the regular phone owner, but Frederico d'Avila, CEO of Sikur, says the bigger brands aren't doing enough. \"They do not always care about security,\" he told CNET, \"as we saw in the news recently with issues with the Apple Store.\" Apple was last week forced to remove a number of apps from its App Store as they had been used to sneak in malware. \"I don't think they are doing enough,\" he continued. \"That's why we came to that place, to help the customer to have that right solution for their privacy. They're not looking to security as we do, because we're living for that.\"\nSikur's secure GranitePhone plan (pictures)", "external_links": ["http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/03/03/735cef6f-4a9d-4205-ad8b-dc1b9c7597fd/resize/270xauto/c53dd0de112c4e0bee829de6936f24dd/20150303-sikur-granite-phone-mwc15-003.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-29T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:10:25.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
