This includes support for video uploads on Twitch which is without doubt the biggest of the announcements of the event's keynote. \nWhat this means is that Twitch users can upload prerecorded videos to Twitch similarly to how videos are uploaded on YouTube currently. \nThis puts Twitch in direct competition with YouTube and while Twitch's content is limited to gaming, it is very likely that many content creators will upload their videos to Twitch and not only to YouTube once the feature becomes available. \nWhile Google is busy adding streaming features to YouTube to compete with Twitch, Twitch is adding video upload and management features to its service to compete with YouTube on that level as well. \nIt will be interesting to see how this evolves over time. Will gamers move completely to Twitch or YouTube, or will they upload videos and do broadcasts on both services? \nOther features of interest are options for broadcasters to create video playlists, a fully revamped conversations module and the ditching of Adobe Flash in favor of HTML5 video which will happen in 2016 on the platform. \nYou can watch a recording of the keynote by following this link . \nNow You : What's your take on this? Does Twitch stand a chance against Google and YouTube when it comes to pre-recorded videos?
