The presentation entitled “The True Cost of Using End-of-Life Software” will explore whether or not it’s worth the risk of not migrating to new versions of operating systems and other business software when they become obsolete. The webinar is set for Friday, September 25, 2015. “Being comfortable with the software you use to run your business is important,” said Scott Gorcester, CEO, VirtualQube. “Most businesses stick with what’s comfortable and avoid the expense of updating systems. We can take a good look at the software being used now, then help businesses assess their level of comfort and the possible risks and costs.”\nAccording to research group IDC, there’s a 60% chance business computers will be infected with a virus using unsupported software. Other risks include compliance penalties, revenue loss and downtime. VirtualQube’s free webinar and complimentary audit will help participants learn where they stand with their operating systems, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, and other business software.\nTo learn more about VirtualQube and how to join its free webinar, please visit http://www.virtualqube.com or call 425.939.2700.\nAbout VirtualQube\nVirtualQube is a managed IT service provider (MSP) based near Seattle, Washington.
