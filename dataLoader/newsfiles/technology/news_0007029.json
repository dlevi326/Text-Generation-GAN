But that is changing, says one ad tech vendor. \nSpotX platform and global supply SVP Sean Buckley says \"programmatic\" and \"direct\" sales channels are coming together. \n\"We're starting to see those two worlds converge, our platforms customers interacting with buyers on deal terms, talking to the same folks that used to hand them an (insertion order) and are now leveraging their own first-party data, third-party data, verification and measurement vendors,\" he tells Beet.TV in this video interview. \nThat trend is being borne out in SpotX's own company, which just rebranded from several years as \"SpotXchange\". \n\"Private marketplaces have been a huge area of growth from us. Over 40% of the activity on the platform is through private deals,\" Buckley says. \n\"(The rebrand) helps tell the story about how our company has grown and evolved over the last few years. We, of course, originated as an ad exchange but now our product portfolio encompasses much more than that.\" \nThis video is part of series: Programmatic Video at a Turning Point, presented by SpotX .
