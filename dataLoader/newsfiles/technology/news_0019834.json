Twenty years later, the pendulum has swung the other way and returning manufacturers needing to move raw materials and finished goods are fueling demand for On the Move Systems’ ( OMVS ) upcoming Uber-for-Trucking shared economy platform. \nDistance, speed and cost are among the factors feeding de-globalization and re-shoring. Moving manufacturing offshore has created lengthy supply chains that have proved difficult to manage and maintain. Second, extended globalization has made it harder for companies to react quickly to changing market conditions . Finally, labor and energy costs in China and other once-cheap markets have increased, making them less desirable. As a result, manufacturers are increasingly moving or considering moving operations back to the United States for greater cost and quality control . \n“Bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. is not only good for America but for trucking as well,” said OMVS CEO Robert Wilson. “As manufacturing returns, the demand for trucking services also rises, which means national trucking companies have a greater need to connect with local drivers, and vice-versa, to optimize routes and schedules. The growing re-shoring trend can therefore greatly strengthen our shared economy business plan as our upcoming on-demand platform will enable truckers to make the best possible use of resources.” \nOMVS’s cutting-edge shared economy platform will enable truckers to not only build networks , but maximize equipment utilization , recruit drivers and effectively price their services . Shared economy services are estimated to be a $450 billion market . \nFor more information on OMVS, please visit www.onthemovesystems.com . \nAbout On the Move Systems, Inc. \nOn the Move Systems, Inc.
