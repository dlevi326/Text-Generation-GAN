It’s refreshing.\n“The Australia of the future has to be a nation that is agile, that is innovative, that is creative. We can’t be defensive; we can’t future-proof ourselves,” he said.\n“We have to recognise that the disruption that we see driven by technology, the volatility in change is our friend if we are agile and smart enough to take advantage of it.”\nThe explosion of technology across business and the arrival of smartphones and cloud tech are generating entirely new industries as well as some of the highest paid jobs in the world. Australia is in a great position to capitalise on this opportunity and build a strong and vibrant tech industry, but we need to break down the unnecessary compliance hurdles that exist today and offer more opportunities for these innovative startups to raise the capital needed to get going.\nThe good news is that Turnbull understands this. Earlier this year he commented on the need for Australia to take note of how the New Zealand government had gone about generating momentum in their tech sector.\n“While crowdsourced equity fundraising is technically legal in Australia, the associated compliance and considerable regulatory hurdles mean it is rarely undertaken by young technology companies that require growth capital,” Turnbull said earlier this year .\nAs Australia transitions out of a mining-led economy, the nation needs a Prime Minister who can demonstrate leadership during this process and spot the next economic brightspots.\nThat means significantly investing in science and engineering skills, emerging technologies and the renewable energy industry.\nBefore Turnbull was a politician, he was a businessman. He understands the needs of small business and by bringing real, commercial experience to the role of Prime Minister, it will boost the government’s economic credibility.\nHe also gets the tech sector having been an early investor in Ozemail back the late 90s where he made his fortune.\nHis passion for tech start-ups was evident to me in 2013 when I had the opportunity to present with him at a digital business conference . In a conversation that followed the event, he was clearly interested in not only Xero’s trajectory in the Australian market, but also the burgeoning ecosystem of innovative cloud add-ons that were benefitting from Xero’s success as more and more small businesses were moving to the cloud.\nSo it’s great to have someone as Prime Minister who gets it, has done it, and remains passionate about the plight of the tech start-up in this country.\nHe's breathed life into the communications portfolio and understands the needs of the technology industry. We've already seen some moves through the Digital Transformation Office, which Turnbull led, but it's fair to say there's a long way to go.\nMore needs to be done to accelerate the rollout of NBN to create equality for regional locations where there is a huge opportunity to stimulate these local economies with innovative businesses, but are being held back by the lack of internet bandwidth.\nWe also need a more aggressive agenda for government to adopt cloud and web services before citizens and businesses can interact with government seamlessly, online.\nDeveloping a culture of open government is important and something Turnbull has already noted, less than 24 hours in.\n“There are a few things more important in any organisation than its culture,” he said.\n“The culture of our leadership is going to be one that is thoroughly consultative...we make decisions in a collaborative manner.”\nI would like to see Turnbull transition the way his party works so a case for change is built and decisions are not made on the basis or power or captain’s calls. Turnbull believes in transparency. He’s a great statesman and communicator, I hope that filters down through the ranks.\nWhile I don’t expect Turnbull to fundamentally change the way politics or politicians act and behave, I would like to see more business acumen applied to our parliamentary and political processes.\nI’m sure I am not the only one who ponders “if that happened in the business world, they’d be sacked”. Especially after the recent politician expenses scandal which saw former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop resign when it was revealed she billed taxpayers for a $5,000 80-kilometre helicopter flight.\nTurnbull has an opportunity to bring some of the leadership qualities that make an impact in the real world and apply these to running a country, much the way you’d want a great leader to run a business.\nFrom a policy standpoint, the government was heading in the right direction on providing support to small businesses and start-ups through tax deductions and support for equity crowdfunding, but we need to understand the distinction between the two types of businesses and why one-size-fits-all policies won't work.\nAnd while we welcome attempts in the budget to stimulate investment in the small business sector, most of the tech industry agrees that education and skills are critical in the long term to build a sustainable technology sector in this country.\nFor Turnbull to push Australia’s economy forward, he will need to focus on longer term solutions to capitalise on the opportunities the tech industry can deliver. This will include investing in computer education and STEM skills from a primary school level to develop a world-class tech workforce in Australia.\nChris Ridd is Xero Australia managing director.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/technology/malcolm-turnbull-says-australia-could-follow-new-zealand-crowdfunding-laws-20150517-gh3rur#ixzz3lmgyFEbb", "https://www.xero.com/blog/2013/10/sparking-technology-innovation/"], "published": "2015-09-16T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T07:29:49.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
