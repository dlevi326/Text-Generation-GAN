Broadcast Pix ? will debut its upgraded Flint? integrated production switcher line at IBC2015 (Stand 7.B21), which runs Sept. 11-15 at Amsterdam RAI. Designed to manage live production from ingest to distribution, the new Flint is available with four (Flint LX) or six inputs (Flint LS), and includes several new workflow enhancements. All of Flint?s video inputs are now available as SDI and HDMI, with one input also supporting analog video. Audio has also been improved. The system supports embedded SDI or HDMI audio from any input, and one input can alternately use four balanced analog or two AES/EBU inputs. Source audio can be mixed with clips in the built-in clip stores using Flint?s exclusive internal eight-channel audio mixer, which is controlled through an intuitive interface with on-screen stereo faders and VU meters. ?When we introduced Flint in 2013, we knew it was an ideal tool for streaming video . Now, broadcasters and other live video producers have also embraced its end-to-end integration as well,? explained Steve Ellis, CEO of Broadcast Pix. ?With all its integrated tools, Flint makes it easy for someone with very little training to create sophisticated live productions using a touch screen or tablet. It?s a powerful all-in-one video production system, and these latest upgrades provide improved audio and video input flexibility and functionality.? The multi-format switcher supports a variety of HD and SD cameras simultaneously, as well as cloud-based content from Dropbox, Twitter, and other resources. Flint ingests and scales all sources while maintaining constant lip sync. Both new models also include three key layers, two clip channels with storage for up to 60 hours of clips and animations, and an internal CG with six graphic channels. Flint can simultaneously output up to six video formats. Flint systems feature built-in HD streaming and live program recording to its internal hard drive. Plus, Flint includes Broadcast Pix?s Fluent Control toolset with a customizable multi-view, file-based macros, advanced ClearKey chromakeyer, and control of external devices such as robotic cameras and video servers. Control options include a choice of three different Broadcast Pix control panels, touch screens, iPad or Android tablets, or keyboard and mouse. New Version 5 software, which was announced last month, adds new source control moves and enhanced Virtual Sets with multi-angle sets and zoom capability. All Flint inputs now auto-sense every input and include new format support for improved ease of use. Plus, new controls for Sony IP-based PTZ cameras and Matrox Monarch HD streamer/recorder appliances enhance Fluent Control. Other upgrades announced earlier this year include a Show Transfer Utility that allows organizations to back up and move all elements of a program ? including graphics, clips, and macros ? between Broadcast Pix systems for consistency and redundancy. PixPlay adds slow motion support for Blackmagic Design and AJA Video Systems disk recorders to the production switcher for simple reviewing stations. The refreshed Flint LX and LS models will ship in September, with prices starting at $9,995.
