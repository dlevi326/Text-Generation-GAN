These are all old games released more than 10 years ago but still playable on modern systems. \nThe security bulletin itself mentions that the update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office and Lync which attackers could exploit to run code remotely on affected systems. \nThe description on Microsoft's Knowledge Base adds that the security bulletin \"addresses a defense-in-depth update for the secdrv.sys driver, a third-party driver\" by turning the service for the driver off. \nThe driver secdrv.sys is used by Macrovision's SafeDisc copy protection scheme. \nThis has the consequence that games that rely on Safedisc won't work anymore on all systems the patch was installed on. \nThe same Knowledge Base articles offers a workaround to play these games on patched systems again. The caveat is that doing so will render the systems vulnerable again. Microsoft states explicitly that it does not recommend the workaround because of this. \nThe workaround requires that you start the driver before you play games that require Securom and stop it again the moment you are finished playing these games. \nAll commands require an elevated command prompt. On Windows 8 press Windows-X, and select Command Prompt (admin) from the context menu. In earlier versions of Windows, tap on the Windows-key, type cmd.exe, right-click on the result and select \"run as administrator\". \nTo start the service manually \nRun the command sc start secdrv which starts the service if it is installed on the system. \nTo stop the service manually \nRun the command sc stop secdrv which stops it immediately so that the system is no longer vulnerable to attacks. \nMicrosoft has released instructions on how to make the changes permanent. While that is more convenient than having to run these commands before each game session, it makes the system vulnerable to attacks again. \nPlease note that the service is only installed on the system if a game that required the DRM was installed on it. \nWindows 10, Microsoft's newest operating system won't run games requiring SecuROM or SafeDisc as well because of security loopholes they may introduce on the system. Summary Microsoft update breaks Safedisc games on Windows Vista, 7 and 8 Author Martin Brinkmann Description A recent security update for Windows 8 and earlier versions of Windows rendered games relying on SafeDisc DRM unplayable on those systems.
