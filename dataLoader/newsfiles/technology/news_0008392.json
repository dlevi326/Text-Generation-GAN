However, Facebook says it is a gateway to access internet and not a gatekeeper.Martin said that Facebook is looking forward to launching a special Wi-Fi service in India which will help subsidise cost of accessing Internet.\"We also have our connectivity lab which is looking at drones and unmanned aerial vehicle to lower the cost of service to people without infrastructure. We are rolling out a kind of Wi-Fi service at a lower cost which is trying to adjust cost issue in other countries and looking out to do that in India,\" Martin said.\"The only limitation for any developer to participate (in internet.org) is that it has to be structured so that it uses limited amount of bandwidth,\" Martin said.He said that Facebook also has different set up for its own service that it provides through internet.org.\"It doesn't have any advertising, videos on it so that users can fully utilise it and at the same time do not use too much bandwidth,\" Martin said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T12:31:53.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
