That means I'll be at @Macys downtown Brooklyn in 3 days!!!! \n\"That didn't stop the NAVY from getting a head start to the front of the line at 6am today!!! Lol!! Yall are too trill!! I can't wait to see you on MONDAY!!\" More Technology Industry News  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:17:01.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
