But even after axing more than 25,000 jobs, it's still the third biggest tech employer.\nHP, the struggling computer hardware and services company, ended fiscal 2014 with 302,000 employees - putting it just behind International Business Machines (IBM) and computer services firm Accenture (ACN) with the largest headcounts in the tech sector, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ. IBM ended fiscal 2014 with more than 379,000 workers and Accenture with with 305,000.\nGiven the challenges, investors probably aren't all that surprised to hear HP is taking out another 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its enterprise division.\nUSA TODAY\nHewlett Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs from enterprise unit\nWhat is concerning is that the job cuts keep coming - and this latest one is the biggest year. Cutting 25,000 jobs would take out 8% of the total jobs at the end of fiscal 2014. And that comes after years and years of pain. HP has cut jobs for three years in a row including a 5.1% cut in fiscal 2012, 4% cut in fiscal 2013 4.8% in fiscal 2014.\nHP has been cutting jobs annually for years. (Photo: S&P Capital IQ, USA TODAY)\nInvestors don't seem too concerned. Shares are down 51 cents, or 1.9%, to $26.60 in afterhours trading after the announcement was made. But then again, seems like annual job cuts are just to be expected at HP.\nTECH COMPANIES WITH LARGEST TOTAL EMPLOYEES AT END OF FISCAL 2014\nCompany, Symbol, Total employees\nInternational Business Machines, IBM, 379,592\nAccenture, ACN, 305,000\nHewlett-Packard, HPQ, 302,000\nCognizant Technology, CTSH, 211,500\nXerox, XRX, 147,500\nJabil Circuit, JBL, 142,000\nMicrosoft, MSFT, 128,000\nConvergys, CVG, 125,000\nOracle, ORCLE, 122,000\nIntel, INTC, 106,700\nSource: S&P Capital IQ, USA TODAY\n2 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1UTC0bo TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dcc982e8ed28edbe24141c93759ed7448c9e2642/c=58-0-965-682&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635779346676690304-493360707-75925668.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635779346676690304-493360707-75925668.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1UTC0bo", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/96aa99708edef136c70c0f9cd42ef9513d1a0038/c=0-0-399-300&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635779351756550867-capture.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635779346676690304-493360707-75925668.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c6812688b24251cf087c8e03ab9798cb08726248/c=0-67-1023-645&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/02/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635604008258873199-AX034-573A-9.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UTC0bo&mini=true", "http://player.theplatform.com/p/gZWlPC/cnbc_global?playertype=synd&ssid=cnbc_usa_today_ros_vod&byGuid=3000421136&size=530_298", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UTC0bo&text=HP%20is%20still%20tech%27s%20third%20largest%20employer&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-09-16T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T00:47:58.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
