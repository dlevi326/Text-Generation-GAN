Announces Industry Changing Enhancement to the Yodil Platform Reduces Development Costs by up to 40% September 02, 2015 10:26 AM Eastern Daylight Time \nCHARLOTTE, N.C.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Yodil Inc., a leading provider of Enterprise Data Management solutions to the insurance industry; including its enterprise data warehouse (EDW), business intelligence (BI), data analytics, data governance, and reporting solutions announced industry changing enhancements to its platform with the addition of the Map2Code (M2C) product. These recent developments enable clients to quickly move their source data to a target data warehouse using their business analyst team, dramatically reducing the time, cost and risk associated with these project efforts. \nCustomers have been asking to integrate data into warehouse’s, ODS’s, etc. in a way that would be quicker, less costly and reduce the risk of data errors. M2C speeds up the iterative mapping and development process, leverages existing ETL tools to speed the coding process, achieving up to a 40% efficiency in cost and schedule reductions. Specifically, M2C improves communication of business rules and rule changes, limits complexity of technical ETL development and auto generates lineage metadata. \nFrederick Waite, Yodil’s CEO, shared, “CIO’s are constantly being asked to do more with less. M2C gives them the ability to deliver for their business more quickly while reducing errors due to poor communication with development teams.” \nAviva Philips, Yodil’s SVP of Products added, “Without such capabilities the dreaded ‘time bandits’ will continue to take their toll on staff and other resources involved in turning data into information. M2C enables more effective communication and collaboration between business analysts and developers, reducing the time and effort typically spent on testing and debugging. M2C brings efficiency to the most labor and time intensive efforts in making quality data available for analysis.” \nAbout Yodil, Inc. \nYodil, Inc. is a leading provider of Enterprise Data Management software, offering Business Intelligence (BI), Data Warehousing, Data Quality, and Data Governance solutions for property and casualty, workers compensation, and specialty lines of insurance.
