The theatre’s new sound system will launch at the festival’s 40th anniversary with the Twentieth Century Fox title The Martian, directed by Ridley Scott; Every Thing Will Be Fine, directed by Wim Wenders; and the Elevation Pictures title Hyena Road, directed by Paul Gross, all delivering the immersive cinematic experience that audiences worldwide have come to expect from the Dolby Atmos format. \nEvery Thing Will Be Fine will play in Dolby Atmos and Dolby ® 3D at 9:45 a.m. EDT on September 13; Hyena Road will play in Dolby Atmos at 1:30 p.m. EDT on September 15; and The Martian will play in Dolby Atmos at 6:00 p.m. EDT on September 18, all at TIFF Bell Lightbox, Cinema 2. From then on, moviegoers can enhance their immersion in future films at TIFF Bell Lightbox, Cinema 2, with a permanent installation of Dolby Atmos technology. Dolby Atmos breathes life into storytelling by allowing filmmakers the creative freedom to easily arrange sounds anywhere in the movie theatre, even overhead, with amazing richness and depth. \n“Dolby has always been a strong advocate for independent filmmakers and continues to support their vision to bring immersive sound into their creative work,” said Vince Voron, Vice President, Executive Creative Director, Dolby Laboratories. “With the permanent installation of Dolby Atmos at TIFF Bell Lightbox, all filmmakers will have a unique venue to exhibit their movies and provide audiences a lifelike cinema sound experience.” \nEvery Thing Will Be Fine tells the tragic story of a writer named Tomas, who drives aimlessly around the outskirts of town after a trivial domestic quarrel, and accidentally hits and kills a child. Will he be able to move on? \nIn the Elevation Pictures title Hyena Road, the first Canadian title to be produced in Dolby Atmos, three different men, three different worlds, three different wars stand at the intersection of modern warfare—a murky world of fluid morality where all is not as it seems. \n“In the heart of modern warfare, Dolby Atmos captures and accentuates the sounds of crisis,” said Paul Gross, writer-director of Hyena Road. “Our team was incredibly excited to create a totally immersive sound landscape that underscores the essence of Hyena Road. ” \nThe Twentieth Century Fox title The Martian takes a dangerous journey in space. During a manned mission to Mars, astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit, and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. \nThe Dolby Institute will host a panel discussion on immersive storytelling through sound, featuring Hyena Road as a case study , at TIFF Bell Lightbox, Cinema 2. On September 16 at 10:30 a.m. EDT, Glenn Kiser, Director of the Dolby Institute, will present a clip in Dolby Atmos and moderate a discussion on the sound design and music of Hyena Road. Panelists will include director-writer and actor Paul Gross and members of the film’s sound and music creative teams. Access is available to accredited TIFF Industry delegates. \nAbout Dolby Atmos \nDolby Atmos delivers moving audio—sound that can be precisely placed and moved anywhere in three-dimensional space, including overhead.
