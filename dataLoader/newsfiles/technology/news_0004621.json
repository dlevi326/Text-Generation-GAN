U.S. officials said Friday that the screening will end Monday for passengers from Liberia. But the screening and monitoring will continue for travelers from Guinea and Sierra Leone. The screening of travelers from the three West African nations began last October when the countries were in the midst of the worst Ebola epidemic in world history. But the epidemic has waned. International health officials this month said the Ebola virus is no longer spreading in Liberia. Travelers from Liberia will no longer be funneled through only five U.S. airports, either, unless they've been in Guinea or Sierra Leone in the previous three weeks. Liberia will continue to screen passengers for Ebola as they leave the country.
