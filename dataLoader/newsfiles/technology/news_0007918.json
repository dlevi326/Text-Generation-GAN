RELATED ï»¿BENGALURU: The third edition of Google's popular mentoring programme -- Launchpad Week -- begins in Bengaluru on Monday. The five-day programme for early-stage startups is focused on mentorship in areas such as product strategy , UX (users experience) and UI (user interface), marketing, business development and presentation skills. The event will conclude with a demo day where the startups will make a pitch to VCs and investors. Launchpad Week is held in several cities around the world on a regular basis, including Tel Aviv, Barcelona, Paris, Berlin and London. Sixteen startups have been shortlisted for the third edition of the Bengaluru event, from 50 startups that were recommended by venture and angel investors. \"We found many me too companies in Bengaluru, hence we have inducted startups from Mumbai, Chennai and other cities too. This edition of Launchpad has a combination of B2B and B2C startups that are looking for market validation before deploying additional resources into the startup. A majority of them have a minimum viable product, while others have a product release roadmap over the next 2-3 weeks,\" said Sunil Rao, country head of developer relations and startup ecosystem at Google India. Selected startups include city-based SlamdunQ, a wearable technology company focused on enhancing sports performance. Founded in August last year by Madhuvanti, Venkat Ramachandran and Sakhee Mody , its first application, Slam dunQ Cricket, is aimed at helping bowlers improve skills. The company, incubated at Sasken, develops apps for wearable devices in sports, healthcare and fashion. \"We are helping individuals improve their game through guiding inputs and a tech platform without requiring a physical coach,\" said Madhuvanti, who took care of digital marketing for IPL's RCB team. LightMetrics' smartphone-based driver monitoring solution gives a 360-degree view of driving behaviour by providing visual context to driving data. Enterprises on its platform are able to accurately monitor their fleets. Soumik Ukil, principal researcher at Nokia Technologies, and 5 colleagues started the company in November last. The company has piloted their solution with taxi aggregators and delivery startups. \"It's a second wave of entrepreneurship where founders are coming from big startups like Flipkart and not necessarily from firms like Infosys or Wipro,\" Rao said.
