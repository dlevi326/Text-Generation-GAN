Together, the software platforms will provide in-place and real-time visibility into an organization’s data storage systems, as well as the automated classification and management of sensitive unstructured information. This level of insight and control will enhance cyber security protections in several important ways:\n Preparedness: RG proactively defends against cyber security threats by identifying sensitive data and moving it to the most secure storage locations. RG can also identify and delete records that should no longer exist. Detection: Sentinel detects and alerts administrators to suspicious system behavior proactively. Validation: RG will enhance the capabilities of Sentinel by allowing it to leverage content classifications to improve threat detection (focusing it on where sensitive data resides) and triage alert protocols. Remediation: RG improves baseline security by attaching document classifications to each document; these tags will allow existing data loss prevention (DLP) tools, firewalls, email gateways, proxy servers, etc. to leverage sophisticated document classification to protect the most sensitive documents. Response: RG and Sentinel provide immediate, definitive answers to the troubling questions that arise following a data breach, like “what data was lost,” “how was it lost,” and “what is our exposure?”\n“As the number of data breaches continues to rise and organizations become increasingly concerned about the reputational and financial harm resulting from inadvertent disclosures, now the ideal time for a solution that truly addresses the problem, while acknowledging that breaches will happen no matter how many security controls are in place” said Mike McCutcheon, Rational’s Chief Solution Officer.\n“Together, Rational and CounterTack will be able to provide a completely unique service to organizations; our combined analytics to identify both sensitive content and unusual behavior will create an early warning system for our clients and their entire vertical,” said Avi Legmann, CounterTack’s Senior VP of Business Development.\nAbout CounterTack | MCSI\nCounterTack | MCSI is the leading provider of real-time, Big Data endpoint detection and response technology for the enterprise.
