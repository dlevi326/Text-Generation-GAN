A short-term fix, for users who can access the net through another means, is to switch their DNS server to Google Public DNS, following the company’s own instructions .\nThe issue at the heart of the malfunction is the domain name system, the technology that converts a web address such as “theguardian.com” into the IP address such as “77.91.252.10”, which tells the computer the actual location of the server it is trying to connect to. DNS acts like a phone book, linking the name to the number, and when the DNS server is down, as with Plusnet, machines cannot tell where a URL is telling them to connect.\nSwitching to Google’s public DNS, which has the memorable IP address “8.8.8.8”, replaces Plusnet’s DNS servers with Google’s own, which are still working.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Plusnet/statuses/641893683416186880", "https://twitter.com/Plusnet/status/641893683416186880", "https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using"], "published": "2015-09-10T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T17:21:51.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
