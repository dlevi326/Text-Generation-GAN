Construction on the Euclid Creek Tunnel started in 2011. The tunnel has a diameter of 24 feet, and will have the capacity to hold 61 million gallons of combined storm water and waste water.\nThe tunnel runs 190 to 220 feet below ground from Bratenahl to the sewer district's Easterly Wastewater Treatment Plant. From there, the tunnel runs under Lake Erie, passes under the shoreline at East 156th Street, and follows Lake Shore Boulevard and Nottingham Road, terminating at St. Clair Avenue.\nThe tunnel will become fully operational upon completion of the Tunnel Dewatering Pump Station in 2016.\nThe tunnel project was originally budgeted to cost $198 million, but closed Thursday at about $3.6 million under budget, according to a prepared release.\n\"Our engineering and construction team worked diligently to complete this project under budget,\" said Kellie Rotunno, the sewer district's chief operating officer.\n\"The Euclid Creek Tunnel sets a new financial benchmark as we continue to identify cost-savings and save our customers money.\"\nProject Clean Lake has realized $330 million in savings since its inception, according to the district's news release. The savings are credited to value engineering, contract management and a highly competitive bidding environment.\n\"This tunnel system will keep hundreds of millions of gallons of combined sewage out of Lake Erie each year,\" said CEO Julius Ciaccia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T05:35:53.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
