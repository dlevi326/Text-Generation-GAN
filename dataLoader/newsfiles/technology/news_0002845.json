This acquisition is for a strategic buyer that can incorporate the infrastructure and capitalize on its technology to expand in the sales, marketing or data services industry. Fraud cost online retailers an estimated $3.5B last year and will likely continue to increase. It is clear that for a business to continue to grow and remain profitable online, the quality and accuracy of the data they collect from their online websites must be protected from bad data, whether fraudulent in nature or simply user error. This business specializes in one thing...confirming the connect status of a phone number. Their suite of products and services is designed to manage and address the growing problem of bad contact data collected online, whether phone or email. Unlike most phone validation services that simply check phone numbers against telecom provided databases - this company developed custom telephone technology that actually silently touches the phone number to verify if the number is connected, disconnected, or busy in real-time. This real-time testing of the ''connect-ability'' of a phone number delivers industry leading accuracy of up to 98% vs. the industry norm of 80% or less. This company's unique library of software and technologies are primed to provide continued growth in revenue and profitability delivering on the current set of products & services offered or may be used to augment the existing services of a strategic buyer already in the sales, marketing or data services industry.
