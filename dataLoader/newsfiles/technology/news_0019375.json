WiFi Debate Is Really About", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Unlicensed spectrum is quickly becoming a hot topic as the fate of a next-generation technology called LTE-U emerges to meet increasing demand speed and functionality on wireless networks. On the one hand, WiFi proponents want to preserve as much unlicensed spectrum as they can for WiFi service, and on the other, wireless carriers want the ability to innovate to improve their customers’ experience. The technologies have different markets and use cases and can co-exist. The good news, preserving Wi-Fi and improving wireless customers experience, is readily achievable if we can move away from the rhetoric and stick to facts. LTE-U or LTE–unlicensed is an emerging technology designed to alleviate congestion on wireless networks by off-loading some wireless traffic, which operates on licensed spectrum, to unlicensed spectrum. Anyone with any technology can take advantage of unlicensed spectrum. The use of unlicensed spectrum has flourished without regulation and can continue. Many technologies operate on unlicensed spectrum whether it is Bluetooth or baby monitors, and LTE-U won’t change that. The dominant users of WiFi, mainly Google and cable companies, see LTE-U differently. They claim that LTE-U will block access to WiFi, creating a “looming disaster” for their business models. In reality, LTE-U has been tested and proven to co-exist with Wi-Fi. In fact LTE-U may be a better neighbor to Wi-Fi than Wi-Fi is to itself. The Japanese are already a year ahead on this, showing that LTE-U is 1.6 times more bandwidth efficient than WiFi, meaning that users of LTE-U can share the spectrum nicely with WiFi users.The argument in favor of WiFi is that it offers low barriers to entry for innovators, given that they don’t have to purchase spectrum and license LTE patents. However, despite what some people think, WiFi isn’t exactly free. It is still built with real world equipment and wires that costs real money. Moreover, we the people are essentially the owners of the unlicensed spectrum commons. We do not get a check from the profits earned by the companies who deploy their business across WiFi. Naturally Google is an outsized player in the WiFi commons. The master of deploying “free” technologies on top of someone else’s investment, Google, is leading the charge to maintain WiFi as is so that it can deploy a global mobile communication system without having to purchase spectrum.WiFi is not a perfect technology. In addition to the interference problems, there are also shortcomings for security and speed. LTE-U offers a number of advantages, most importantly speed, as well as a seamless user experience, greater range for devices, and better security.To date, the success of WiFi is largely the result of multi-stakeholder consensus and the Wi-Fi Alliance, a standard-setting organization. Problems have been addressed and resolved by stakeholders on their own without government authorities telling them what to do. However the WiFi Alliance recently took a wrong turn by asking the FCC to adjudicate the the entrance of LTE-U rather than rely on the bottom-up, multi-stakeholder approach that has worked to date. It’s ironic that the WiFi Alliance, which includes Apple, Microsoft, and Google, is warning the FCC that LTE-U is “disrupting” their status quo. When companies ask the FCC to protect them from technology and competition, they cease to be innovators and become rent-seekers. Make no mistake that there is big money on both sides of this issue, as well as complex interdependencies between telecom, cable, internet, and device companies. Cable providers want to preserve the status quo for WiFi because it is a free infrastructure enabling them to offer a wireless service. Seemingly strange bedfellows T-Mobile and Comcast, which have been rumored to merge , have taken opposing positions on this issue. In a surprising twist, Public Knowledge, a group that is dedicated to taking down “big cable” is actually defending the industry’s agenda . In any event, the debate between WiFi and LTE-U is a nice problem to have. The conflict reflects the fundamental dynamism of the American technology industry. Not only do wireless technologies compete with wireline, but there are multiple wireless technologies, each with their own set of advantages. In addition to the family of 3G standards, WiFi, and satellite, we have witnessed WiMax, Bluetooth, and ZigBee. These technologies rise and fall based on how consumers interpret their merits. The point of competition is that technologies—and the companies that deploy them – will try and fail. Some win and some lose. Consumers, not regulators, should decide which wins. Dialogue and consensus-building have worked to get us this far with with wireless technologies and unlicensed spectrum, and it’s a model that address the LTE-U and WiFi too.", "external_links": ["https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/english/info/media_center/pr/2014/0821_00.html", "http://seekingalpha.com/article/3395055-comcast-should-add-t-mobiles-wireless-to-its-broadband-and-pay-tv-package", "https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/lte-u-can-harm-consumers-but-only-if-the-fcc-allows-it"], "published": "2015-09-03T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T00:03:48.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
