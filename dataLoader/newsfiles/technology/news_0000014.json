We are trying to find the good parts and the good people that we can keep. But there are other areas that need to be refined. It’s a continual process.”\nSpeaking to The Australian on the release of its full-year results, Mr Teoh moved to dispel investor and customer concern that following TPG’s $1.56 billion buyout of iiNet that it would destroy the telco’s premium brand by cutting costs, closing call centres and moving subscribers on to its own infrastructure.\n“We are not changing the call centres. We must make sure the capability is there, the customer service is there, it is what makes iiNet valuable,” he said. “We are trying to make sure we maintain the same level of customer service so there won’t be much change.”\nMr Teoh confirmed that iiNet’s three top executives — chief executive David Buckingham, chief business officer Greg Bader and chief operating officer, Maryna Fewster — had been made redundant since TPG took the reins of the telco. As revealed by The Australian, those three executives reaped a combined $25 million worth of bonuses when the company’s sale to TPG Telecom was finalised earlier this month.\n“They have done a good job for iiNet but in many mergers and acquisitions there has to be reorganisation. They have done their part and we have to respect them,” Mr Teoh said.\n“We are trying to do this as quickly as possible because there’s no point in dragging this out. Stability is very important.”\nMr Teoh’s comments came as TPG delivered another strong full-year financial result that saw profit increase 31 per cent to $224.1m on the back of surging growth in its corporate arm which increased revenue by 57.6 per cent to $642.5m.\nRevenue from its consumer arm jumped 11.5 per cent to $628.1m which pushed total revenue up by 31 per cent for the year to July 31 to $1.27bn.\nDespite the strong results, shares in TPG fell 4.58 per cent to $10 as the company refused to forecast guidance for the next 12 months. Mr Teoh said it was too “uncertain” to issue growth forecasts for the next year as the company’s integration of iiNet had just begun. “We did not do any due diligence on this deal so we are only finding out what is possible now (in terms of synergies). We are still going through all of that, so it is premature to give the exact numbers right now.”\nAnalysts have been forecasting TPG to extract between $80m-$120m of synergies from iiNet if it were to consolidate its call centres together, cut staff and transfer its broadband traffic onto TPG infrastructure.\nBut with Mr Teoh’s pledge to keep iiNet’s call centres intact, the total value of synergies could be less than predicted. Mr Teoh said most of the synergies from the absorption of iiNet’s business would come from transferring the telco’s traffic onto TPG’s fibre infrastructure as well as implementing simpler IT systems.\n“We are excited about iiNet because the good brand name is there, they have the best customer service so we can command a slight premium in the marketplace. So if we can make iiNet very efficient that will mean better margin for us,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T07:40:53.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
