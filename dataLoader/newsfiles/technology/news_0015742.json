Tasked with virtualizing existing Microsoft Windows and Linux desktops in a highly secure mission control room for the US Geological Survey at NASA Goddard Space Flight center, the Hammers Company turned to the Leostream Connection Broker to manage Windows and Linux desktops while providing end users with the performance required to access graphic-rich applications. \n\"We always knew that we needed a connection broker,\" says Greg Greer of the Hammers Company. \"In our new environment, with Windows and Linux virtual machines, we needed a new brokering solution that could handle the OS diversity. Leostream came to our attention, and the rest is history. Leostream is the only product that supports the sort of diversity we built into our new environment\" \nThe vendor neutrality of the Leostream Connection Broker was critical to the VDI design, which not only included Windows and Linux remote desktops, but a number of thin client models, and high-performance display protocols. The broker also ties into the existing VMware infrastructure and Active Directory authentication server, which is the backbone of the entire environment. Leostream provides the tools for managing users assignments and desktop connections in the heterogeneous deployment and offers functionality to meet a wide range of requirements, including: -- Advanced filtering capabilities that give granular control over which resources are assigned to users based on their Active Directory attributes -- The ability to log users into Leostream and the remote desktop based on multifaceted sign-in workflows -- Audit level tracking which records when users are logging into the system and which desktops they are using in order to help meet security requirements \n\"Our mission is to help customers like the Hammers Company simplify even the most complex VDI designs,\" comments Bob Ewanouski, Leostream's VP of Sales. \"The Leostream Connection Broker is included in some of the world's largest hosted desktop deployments across banking, government, oil and gas, healthcare, and education. It's our flexibility to support the multiple technologies you typically find in a mixed environment that makes us crucial to the success of these deployments.\" \nTo learn more about the Hammers Company desktop virtualization initiative, download the case study , which outlines the project details and solution components. \nAbout Leostream \nLeostream ( http://www.leostream.com ) provides the critical connection-broker technology required for enterprises to achieve successful large-scale hosted desktop implementations.
