Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. give users the ability to create polls, and SurveyMonkey Inc.’s business model is based on online polling. The new feature is the latest to be bolted on to the social-media company, which has been looking for ways to reach more people and boost user numbers. So far this year, Twitter has introduced a service for collecting political donations, a buy button for tickets to events and an app for streaming live video, called Periscope.\nAs of late Thursday, boxers were winning about 2-to-1 on Noto’s poll.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/anthonynoto/status/647146540507656192\\"], "published": "2015-09-25T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T02:20:38.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
