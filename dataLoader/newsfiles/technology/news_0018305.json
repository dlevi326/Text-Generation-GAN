Irrigation systems along the Animas were closed before the mustard-colored plume of tainted wastewater drifted downstream after the Aug. 5 blowout at the Gold King in southwestern Colorado. \nAbout 3 million gallons of wastewater rushed out of the mine after a cleanup crew supervised by the Environmental Protection Agency inadvertently breached a debris dam at an entrance to the mine. \nThe water tainted rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. The EPA has been sharply criticized for causing the blowout and for being slow to notify downstream users, including the Southern Ute Tribe and the Navajo Nation. \nThe EPA has said its tests of water and sediment show concentrations of metals have returned to pre-spill levels, but it's not clear whether the agency tested the same areas Weindorf and Lombard did. \nEPA spokeswoman Laura Allen said the agency will review the researchers' findings. She said the EPA plans its own long-term monitoring project and has asked the affected states and tribes for their input. \nWeindorf described his and Lombard's work as a pilot study and said he didn't want to cause undue alarm, but he believes soils need to be tested over the long term. Over time, the metals they found along the riverbank could be washed into the river, get into irrigation ditches and gradually build up in the soils of land used to grow food and to graze livestock. \n\"There's a risk those metals could work their way into our food chain or the food chain for animals. That's why we want to do this long-term study,\" he said. \nWeindorf and Lombard have asked the Natural Resources Conservation Service, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to fund a three-year study that would closely monitor five or six sites along the river, incorporating the three states and two reservations affected. He estimated it would cost $750,000 to $1 million. No decision has been made. \nWeindorf and Lombard conducted their pilot study Sept. 1-3. \nLombard, who works at the NMSU Agricultural Science Center in Farmington -- where the Animas joins the San Juan River -- said researchers also took soil samples from irrigation ditches before the polluted plume passed to compare with future tests. \nWeindorf and Russell Begaye, president of the Navajo Nation, questioned why the discolored material wasn't removed by cleanup crews. \n\"They need to get out there and remove soil that's contaminated,\" Begaye told a U.S. House committee hearing Thursday. \nAsked about that kind of cleanup, the EPA said it doesn't anticipate any human health problems from contacting or accidentally ingesting river water, and that the risk to livestock was low. \nColorado officials believe risks are low for most human exposure and don't warrant removing sediment, health department spokesman Mark Salley said. \nThe department advised avoiding any contact with discolored sediment and water and washing after any exposure. \nThe New Mexico Environment Department hasn't reviewed Weindorf and Lombard's findings but believes contaminated sediment is one of the more serious risks, spokeswoman Allison Majure said. New Mexico plans its own long-term monitoring. \n___ \nFollow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP . \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
