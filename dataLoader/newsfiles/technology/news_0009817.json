So far, the only thing we haven't touched is the closing musical guest.\nAs many Apple fans recall, the company ends every iPhone event with a musical number. Last year, it was U2 (remember how we all got that album on our iPhones we didn't want ?).\nThis year, there is talk of Apple's newest friend — pop star Taylor Swift — wrapping up the event. Fortune seems to think it will happen , despite the fact that Swift will perform a concert in Houston later Wednesday.\n\"Flights from San Francisco to Houston take 3:45 hours gate to gate—plenty of time to hop from a 10-12 a.m. event in San Francisco to a 7 p.m. show in Houston, even with the 2 hour time difference,\" writes Fortune 's Philip Elmer DeWitt.\nSwift and Apple are now best buds after the singer offered her album 1989 exclusively on the company's Apple Music service. The deal was reached after Swift prodded the tech giant to pay royalties for streaming music.\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1EULP6N TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EULP6N&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/517d7130ba7e9b0d604d1137c4e40737577f6fb9/r=308x400/local/-/media/2015/08/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635765589014841234-GTY-485970944-75495806.JPG", "http://fortune.com/2015/09/04/apple-taylor-swift-appearance/?xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_FORTUNE", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b85be964a0c80e62bc1979d9b3565b9f5811c992/c=33-0-2283-3000&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/08/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635765589014841234-GTY-485970944-75495806.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635765589014841234-GTY-485970944-75495806.JPG", "http://twitter.com/brettmolina23", "http://usat.ly/1EULP6N", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EULP6N&text=Will%20Apple%20deliver%20a%20Taylor%20Swift%20surprise%3F&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-09-09T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:24:36.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
