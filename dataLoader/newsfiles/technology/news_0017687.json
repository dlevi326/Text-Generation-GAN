This report also forecasts the growth numbers till 2019 (on a YoY basis) and hence suggests the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for the estimated period.\nIndia currently has limited opportunity for growth given the conservative nature of business environment\n“Resistance to Change” is one of the key factors owing to the limited scope of market for ESS. This resistance not only comes from the management level but also from the operational standpoint. Questions like why, what, where, when are often discussed at the strategic level within the walls of the boardroom. This often derails the true motive behind the implementation of the enterprise social software. Moreover, unrealistic expectations crop up assuming that ESS would solve all operational challenges. Most significantly people believe that it is just a “good-to-have” measure and not a mandate.\nProper customer education and consultative sales approach is expected to work out in most cases in the APAC region. They need to be updated with the advantages of using an enterprise social software. This is not only help ESS as an emerging technology to grow but would also help the customer visualise an end-result. Providers should try to integrate ESS with collaboration software giving market success for both of them.\nMarket Segments and Forecasts Covered in the Report\nThe Global Enterprise Social Software market is segmented by:\n- Regions (North America, Europe, APAC, South America, RoW)\n- Deployment (On-Premise, Cloud)\n- End users (Enterprise, Mid-size, Small Business)\n- Industry (Financial Services, E-commerce, IT and Telecommunication, Healthcare, Retail, Others)\nCompanies discussed in the Global Enterprise Social Software market research report include IBM, Microsoft, Jive, Salesforce, Zimbra, Mzinga, SAP, Opentext Corp, Socialtext, eXo Platform, EMC, Oracle, Google, Interact Intranet, Alfresco, Infor, Elcom Technology, Autodesk, Sitrion, Spigit (Mindjet).\nTo purchase the full report please call +1-408-469-4380 or mail us at This email address is being protected from spambots.
