In Kenya they have the problems with al-Shabab. African governments need to be sure of who's moving where and when,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Sarah Young ; Editing by David Holmes )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T20:24:13.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
