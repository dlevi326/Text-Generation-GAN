If cameras are few and far between, the chances that a location will be blocked by an object in the foreground are increased. And if cameras are too close together, the differences in successive views can become too tiny to provide any value or useful information. \n\"To solve this, we focused on the problem of automatic online view-sampling, where each new view results in the best possible additional shape reconstruction incrementally,\" Kim said. At each iteration, the algorithm he and his colleagues developed adds a camera view and calculates a depth map of a scene; this process continues until the last camera view added results in a negligible improvement. \nIf there is a limit on the number of cameras available, the algorithm can stop at that number, providing an optimal spacing and placement of that number of cameras. \nThe Disney researchers presented their findings at the International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2015) in Quebec City. Conference organizers have recognized their report as among the top 10 percent of papers being presented this year. \nThe researchers compared their new method with regular sampling on both synthetic and real scenes and showed they could recover high quality detail with fewer than half the number of cameras required for regular sampling. \n\"Our online sampling analysis considers the statistics of the very scene being captured and thus results in a significant win over dense, arbitrarily or regularly placed cameras,\" said Kenny Mitchell, a senior research scientist at Disney Research. 2 hours ago 0 Disney researchers reconstruct detailed 3D scenes from hundreds of high-resolution 2D images July 19, 2013 \nInvestigators at Disney Research, ZÃ¼rich have developed a method for using hundreds of photographic images to build 3D computer models of complex, real-life scenes that meet the increasing demands of today's movie, TV and ...
