They are produced by plants, which convert energy from sunlight into chemical energy in the form of sugars through photosynthesis. Discovery of new plant switch could boost crops, biofuel production April 15, 2015 \nA team of Michigan State University researchers has discovered a switch that regulates plant photosynthesis - the process that lets plants store solar energy and use it to grow and produce food. Seasonal body clock discovered in animals September 25, 2015 \nScientists have discovered the cells driving the annual body clock in animals which adapts their body to the changing seasons. Imagining strange new lifeforms could help us discover our own origins September 25, 2015 \nFrom the earliest of times, philosophers and scientists have tried to understand the relationship between animate and inanimate matter. But the origin of life remains one of the major scientific riddles to be solved. Recommended for you Study sheds light on powerful process that turns food into energy September 29, 2015 \nThe way in which our cells convert food into fuel is shared by almost all living things - now scientists have discovered a likely reason why this is so widespread. Modeling tool IDs genes that control stress response in plants September 29, 2015 \nAn interdisciplinary team of researchers from North Carolina State University and University of California, Davis has developed a modeling algorithm that is able to identify genes associated with specific biological functions ... Researchers discover key link in understanding billion-dollar pests in agriculture September 29, 2015 \nInvisible to the naked eye, plant-parasitic nematodes are a huge threat to agriculture, causing billions in crop losses every year. Plant scientists at the University of Missouri and the University of Bonn in Germany have ... Biologists crack centuries-old mystery of how cell growth triggers cell division September 29, 2015 \nCells were discovered in 1676, and almost immediately afterward scientists began wondering why cells are so perfectly small. Scientists unravel root cause of plant twists and turns September 29, 2015 \nTo feed the world's burgeoning population, producers must grow crops in more challenging terrain â€“ where plant roots must cope with barriers. To that end, Cornell University physicists and Boyce Thompson Institute plant ...
