Laplink Software, Inc. announced today that PCmover has been selected by Microsoft Corp. as its recommended migration solution for Windows users, with a free download of PCmover Express for personal use available now.“Microsoft looks forward to continuing our collaboration with Laplink,” stated Shad Larsen, Director of Business Planning at Microsoft. “We wanted to make it easier for customers to migrate their personal files and settings from their older Windows PC to a new Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 PC, and Laplink delivers a great solution with their PCmover Express software.”The free offer for PCmover Express will be available on Windows.com in 18 markets. The offer, which will be available for one year ending on August 31, 2016, is available for personal, non-commercial use. It requires the destination PC to be running Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 and not joined to a domain. Commercial users can purchase a license for PCmover Express that provides commercial use rights for about $20. While PCmover Express does not transfer applications, that functionality is provided with PCmover Professional as an available upgrade.Laplink previously worked with Microsoft to provide Windows users with migration software in support of Windows XP customers moving to new Windows PCs. According to Thomas Koll, Laplink’s CEO, extending this relationship to Windows 10 was an easy decision.“We’re fully committed to this relationship with Microsoft in support of all Windows users,” said Koll. “Our latest version of PCmover makes it easier than ever for customers running Windows XP, all the way to the latest release of Windows 10, to migrate their personal files, folders, and other settings to their new PC.”Koll also indicated that Windows 10 adoption might surprise some industry onlookers.“We’re seeing strong demand for Windows 10 by both consumer and commercial customers,” continued Koll. “And as customers buy new Windows 10 devices, we believe they will discover Laplink’s migration solutions provide great choice and flexibility, saving time and money for consumers, SMB, and enterprises.Transferring your personal files, folders, and other settings to a new PC can sometimes be time-consuming and difficult. Laplink’s PCmover software provides an easy-to-use solution with a wizard driven interface, allowing users to automatically transfer selected user profiles, files, and settings to a new device from an old PC. Laplink also offers its unique Free Transfer Assistance, providing certified experts 24/7 to assist with migrations.For larger organizations, Laplink offers an enterprise version of PCmover, which allows IT to manage migrations even for unmanaged PCs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:05:20.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
