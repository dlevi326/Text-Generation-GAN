The N1TV channel's editor, Szabolcs Kisberk, said in a statement that employment of the camerawoman, widely identified as Petra Laszlo, had been \"terminated with immediate effect.\"\nHe said she \"behaved unacceptably\" at a police-supervised collection point for Arabs, Asians and Africans crossing the border from Serbia near the village of Roszke.\nIn videos and images posted online by multiple videographers and photojournalists, Laszlo can be seen making sideways karate-style kicks into the knees of two people - a young man and a pony-tailed teenage girl - as they ran past her. Both stumbled but neither fell as Laszlo continued filming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T03:39:41.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
