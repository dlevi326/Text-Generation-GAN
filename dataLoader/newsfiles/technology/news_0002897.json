These items cover a wide range, including art, home & living, apparel, fashion accessories, costume jewelry, craft supplies, food, bath and beauty products, toys and unique products. The app follows a model of an open marketplace which allows any seller – online or offline – to create their “microshop” in seconds and start selling. Buyers are able to discover unique products in a personalized manner and directly interact with sellers.\n“There are over 50M homepreneurs, artisans and flea market sellers that currently have no avenue to sell online except for unorganized channels such as WhatsApp and Facebook. Further, a large number of consumers have no place to discover such eclectic products except in an offline setting. Kraftly wants to become the one-stop shop to cater to both these audiences.” comments Saahil Goel, CEO of Kraftly.\nCurrently available options, allow small and hobby sellers to only sell through platforms such as classified listings. However, this doesn’t address the fundamental problem associated with commerce – which is payments and shipping. Kraftly addresses these issues and offers a complete buying and selling experience that truly makes it the first C2C marketplace of India. The app enables any individual, hobby seller or shop owner to create their own branded micro-shop, list products and receive payments on the go – without requiring any paperwork. Kraftly completely manages payments and logistics for each seller thereby allowing the long tail of small and home sellers to go online.\nKraftly pioneers a unique wallet system that allows buyers to directly deposit payments into the sellers wallet making the transaction extremely transparent. Shop owners can also use the app as a “point of sale” system for walk-in customers and use it for accepting credit and debit cards in their shops instantly by signing up on the app.\n“The current ecommerce ecosystem is primarily geared up for B2C commerce with a strong focus on standardized products sold through a small set of distributors and suppliers. Small sellers make up a large part of offline retail, yet are unable to sell with the large marketplaces. On-boarding a seller onto B2C marketplaces is a tedious process that only a few small sellers will ever want to undertake. Further, marketplaces have huge barriers such as – photo shoot quality, minimum number of products required, product specifications and documentation that further have prevented this seller community to launch online. With a strong focus on promoting small sellers, Kraftly allows users to simply click pictures of their products and completely manage their microshop – all from their smartphones.” added Saahil.\nUntil now, it was difficult to reach small sellers, but with the explosion of the smartphone market in India, the dynamics are in favor. For a lot of these sellers, introduction to the Internet has been through the smartphone making it the first medium to get online. The listing process on Kraftly is as simple as adding a picture to Facebook or WhatsApp.\nAs ecommerce continues to boom in India (projected at 15x growth in 5 years), consumers will demand such artsy and eclectic products through the online channel as well. Currently access to these products is limited to offline exhibitions and craft fairs and has a limited consumer reach.\nTo enhance user experience for buyers in certain categories such as – food items, home décor, bulky goods and plants, Kraftly also allows users to search and browse for products using location as a filter.\nBy bringing a large supply of un-standard products online, Kraftly will become a one stop mobile app to shop for unique, quirky and trendy products across categories. Since products are being listed directly by the creator, prices will also be relatively cheaper than what consumers are used to paying. This makes Kraftly a win-win situation for both the seller and the buyer.\n“Our unique model allows us to represent the seller and create a venue for sellers to easily conduct business with convenience. We strongly support the small seller community and have planned several initiatives around the same in the coming year. Currently we have over 1500 category leaf nodes and over 6 lac products from 2000+ sellers for a buyer to choose from. We expect that in 6 months we will have over 5 Lac sellers on the platform and have close to 30-40 Lac SKUs” adds Saahil Goel.\nTOP 10 FEATURES THAT MAKE KRAFTLY A MUST HAVE APP\n1.
