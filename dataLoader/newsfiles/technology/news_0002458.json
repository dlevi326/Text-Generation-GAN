Photo: Luis Ascui\nIn her first week of taking an online course through the Copenhagen Business School, Melbourne woman Justine Raczkowski​ was challenged to name a social problem that needed solutions.\nHer response was to set up a new company that helps connect isolated seniors and disabled people to the outside world via social media – and at the same time provide employment for young IT students, women and older people.\n\"I drew on personal experience,\" she says. \"When my husband's parents returned to Poland in 2012, Skype was the easiest way to communicate with them. But they didn't know how to download it and get started. They were computer illiterate. I spent a month on the telephone sorting it out.\"\nThen, when her parents separated in their 70s, her father got a laptop and managed connectivity without a hitch – but her mother got an iPad and was lost. \"She'd worked in Windows before so she didn't know which side was up.\"\nAdvertisement What Raczkowski realised was \"there are fantastic technologies for seniors but they need help to get up and running.\" Her solution was My S4S (Support for Seniors), where IT students from Monash University first visit the clients at home, and then provide ongoing helpdesk support, both by telephone but also logging on remotely. The idea is not to fix the problem, but to show the client how to do it for themselves.\nAt the beginning of the year, she began approaching aged care providers. \"They are the people best able to identify people who needs the service.\" So far My S4S has 100 clients, 13 student trainers and two senior trainers who provide \"translation\" services.\nAt $385 for a year of access, training and ongoing helpdesk support, it may be a stretch for some pensioners. On the other hand, for disabled people and their carers, Commonwealth funding is available via carer packages.\nThis was the case for Marta Nagy, who has become as isolated as her wheelchair-bounder partner.\nShe met Graham Kennedy 10 years ago. \"Not the dead one.\" Her Mr Kennedy was the former CEO of Crayola, the maker of crayons on supermarket shelves everywhere. \"But he's a funny guy too.\"\nAfter five great years together, Kennedy suffered a massive stroke, which ruined one leg. A fall out of hospital bed ruined the other. He could not speak at that time, and when he overheard the doctors telling his family that he'd have to go into a nursing home, he began to cry. Nagy decided she's give it a go, looking after him at home.\n\"I had to give it a try. What else could I do? I love the guy.\" Since then Nagy has barely had time to get to the mail box, the old-fashioned one in which letters arrive. As Kennedy's full-time carer, she is largely reliant on computers and iPads to communicate with the outside world. But she needed help to get started, and attending a computer course was impossible.\n\"I looked at getting to the library for a half hour session, but that means being away from Graham for a couple of hours with travelling,\" she says. \"I never made it out of here.\" Nagyis able to manage \"basic emails, but if I have to set up to print or create a document, I'm in trouble. The desktop has gone from using Windows 7 to Windows 10. I don't know how it happened and I have no idea how to navigate it. It's all pictures, which is fine for kids, but it's had me stumped.\"\nNow she is able to \"put photos on Graham's Facebook page, which was started by him. I didn't know how to do that before.\"\nShe is also able to maintain better online contact with doctors, nurses and carers – \"a way of making friends, they are the people I meet\" – as well as her sister. \"She has three kids. We can't visit because they don't have the right wheelchair facilities ... so a lot of contact is by email.\"\nNagy isn't yet fully on top of social media. \"But the trainers have remote access to my computer ... so I get the help when I need it.\"\nIn the 25 days between International Day of Charity (September 5) and International Day of Older Persons (October 1) My S4S plans to give away 200 tech support packages in a two-for-one arrangement.\nLink: www.mys4s.com", "external_links": ["https://www.mys4s.com/"], "published": "2015-09-12T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T15:24:09.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
