In doing so, it enables the user to personalize the appearance of a flat screen. As a result, it adds a fashionable flair to any room décor. The invention features a fun and versatile design that is easy to apply and remove. Additionally, the COMPUTER AND TV DÉCOR protects the exterior edges of a television or computer monitor frame and it is producible in design variations.\nThe inventor described the invention design. “My design allows you to coordinate your computer or TV to your personal tastes and likes.” The invention is patent pending.\nThe original design was submitted to the St. Louis office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
