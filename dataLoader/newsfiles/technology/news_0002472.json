Designed for use in environments where affordability is key, the PC42t is a light-duty printer ready for retail shelf price labeling, general office packing and shipping labelling, and distribution center barcode labelling applications. Well-suited for small-business owners looking to upgrade to thermal printing from inkjet or laser printers for the first time, the PC42t is easy to setup and inexpensive to own. \nJoining Honeywell's extensive offerings of barcode printers, the reliable PC42t label printer includes broad, industry-standard connectivity including USB device and USB host, plus optional serial or serial plus Ethernet.
