Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates Would you trust a computer to have your best financial interests at heart?\nIt's a question that may soon become more relevant, as banks, superannuation funds and wealth managers use automated digital programs to deliver basic types of financial advice to a mass market.\nAbout 40,000 National Australia Bank customers will this month have access to the first such tool from a major bank , which will provide tailored-information on superannuation and insurance to online banking customers.\nSuperannuation funds such as QSuper are using similar applications, which most commonly provide what is known as \"general advice\". For example, it might tell you how much superannuation to save to reach certain retirement goals, rather than recommending specific products.\nAt the same time, so-called \"robo-advisers\" such as Stockspot are providing automated investment reflecting a customers' risk profile, including an annual review of clients' goals.\nNone of these completely replace the role of a financial planner, it should be stressed. They do not provide comprehensive financial plans that take into account a customer's broader circumstance.\nEven so, machines that do this may not be far away – and that is re-igniting debate about the regulatory framework of a scandal-prone industry.\nCarolyn Colley, chief executive of software firm Decimal, says the range of automated advice platforms is likely to grow significantly over the next year or so, including topics such as credit card debt. And this is just the \"tip of the ice berg.\"\n As a rough guess, she says, computers may be capable of providing comprehensive financial advice within about three years.\n\"If all the products were transparent and could do a complete comparison and take into account individual circumstances, it could be possible. I don't think it's impossible,\" she says.\nKing & Wood Mallesons partner Kate Jackson-Maynes also cites predictions computers could ultimately be sophisticated enough to comply with Future of Financial Advice laws designed to stamp out conflicts in the industry.\nThese require, among other things, advisers to follow a series of steps to ensure they are acting in the customers' best interest.\n\"I am by no means a tech expert, but understand that most developers of algorithms are confident that they can create something that can satisfy the best interest test without any human interaction,\" she says.\nIt has been estimated \"robo-advisers\" manage $US19 billion in the United States, and given our large super pool and pressure to cut fees, it is tipped to expand quickly here too.\nHowever, some in the industry are sceptical about the potential for conflicts of interest to emerge, just as they have in traditional advice in the past.\nAndrew Ward, managing director of peer-to-peer investment advice platform SelfWealth, argues the type of product NAB is launching may simply be another way of encouraging cross-selling wealth products.\n\"Hopefully it's not a wolf in sheep's clothing dressed up as an independent investing tool rather than another channel to promote and sell NAB's own products,\" he says.\nThe Financial Planning Association argues that without specific regulations, conflicts could eventually be built into the algorithms, such as through charging \"shelf space fees\" to certain product providers.\nGeneral manager of policy, Dante De Gori, says there is also a question mark over whether computer programs could really satisfy FOFA's best-interest test.\n\"How does a program exercise professional judgement? How does it exercise years of experience in reading the facial expressions of the person across the table?\" he says.\nEven if computerised advice platforms stick to more mechanical tasks, the mass roll-out of robo-advice tools highlights a long-standing grey area – what can be considered \"advice\", as opposed to \"sales\" or \"information.\"\nNAB's product, for instance, will not recommend products, but the bank says it will provide \"personalised\" advice because of the information collected about the customer. It is safe to assume other tools will follow a similar model.\nHowever, the Financial System Inquiry recommended the very term \"general advice\" be scrapped because of the potential for consumers to believe the information was tailored to their needs, when it does not actually take into account their entire financial situation.\nAt the very least, consumers should be aware of what they are getting when promised types of advice produced by a machine.\nProducts being rolled out today are not providing \"holistic\" advice that considers a person's entire financial situation, and Jackson-Maynes says this should be made clear to customers.\n\"If they haven't asked me about the fact that I have a million dollar mortgage and they're giving me advice in relation to my superannuation without having regard to that, it's important that the consumer understands that.\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@clancyyeates", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/nab-to-offer-computerised-financial-advice-to-bank-customers-20150909-gjib37.html", "http://fpa.asn.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015_03_31_FPA-Submission_to_Treasury_on_FSI_Report_FINAL.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-20T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:05:24.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
