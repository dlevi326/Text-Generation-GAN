This does not only affect users globally who want to access (and pay) for the likes of Hulu Plus, HBO Go or Netflix, but also residents of countries where these streaming services are offered, for instance if they leave the country for a period of time. \nGetflix is a web service that provides you with the means to bypass geo-restrictions. It is not a VPN but uses what the company calls \"Smart DNS\" technology instead which means that the streams utilize the customer's bandwidth for the streaming. \nHere is what you get: Lifetime access (30 years) to the service. Access streaming services in more than 20 regions of the world including Hulu Plus, Crackle, HBO Now, BBC iPlayer, Pandora or Sky Go on up to 10 computer systems and devices. Support for PC and Mac, gaming systems, mobile devices and Smart TVs. No software installation required, just a simple change of DNS settings. Free, optional VPN account to encrypt traffic. \nNote : Getflix lets you bypass these geo-restrictions, but select services may require a subscription. \nCheck out the Ghacks Deals main page for additional discounted offers, e-learning bundles, software and freebies.
