Ken James Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Australian entrepreneurs who have taken the plunge to grow their startup businesses in the United States have some surprising advice for Australian policymakers and the local technology industry: don't waste your time trying to imitate Silicon Valley at home.\nInstead, they argue that Australia needs to embrace the idea of its best and brightest business builders taking their talents to the world's top technology market.\nThe sentiment was expressed by six young expat entrepreneurs in a group interview from San Francisco with The Australian Financial Review .\nMichael Overell, a former McKinsey management consultant who founded an online marketplace for contractors called RecruitLoop, said trying to replicate Silicon Valley in Australia was \"silly\".\n\"A smarter question for policymakers or thought leaders in Australia is how can we facilitate an environment that supports technology-based businesses while being cognisant that many are going to want to be based in the centre of the tech universe of Silicon Valley,\" Mr Overell said.\nOzan Onay, co-founder of healthcare marketplace Vida Health, raised $US5 million almost immediately after starting in his business in San Francisco's Bay Area.\n\"These sized funding rounds we can't really do in Australia,\" Sydney-raised Mr Onay said.\n\"Silicon Valley is exponentially better ... For Australia to try to be as a good as Silicon Valley and end up third or fourth best placed for a venture-backed technology company would be a dismal failure.\"\n Keeping tech in Australia In local technology circles, there has been constant chatter about trying to retain burgeoning tech firms at home and doing more to set up tech hubs.\nMike Cannon-Brookes, who co-founded Sydney software firm Atlassian which is valued at over $US3 billion, has repeatedly criticised the federal government for failing to foster the development of technology at home.\nThe government has taken some modest steps to boost the fledgling tech sector in recent years, including tax and regulatory changes to boost employee share schemes and to make crowd source funding more viable .\nGideon Silverman, who founded digital financial assistant Monetise after studying at Stanford University in California, said Silicon Valley was the \"greatest technology incubator in the world\" thanks to links with leading education institutions.\n\"Unless in Australia we plan to build Stanford, I think we will really struggle to have the capability, the talent and capital to make it work,\" Mr Silverman said.\n\"We've come to get the best training and resources in the world and build our big dreams. \"We'd like to take them home to benefit Australian consumers.\"\nExpat contingent About 20,000 Australians are estimated to be working in Silicon Valley and other US tech hubs.\nIn a piece in The Australian earlier this year entitled \"Hey, Silicon Valley â€” we want our talent back,\" Labor MP Ed Husic lamented the lack of plans for Australia to build, value and retain talent.\nSome have lamented the so-called \"brain drain\".\nJillian Kilby, founder of an engineering and project management firm operating in the US, lamented the term.\n\"People look at it as a brain drain, but we should look at it as an exchange of ideas,\" Ms Kilby said.\n\"A lot of us will return to Australia to make Australia a better place as a result of what we've learned.\"\nMs Kilby, who studied an MBA at Stanford after founding the firm in outback NSW, said she had found it challenging to scale the business at home.\nThe bigger US market had greater financial resources and more human capital on offer, she added.\nChallenge of scale Katherine van Ekert Onay, co-founder of on-demand veterinary medical service VetPronto, agreed.\n\"There is no problem starting a tech company in Australia, but it's going to be impossible to scale,\" Dr van Ekert Onay said.\nWell-established Australian companies can raise cash easily enough at home. But local investors have generally eschewed riskier early-stage startups.\nHealthcare startups are capital intensive upfront and can take a long time to deliver returns.\n\"But the returns could be very big,\" said Vida Health's Mr Onay, who is married to Dr van Ekert Onay.\n\"That kind of argument just doesn't work for Australian investors. There is a level or risk-adversity.\"\nAsh Fontana, general partner of Zetta Venture Partners which has $US60 million of venture capital investments in startups, said Australia should not try to compete.\n\"I think Australia has to find the things it's really good at and build an eco-system around that,\" he said, citing rare earth chemistry and mining technology as examples.\nMr Overall said policymakers should not deter Australian tech businesses shifting offshore, but instead focus on attracting the regional headquarters of expanding global firms.\n\"Every one of those companies at some point will need a regional HQ,\" said Mr Overell, who hails from Queensland.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/investing-in-it-skills-will-keep-our-talent-at-home/story-e6frgb0o-1227221819146", "https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-09-21T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:28:17.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
