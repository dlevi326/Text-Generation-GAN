The large-scale three year project is funded by EPSRC and addresses the design, construction and testing of the system. This research fellow will be part of the design team, working on the MMIC designs and their associated connections to the miniature waveguides. The work will be in collaboration with the Rutherford Appleton laboratory and Fraunhofer IAF. \nThe project will take place in the Emerging Device Technologies research group, where the underlying science, the new technologies and the applications of low terahertz EM waves are an increasingly important part of the research strategy, which is strongly backed by UK and EU funding. The involvement of major international companies further highlights the importance of the research and the potential impact that can be generated by cooperative work on fundamental research questions. \nPerson Specification: \nThe post is available for both UK/EU and international candidates (subject to work permit approval), who should have, or expect soon to obtain, a PhD degree in electronic engineering or physical sciences. The successful candidate is not expected to have experience with micromachining technology, but will have worked in the area of microwave engineering. Ideally the candidate will have experience in MMIC circuit design, particularly at frequencies above about 50 GHz. Experience with full wave electromagnetic CAD software and MMIC circuit simulators are essential. \nHow to apply \nThe applicant is required to upload a covering letter, a brief statement of research interests (describing how past experience and future plans fit with the advertised position), CV and the details of two referees as part of his or her online application. \nInformal enquiries may be addressed to the project leader Professor Michael Lancaster ( m.j.lancaster@bham.ac.uk ) Share this job", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T11:34:57.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
