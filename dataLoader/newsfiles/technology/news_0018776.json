The SkillsUSA WorldTeam won three medals at the 2015 WorldSkills Competition. Brock Miesner of St. Ann, Mo., was awarded the bronze medal for Refrigeration and Air Conditioning. Andrew Cardin of Sutton, Mass., won a Medallion of Excellence for Welding. The Medallion of Excellence is awarded to competitors who earn 500 or more points but do not medal. Lauryn Erickson of Hersey, Mich. won the Best of the Nation for Hairdressing. The Best of Nation honor is given to the competitor with a high score who demonstrates the qualities of leadership for their country’s team. Michael Mullin of San Luis Obispo, Calif. Competed in Automotive Technology and was ranked fifth among 21 competitors. All 18 of the SkillsUSA WorldTeam members received a Certificate of Participation.\nThe students tested their skills against more than 1,189 students representing 59 countries and competing in 50 official skill competitions and one demonstration contest. Competitors from 17 to 22 years old demonstrated their excellence in a variety of trade and technology contest areas. The next competition will be held in 2017 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\nThe WorldSkills Competition highlights the worldwide issue of preparation of a highly skilled workforce. Simon Field of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) stated in the book Learning for Jobs, “Countries are recognizing that good vocational education and training makes a major contribution to economic competitiveness. The wealth of nations will come to rely more on the skills of their people than on natural resources.”\nThe competitors earned the right to be members of WorldTeam by being members of SkillsUSA, and by winning local, district and national contests in the SkillsUSA Championships program. Candidates then participated in an application and interview process. The selected members then completed a full training program to prepare for WorldSkills.\nMembers of the SkillsUSA WorldTeam who competed in the 2015 WorldSkills were:\n Automobile Technology: Michael Mullen, San Luis Obispo, Calif.

In 2015, more than 1,200 competitors tested their skills in São Paulo for four days in 50 occupational skill areas Accompanied by their teachers, trainers and industry technical committee experts, these young people competed before the public in contests that were run and judged by industry using demanding international standards. Member countries include: Japan, England, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Australia, Thailand, Argentina and many others.\nOver its 65-year history, WorldSkills International (formerly known as the International Vocational Training Competition) has come to symbolize the pinnacle of excellence in vocational training. It provides a unique means of exchange and comparison of world-class competency standards in the industrial trades and service sectors of the global economy. The continued growth of WorldSkills International attests to the fact that traditional trade skills, along with today’s newer technology’s multi-skilled occupations, make an essential contribution to the economic strength of every nation.\nA total of 5,000 international experts, delegates and judges and 3,000 volunteers were required to plan and run the competitions. An estimated 150,000 spectators viewed the competition at the Anhembi Park Centre.
