Fonality introduced today plans to provide the Agent community with more opportunities to leverage Fonality's unique position in the market to offer agents access to business communications and UC. Fonality is the only provider to offer On-Premise, Hybrid or Cloud solutions to agents in one subscription model - regardless of deployment. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150814/258527LOGO \nFonality's Channel Partner Program is proud to have worked with such a large variety of partners for the last decade, and its commitment to the Partner Program is stronger than ever before. David Beagle, Fonality's new vice president of channel development, leads the charge in securing a larger presence within the Agent community with an aim to hit the $100 million revenue mark. \n\"Many Agents face a growing obstacle when it comes to losing Unified communications (UC) opportunities because many UC providers fail to offer a variety of different deployment options,\" says Beagle. \"Fonality's Master Agency program removes that obstacle and thus allows for more sales control for the Agent. I'm excited to be on board to help Fonality continue to grow and strengthen its already stellar Partner Program.\" \nOne Partner for All \nFonality, unlike most business phone systems, allows Agents to offer a one-stop solution that is agnostic when it comes to deployment methods. No one business is alike - and that's why Fonality offers a variety of different deployment options for our partners to leverage for success. \nWhether a prospect is interested in public cloud, private cloud, Hybrid-Hosted(TM) or a combination, Fonality has the answer to the right business phone system and right unified communications solution for their business. \nContract already in place? No problem. With its new program, Fonality keeps Agents in the game with business phone solutions that are flexible and designed to seamlessly integrate with a prospect's existing infrastructure. No longer do Agents have to disqualify or walk away if the prospect wants a mixed environment or if contracts are in place. With Fonality, they can play! \nBuilding Atop a Solid Foundation \nFonality is proud to have strategic partners around the country enjoying the benefits of its comprehensive Channel Partner Program. The Fonality Partner Program has a rich history that spans over a decade and provides a simple solution for master service agents, managed service providers (MSPs), and value-added resellers (VARs) to open new revenue streams by adding business phone systems and UC to their portfolio. \n\"We are thrilled to be announcing this news leading up to the Cloud Partners show in Boston,\" says Beagle. \"Fonality is looking forward to sharing the news directly with our partners and setting up meetings for anyone wishing to learn more about our focus on the Master Agent community.\" \nAre you attending the Cloud Partners Conference in Boston and Interested in meeting with Fonality?
