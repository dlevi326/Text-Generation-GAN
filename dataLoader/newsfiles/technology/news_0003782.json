For instance, the 153.6 MHz version has an ultra-low phase-noise floor of −163 dBc/Hz at 40 MHz; the VCXO’s extremely low phase noise translates to a typical RMS phase jitter of 75 fs (12 kHz to 20 MHz). \n\n\nThe 14.2 x 9.14 x 5.3-mm oscillator, whose low phase noise performance suits it for applications such as HD video broadcast equipment, is currently available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T10:31:05.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
