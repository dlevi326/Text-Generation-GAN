We are convinced that this new company structure will create a more attractive, cohesive and seamless offering, which will contribute to shaping the future of television,” Tumegård explained. “This means that we will be able to offer a more in-depth and unique know-how in media transport and workflows, as well as a broader and more integrated solution to service providers and media companies around the world.” \nFor his company’s part, ScheduALL COO and owner Ralph Quintero said: “We are operating in a fast moving industry. I am convinced that we can create added value to our customers with our combined expertise in transport and production workflows. We will continue to serve our customers and partners and accelerate the deployment of advanced solutions providing automated, assured orchestration for on-demand network services.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T10:34:53.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
