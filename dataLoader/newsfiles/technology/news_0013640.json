User scenarios include holding down on content to preview images - take your finger off and you're back in the app you were busy with. \nThe new iPhones have a new A9 processor, with Apple claiming its 70 percent faster in CPU tasks and 90 percent faster in graphics-related tasks compared to last year's chip. \nApple also claimed that its new Touch ID fingerprint scanner is twice as fast as last year's device. \nIn the camera department, Apple has announced a camera bump from the long-standing 8MP resolution to 12-megapixels. And yes, these new phones are finally capable of shooting at 4K ultra HD. \nLove selfies? Then you'll be pleased with the new 5MP selfie shooter, complete with a Snapchat-inspired \"flash\". \nHoping for Apple to do away with 16GBs as the base model? Nope, you're looking at the same pricing and storage scheme In other words, the small phone will cost $199 for 16GBs, $299 for 64GBs and $399 for 128GBs. The larger 6S Plus starts at $299 for 16GBs, $399 for 64GBs and $499 for 128GBs. \nThe new iPhones will be available in the USA on September 25, but interestingly enough, Apple will also be running a subscription-based upgrade programme. This programme will see users dishing out $32 a month and getting an iPhone every year. \nGot an iPhone 6? Then there's some consolation, because iOS9 is around the corner, set for a September 16 launch. \n\niPad Pro \nApple has revealed the iPad Pro as well. \nThe new iPad Pro comes with a 2072x2048 12.9-inch display as well as an A9X processor. \nMuch like the similar Galaxy Note Pro and Surface range, Apple's device comes with a stylus, dubbed the Apple Pen. It even comes with a Surface-style keyboard attachment. \nInterestingly enough, Microsoft's Office representative was on-stage to demonstrate Office on the device. \nThe iPad Pro will retail for $799 (32GBs), $949 (64GBs) and $1079 (128GBs). \nApple also refreshed its iPad Mini, in the form of the iPad Mini 4, which starts at $399 and offers an upgraded processor. \n\nApple TV \nThe company was widely expected to reveal a new Apple TV box and this was indeed the case. \nThe new Apple TV has the same fundamental design as the old one, save for the new remote, which comes with a Siri button, accelerometer, gyroscope and a touchpad for navigation. \nSiri allows you to search for content (Apple demonstrated users searching for cameos, popular comedies and more, using natural language), but also delivers previous Siri features such as sports scores and weather. \nBut probably the most important feature is that the App Store is now available on the device, allowing users to game on the Apple TV. Apple confirmed that apps like Disney Infinity, Guitar Hero, AirBnB, Crossy Road (including multiplayer!) and more will be available on the platform.
