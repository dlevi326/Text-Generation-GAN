In 2011 he went to Chicago to meet with business leaders.\nRelated Stories Thorny issues roil relations between U.S., China What the president of China will be doing in Washington state U.S. and China seek arms deal for cyberspace Xi’s visit opportune time to snag investments Important but unfamiliar: A look at who’s coming to town with Chinese President Xi Jinping But it’s worth noting that relations between the two countries now seem to be at a low point, due to cybersecurity issues and also foreign-policy disagreements ranging from human rights to China’s territorial ambitions, said Orville Schell, the Arthur Ross Director on U.S.-China Relations at Asia Society in New York.\nMost Read Stories Doug Baldwin struggles to find balance between football and life 3 couples imagine a new kind of retirement on Bainbridge Island Green River killer Ridgway coming back to Washington How Vietnamese-Americans in Bellevue challenged an insensitive art display — and won Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. “The U.S.-China relationship as a whole is as tense as it has been since 1989,” the year of the Tiananmen Square protests, Schell said.\nTechnology trade disputes are becoming one of the main tension points between the U.S. and China, said Samm Sacks, an analyst with political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group. It’s certainly casting a pall over the visit, she said.\nHence the need to foster a rift between Washington, D.C., and America’s buoyant tech sector, which despite challenges and disputes sees in China an immensely lucrative market.\n“The Chinese sense a growing divide between the tech industry and Washington,” and seek to exploit it by communicating directly with tech titans here to let them know that China might retaliate against them should America impose sanctions on its firms, Sacks said.\nThe same divide-and-conquer strategy applies to the governors of states such as California, Iowa and Michigan, where there are also strong economic links to China. Those officials are flocking here, too.\n“He clearly wants to get ahead in front of the administration and meet the political leaders before going to D.C.,” said James Reardon-Anderson, a China expert and senior associate dean at Georgetown University’s Edmund A. Walsh’s School of Foreign Service.\nThat dynamic highlights how, underneath the increasingly strong economic links tying the two largest economies on the planet, there’s a sense of rivalry.\nIt’s not common for leaders of other large powers — such as France, Germany and the U. K.— to set up high-profile events to flex their muscle outside the Beltway during U.S. visits.\nBut then again, those countries are allies, Reardon-Anderson said. “The relationship between U.S. and China is much more mixed,” he said.\nExperts say that the U.S. government is likely to soon deploy targeted sanctions against Chinese firms or individuals who may have benefitted from the theft by hackers of trade secrets from U.S. companies, and from havoc generated by online attacks on U.S. Internet infrastructure.\nBeyond the sanctions, China also has other important items to discuss with the leaders of the U.S. tech industry here. China still needs foreign expertise to help grow its own tech sector; on the other hand, U.S. and other firms are facing an increasingly difficult commercial environment in China, says Sacks, the Eurasia Group analyst.\nThere’s also the issue of convincing American companies to play by Chinese rules. “The Chinese government wants foreign investment in the technology sector, but they want foreign tech companies to be compliant with their own internal security regime,” Sacks said.\nSchell, of the Asia Society, says that it’s clear why both businessmen and state governors would be drawn to the Seattle event, since China represents a huge market. “They’re not conducting foreign policy, they’re seeking to enhance their bottom line,” he said.\nBut regional officials and corporate titans alike are dealing with a government whose foreign and domestic policy goals go hand in hand with its commercial agenda, said Schell.\n“They have to be very careful not to be too naive,” he said.\nTimeline of relations between Washington state and China\nSources: Seattle Times archives, Washington State China Relations Council, HistoryLink.org\nÁngel González: 206-464-2250 or agonzalez@seattletimes.com .
