VMware and Microsoft battle fiercely over big markets such as software \"virtualization\" for computer servers, and Microsoft also offers its own device-management software that competes with AirWatch.\n\"There is overlap between our two products, but that doesn't matter,\" VMware Executive Vice President Sanjay Poonen said at the San Francisco conference.\nWrite to Shira Ovide at shira.ovide@wsj.com\nSeptember 01, 2015 14:55 ET (18:55 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:59:31.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
