She said: \"People who I didn't want to see my body have seen me (naked). I don't want to feel like that.\" \nMitchell, from Shephall Way in Stevenage, pleaded guilty to one count of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress as well as one count of assault by beating. \nJoanna Coleman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: \"These vengeful crimes are predominantly thought of as being carried out by men. \n\"This sentencing will highlight that anyone can be guilty of this offence and regardless of the defendant's gender, once reported, it will be taken seriously.\" More Technology Industry News  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:16:17.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
