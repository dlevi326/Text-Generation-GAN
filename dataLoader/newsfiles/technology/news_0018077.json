Apple isn’t the only tech company that can make an attractive watch that looks like a fashion accessory and not a Spy Kids prop! We can do it, too! See!”\nIf you listened close enough, that’s really what Samsung and Motorola were saying this week with the announcements of their respective new smartwatches.\nWith circular screens and finer materials, the Moto 360 and Samsung Gear S2 look like real watches—Samsung’s rotatable ring even adds some extra functionality to the timeless design. But based on my short time seeing the new devices, real utility, which can only come through improved software, seems to be on the back burner.\nThe new Moto 360 looks far better on my wrist than the previous version—yes, that’s the one I compared to a wall clock for its monstrous size, so I guess that’s not saying much.\nThe 42mm version is still slightly chunky on my small wrist and the underside still thick, but the different mix-in-match case and band combinations overshadow it. A silver bezel, a rose gold case, a double wrap leather band or maybe a metal rose gold one… deciding on the customization options on Motorola’s site is truly overwhelming.\nMotorola’s 42mm Moto 360 smartwatch. Drew Evans / The Wall Street Journal\nFor the $300 starting price, Motorola’s all-metal watch certainly doesn’t feel like a Tag Heuer and the screen is still cut off at the bottom, but it’s far more affordable than Apple’s $600-and-up metal-banded designs. And without any real extras to differentiate or add to Google’s Android Wear software, affordability is what the company seems to be betting on.\nSamsung, however, adds more substance than style. While the Gear S2 has a 1.2-inch diameter touchscreen, you can also rotate the unfortunately named Rotary UX around the screen to move between the apps or menus. It’s similar to Apple’s Digital Crown but I actually found it more fun and natural to use.\nSamsung Gear S2. Drew Evans / The Wall Street Journal\nInterestingly, that interface is not powered by Google’s Android Wear but Samsung’s own homebrewed Tizen software. It seems smartly designed, and while some have pointed out the similarities between the design of the app screen and the Apple Watch, navigating the S2’s app screen and interface actually feels simpler.\nSpeaking of apps, during the demo Samsung showed off Uber, Nike+ and even the WSJ’s own news app, but whether the company will gain enough third-party support for its smaller platform remains to be seen.\nThat said, while the as-yet-unpriced Gear S2 is nicer looking than Samsung’s six other smartwatch attempts, it still looks more like a big scuba sporty watch than a fine piece of jewelry. The Gear S2 Classic, which is available with a stainless steel case, ceramic bezel and leather bands, is a better effort but unlike the Moto 360 will have a very tough time appealing to us females.\nSamsung Gear S2 and Gear S2 Classic. Drew Evans / The Wall Street Journal\nStill, both companies seem to have figured out that the battle for smartwatch dominance is nothing like the one for the smartphone: It has absolutely nothing to do with tech specs. Instead, it has everything to do with creating something as attractive and inconspicuous as a regular watch with some strong smarts.\nBoth will need to keep working on those smarts. After all, beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but brains aren’t.\nThis story was first published in The Wall Street Journal.", "external_links": ["http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/08/31/samsungs-gear-s2-watch-has-a-round-face-cellular-connection/", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KC921_Moto36_G_20150902112811.jpg", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/moto-360-review-one-size-doesnt-fit-all-1409896802", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD462_Samsun_G_20150903120744.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD465_SamGea_G_20150903121045.jpg", "http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/09/02/new-moto-360-smartwatch-focuses-on-fashion-fitness-and-females/"], "published": "2015-09-04T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:56:50.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
