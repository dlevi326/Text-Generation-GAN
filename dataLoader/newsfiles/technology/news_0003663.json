Where it eventually came to rest was nearly 50 metres from the roadway,” he said.\n“Medics faced a considerable challenge of darkness and the need to locate all the patients, some of whom were missing after being flung from the wreckage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T14:08:51.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
