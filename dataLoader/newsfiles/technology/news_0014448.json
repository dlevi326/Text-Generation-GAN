Six of the eight also had the amyloid buildup that is a tell-tale sign of Alzheimer’s. \n“This is the first evidence of real-world transmission of amyloid pathology,” John Hardy, a University College London molecular neuroscientist, reportedly told the journal . “It is potentially concerning.” \nThe hormone treatments were administered to people who were short in height. The samples were taken from cadavers’ pituitary glands – but they were inadvertently contaminated with prions. The treatments started in 1958, and were halted in 1985 due to reports of Creutzfeldt-Jakob. By the year 2000, 38 of the patients had developed the disease. By 2012, the number had grown to 450 cases among the recipients of the cadaver-derived HGH and some other medical procedures, like transplants and brain surgery. \n\"This is potentially very important research,” added Mike Hanna, Director of the UCL Institute of Neurology . “It could inform our understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease and will enable new programs of world-leading research in dementia.” \nThe extent to which prions may be “catching” has yet to be settled. The study last week showed that the newly-understood Multiple System Atrophy could be spread by direct contact with re-used surgical instruments . \n“You can’t kill a protein, and it can stick tightly to stainless steel, even when the surgical instrument is cleaned,” said Kurt Giles, a University of California at San Francisco researcher and one of the authors of that MSA study. “As a result, we’re advocating a precautionary approach.” \nBrain-eating cannibals from Papua New Guinea were the subject of a June study analyzing their genetic adaptations allowing them to survive a prion disease called kuru. Their genetic information may still hold cures or treatments to diseases like Alzheimer’s. \nThe authors of the newest paper on the hormone spread of Creutzfeldt-Jakob were also cautious in pointing out particular dangers. \n“Our findings relate to the specific circumstance of cadaver-derived human growth hormone injections, a treatment that was discontinued many years ago,” said John Collinge, one of the UCL authors. “It is possible our findings might be relevant to some other medical or surgical procedures, but evaluating what risk, if any, there might be requires much further research. Our current data have no bearing on dental surgery and certainly do not argue that dentistry poses a risk of Alzheimer’s disease.\" Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T03:57:43.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
