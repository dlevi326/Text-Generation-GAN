I used to be very active on News24, writing articles or letters and commenting on a wide range of subjects from Rugby to Politics.\nI started noticing fake accounts start creeping in owned by trolls who were hell bent on ruining the comment sections of News24. If I remember correctly it started in the rugby section.\nWe used to have fantastic well thought out debates about all rugby that was current and a small group of fake accounts absolutely ruined it for everyone, so I stopped commenting.\nThen the same thing started happening on the news site with political stories being hi-jacked by party trolls. So I stopped commenting there.\nThe fact is I used to be very active and loved the comments section, now I hardly use news24 because of how bad the comments section is this leaves me with a dilemma! Comments are vitally important, we want to know what people think and I would probably still stay away from News24 without comments.\nI think your challenge is not to stop comments but to create a more secure comment section with users needed to sign up as members. With consequences for actions.\nI am sure most of the trolls would disappear with more stringent rules in place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:28:27.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
