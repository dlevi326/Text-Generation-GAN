Rosier’s mother “cried when I first got in,” he said. “She almost cried when I got hit, too. … I was like, ‘Mom, it’s football. I’m going to get hit.’ ”\nDana Hudson, who traveled from Mobile., Ala. said her “heart skipped a beat … a few times” when her son entered the game. She felt “excitement, concern, joyfulness, and nervousness.\n“I then stopped and prayed in my seat,” she said.\nRosier was one of 26 players made their Hurricanes’ debut in last Saturday’s 45-0 win against Bethune-Cookman. Most of them were playing college football for the first time.\nAmong the 12 true freshmen, the standouts were running back Mark Walton, who rushed for 85 yards and a 5-yard touchdown on 10 carries and nose tackle Kendrick Norton (sack).\nRosier, who went 1-for-4 with an 11-yard completion, but led touchdown drives on two of the three series he played in the weather-shortened second half.\n“It was a dream come true to finally get in the game,” said Rosier, 6-foot-2 and 215 pounds. “We were very base, but the offense performed very well. The coaches prepared us as if we were going to start.”\nCoach Al Golden called his freshman class – which was rated 23rd nationally by ESPN, 26th by Rivals, 27th by 247Sports and 39th by Scout – a “very bright group.”\n“The thing that was exciting for me is that you can talk to [cornerback] Michael Jackson during the game,” Golden said. “We were making adjustments with him. [Safety] Quan Johnson, we were making adjustments with him.\n“Sheldrick Redwine is really bright. And he could be exhausted – he could have just covered the kick, and he could come off breathing [hard], and he just looks you right in the eye, and you can speak to him. I thought those guys did well.\n“[Guard Tyler] Gauthier went in there and did well. [Tackle] Tyree St. Louis really improved. Of course, Mark [Walton] has been like that.” Golden also mentioned Norton, defensive end R.J. McIntosh, linebackers James King and Charles Perry, and redshirt freshman H-back David Njoku.\n“They should make such improvement this week,” Golden said.\nThere were plenty of firsts among returning players, too. Junior tight end Stan Dobard caught his first touchdown pass. Sophomore linebacker Marques Gayot, from Park Vista High, recorded his first tackles for loss. He finished with 2.5, including 1.5 sacks.\nTwo players who missed 2014 because of injuries, senior receiver Rayshawn Scott and junior safety Rayshawn Jenkins, came back strong. Scott recorded a game-high 100 yards and a touchdown catch – his first since 2012 – and Jenkins intercepted his first pass since 2013.\nThen there’s offensive lineman Hunter Knighton, a redshirt sophomore who made his UM debut 19 months after a near-death experience with heat stroke.\n“It was amazing finally getting back out there,” said Knighton, the second-string center. “It’s weird – I kind of forgot how that felt, being able to run around and play football again in a game situation. It was just amazing. I was blown away.”\nWalton, UM’s most highly regarded freshman, said he was “more excited than nervous” about his debut. He showed his ability to dance around defenders and hurdle them, if need be. He scored his 5-yard touchdown when he made one cut at the line of scrimmage and plunged into a sizable hole.\n“I was waiting on that for the longest time,” he said.\nFRIDAY’S GAME\nMiami at Florida Atlantic\n8 p.m., FS1\n</p", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/09/09/1b/8d/kendrick-norton-bethune.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:44:45.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
