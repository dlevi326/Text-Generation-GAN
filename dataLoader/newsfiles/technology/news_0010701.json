A spokesperson for Ola did not comment on a Techcircle.in query. \nSources suggested that Ola Share has been in pilot stage for one month. A formal launch is expected next week. Ola Share will be available in five metro cities in the initial phase. \nOla Share is said to be similar to Uber’s UberPool, which will be launched in India next month. Uber had claimed that its carpooling option would be cheaper than using and maintaining a personal car. \nThe service will be highly localised and users can split fare with people they share the ride with. \nEarlier this month, Meru Cab Company Pvt Ltd, one of India’s oldest radio taxi firms, ventured into the carpooling space by launching a new service for customers travelling to the same area. \nThough there are a number of ride-sharing apps in the market, Meru was the first taxi company to venture into this nascent but highly advocated business. \nOnline travel group Ibibo had launched a car-pooling app named Ryde in April. \nWestBridge Capital-backed Carzonrent India Pvt Ltd, which runs radio cab services besides offering self-drive car rental and fleet management services, recently acquired Bangalore-based 42 Solutions Pvt Ltd, which runs a ride sharing app RidingO. \nAccel Partners and Index Ventures-backed online carpooling venture BlaBlaCar forayed into India in January while Rocket Internet-backed carpooling firm Tripda entered the country last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T07:29:21.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
