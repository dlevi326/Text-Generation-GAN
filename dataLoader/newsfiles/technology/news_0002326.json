These are claimed to allow enterprises to more efficiently allocate resources, increase operation quality, improve business efficiency and strengthen risk management and control across their entire operation. \nFor its part, Huawei is providing GDCATV with its Hyper-Converged Infrastructure FusionCube and cloud OS FusionSphere enterprise product family that encompasses both hardware such as servers, storage, security, and networking, and software including virtual computing, cloud computing, and cloud management. \n“Ensuring that business processes such as budget planning and administration are consistent across our operation is critical to our expansion plans for an integrated cable network, and to provide increasingly sophisticated digital services to our clients,” said Zhong Mingge, director of Enterprise Information Technology, GDCATV. \n“Accenture’s proven financial performance management assets and knowledge of the communications service provider (CSP) industry, combined with Huawei’s enhanced infrastructure solutions will enable us to realise operational efficiencies and deliver an excellent customer experience.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T10:48:09.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
