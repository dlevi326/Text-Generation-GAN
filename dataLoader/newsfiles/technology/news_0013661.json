(Eric Risberg/AP) Apple breaks with past in fragmenting updates from old devices SHANE DINGMAN TECHNOLOGY REPORTER — The Globe and Mail \nPublished Wednesday, Sep. 09, 2015 5:55PM EDT \nLast updated Wednesday, Sep. 09, 2015 11:06PM EDT \nEver since Steve Jobs shocked the world in 2007 with the first iPhone, one of the hallmarks of Apple Inc.’s mobile devices has been simplicity. On Wednesday, Apple broke that paradigm in some pretty significant ways. \nAll three of the major hardware announcements on Wednesday – Apple TV, iPad Pro and the iPhone 6S – mark a break from the Apple operating system and hardware profiles of the devices that immediately preceded them, and also from each other. And that’s the catch: Consumers who want to use the new features will have to buy new products, rather than download free upgrades for older models, further buffeting Apple’s already deeply entrenched market lead in premium mobile device sales. Android may outsell Apple, but Apple outearns its competitors by a hefty margin on every unit sold. connect with us The Globe and Mail Newspaper \nNewspaper delivered to your doorstep. subscribe Globe Unlimited \nDigital all access pass across devices. subscribe The Globe and Mail App \nThe New Globe and Mail App for iPhone®, iPad® and Apple Watch download Globe2Go \nThe digital replica of our newspaper. subscribe Globe eBooks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T05:21:06.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
