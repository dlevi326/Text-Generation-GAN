Kids nowadays can learn any language effortlessly due to the availability of teaching materials and methods that makes learning much easier compared in the previous years. Given the fact that more and more people are becoming fond of travelling overseas to widen their knowledge when it comes to studying language to break the barriers of communication – for Coderversity there’s another language that children should learn – that is how to code .\nThe Hour of Code campaign might be one of the influential movement in encouraging the younger generation to learn to code . However, much encouragement for children to learn to code should come first from their family, particularly from their parents as they have much more influence to their children. Contrary to the belief that coding is only applicable to people who are good in math, the truth is, anyone can learn how to code. Coderversity, one of the institutions who actively supports the “Learn to Code” campaign believes that through coding, people can make their life much better now that everything in this world is digital.\nEven the new Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, believes in the power of code literacy where every nation will become agile, more innovative and creative. Learning how to code is never that daunting as this is analogous to the written versions of human languages but is made simpler - it only requires expression without worrying for any ambiguity.\nLike the English and any other language, codes have a defining grammar. It comes with equivalent dictionaries of the parts of speech, along with the phrase patterns, conditionals, conjunctions, and clauses. Although the dictionaries are lesser extensive compared to those of the human languages when it comes to pattern rendering nature of the grammar, it comes in the same purpose.\nWhat is good about having kids learn to code at their tender age is that they will be able to gain great appreciation on computational thinking and logical thought. This appreciation in turn will help them develop good critical thinking skills that would make their learning as they age meaningful. In fact, it could be their life skills kit in the near future as the world becomes even more digitalized in the coming years. And learning to code only takes good encouragement from the parents.\nTo learn more about coding and how it could make a difference, visit http://www.coderversity.com.\nAbout Coderversity\nCoderversity is an intensive, comprehensive programming boot camp program where you can learn the design and architecture techniques that are necessary to become successful software, the web, or mobile developer.
