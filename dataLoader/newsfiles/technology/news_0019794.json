(NYSE:MXL), a leading provider of integrated radio frequency (RF) and mixed-signal integrated circuits for broadband communications applications, and Wistron NeWeb Corp. (WNC), an industry leader in the design and manufacturing of advanced wireless communication products, today announced that Sky Italia will begin deployment of a new digital channel stacking low noise block (LNB) downconverter based on the industry-leading MxL803 Ku-band satellite down-conversion RF IC and MxL862 channel-stacking system on chip (SoC). \nMaxLinear, WNC and Sky Italia have been collaborating on the joint development of this LNB over the last couple of years. Sky Italia’s stamp of approval and launch of this LNB highlights a key milestone for the companies and opens the door for a market-wide adoption of digital channel stacking technology by other operators. \nThe new LNB leverages MaxLinear’s turnkey protocol software, which gives Sky Italia the ability to dynamically allocate channels using the EN50494 and EN50607 standard DiSEqC control protocols. As Sky Italia upgrades or expands its transponder capacity, the LNB can be easily reconfigured to accommodate new channel line-ups. \nThe concurrent operation of multiple DiSEqC protocols provides complete flexibility to Sky Italia for seamlessly deploying advanced multi-channel set-top boxes and media servers while ensuring coexistence with legacy receivers connected to the same coax cable. \n“Consumer demands are changing rapidly as there is an increased desire for more flexibility to watch individualized content on any device at any time. Sky Italia wants to be the first choice consumers turn to for these flexible services,” said Giuseppe Ioculano, Head of Installation Technology Development at Sky Italia. “This new LNB provides the ultimate in flexibility to allow us to meet the goals of managing legacy set-top boxes and introducing exciting new functionalities, whilst at the same time supporting our need for single-cable technology.” \n“This LNB uses the latest technology to provide a more cost-effective solution that enables Sky Italia to reduce installation costs and meet the needs of consumers,” said TJ Chen, head of the DBS Business Unit from WNC. “This project has been in development for some time, and its deployment in the Sky Italia network will show the industry just how impactful digital channel stacking technology can be.” \n“Partnering with WNC and Sky Italia has been an opportunity for MaxLinear to lead an industry- changing shift in technology to digital channel stacking,” said Yves Rasse, Senior Director, Consumer Product Line for MaxLinear. “The turnkey solution based on MxL803 and MxL862 is a great choice because it combines two of our most impactful satellite technologies – Ku-band down-conversion and Full-Spectrum Capture™– to provide the configurable digital LNB platform required for next-generation satellite systems.” \nMxL803 and MxL862 Technical Details \nThe MxL803 RF IC is the industry’s first monolithic Ku-band down-converter implemented in digital CMOS. The single-chip solution helps eliminate dozens of discrete components, including the image reject filter, thus improving system reliability and eliminating the need for performance tuning in production. \nThe digital phase-lock loop (PLL)-based implementation allows operators to achieve channel drift performance of +/- 0.5MHz, compared to +/- 2MHz for a traditional dielectric resonator oscillator (DRO)-based implementation, resulting in higher usable bandwidth per channel without incurring additional costs. \nThe MxL862 is a field-proven, market-leading, digital channel-stacking SoC optimized for single-feed satellite platforms. Based on MaxLinear’s ultra-low power Full-Spectrum Capture technology, the MxL862 integrates a bank of programmable channel select filters enabling a stacked output of more than 32 channels. The device can also be configured in universal L-band switch mode for backward compatibility with legacy STBs and with dish alignment measurement equipment typically used by installers. \nAbout Wistron NeWeb Corp. \nWistron NeWeb Corporation (WNC) is an industry leader in the design and manufacturing of advanced communication products.
