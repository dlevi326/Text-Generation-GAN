Tinder users swipe 1.8 billion times per day, resulting in more than 26 million matches per day and over 8 billion matches made since Tinder launched in 2012. Tinder's Interana instance has passed the trillion rows of event data threshold, so being able to obtain insights in seconds with Interana vs. the hours it used to take has proven invaluable. Interana's speed, scale and simplicity of use is unlike any other solution available, enabling Tinder to use data more effectively in its daily workflow. \nUsing Interana's simple and flexible behavioral tools, Tinder is able to quickly understand user behavior, reasons for conversion and retention, root cause, as well as types of connections made. This understanding enables Tinder to develop desired features, like Super Like and Tinder Plus' Rewind button and Passport features. \n\"We considered a range of popular analytics options, but none could offer us the speed, scalability and flexibility of Interana and still be truly self-service for both general business users and data analysts,\" said Dan Gould, VP of Technology at Tinder. \"It's all about improving the Tinder app and we need very rapid behavioral analytics to do that. The two big wins of Interana are that's it's so fast and the user interface is surprisingly simple given how much you can do.\" \nTinder employees across a number of different departments, including engineering and marketing, use Interana to gain insights into user behavior to improve the core experience. Hard at work improving the recommendation algorithm, Tinder has found that behaviors are different across genders, orientations and ages in different locations. For example: Brazil's youth may use the app to meet new friends 2014 World Cup boosted use in Brazil by 50% U.S. and U.K. users 25-34 use the app to meet new people for travel, dating, and marriage \nBy using Interana's behavior-based tools -- like funnels, cohorts, metrics and sessions -- for visual and interactive ad hoc exploration and discovery of data, Tinder's product team is able to identify key user behaviors. For instance, using Interana, the team realized that a small percentage of users were swiping right on every profile, potentially decreasing the value of matches. As a result, when company launched Tinder Plus shortly after, it also introduced a limit in right swipes each user could perform each day. Since implementing the change, the quality of matches has increased dramatically. \n\"With the need for quick analytics and data growing so rapidly, analytics solutions need to scale. At the same time, data shouldn't be so complicated that only highly trained engineers can ask questions and draw conclusions. Our customers, including Tinder, are experiencing dramatic growth, and with it, a boom in data. Managing and analyzing that data is fundamental to understanding their customers and optimizing the user experience,\" said Ann Johnson, co-founder and CEO of Interana. \"Interana provides a behavioral analytics solution that's not only powerful and scalable enough to accommodate enormous waves of data, but is also simple and enables true self-service regardless of an employee's skillset. For a company like Tinder where data is paramount, that ease of use is a critical.\" \nTo read the full case study, please visit: http://go.interana.com/tinder-case-study.html . \nAbout Tinder Launched in 2012, Tinder is the world's leading social app for meeting new people.
