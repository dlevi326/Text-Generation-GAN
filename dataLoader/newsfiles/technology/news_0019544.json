There are a lot of genetic factors that cause testicular cancer which we are yet to find - so the first step must be to identify the genetic drivers of testicular cancer so we can develop new ways to prevent it.\"\nAlong with genetics, environmental and behavioural factors split the risk of developing cancer between them.\nThe study by UK, US, German and Swedish scientists, published in the journal Scientific Reports, analysed the risk of testicular germ cell tumours - the most common type of testicular cancer - in two different ways.\nIt used statistical analysis to examine patterns of ancestral testicular cancer in families in the 15.7 million people-strong Swedish Population Registry cancer family database, which included 9,324 cases of testicular cancer.\nIt then examined the genetic code of 6,000 British men from two previous testicular cancer studies, 986 of whom had been diagnosed with the disease.\nThe combined analysis revealed that 49% of all the possible factors contributing to testicular cancer risk are inherited.\nIt found that the inherited risk comes from a large number of minor variations in DNA code, rather than one faulty gene with a big effect.\nThe scientists said the study, funded by the Movember Foundation, the ICR and Cancer Research UK is the largest to explore testicular germ cell tumours in detail.\nSam Gledhill, the Movember Foundation's global manager for testicular cancer programmes, said: \"These discoveries help to unlock the mysteries of this relatively poorly understood cancer and may ultimately identify potential treatment targets to fight this disease.\"\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror"], "published": "2015-09-10T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:47:04.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
