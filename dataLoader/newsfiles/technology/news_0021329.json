She also loves reading (and has a stack of books at her bedside to prove it). You can often tell a lot by the books people read, or don’t. Here is what the city’s number one has been getting stuck into:\n* How South Africa Works (by Jeffrey Herbst and Greg Mills)\nSome people like to think of the Western Cape as a country of its own. But this book looks at South Africa as a whole and reviews its major economic achievements in the last 20 years. It also taps into the minds of politicians, business leaders and analysts. Heavy reading? Not so, says the mayor. “It is not serious reading but I think it is a very important book because it is very up to date with stats and so on.”", "external_links": ["http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/681/85229a9dbccd4af3ba40e2deaf2c1173.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-04T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:12:18.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
