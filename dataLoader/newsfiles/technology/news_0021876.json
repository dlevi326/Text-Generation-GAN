I think our views in this regard are similar.\" \nThe Central Asian country hosted an unsuccessful round of talks on Iran's nuclear programme in 2013. \nIran and six world powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- finally reached a landmark agreement in July on limiting Tehran's nuclear drive. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:02:41.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
