The eclipse comes to 27 September in some parts of west. Some months before and after also, the impact remains. Already in few months past, these have hit the headlines of newspapers: migrant refugee crisis in Europe, global economy slowdown, volcano eruptions, huge tragedy in holy shrine of Mecca, devastating 8.3 magnitude earthquake in Chile, massive fire in California and elsewhere, threats of war by different countries, burning Middle East, unprecedented happenings in Japan, China and Thailand, danger to food crops by drought, floods, inhospitable weather and storms.\nIt looks as if there is widespread environment of uncertainty. Are these uncommon or unusual happenings not a sign of said phenomena on 27 September 2015? But if by these phenomenon, world coming to an end or total extinction of mankind is meant, this writer does not subscribe to that opinion or prediction.\nMankind is undoubtedly passing through tougher, harder and critical times which may likely cause before midâ€“2016 wider damage or harm but no end time of mankind is predicted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T18:07:53.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
