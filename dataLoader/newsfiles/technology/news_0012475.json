However, much less is currently understood about how regional climate change will unfold. \nThe new, groundbreaking collaborative report suggests climate change at the regional scale could be much more diverse - with shifting rainfall patterns, changes in the frequency of storms and increases in the frequency of extreme events. \nThe international team of authors has reviewed the literature on regional climate change and has highlighted some of the different factors that can affect weather and climate. \nIn middle-latitudes, climate is largely determined by highly variable weather in storm tracks and jet streams. These introduce considerable uncertainty into model projections of future change. \nIn the tropics, the atmosphere and ocean behave in concert, for example in the emerging El Niño event in the Pacific. There needs to be a focus on understanding that coupling and how it is impacted by climate change. \nTheir findings are published in the journal Nature Climate Change . \nProfessor Mat Collins from the University of Exeter's Mathematics department and one of the authors of the article said: \"In the UK we are influenced by many different types of weather, from winter storms to summer heat waves. This makes it really difficult to predict how future climate change will play out. \n\"Planning by society to adapt to the impact of climate change requires information about the spatial variability of change. Much of this information is, as yet, unreliable. \nThere is an urgent need to provide quantitative but reliable information about spatial variability in future climate that is consistent with the global projections from models.\" USDA chief: Climate change already hurting farmers February 5, 2014 \nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack says he's convinced the effects of climate change have already had a negative impact on agriculture and forestry in the U.S. Society has been discussing climate change's impacts long before we knew it existed July 9, 2015 \nFor the first time, a new analysis shows an impact of climate change on human society long before we knew the climate was actually changing. New book argues that social sciences are critical to climate conversation August 21, 2015 \nPope Francis recently made an impassioned plea for a \"cultural revolution\" to combat climate change, calling for collective action and \"a conversation which includes everyone.\" Climate impacts on marine biodiversity August 24, 2015 \nNew research into the impact of climate change has found that warming oceans will cause profound changes in the global distribution of marine biodiversity. Existing crop models can forecast yield in uncertain climate conditions August 27, 2015 \nA study led by Indiana State Climatologist Dev Niyogi of Purdue University has determined that existing crop models can reliably forecast corn yields during times of climate variability, specifically the El Niño and La Niña ... Bringing together storm tracks and clouds September 9, 2015 \nWe often talk about future climate change in terms of \"global warming.\" But when it comes to the impacts of global warming, regional changes in winds and precipitation are more relevant. The latter depend on how the circulation ... Recommended for you Metal-eating microbes in African lake could solve mystery of the planet's iron deposits September 9, 2015 \nAn isolated, iron-rich bay in the heart of East Africa is offering scientists a rare glimpse back into Earth's primitive marine environment, and supports theories that tiny microbes created some of the world's largest ore ... Ocean life triggers ice formation in clouds September 9, 2015 \nResearchers have shown for the first time that phytoplankton (plant life) in remote ocean regions can contribute to rare airborne particles that trigger ice formation in clouds. Results published this week (Wednesday 9 September) ... Study proves pipeline replacement programs are effective September 9, 2015 \nInvisible gas leaks from aging or damaged pipelines cost U.S. consumers billions of dollars every year, contribute to global warming, and, in rare cases, cause dangerous explosions. But pipeline replacement programs in cities ... September 9, 2015 \nResearchers have discovered how tectonic plates first collided in one of the world's largest deep sea trenches. Study: Are we shifting to fewer, weaker Atlantic hurricanes? September 7, 2015 \nA new but controversial study asks if an end is coming to the busy Atlantic hurricane seasons of recent decades. Researchers find unintended consequences of geoengineering to slow climate change September 9, 2015 \nLike the leaves of New England maples, phytoplankton, the microalgae at the base of most oceanic food webs, photosynthesize when exposed to sunlight. In the process, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, converting ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:29:29.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
