Low-lying hazes in some areas that suggest the weather changes daily on Pluto as it does on Earth. Evidence of a glacial cycle similar to the one on Earth that builds up glaciers and then sees them flowing into the sea. In this small section of the larger crescent image of Pluto, the setting sun illuminates a fog or near-surface haze, which is cut by the parallel shadows of many local hills and small mountains. (NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI) \nThe main differences between natural cycles involving glaciers on Earth and on Pluto is that the glaciers on Pluto are made of frozen nitrogen, not water, and scientists aren't sure whether a liquid is involved, said Alan Howard, a University of Virginia planetary scientist who is on the New Horizons geology, geophysics and imaging team, in an email to CBC News. \nIce appears to be evaporating from one area of an icy plain known as \"Sputnik Planum. \" After travelling tens to hundreds of kilometres through the atmosphere, It's re-deposited to the east, \"probably as frost.\" \nHe added in a statement, \"We did not expect to find hints of a nitrogen-based glacial cycle on Pluto operating in the frigid conditions of the outer solar system.\" QUIZ | 10 questions about the mighty dwarf planet Pluto \nAs on Earth, this cycle is thought to be driven by the sun, even though the sun is far dimmer on Pluto which is on average 40 times farther away from the sun than Earth. A backlit view highlights the intricate flow lines on the glaciers on Pluto. Ice that appears to have accumulated on the uplands on the right side is draining from Pluto's mountains onto the informally named Sputnik Planum through the three to eight-kilometere wide valleys indicated by the red arrows. The flow front of the ice moving into Sputnik Planum is indicated by the blue arrows.
