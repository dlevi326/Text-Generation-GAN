It produces a nominal initial short-wave UV (254 nm) intensity of 46,000 µW/cm 2 to ensure quick and complete erasure of programmed memory from every EPROM chip or wafer. This high-efficiency unit can complete an erasing cycle in just 4 minutes . \nThe PC-4420A utilizes four high-intensity, ozone-free, mercury vapor quartz grid lamp assemblies mounted on specular aluminum reflectors. Powerful internal cooling fans control the cabinet temperature to ensure optimum UV intensity, maintain uniform output and provide reliable erasing conditions. The fans also prolong the life of the grid lamps. \nThe cabinet's large drawer has a large load capacity of 336 individual 24-pin EPROMs. It can also accommodate PC boards, metric cards and silicon wafers, as well as open-faced stocking tubes. A removable tray insert is height adjustable to maintain ideal UV exposure distance. Optional tray inserts are available to accommodate either 6 in (152 mm) or 8 in (203 mm) wafers. A safety interlock prevents operation unless the loading drawer is fully closed. \nHeadquartered in Westbury, New York, Spectronics Corporation invented fluorescent leak detection in 1955, and remains the world's leading manufacturer of ultraviolet equipment and fluorescent dyes. Spectroline ® cutting-edge, top-quality, industry-awarded lamps, dyes, radiometers and diagnostic tools are built to exacting standards, and are used for literally dozens of markets, some of which include Industrial, Air Conditioning & Refrigeration, Laboratory, Semiconductor, Nondestructive Testing and Forensics. Spectronics Corporation is dedicated to upholding high standards in design manufacturing, ensuring customer satisfaction and developing innovative technologies that make the world a better place.
