Mr. Manjoo is off this week, so Mr. Isaac is conversing with fellow tech reporter Quentin Hardy. Mike: Hello, Farhad! How are you do ... — wait a minute. You aren’t Farhad. You’re my very intelligent colleague, Quentin Hardy! What are you doing here, and what have you done with Farhad? Quentin : The working theory is that we have reached Peak Manjoo, and from now we on must ration his wisdom wisely so it lasts longer. I will try to drop something like his wisdom bombs. Mike: Okey-doke. So, it has been a strange week in tech, though I think I say that every week, so I guess it has been a normal week in tech. We’re all still on the lookout for who will take the chief executive position at Twitter , a process that seems to be moving about as fast as the Iran deal did. China’s stock market is basically imploding, which I guess is also bad for American tech start-ups. Oh, and McDonald’s is now serving breakfast all day , which is really much bigger news than any of this other tech stuff combined. But as you are this week’s substitute Farhad, I leave it to you to set the topics of discussion. What’s tickling your fancy this week? Quentin: Like almost everyone, I’m wiggling my toes in the wading pool and nursing an appropriate beverage as the Labor Day holiday calls an unofficial end to summer. Traditionally, college students pack off for school, new cars and fashions show up and we all get back to business. In tech, it means we start a round of conferences and product announcements, maybe even a few big deals. Usually we ease into these events nice and calmly, but not this year — and not just because Apple is having a bunch of product announcements next week. You know, Apple has these big announcements, real rolling-thunder stuff. Amazon seems to like it the other way around. Out of nowhere on Tuesday, they announced that Prime members could now download (some) movies and TV shows to iOS and Android devices. In order to watch programming offline previously, you had to have an Amazon Fire tablet, so this gives Amazon a much bigger potential customer base. It’s a pretty huge deal, if Amazon can negotiate a decent inventory of titles. And it brings the pain to Netflix, which hasn’t been interested in offering offline media.

On Saturdays, you will receive a roundup of the week’s news from Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac. Mike: This is cool! If only I used Amazon to watch movies. At this point, I’m basically beholden to Netflix — by the way, their new show “Narcos” is awesome. So even with all the cool little features, I only buy an Amazon flick every once in a while. Amazon’s big problem is people like me: People who don’t register “media” when they think of Amazon. They think about diapers and dog treats. Which reminds me, I need to buy more Greenies for my dog. Quentin: I’m just starting “Narcos.” Don’t tell me how it ends! \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T19:20:37.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
