Employers, and others with whom the badge is shared, can instantly verify the skills and competencies achieved to earn the AXELOS badges. \nPeter Hepworth, chief executive of AXELOS, said, \"Acclaim digital badges are an innovative way to manage, track and represent the relevancy of our best practice qualification holders who complete CPD activities. This new approach will support our community of practitioners' progress in their careers and demonstrate their commitment to staying up-to-date and relevant in a way that can be easily recognized and verified.\" \n\"We are thrilled to be working with AXELOS to further its commitment to best practice which promotes and advocates ongoing training and development to enhance employability, both for individuals and organizations,\" said Clarke Porter, vice president and general manager of credential services for Pearson VUE. \"Through Acclaim, AXELOS has been able to quickly and efficiently scale its badging program.\" \nAbout Pearson Pearson ( www.pearson.com ) is the world's leading education company, providing educational materials, technologies, assessments and related services to teachers and students of all ages.
