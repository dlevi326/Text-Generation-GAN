It’s just that they are taking an unusual route towards it. - Advertisement - \nWe have seen how Oppo has done it before where the primary camera can be rotated to become the secondary camera that is quite cool. The physical camera is just one aspect of it; it has a few other supporting settings to make it an awesome selfie camera. We will explore more of that in a short while. \nFor Huawei, the Honor 7 represented an expensive 5-inch flagship device that the Honor 7i seems to be improving on. \nWell for a start, it dishes away with its metal body (presumably to reduce cost) but the slim and lightweight. It has a body measurement of 141.6 x 71.2 x 7.8 mm (5.57 x 2.80 x 0.31 in) and weighs just 160 g (5.64 oz), which is great. Then there’s the fingerprint sensor that makes a comeback that is great news as well. You can use it to unlock the device and for more serious stuff like authorizing payment as part of the biometric system. \nScreen-wise, it gets an upgrade from being a 5-inch to a 5.2-inch Full HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~424 ppi pixel density. This upgrade in screen allows you more space to work on, and you should enjoy the IPS technology as well. \nUnder the hood of the Honor 7i, is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising Quad-core 1.7 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53 and Adreno 405 graphics. There are two variants available, with 2GB memory tied with 16GB storage and 3GB memory with 32GB storage. Should you feel the price difference isn’t that much, and then by all means you should be getting the higher-end model. - Advertisement - \nNow we’ve come to the best part about the Honor 7i, the rotating camera. Featuring a 13 Megapixel camera with 4208 x 3120 pixels, autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama, you can rotate its lens at many angles until it is facing you and becomes just like a secondary camera. Produced by Sony, it has an f/2.0 aperture and a 28mm wide-angle lens, plus it’s covered in sapphire crystal which makes it scratch-resistant. Remember the fingerprint sensor just now? It is placed at the side instead of the back of the device as usual, and this could also double up to snap a photo. \nAs mentioned earlier, there are two variants when it comes to storage – 16GB and 32GB. Not to fret, as it also has a microSD slot that can take in up to a maximum of 128GB should you need to expand further. In case you do so, you will then have to sacrifice the 2 nd sim slot. \nIn terms of battery, the Honor 7i is powered by a non-removable Li-Po 3100 mAh battery that should have no issues supplying enough juice to it for at least a day or two in between charging. \nThe latest Android Lollipop 5.1 accompanies its release together which comes with Emotion UI 3.1. \nTo top it all off, there’s 4G LTE connectivity and dual sim capability which is a nice addition. - Advertisement - \nAll said and done; Huawei Honor 7i seems to be what the Honor 7 should be from the start. It comes with a larger screen, rotating camera lens, minus the metal body and is cheaper as well. \nHuawei Honor 7i is currently available in China for approximately $299 for the 16GB model. It is available in black, white and gold. News From", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T08:31:30.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
