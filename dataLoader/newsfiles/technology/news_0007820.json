The post, which has been vacant since the untimely death of Collins Chabane in March this year, is a critical one in shaping the \"state\" of the state, especially so in the current climate.\nThe new minister, Ngoako Ramatlhodi, is an experienced politician who in his former post in mineral resources demonstrated an impressive ability to grasp the issues facing the mining industry and bring stakeholders together to seek solutions.\nThose attributes should stand him in good stead in his new portfolio, which is just as challenging. Spending on the public service has ballooned over the past few years — personnel costs now make up about 40% of noninterest spending, and it’s not as if we have high-quality public service and effective service delivery to show for it.\nIn this year’s public sector wage deal, government ended up awarding increases that over three years will cost it up to R66bn more than it had budgeted for. As revenues are likely to fall short, it will be put under significant fiscal strain.\nThe government is committed to stick to its self-imposed limit on spending growth and part of that, Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene emphasised in his February Budget speech, is \"a consolidation of government personnel numbers\".\nWhile the Treasury is the paymaster, it is public service and administration that is the policy department and Mr Ramatlhodi’s challenge will be to put the cap on numbers in a way that enhances the quality of the public service. He will have to deal with the strong public sector trade unions and try to get everyone to commit to better, rather than bigger government.\nWe wish him well. But we, and almost everyone apart from President Jacob Zuma, are a lot less confident that Mr Ramatlhodi’s replacement, Mosebenzi Zwane, is the right person for the job. The appointment of a complete outsider to so critical a post is, frankly, scandalous. It reflects a disregard for the numerous challenges in the mining sector. It is seldom that a new minister is greeted with such shock.\nCabinet ministers do not necessarily have to be experts on their sectors. They should, however, have worked their way up the political ranks to positions of some seniority and authority and have meaningful experience in government. They should also have demonstrated their ability to lead, and to grasp the complex issues involved in a ministerial portfolio. In other words, they should have some gravitas. That is particularly so in the case of a portfolio such as mining, which is critical to the economy and to investor confidence.\nIt’s not clear that Mr Zwane, who spent just a short stint in Parliament as Free State provincial MEC for agriculture, has any of the attributes.\nThat’s even without the very large question marks hanging over his head because he is understood to be a good friend of the politically connected Gupta family. Mr Zwane takes over an industry that is in crisis. Commodity prices have plummeted, putting the sustainability of many mines in question, and with China’s economy slowing and no sign of an upturn in the commodity price cycle any time soon, there are some tough choices to be made in mining.\nAdded to the industry’s price woes are rapidly climbing costs, particularly electricity. It’s a challenging labour and safety environment. And hanging over it all is the uncertainty about transformation in the industry, which is being tested in court.\nBusiness, labour and the government have shown an ability to come together in response to the challenges. We can only hope that the new minister is able to listen carefully, learn fast and rise to the occasion.\nMany are not confident that newcomer Mosebenzi Zwane is the right person for mineral resources minister", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:21:54.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
