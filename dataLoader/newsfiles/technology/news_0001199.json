When I accepted the Co-CEO position, our goal was for me to develop a solid investor relations strategy for the company, provide operational support, and assist with cash management. I am personally very excited about the progress we have made and our last quarter showed a $130,865 positive net income, which shows we are trending in the right direction. It's very rewarding knowing that we are on the right track as a company, and I feel comfortable stepping down knowing the company is in safe hands. I will continue to be actively involved in the company as Director, shareholder, and advocate but the demands of my construction company require me to reduce my time commitment to PCS.\" \nRobert Grover added, \"In his eight months as Co-CEO, Todd Hackett has been invaluable to the PCS family. He has fulfilled his goal in supporting operations, developing shareholder awareness, and improving our financial footing. On behalf of the Board of Directors and myself, we want to convey that we are deeply appreciative of Mr. Hackett for his dedication, expertise and support during his tenure.\" \nMr. Grover continued, \"With the addition of GreenHouse and 5W, the PCSV team continues to grow in strength. We have an extraordinary Board of Directors with deep experience and connections that we are leveraging for expertise in operations, governance, and finance. Additionally, Gordon Smith, former director of Micron and Simplot CFO, continues to act in an advisory role to the company. Although he has no plans to get involved operationally, we consider Mr. Smith a good friend and supporter. The combined strength of our management team and advisors will help drive our next stage of growth. We feel that PCS has a great foundation, and with the team coming together now, we believe we can revolutionize STEM education.
