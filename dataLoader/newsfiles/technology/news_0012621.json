Martin, “Game of Thrones” is one of the most-watched dramas on premium cable, and HBO says it’s the most popular TV show in the world. HBO won 14 awards during the 67th Emmy Awards, broadcast live Sunday on the Fox network from the Microsoft Theater in downtown Los Angeles and hosted by Andy Samberg.\nHBO maintained its dominance at the annual honors for the year’s best TV despite facing challenges from new players Amazon.com and Netflix, along with all of broadcast and cable. The network also returned to the winner’s circle in the top category for the first time since 2007, when it won for the final season of “The Sopranos.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T06:31:28.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
