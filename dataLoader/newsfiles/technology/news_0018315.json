My feeling is that News 24 have lost the plot. You are closing the door to freedom of speech.\nI have never made a comment on any News 24 news item. But I always look at the comments to get other readers points of view. I regard myself as fairly informed.\nBut I also realise my limitations. I have one way of thinking and everyone has their own way of thinking. Reading other readers'comments is an invaluable way for me to become more open-minded.\nI understand that some readers get emotional and some comments are fairly vulgar. But that is their choice.\nWhy close the door on comments when their are so many advantages of seeing other readers points of view?\nIf you continue with this initiative to stop folk from commenting, I will stop using News 24 and look for another alternative.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:29:58.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
