A good editor will strike a balance in terms of publishing a range of views expressed on a topic.\nI don’t agree with those who claim their right to free speech is being curbed. There are many other opportunities and platforms available for people to express their views online through media such as twitter, fb and blogging etc. (of course, to do this they would have to make an effort to build their own audience instead of tapping into the large free audience provided by the news site – it could be argued that commenters are parasitic in this way). They are also largely free to express their views verbally in person in public, work and private spaces with friends, colleagues and others.\nWhat the Comments forum does is provide a space for anyone to express anything they like without having to take responsibility or bear the consequences directly in person . To illustrate my point, for example, if a person were to say something really insulting to someone’s face they’d have to deal directly with the consequences of hurting that person and their reaction to it – this might be enough to inhibit a person from saying it in the first place. Interacting online removes that inhibiting factor, but not the harm that people can cause to others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T12:06:31.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
