The app is becoming the universal writing desk for the mobile world and has notched more than 2 million downloads and over 3 billion network impressions in 12 months, with users spanning 170 countries and translated letters in 80 languages. \nDetails \nThe redesign enables universal navigation, across four kinds of media objects: -- People - for discovering more pen pal connections -- Pictures - SocialStamps, appealing to visually-oriented users -- Prose - the textual portion of letters, for those who love reading and writing -- Personality - original expression reflecting the sender's authentic self, with a new \"social mark\" signature feature unique to each letter \nThe updated lettrs app addresses trends confirmed in a recent Pew Research Center study , which found growing U.S. use of smartphone messaging apps, as well as increasing popularity of image and video sharing.
