There is a growing ambiance and climate of hate... politics of poison and hatred is bound to grow in the run up to the Bihar elections. Silence from top despite having great oratory is eloquent,\" Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, adding it was shocking that such an incident is happening on the outskirts of Delhi.\n\"In last 15 months such incidents have been rising so also the trust deficit,\" he said.\nThe ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh too attacked the BJP, saying it was using issues like beef ban to spread hate.\nTerming the incident as \"painful\", Union Minister Mahesh Sharma, who is BJP MP from Noida, said it happened due to \"misunderstanding\" and dismissed allegations that it was an attempt to polarise the village ahead of panchayat polls there.\nJaan Mohammad, a relative of the victim, said, \"An announcement was made in a local temple that a cow has been slaughtered here, following which a large number of people attacked our family.\"\nThe victim's daughter said the mob stormed the house and assaulted her father and brother. \"They harassed me and also beat up my grandmother,\" she said.\nThe attackers looked into the fridge for beef, but it was only goat's meet which had been brought for Eid, another woman relative said, claiming that police had later confirmed it.\n\"Yes there was meat in our fridge, but it was not cow's meet. It was goat's meet. In one bowl was cooked meat and in another bowl it was uncooked,\" she said.\nThe family alleged that the attackers also looted jewellery.\nCow slaughter is banned in Uttar Pradesh.\nAs the rumours spread, villagers blocked a highway in Bisrakh area yesterday demanding death penalty for those involved in the slaughter. When police tried to control the mob, a clash ensued in which one person identified as Rahul Yadav was shot.\nDistrict Magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar N P Singh said there have been protests by villagers demanding action against those involved in the slaughter of a cow.\n\"We have formed peace committees to restore communal harmony in the area,\" the DM said.\nBJP MP Sharma said he has also organised a meeting between the two groups in the village in view of the tension there.\n\"It's a painful incident. Both the so called groups belong to same village living there for years together. Nobody should take law into his hands,\" Sharma said.\nAsked about allegations that the incident was an attempt to polarise voters ahead of panchayat elections in that area, he said, \"This incident was like action and reaction and not because of any organised plan\".\nBJP district president Thakur Harish Singh charged, \"The police did not react on time. The locals gave samples of meat to the police but they did not take it seriously. Then some people got agitated. We urge people to restore peace.\"\nFormer BJP MLA Nawab Singh Nagar said he had met the family and denied there was any \"conspiracy\".\nThe Samajwadi Party defended the action of authorities and said prompt steps have been taken to control the situation.\n\"Let me assure that the state government would not tolerate any divisive force that is acting behind the scenes to trigger such incidents where communal harmony is disturbed,\" SP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said.\nAt the same time he attacked the BJP saying \"is trying to create divide between various communities and non-issues like beef ban which should be regulated by law are being used to spread hate\".\nHe also objected to statements of local BJP leaders on the issue.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:07:41.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
