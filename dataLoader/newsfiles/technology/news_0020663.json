At night the children were quartered in army tents; by day they got instruction in marksmanship, hand-to-hand fighting, weapons maintenance, first aid, map reading and orienteering.\nFor 11-year-old Oleksander Olinichenko, whose mother and father are both in the Ukrainian army, the camp was a chance to pursue his interest in all things military, as well as show his patriotism.\n\"I like everything here, they teach me to take apart and to assemble the assault rifle, they teach us hand-to-hand fighting, first aid - it's very interesting,\" said Oleksander, his face disguised by military goggles and a regulation helmet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T02:04:30.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
