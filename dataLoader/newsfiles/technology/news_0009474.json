The improved loss-in-weight feeder control accelerates the servo motor’s reaction time and improves feeder accuracy. It also supports the process interface for multi-range PLC/DCS. \nThe feeders achieve ±0.5% accuracy and have feed rates ranging between 2-4,000 lb/hr, depending on feeder configuration and material characteristics. Feeders come with standard twin- or single-screw configurations, and interchangeable screw types are offered. \nLingood feeders are available in the U.S. though Field Industries LLC .
