Changes in the alewife have also triggered behavioral and body changes in the chain pickerel, a predator fish that normally prowls the shores on region’s lakes, according to a new survey of 12 regional lakes published Sept. 14 in the journal Nature Communications . \nSome pickerel in landlocked lakes with alewife have moved out from the shoreline to the center of lakes where alewife congregate. These pickerel have more fat and slightly larger bodies that make them more efficient swimmers, and thinner heads, perhaps because their prey has become smaller. \n“This suggests these pickerel are becoming alewife specialists,” Post said. \nThese changes in the pickerel are not seen in lakes with access to the sea or in lakes lacking alewife, the researchers found. \n“These lakes are a perfect laboratory to study how ecological and evolutionary processes interact in human time scales,” Post said. “These aren’t changes that happened a million years ago.” \nLead author of the paper is Jakob Broderson, former postdoctoral researcher in Post’s lab and now at EAWAG Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T19:27:16.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
