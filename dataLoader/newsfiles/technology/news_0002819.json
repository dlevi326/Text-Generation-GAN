The museum also needed very high levels of data integrity, information security, quality of meta data, file format preservation and future proofing to be applied to its culturally and historically significant AV collections. \nThe solution also needed to provide significantly higher levels of end-to-end digital preservation best practice as defined by the US National Digital Stewardship Alliance than MoMA was previously using as well as to deliver a much easier process for accessing the AV artworks. \nTaking this all into consideration, MoMA selected and designed a system around the already available integration between the Archivematica file-format preservation system and Arkivum’s data archiving service. The solution MoMA chose is the Arkivum/OnSite solution, as it delivers flexible on-site digital data storage, combined with a local instance of Arkivum/100 which, in turn, comprises an on-site Arkivum Service appliance that includes a multi-terrabyte local hard drive cache and an IBM LTO tape library for long-term data storage. \nThe integrated Archivematica/Arkivum solution has been combined with an in-house designed but open source Binder Indexing system which is expected to enable MoMA to handle 5.4 petabytes of digitised audio-visual art that will be generated over the next 10 years. \nThe newly combined system is located in the MoMA Data centre in New York and the entire system and its data is duplicated in another MoMA data centre for disaster recovery. A third copy of the tape-based data is stored offline at yet another MoMA location. This entire tape duplication process is managed by the Arkivum Service and provides the Arkivum 100% data integrity guarantee. \n“We’re delighted that MoMA chose our solution”, said Jim Cook, CEO at Arkivum. “Having now reached the highest level of National Digital Stewardship Alliance best practice standards with our solution combined with Archivematica and the Binder system, MoMA has now significantly raised its standards for digital preservation and can be confident about its long-term data storage requirements.” \nTo read the full case study please visit www.arkivum.com - Ends - \nNotes to Editors \nAbout MoMA \nFounded in 1929 as an educational institution, The Museum of Modern Art is dedicated to being the foremost museum of modern art in the world.
