India is a huge and diverse market for us which is full of opportunities,\" Wang said. \nOppo claims that it is the second largest smartphone player in China in terms of sales volume. \n\"Our new R series of smartphones which was launched globally in July propelled us to the second position in China and that is also one of the reasons to bring the R series to India which we are launching today (Wednesday).\" \nThe Chinese handset-maker has three series of smartphones - Find, N and R. \n\"The Find series caters to people who love performance and design at the same time. The N-series caters to the camera lovers and the phones come with a rotating camera as well. The R series is more focused on design,\" a top official from Oppo said. \nOppo, which entered the India market last year, failed to achieve big numbers although the start of their business had shown promise. \nWhen asked about the strategies it would adopt to grow its business in India, Wang said: \"Oppo was happy with the current numbers in a market like India which is so diverse. Our research and development team is working on products more suited to India.\" \n\"We are not looking at the numbers game but towards a more sustainable way of doing business in the market. We have 1,000 engineers on our research and development team and 50 percent of this workforce is working to understand and deliver the needs of Indian consumers.\" \nOppo also launched two new smartphones on Wednesday -- the R7 Plus and the R7 Lite -- priced at Rs.29,990 and Rs.17,990 respectively. \nThe R7 plus will come with 1.5 GHz octa-core processor and a 3GB RAM. It will have an internal memory of 32GB which can be expanded to 128 GB. \nIt will draw power from a 4,100 mAH battery and also benefit from Oppo's user interface ColorOS 2.1 built on Android 5.1. The device will have a six inch Corning Gorilla Glass screen which will support a resolution of 1920 x 1080. \nThe phone, which has support for dual 4G standby, will come with a 13 megapixel rear camera and a eight megapixel front camera. Interestingly, it will come with a fingerprint sensor as well. \nOn the other hand, the R7 Lite will come with 1.3 GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor and a 2 GB RAM. The phone will have a 16 GB internal memory which is expandable to 128 GB. The device will draw juice from a 2,320 mAh battery and will run on Oppo's ColorOS 2.1 based on Android 5.1. \nIt will have a five inch Corning Gorilla Glass 3 screen. The rear camera will again be a 13 megapixel unit and the front camera will be a five megapixel unit. \n(Anirban Ghoshal can be contacted at anirban.g@ians.in) More Technology Industry News  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T09:21:16.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
