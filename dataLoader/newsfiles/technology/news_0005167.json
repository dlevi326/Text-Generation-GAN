September 17, 2015 SOUTH ELGIN, Ill. – McCloud Services is encouraging all 165 associates to join the fight in finding a cure for breast cancer during Breast Cancer Awareness month this October. During the month of October, service specialists are encouraged to wear pink exam gloves on the job to build awareness, offer support and foster hope for those fighting breast cancer. The company has purchased the Generation Pink Gloves through Medline Industries, which donates and supports the National Breast Cancer Foundation. Additionally, all office team members are encouraged to participate and show their support by wearing pink each Friday during the month of October. “Breast cancer touches many, and we all have a story to tell. By partnering with Medline Industries, we hope to generate awareness while on the job, and inspire others to take a creative approach to join in the fight to find a cure for all cancers and help fund essential research,” said Chris McCloud, president and CEO of McCloud Services. Any employee donations made to the American Cancer Society during the month of October will be matched by the company. McCloud Services is also encouraging its associates to share their stories during the month of October about how important cancer awareness is to them, their families and the community. All submissions will be published throughout the month of October in the company’s newsletter. “Many of our associates have been touched by not only breast cancer, but many types of cancer. Our hope is to provide a support system for our McCloud family and take our mission one step further by supporting important cancer research that will cure and prevent all types of cancer,” added McCloud.
