As a class, they are on the nose right now. However, Andrew Chapman has boldly updated his book of photographs of politicians past and present to bring us up to the Abbott era.\nThe previous version of the Chapman pollie collection was called Campaign – the Abbott revision is called Political Vision (Echo Publishing, $49.95) and has a foreword by former Keating speechwriter Don Watson. (We are right now re-reading Watson's superb account of his years in the Keating office, Recollections of a Bleeding Heart , which has us looking closely at Chapman's Keating photos for signs of the stress, despair, exhilaration and triumph that he describes.)\nThere is an axiom, possibly defined by Ansel Adams, that if your photos are no good it is because you are standing in the wrong place. The striking thing about the photos in Political Vision is that they are all taken by a photographer standing in exactly the right place at the right time.\nCanon 750D.\nWatson's description of the special qualities of the black-and-white still image is something for all aspiring photographers to ponder: \"In the still photograph, as opposed to moving image, there is nothing to distract us from the face, wherein it is alleged the mind's construction can be seen.We might also see something of the mind in the way a politician walks, or waves his hands about, or tugs at his ear, or twitches under pressure – but you don't need a video to see them doing it.\"\nAdvertisement Not only are the Chapman photos sans motion, they are also sans colour. Many of the photographs were shot in colour, as required by the magazine and newspaper clients, but were subsequently re-rendered as black and white because, he once said: \"Black and white captures the essence of the photographic image. Colour is just photography with make-up on, most of the time.\"\nMost of the photos were captured on film, then when the digital era came Chapman embraced the new technology because of the \"sensational\" high ISO capability of the new technology. For many years, he preferred Canon gear but lately he has \"been having an affair with Fujifilm's new X system\". He likes the low light capability of the cameras and the fact that \"their compactness has the advantage of not making you look too professional, therefore getting ignored ... excellent!\"\nREVIEW\nCanon EOS 750D DSLR\nPrice: $876 (body only street price)\nFast and accurate\nTHE LOW-DOWN The Canon 750D is a relatively low-cost 24mp DSLR. It has improved auto-focus and is claimed to have better AF performance in live-view mode. The light metering has \"skin-tone detection\", which is hard to test but which seems to work. The 75mm LCD is full articulated, video quality is 1080p at 30fps, and for stills there is 5fps continuous shooting. Connectivity is by both Wi-Fi – which Canon doesn't do as well as its rivals – and NFC. Construction quality is good and the feel of the camera is better than the price suggests.\nLIKE This is a very responsive camera where everything – focus, exposure and shutter firing – are blink-of-the-eye fast. We took the 750D to a Bollywood knees-up to capture faces in the crowd of performers and spectators, and the speed of shooting and consistency of output were impressive. And, judging from the results, it seems that the \"skin tone detection\" is more than a gimmicky promise.\nDISLIKE So-called live view is as clunky as ever. The usefulness of the articulated LCD is limited, compared with a mirrorless camera, by the clumsiness of the system.\nVERDICT While enjoying ourselves at the Bollywood party, we never once felt that the 750D was in any way limited or restricted by comparison with our Canon 5D MkII. The viewfinder is a little smaller and not as bright as a true prism finder, but when you are hunting for the critical moment of the gorgeous smile, viewfinder brightness is not as important as speed of response to the input of the finger on the shutter release. We were using our Canon 70-200mm zoom for the event, a reminder that a budget DSLR body is the entry into a fabulous system of lenses and accessories.", "external_links": ["http://www.fivemile.com.au/artist/andrew-chapman", "https://www.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-chapman/16/417/11a"], "published": "2015-09-02T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T07:08:42.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
