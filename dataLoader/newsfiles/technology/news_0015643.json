However, the new software is still worth getting, and some fine improvements in it are completely worth the upgrade. Here are some features of the iOS 9 you may have not noticed even after the update:\ni OS 9 now gives you the option to swap between apps without using the home button. When you switch from one app to another, you are given an option on the top left of your screen to go back to the previous app. ​\nWhen you plug in your headphones, the iPhone detects them and automatically shows you a shortcut icon for the music app on the lock screen.\nSelecting multiple media has been made a lot easier with the iOS 9, you can now simply slide your finger through the images you want to select, instead of tapping each one.\nThe spotlight search is now much more advanced. It shows your top four most used apps and contacts as the ‘Siri app suggestions’.\nIn setting if you scroll down to the battery option, you will notice that your iPhone now has a low power mode, which temporarily reduces power consumption until you can fully charge your iPhone.\nAlso, in case you missed it, the settings app also has a search bar now, which makes looking for settings options so much easier.\nIn the camera roll, when you preview an image, much like in iPhoto on the Mac, the others image show lined up at the bottom, so that you don’t have to swipe through every picture, and choose the one you wish to view next from the tiny thumbnails.\niOS 9 users can also now hide pictures from Moments, Collections and Years. However, the media would still be visible in Albums.\nAnother great feature in the camera roll of iOS 9 is the two dedicated folders for selfies and screenshots. That would save so much time in looking for the selfies you want to put up on the social media.\nApple has upped the security of the iPhone with iOS 9. It now allows users to set 6 digit passcodes, which means almost a million combinations to crack from. ​\nThe new operating system also comes with a new iCloud Drive app, which will allow users to interact and manage all of their saved files within iCloud inside of the app. The specific setting for turning on the hidden app lies in Settings > iCloud > iCloud Drive. Once users decide to turn on the \"Show on Home Screen\", the app will show up on their home screen alongside their previously downloaded apps.\n Tags: technology Mobiles and tabs latest apple iOS 9 Also Read Leela Group to sell Delhi, Chennai hotels 'FREAK attack’ flaw: Your Apple, Android browser is open to hackers Bids for subsidy by gas power projects postponed by one day TRAI asks Vodafone to stop using 111 for customer services", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/IMG_1919.PNG", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/IMG_1917.PNG", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/ios0-apple-ipad-iphone_0_0.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/IMG_1921.PNG", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/IMG_1920.PNG", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/IMG_1930.JPG", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/IMG_1922.PNG", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/IMG_1918.PNG", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150919/technology-mobiles-and-tabs/article/11-features-ios-9-you-should-know", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/IMG_1927.PNG", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/IMG_1926.PNG", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/IMG_1929_0.PNG", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/IMG_1925.PNG", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/ios0-apple-ipad-iphone_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/IMG_1923.PNG"], "published": "2015-09-20T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T01:19:49.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
