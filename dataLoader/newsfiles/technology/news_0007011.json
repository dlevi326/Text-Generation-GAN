Additionally the chassis can configured to an actively cooled or fanless system depending on the needs of the environment. M100/520 - This is the latest version of our flagship 1U graphic engine that features Intel's 4th Generation processors. It combines high performance computing, with high-end, discrete graphics in a low-profile, 1U chassis that's rack mountable.
