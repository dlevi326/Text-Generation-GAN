Data are maintained in a single file with audit tracking to eliminate multiple files of various revision levels. \nThe NJ101 is compatible with Omronâ€™s NJ501/301 and NX701 products, with a similar size and functionality. The NJ101 is ideal for lower-risk applications where operators need to coordinate only up to 2 axes of motion, but still utilize Sysmac capabilities (i.e. graphical CAM editor, 3-D simulation, EtherCAT distributed clock, parameter backup to the controller for easy servo amplifier replacement, etc.). \nKey benefits of the NJ101: Lowest cost point controller within Sysmac family Uses same integrated development environment Project scales to higher levels of controller (NJ3/NJ5/NX7) Backwards compatible with Omron CJ2 PLC I/O and communication modules \nIdeal applications for the NJ101 include: Modular Specialty Machinery, Rotary Knife Applications, Low-Axis High-Performance Motion, Packaging, Food & Beverage, Multi-Loop Process Control, Petro/Chemical, Pharmaceutical, Automotive and Material Handling Equipment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T00:53:55.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
