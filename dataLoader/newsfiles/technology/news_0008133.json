The critical contribution of this \"Language User Interface\" on a big screen is compounded when the screen is smaller, e.g., a mobile phone. The sixth annual Mobile Voice Conference organized by The Applied Voice Input Output Society (AVIOS) is aimed at showing how the Language User Interface has matured and is driving the evolution of user interaction on mobile devices and beyond. AVIOS announced that the preliminary program has been posted on the conference web site .\nThe emphasis is on quality talks, with only two tracks: Trends and Applications, and Getting It Done. Sessions range from case studies to best practices, as well as tools and services that help companies take advantage of this trend without being experts in the Language User Interface. The preliminary program lists sessions such as\n The evolution of customer service in a mobile world Tools for creating customer-facing digital assistants Call centers: Automation with Natural language Mobile apps: What works and what doesn't Enterprise applications and the Language User Interface And much more. One keynote talk, \"How Mobility Drives Natural Language Technology: Present and Future Tools and Capabilities,\" by Amy Neustein, Editor in Chief, International Journal of Speech Technology, provides a deep discussion of where we are with natural language technology and how we can expect the technology to evolve.\nAn innovation this year is \"demo tables,\" where attendees can see a technology or tool from selected vendors at work and have one-on-one interactions with company representatives. The tables will be open through most of the conference, with one session devoted specifically to this option.\nThe Mobile Voice Conference covers the core technologies and tools required to use the Language User Interface, including speech recognition, natural language interpretation, and conversational applications. It also covers complementary technologies such as biometric voice authentication and user identification, multimodal interfaces where speech complements the GUI, and speech analytics that allow understanding your customer.\nThe conference is currently enlisting sponsors to be highlighted in upcoming announcements of detailed conference content. Details of sponsor options are available from Peggie(at)avios(dot)org.\nAbout the Applied Voice Input Output Society\nAVIOS is a not-for-profit private foundation founded in 1981 with the goals of informing, educating, and providing resources to developers and designers of new and changing speech technologies. AVIOS endeavors to create linkages between users, developers, and researchers to advance speech and multimodal technology with a long tradition of conferences and local chapter meetings around the US and internationally.
