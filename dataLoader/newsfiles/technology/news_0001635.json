The company set out to raise $35,000 on Kickstarter to finish development and produce the first batch of their latest invention that will revolutionize the cat toy market.\nThe IrresistiCat takes a new spin on solar, making a product that absorbs and saves up light energy from any and all sources. When enough energy is stored up, the energy is released with a burst smacking the internal ball around in circles, making it seem almost alive. This environmentally friendly tantalizing toy is bound to be irresistible your cat while engaging its need to hunt and play.\nWhen placed in a room that gets light, the IrresistiCat will trigger every couple minutes while in a well lit room it will go off multiple times a minute. When the toy is set in a spot that gets direct sunlight, the toy will continue to go off constantly. With no batteries ever, the toy is working all day even when the pets' owners are out of the house doing other things.\nBatteries are not just a hassle, they are bad for the environment. The inventor of the IrresistiCat, Ron, had this to say on the topic “We think there is a better way. No batteries to purchase, change or recycle...ever!” Toys with batteries require changing when the battery power is depleted, are expensive to replace and the batteries need to be recycled.\nSolarChasers, LLC was set up in Salt Lake City in 2010 and is owned by Ronald Forhan. It has enjoyed traction with its last product, the self-titled “SolarChaser.”\nRonald Forhan\nCEO\nSolarChasers, LLC\n(325)212-7867\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1714708658/irresisticat-by-solarchasers-powered-by-light-batt", "external_links": ["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1714708658/irresisticat-by-solarchasers-powered-by-light-batt"], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T10:36:37.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
