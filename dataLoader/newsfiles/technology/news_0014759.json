The Obama administration officials, touting a new era of U.S.-China climate diplomacy, said the statement would demonstrate to the world the countries’ commitment to reaching agreed-upon targets.\nChinese President Xi Jinping’s decision to put a price on CO2 emissions with a cap-and-trade system marks the first time China has launched such an initiative.\nSenior administration officials said the emissions trading system would encompass a wide range of sectors that produce a substantial percentage of climate pollution, including the paper, steel and cement industries. It would mark an evolution from a series of regional test programs already under way in China, U.S. officials said.\nWhile China has operated cap-and-trade systems on a pilot basis, officials said the planned launch of the emissions-trading system is a significant policy undertaking by the Chinese.\nFriday’s announcements are the culmination of several months of discussions among U.S. and Chinese officials as the Obama administration tries to build momentum ahead of United Nations climate-change negotiations in Paris later this year.\nAn extended version of this report can be found at WSJ.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-china-to-announce-new-steps-to-fight-climate-change-1443144860"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T09:32:39.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
