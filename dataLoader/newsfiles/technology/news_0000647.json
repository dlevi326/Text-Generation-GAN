I could actually hear over the phone how happy they are with what they do and how they help people.”\nBelan, a management executive with a pharmaceutical, biological and chemical engineering background, was working a 12-hour night shift when he and wife Allie decided to go out on their own. Allie teaches first grade in the Adamstown area, where the Belans live with their two children, ages 13 and 8. She will continue in the public school system as Dave launches the family’s AdvantaClean business.\n“I worked in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries for 20 years,” Dave said. “I’m looking forward to doing something for myself and my family that also impacts lives on the same scale as what I previously did.”\nThe Belans are available for interviews and expert appearances through the following agent:\nGinaCuza\nMarketing Content Manager\nAdvantaClean Systems Inc.\ngina.cuza(at)advantaclean(dot)com\nhttp://www.advantaclean.com\nPhone: 704.766.2437 ext.1124 |877.800.2382 | Fax: 877.455.5546\nAbout AdvantaClean Systems, Inc.\nFounded in 1994 as a contracting business handling cleanup and repairs in southern Florida, AdvantaClean , now headquartered in Huntersville, N.C., is now the leading national franchised provider of Light Environmental Services ™ in the country.
