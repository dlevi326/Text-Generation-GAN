The main plot takes place in NYC, the center of the world's latest zombie outbreak. The gamers start out as Joe, a member of the anti-zombie unit WOLFPACK, a private military organization designed to find, track, and eliminate the zombie menace before it goes global.\n“We’ve been inspired by the success of our previous game and decided to bring our players another perfect action shooter that would blur the line between console and mobile gameplay,” explains Pavel Cizek, the project leader of UNKILLED. “Fantastic feedback from the global community allowed us to focus on exactly those aspects that the players have the highest expectations for,” adds Cizek.\nUNKILLED is mainly a beautiful, smooth, 1st-person-shooter action with a unique MFG control scheme for mobile devices tried-and-tested by millions of players. The Autofire shooting system lets players concentrate on the action. In addition, the game supports multiple gamepads.\nLike before, gamers will enjoy an insane visual quality never before seen in mobile gaming. In the grand scheme of things, it means stunning graphics with many advanced effects like high resolution soft shadows, GPU-simulated particle effects numbering in the tens of thousands of textures, reflective surfaces, and post processing effects for a cinematic feel.\nIn whole, gameplay provides an amazingly long storyline with more than 100 missions, many unique enemies supported by special bosses, a diverse and huge arsenal of weapons, and unique allies to help player to survive and succeed in mission quests.\nApart from the story campaign missions, the players can look forward to many side missions where they complete quests in order to gain useful resources that allow them to buy new gadgets, weapons, and upgrades. Based on a similar principle, there are also special timed campaigns, each consisting of three missions.\nAmong the gadgets with the most entertaining potential are homing rockets that never miss their target, causing explosions that are one of the gameplay’s visual high points. Adrenaline, which slows down the zombies and thus provides more time for headshots, is equally interesting. Regularly spawning treasure chests contain other valuable resources needed for the progress in the game. Apart from gold, these can include special gadgets with temporary effects and unique single-use weapons.\nMADFINGER Games is a steady and dominant player in multimedia entertainment focusing on mobile platforms. Founded in 2009, Madfinger’s apps shot to the top of the charts in sales. Shortly thereafter, MADFINGER Games began cooperation with a number of significant companies from the gaming industry and has been regularly recognized with series of prestigious awards. A majority of recognition comes from Madfinger’s signature stunning visuals and excellent gameplay experiences. Today, MADFINGER Games continues to expand its portfolio with an in-house staff of over 70 employees and games that have been downloaded by more than 100 million players.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:13:31.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
