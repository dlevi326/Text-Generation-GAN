The competition is on mount Kilimanjaro,the highest mountain in Africa and the highest free-standing mountain in the world at 5,895 metres above sea level. \nThe challenge is to climb it in less than 6 hours, 56 minutes and 24 seconds which is the current world record held by Swiss-Ecuadorian Karl Egloff who completed a run up the Umbwe Route and descent via Mweka in August 2014. Now Julio Ludago, a professional mountain guide at Mt. Kilimanjaro hopes to beat this record on Sunday, September 27 , 2015 when he ascends and descends Mt. Kilimanjaro via Umbwe route – Western breach. According to Julio, “I know breaking the world record is not going to be an easy task. The high altitude, low temperature and occasional strong winds on Mt. Kilimanjaro make this a difficult and dangerous challenge but I am prepared. For the last two months, I have been training relentlessly and with the support I am receiving from Intel, Ahsante Tours and ASUS, I am confident I will break the record.” Intel, Ahsante Tours and ASUS have come on board as Julio’s sponsors to help turn this challenge into an exciting experience that will rally various African nations to cheer Julio on as he attempts to break the world record. A social media campaign dubbed “TheClimbAfrica” has also been opened for the competition and supporters are invited to join the conversation by following the social media campaign \nAhsante Tours, Julio’s employer, has been providing the logistical support during his training sessions and will also manage the logistics during the actual day of the climb. Speaking through its Marketing Manager, Noel Kilengo, “We are proud and excited to be supporting Julio in this challenge and we are working very closely with Kilimanjaro National Park Authority to ensure this runs smoothly. We are looking forward to him breaking the world record and making Africa proud.” Corroborating Kilengo, Head of Marketing and PR for Intel East Africa, Lavinniah Muthoni said “Intel, through the use of technology will enable Julio to track his fitness levels and also share his extraordinary experience with Africa and beyond. As he prepares to break the world record , we want people to celebrate his experience and be part of his journey.” Julio was given climbing gear and the Basis Peak that helps him track his activity, health and sleeping metrics 24/7. It also continuously monitors movement, perspiration and skin temperature. This multi-sensor approach, combined with Basis’ BodyIQ technology, enables Basis Peak to automatically detect walking, running, biking, sleep phases, sleep quality and more. Even with these sensors working 24/7, Peak maintains a battery life of up to four days, a challenge for many other wearable devices on the market today. Another exciting technology that Julio will use during this mission will be the ASUS Transformer Book T300 Chi powered by Intel. The razor-thin and powerful 2-in-1 device with a 12.5” screen perfectly meets Julio’s needs because it is lightweight (720g tablet), compact and thin (7.6mm), and it is able to handle the rigors of ascending a mountain as well as continue to operate under low temperature and atmospheric pressure. The ultra-slim 2-in-1 delivers incredible performance and is also power-efficient thanks to the latest Intel Core M processor. With a battery that can last up to 8 hours, it enables Julio to document images and videos throughout his climbing. According to the Director, System Business Group, English Speaking Africa, ASUS, Mr. Alvin Huang, “We are excited to be part of Julio’s journey. ASUS laptop was the first laptop to reach the top of Mount Everest at the height of 8848m in the past, so we are confident the ASUS Transformer Book T300 Chi can successfully survive the severe conditions during this mission and help Julio to connect with his fans. Huang concluded, ‘’As part of the social media campaign to create awareness on Julio’s challenge, we are awarding fans that accurately predict the time it will take him to ascend and descend Mt. Kilimanjaro with our 2-in-1 laptops. We urge everyone to join in and cheer Julio on.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T15:07:45.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
