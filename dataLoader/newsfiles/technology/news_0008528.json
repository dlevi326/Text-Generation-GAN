It allowed us to vent and to release some of the pressure that we feel. To blow off some steam to reduce the anger and frustration we experience each day. Also it allowed to feel and see what others saw in us, whether we liked it or not. It also gave us some insights, good and bad that allowed us to reflect on ourselves. It also helped stop a pure evil dictatorship, until now. It has been made clear that Zuma intends to have complete dictatorship. This can only take place with complete control and censorship of the media. Everyone's voices need to be silenced.\nIt would be good to take a few moments to reflect on how each and every single dictatorship has ended up, until now.There are still videos floating around showing the dictators being dragged out of their holes in the ground and executed. Preceded and followed by brutal and bloody war. I still have this feint glimmer of hope that this will not happen, but that is fading away quite fast.\nThe real tragedy here though is the date that had been chosen. A reminder of terrible injustices.\nSeptember the 11th. The day that tragedy struck. The day that the vast majority of people on the planet were affected in one way or another by a terrorist attack on their freedom. Perhaps it is symbolic. Perhaps it is just irony.\nTime will tell and time is never wrong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T11:25:09.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
