S. Magistrate Judge. Patriot believes the report and recommendation, which are inconsistent with the claims construction issued by the same court in which a jury previously found infringement of the '336 patent against HTC Corporation, is in error. In conjunction with preparing to file its objections, Patriot has agreed to a stipulation of defendants' non-infringement, limited to the recent claim construction. If the report and recommendations are adopted by the District Judge then Patriot plans to file an appeal with the United States Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit. Patriot plans to continue to vigorously pursue its rights under the '336 patent and expects to pursue remedies in addition to the pending objection if required. \nAbout Patriot Scientific Corporation \nHeadquartered in Carlsbad, California, Patriot Scientific Corporation is the co-owner of the Moore Microprocessor Patent Portfolio(TM).
