The platinum price was off nearly 2% at $929.22 per ounce, near six-year lows\n\"Today should be another day of large daily ranges with the rand likely to trade anywhere from R13.70 to R14.20 to the dollar depending on who has what order,\" Standard Bank trader Warrick Butler said.\nItâ€™s a start to what will likely be a risk-intense week for the currency and broader financial markets.\nMarket participants are awaiting domestic trade data as well as the US non-farm payrolls report. A number of US Federal Reserve members will also be delivering speeches, which will be watched for clues as to when the Fed might raise interest rates.\nAt 11.56am, the rand was at R13.9404 to the dollar from its previous close of R13.9029.\nAgainst the euro the rand was at R15.5980 from R15.5519 previously and was at R21.2275 against the pound from a previous close of R21.1143.\nThe euro was at $1.1189 from $1.1188.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:27:57.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
