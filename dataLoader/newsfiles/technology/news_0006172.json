You can also enhance shots of your pets and landscapes, such as a waterfall.\n\nYou need one of the iPhone 6S models to capture these Live Photos, but older phones are fine for viewing.\n\nThis feature takes practice, so check out these tips in order to use capture and manage Live Photos:\n\niPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus Video Preview Apple #iPhone6S, #iPhone6SPlus: Video preview focusing on new features of the next-generation iPhones\nPosted by The Times of India | Tech on Thursday, September 10, 2015 \nTaking the shot \n\nWhen you open the camera app, the iPhone continually records video in the background, though it's immediately discarded if you do nothing. When you snap a shot, the phone saves a second and a half of video leading to that shot and continues recording until you get three seconds in all.\n\nWait a few seconds before snapping your shot so that the video won't show you moving the phone into position. Likewise, resist dropping your camera right after taking the shot. The phone will detect that movement with an upcoming software update, so it can stop the video automatically. For now, wait for a yellow \"Live\" box on the screen to disappear before moving.\n\nAsk your subjects to hold their pose longer. If they start moving or talking, the video will show that. The video will show your flash firing if you use it, so natural lighting is better.\n\nThe still shot is the key part of Live Photos, and video merely enhances that. Pay attention to perfecting that still shot in terms of focus, lighting and composition. You don't need to wait for the video recording to finish before snapping another shot. Just keep snapping, as you'd normally do, and the phone will create overlapping three-second videos automatically.\n\nViewing and sharing \n\nTo view a Live Photo on your phone, tap and hold the image in the Photos app. On the Apple Watch, you can view it in its Photos app or as part of a custom watch face with that image. On Mac computers, go to the Photos app and move your cursor over the \"Live\" box on the lower left corner. Your devices need the latest system software -- iOS 9 on iPhones and iPads, WatchOS 2 on Apple Watch and El Capitan on the Mac. The Mac update is coming soon.\n\nShare Live Photos with family and friends through the Messages app -- as long as they have an Apple device with the latest operating system. Otherwise, they'll just get the still image.\n\nMake sure the message is sent as an iMessage, which will appear blue. If it's green, it is a standard text message and won't have video. You can also share these through the phone's iCloud Photo Sharing and AirDrop features, but not as email.\n\nApple is letting other services such as Facebook create tools for sharing and viewing as well.\n\nBecause Live Photos include audio, don't share with someone you've just gossiped about.\n\n-- \n\nPhoto management \n\nThe video part gets turned off when you edit photos. You can get it back, but you then lose your changes. Make a copy to edit by sending the Live Photo to yourself using iMessage. Just send it to your Apple ID email address rather than your phone number.\n\nYou can export Live Photos to Mac and Windows computers and find video files that work with most video programs. Quality is lower than usual to save storage. Plus, Apple hides these files under normal use, so this is mostly for advanced users.\n\nEach Live Photo takes up about twice the storage of a regular photo. You can't delete just the video part, but you can disable video recording by tapping a yellow circle on the screen.\n\nApple's iCloud Photo Library service might free up some storage on your phone, but you might be better off buying a phone with more storage to begin with. Apple iPhone 6S, 6S Plus: 10 things to know of 11 Apple's new iPhones are here. The tech giant unveiled the two updated iPhones -- iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus -- at an event in San Franciscoâ€™s mega Bill Graham Civic auditorium. Talking about the new smartphones, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, \"They look familiar, but we have changed everything about these iPhones.\"\n\nOne of the key new features of the new iPhones is the new touch capability called 3D Touch which allows the screen to sense multiple types of pressure.\n\nHere are 10 things you need to know about Apple's latest iPhones. Most smartphone users are accustomed to 'multi-touch' -- the ability for phones to recognize touches from multiple fingers, enabling such capabilities as pinching to zoom. With new iPhones, Apple brings in 3D Touch.\n\nPressing down hard on the new iPhones will launch additional capabilities. For example, you can get quick access to tasks such as taking a selfie or getting directions home. From a message, 3D Touch will give you a preview of a web link without launching the browser.\n\nSimilarly, press for a few seconds on a document icon, and a preview pops out. Press on an address in an email, and a map opens up. On some video apps, the pressure determines how quickly you forward or rewind. After being stuck with an 8MP camera sensor since iPhone 4S, the iPhone range has finally received a substantial megapixel upgrade. iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus sport a 12MP rear camera, with 50% more focus pixels to ensure faster autofocus.\n\nApple says that the new iPhones' camera will deliver more detailed photos than ever before. It can also capture panorama shots in 63MP resolution and capture videos in 4K (movie hall quality) resolution. The selfie camera has also got an upgrade this year, jumping from 1.2MP in iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to 5MP in iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.\n\nThough it is not backed by a front-facing LED flash, Apple has used a technology called Retina Flash to deliver brighter selfies. This feature increases the brightness of the screen by three times, which Apple claims is comparable to that of its rear dual-LED flash.\n\nThe front camera also gets an upgrade. It'll be 5MP FaceTime HD camera that uses the phone's Retina display for a flash for \"detailed selfies.\" Apple claims that the new capabilities will now let the display light up 3-times brighter for a flash that's comparable to that of the TrueTone flash on the back.\n\nApple has also debuted a feature called Live Photos in the camera app, which will capture a 1.5-second video before and after you click the shutter in order to create animated GIFs. The new iPhone 6S Plus will also come in a rose gold colour, as well as the standard silver, gold, and space gray hues.
