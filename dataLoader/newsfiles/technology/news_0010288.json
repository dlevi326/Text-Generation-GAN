To aid those impacted, Comcast has opened its XFINITY WiFi hotspots called Comcast Cares throughout the affected areas to anyone who needs them. In addition, hundreds of Comcast employees have volunteered to help emergency personnel to meet the needs of the community. One technician (who is also a volunteer firefighter) has been battling the blaze alongside fire officials for weeks. Comcast's local offices are collecting clothes, blankets and toiletries to take to the evacuees as well. \n\"Northern and Central California is home to many of our customers and employees. Comcast is committed to giving those affected by this devastation the resources needed to access emergency services,\" said Hank Fore, Regional Senior Vice President for Comcast California. \"We are happy to give our employees, our customers and the greater community our support as well as volunteer efforts to care for those in need.\" \nConnectivity is paramount during a crisis and following its aftermath. Comcast employees have been monitoring phone and Internet services to ensure reliability for emergency personnel as they respond to the devastation. Keeping firefighters connected to their command centers is a priority as well as offering comfort to those who were forced to evacuate. \n\"As many as 1,000 people were displaced and found shelter at the evacuation center in Calistoga,\" said Alfredo Pedroza, Napa County Supervisor. \"Comcast was able to offer these residents the ability to reconnect with loved ones through XFINITY's free WiFi service. More importantly, Comcast employees offered evacuees some normalcy by giving them television and movies to lift their spirits as residents look to rebuild their lives.\" \nComcast is offering Internet, video and phone services for evacuees at the following Red Cross Evacuation Centers: -- Jenny Lind Veterans Hall (189 Pine Street, Valley Springs) -- Good Samaritan Church (4684 Baldwin, Valley Springs) -- Napa County Fairgrounds (1435 North Oak Street, Calistoga) -- San Andreas Church (261 Treats Avenue, San Andreas) \nIn addition, Comcast announced it is providing $100,000 in technology and media support to the American Red Cross. The company will provide $50,000 in cash and $50,000 in-kind support through public service announcements to assist the American Red Cross in its efforts. \nComcast joins other companies by offering financial contributions that will aid those affected by the fires in Lake County, Sonoma County, Amador County, Calaveras County and Fresno County. This donation to the American Red Cross will help the disaster relief organization continue to provide shelter, food and comfort as part of a massive relief effort in California. \n\"The American Red Cross is grateful for the generous donation of $50,000 from Comcast. This donation will enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from the California wildfires. This donation will help provide food, shelter and emotional support to those affected by the wildfires,\" said Lilly Wyatt, Director of Regional Communications for the American Red Cross. \"The air time that Comcast has donated will help us share the importance of preparedness for any natural disaster and for everyday life.\" \nHow You Can Help \nHelp people affected by the California Wildfires.
