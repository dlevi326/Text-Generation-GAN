The show will air on October 9 at 7:00 pm ET on SiriusXM FC , channel 85, and will be moderated by longtime soccer executive and SiriusXM host Charlie Stillitano. \nSir Alex, the longest serving manager in Manchester United history and one of the most decorated coaches the game has ever seen, will talk about his legendary career and his principles for leadership, and he will answer questions posed by the SiriusXM subscribers in attendance. Sir Alex's new book, Leading , will be released in the United States on October 6. \n\"It's a great honour to be asked to participate in the \"SiriusXM Town Hall\" series and I am looking forward to sitting down with Charlie Stillitano to discuss my career and approach to management,\" Sir Alex said. \"It will be an enjoyable experience and I'm intrigued to hear what the SiriusXM listeners want to learn about my time in football.\" \n\"To look at Sir Alex's life and career is to see a profile of extraordinary leadership and success. He has set an example that can be admired far beyond the world of sports,\" said Scott Greenstein, SiriusXM's President and Chief Content Officer. \"We are honored and excited that he has chosen SiriusXM as a place to share his thoughts and experiences in sports and a variety of other areas.\" \nSir Alex Ferguson retired as manager of Manchester United in 2013 following a period of over 26 years and 1500 games at the helm of one of the most storied sports franchises in the world. Over a management career that lasted 39 years, he won 49 major trophies, making him the most successful manager in the history of British soccer. \nAdmired for placing his emphasis on attacking football, with home-grown talent at the heart of his teams, Sir Alex made his name with Aberdeen, winning nine domestic trophies and a European Cup Winners Cup over a six-year period in the late 70s and early 80s. After moving over to Manchester United in 1986, he led the club to the first of many trophies together in 1990. Domestically he won four League Cups, five FA Cups and a staggering 13 League titles. Internationally, he guided Manchester United to the 1999 UEFA Champions League title and the Red Devils that year became the first English club to complete the fabled treble (Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League titles). He added another Champions League title and Cup Winners Cup along with an Intercontinental Cup and a FIFA Club World Cup. \nSir Alex is now Director on the football board at Old Trafford and serves in an ambassador role for both UNICEF and UEFA as well holding the position of Fellow to the Executive Education Program at Harvard Business School. \nAfter the debut the special will be available on SiriusXM On Demand .
