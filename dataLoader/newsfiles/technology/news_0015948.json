The new Rolls-Royce Dawn is aimed at delivering the same whisper quiet, ultra luxurious experience to those who want to enjoy top-down motoring without all the windy, noisy hassle. \nChief among the priorities for Rolls-Royce engineers was making sure rear-seat passengers have plenty of space. In most four-seat convertibles, the people sitting in the back are left with hardly any leg or shoulder room. According to Rolls-Royce, this makes most 2+2 convertibles \"compromised and anti-social.\" \nTo tackle the problem, the Dawn's roof has been packaged so as not to impede on passenger space, which means all the people on board are able to enjoy the full roof-down, Rolls-Royce experience comfortably. \nThe roof on Rolls' new convertible has been designed to isolate passengers from the road like it's a coupe or sedan. While a metal folding roof would be the obvious choice for noise isolation and refinement, the Dawn features a soft-top to give it a more traditional aesthetic. Thanks to its smooth surface and tailored French Seam, Rolls-Royce claims the roof creates no noticeable wind noise, making it as quiet as the Wraith inside. \nThe new Dawn is fitted with a bespoke audio system tuned specifically for the acoustics of its interior. Thanks to 16 individually-tuned speakers and an exterior ambient noise microphone, the system subtly is reported to adjust the volume and tone of music to make sure the sound quality isn't impacted by anything else. \nJust as Mercedes did with its S-Class Cabriolet , Rolls-Royce has worked hard to ensure the torsional rigidity of its new convertible. To make sure the extra structural bracing and mass is well controlled, the Dawn's suspension has been retuned. \nAt the center of the Dawn's driving experience is a 6.6-liter, twin-turbo V12 making 563 hp (420 kW) and 780 Nm. With a new, slightly more aggressive throttle map and GPS-assisted gearbox, the car should be silky-smooth to drive. \nRolls-Royce hasn't yet revealed pricing for the 2016 Dawn, but it will be on show at next week's Frankfurt Motor Show. \nYou can watch the Dawn launch video below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T18:13:26.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
