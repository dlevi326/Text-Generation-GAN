Dr. Nusbaum is the second surgeon to receive the prestigious award at the Hair Transplant Institute of Miami, making it the first clinic in the world to be home to two Golden Follicle Award winners. The ISHRS awards the Golden Follicle each year at the society’s Annual Meeting. Each year, the ISHRS uses the Golden Follicle Award to recognize select surgeons who have made an outstanding and significant clinical contribution to the field of hair restoration surgery.\nIn the past two decades, Dr. Nusbaum has performed over 10,000 individual hair transplant procedures. He is a Diplomat of the American Board of Dermatology, and he is Past President of the American Board of Hair Restoration Surgery. In addition to ongoing research and contributions to clinical publications, Dr. Nusbaum extends his professional expertise to patients who suffer with various forms of hair loss. Dr. Nusbaum works alongside 2008 Golden Follicle Award winner Dr. Paul Rose at the Hair Transplant Institute of Miami, where patients receive most advanced hair loss evaluation methodologies, along with leading surgical and non-surgical treatment options.\nIn 2012, the Institute became 1 of the first 13 clinics in the world to offer the ARTAS® by Restoration™ Robotics. This advanced hair transplant robotics technology enables physicians to conduct follicular unit extraction (FUE) with greater accuracy, precision, and consistency. Following extraction, individual hair grafts are transplanted by the surgeon in a manner that best replicates natural hair lines, volume, and thickness.\nIn 2015, Drs. Nusbaum and Rose developed Mosaic™ Hair Restoration to further enhance patient outcomes. Whereas other surgeons transplant donor hair in semi-standardized clusters of 2-3 follicular units, Drs. Nusbaum and Rose have developed the Mosaic™ Hair Restoration procedure to provide a more natural outcome that better mimics the patient’s natural hair.\n“We have observed that follicular units naturally occur in an arrangement consisting of unique percentages of one, two, and three hair follicular units,” explains Dr. Nusbaum. “In other words, a unique pattern for each individual. Our novel procedure consists of designing the recipient area in this individualized manner, different for each patient, mimicking their unique follicular unit arrangement pattern.”\nReaders are invited to learn more about advanced hair loss treatments at the Hair Transplant Institute of Miami by visiting http://www.miamihair.com , or calling 305-925-0222.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWFtaWhhaXIuY29t"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T22:53:59.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
