It primarily makes touch-sensitive glass covers for mobile phones, computers and cameras.\n\nSACOM spokeswoman Liang Pui-kwan said the group was not only targeting Apple.\n\n\"But Apple is the richest and has the biggest ability to make change and bring the industry forward,\" she said. \"We're trying to bring the facts in front of people and let them know what they are choosing.\"\n\nLens Technology and Apple were not immediately available for comment. 7 iPhone 6S features taken from other phones of 8 As expected, Apple unveiled two new iPhones - iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus at its special event in San Francisco. Not much has changed in terms of design (similar to other S-iteration iPhone variants) but Apple’s next-generation iPhones boast of some new features. While we already know that iOS 9, the software powering the iPhones, comes with features seen already on Android phones, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are also playing catch-up with others. Here are seven new iPhone features that Apple has borrowed from others... Apple’s 3D Touch lets users perform different actions by applying different levels of force on the screen. For instance, a deeper touch opens up an advanced menu or peek into the content inside the app while a simple tap just opens the app. Apple has deployed the same technology in the new 12-inch MacBook and Apple Watch as Force Touch.\n\nThe implementation is certainly new but we’ve seen a similar, multi-level touch feature called SurePress on the BlackBerry Storm 2. Huawei also managed to include a similar feature on its Mate S smartphone days before Apple’s new phones. One of the new iPhone camera tricks, Live Photo captures some action before and after you press the shutter key and offers it as an animated picture. Still images animate responding to taps (or force touch).\n\nWe’ve seen this feature on HTC phones for years with the implementation referred to as Zoe. Microsoft’s Lumia phones also offer a similar feature called Living Image. It’s still not clear if Apple will use a proprietary format or store pictures in GIF format. Support for 4K recording or movie hall quality video recording enables users to shoot video in high resolution (3840x2160p). The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are the first Apple devices to offer this feature.\n\nHowever, the technology is anything but new and most modern flagship Android phones come with 4K video-enabled cameras. Phones such as the Sony Xperia Z3 and LG G3 supported this feature in 2014. This is another area where Apple’s playing catch-up. Apple iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus now feature playback zoom, the ability to zoom into objects in videos while playing them. This feature has been present on a number of Android phones including Samsung Galaxy flagships for years. Some third party video apps also support this feature. A small but useful addition nonetheless.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T23:12:46.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
