Disney\nDisneyland is often called the Happiest Place on Earth, but with the newly announced Season of the Force windfall of Star Wars attractions, it might end up being labeled the Happiest Place in the Galaxy.\nThe new Star Wars experiences kick off November 16 at Disneyland park in Southern California, where fans will be able to pose for photos with their favorite Star Wars characters, attend exhibits and get sneak peeks at the upcoming \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" in a new area called the Star Wars Launch Bay.\nThe Star Tours attraction will feature a new scene inspired by the upcoming film, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\"\nIn December, the Jedi Training experience plans to introduce new characters and a new villain from the Disney XD series \"Star Wars Rebels.\" And for a limited time, the classic Space Mountain attraction gets a Star Wars makeover with an X-wing starfighter battle.\nWe previously reported that the new Star Wars \"signature attractions\" will include the ability to pilot Han Solo's Millennium Falcon spaceship on a secret mission, and \"an epic Star Wars adventure that puts guests in the middle of a climactic battle.\"\nFans will also have the opportunity to revisit favorite scenes from classic Star Wars films at Tomorrowland Theater, as well as purchase themed food and beverages, and merchandise.\nDisney is planning to expand in 2016 at both Disneyland park in Southern California and Disney's Hollywood Studios in Florida.\nBecause Disneyland plans to take guests to a galaxy far, far away with new Star Wars-themed lands, they'll have to temporarily close -- probably for a year -- Rivers of America and the Disneyland Railroad starting on January 10. However, Frontierland's Big Thunder Ranch, which includes Big Thunder Ranch Barbecue, Big Thunder Ranch Petting Farm and Big Thunder Ranch Jamboree, will close permanently.", "external_links": ["http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/28/16509a47-4978-413c-855d-fe7932ebc859/resize/570xauto/9b875424f3f5121e89e5328a6cf75e6d/disneylandstarwars1.jpg", "http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/09/season-of-the-force-begins-november-16-at-disneyland-park-in-southern-california/", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/disneyland-684495-wars-officials.html"], "published": "2015-09-28T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:11:58.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
