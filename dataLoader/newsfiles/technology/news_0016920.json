Reactions to our product and delivery model have been enthusiastic and consistently positive, and we look forward to enhancing the QSpex experience as we expand in New York and across major U.S. and overseas markets in the next year.”Craig said QSpex plans to open Optical Service Centers in 12 major U.S. markets and select European markets beginning in January, though he declined to identify them.QSpex is kicking off its presence in New York with a consumer advertising and social media campaign with the tagline “Glasses Same Day. Delivered Your Way.” The advertising will be seen throughout Manhattan on billboards, subways and digital kiosks, and will feature black and white backgrounds highlighted by purple chairs, benches and stadium seats, underscoring how QSpex is ready to deliver to consumers’ location of choice. All communications will include a call to action for consumers to visit www.QSpexNYC.com , a microsite that will provide locations for QSpex authorized retailers.To order QSpex eyewear, consumers can now visit more than 100 QSpex authorized retailers in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area. The eyecare provider then sends the consumer’s frames to the QSpex Optical Service Center, where lenses fitting the desired prescription, are coated and finished using QSpex proprietary technology. The finished eyewear is then dispatched directly to the consumer’s location of choice via the QSpex fleet of branded vehicles, where a QSpex licensed optician performs final measurements and makes any necessary adjustments. The entire process is completed within hours, according to QSpex.Craig also announced a strategic business relationship with China-based spectacle lens maker Shanghai Conant Optical . Under the new agreement, QSpex will continue to supplement its same-day range of products and services with Conant’s complementary range of products. In addition, both companies will share new and existing product development and manufacturing infrastructure, under protective licensing terms, to aid in the development of new products to be offered through the QSpex-Conant partnership. Together, they will develop, launch, market, and operate an integrated model to deliver a unique and comprehensive same-day offering in addition to complementary optical lenses for a more extensive, bundled approach. The collaboration will enable QSpex and Conant to continue to serve traditional markets and channels, and allow for the expansion into nationally and globally scaled retail channels as well as emerging and underserved geographies, Craig said.Craig said QSpex is further expanding its product line with the introduction of a blue light-blocking lens called QSpex blu-bloQ.
