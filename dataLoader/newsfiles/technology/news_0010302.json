New categories will be announced every Monday via Livestock’s Instagram , Twitter and Facebook accounts, as well as on the blog . \nLivestock’s elegant, contemporary wood frames come in white, black, walnut and silver, and are available in six sizes. The company’s expert printer can adjust the color, sharpness and contrast of each image to ensure the print looks beautiful, whether taken with a smartphone or high-end camera, all for free. Each frame is hand-crafted from the finest wood moulding, and completed with a custom-cut and beveled 8-ply mat, all put together by expert framers. Photos are mounted using acid-free, conservation foam core and are covered with a UV-protective acrylic to help preserve the special images for many years to come. \n“Advances in digital camera technology mean that anyone with a modern smartphone has a terrific camera with them most of the time,” said Livestock founder Mike Malone. “Because of this, photographs have become a favored form of expression, and we at Livestock wanted to give people a platform to have their favorite expressions beautifully printed and framed. And to that end, we believe everyone should have access to professional framing without the time commitment – and often sticker shock – associated with a trip to the frame shop.” \nPrices range from $75 for a 10-by-12-inch frame to $550 for a 40-by-50-inch frame. The shopping process has been streamlined to three easy steps: \n1. Simply upload a photo and indicate whether you want professional touch up. \n2. Choose from the 4 frame colors and 6 size options \n3. Place order \nA Portland native, Malone left a career on Wall Street and joined the burgeoning maker movement to nurture his passion for photography. In returning to Portland, Malone has tapped into Portland’s artisan culture to create an heirloom product that can be appreciated for generations to come. \nFor more information: livestockframing.com View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150921005453/en/ Copyright © Business Wire 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T17:52:31.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
