Death and pain in digital brains One day we will create virtual minds. Could they feel pain, asks Anders Sandberg of the Future of Humanity Institute Digital mind: one day a copy of your brain could be replicated in a computer A human brain model overlaid with a stylised network of neurons, copyright BBP/EPFL 2014 \nI turned off the computer as I left my office, deleting the neural network simulation that I had been working on. Then a thought hit me: had I just killed something? I rationalised that the simulation was simpler than the systems within the bacteria I was doubtlessly squashing on the floor. If they did not matter, neither did it. But the doubt remainedâ€¦ \nSCIENCE has a problem. If we want to find out what really happens in living beings, or how to cure diseases, often we must experiment on them. Digital simulations offer a way out. \nEver since the squid giant axon was modelled in the 1950s using a mechanical calculator, our ability to simulate biological systems has skyrocketed. Today we can run neural simulations on supercomputers ... To continue reading this premium article, subscribe for unlimited access. Existing subscribers, please log in .
