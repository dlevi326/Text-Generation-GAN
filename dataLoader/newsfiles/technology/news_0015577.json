Today many organizations still use custom production applications that are 10 years old. These legacy applications may be facing system end of life high cost of technology and inadequate information flow.\nCompanies with older generations MES are now facing a looming question whether to update or replace these custom solutions with commercially available MES software. Critical Manufacturing has released a white paper addressing the challenges for the global manufacturers that consider migration to a modern .\nThe context conditions will help to set the path for adapting one of the three main techniques Big Bang Phased Introduction or Parallel Systems. When selecting the right strategy for changing the MES manufacturers must take into consideration level of interdependencies automation and downtown impact which determine the critical factors of that decision: time cost and risk.\n“An MES is rarely changed as the impact is great and process can be painful! Any migration project involves a significant amount of time cost and risk but when done for the right reasons and with the right preparation the migration can reap immediate benefits and bring indirect advantages” says Francisco Almada-Lobo CEO for Critical Manufacturing. ”It’s essential for the success of the project to get a full commitment of all departments involved in the migration. We hope this paper will help manufacturers evaluate the business and operational drivers for MES replacement.”\nDetails on the MES migration strategies and migration planning are available now in a new paper from Critical Manufacturing titled “MES Migration Strategies” available at \nABOUT CRITICAL MANUFACTURING\nCritical Manufacturing provides innovative software technology and advanced services that empower operations for some of the most advanced manufacturers worldwide.
