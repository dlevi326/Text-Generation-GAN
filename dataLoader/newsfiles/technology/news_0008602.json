Demand for portable toilet rentals will rebound. Concerts, camp grounds and other outdoor recreational events have also experienced strong growth. Standards are primarily concerned with the number of toilets on-site and proper disposal of waste.”\n“Using the toilet is a basic human need. When the urge to use the john comes, one simply has to go,” says Cattya Bella, Director of Product Development for World Patent Marketing. “Thankfully, there is an abundance of public toilets; unfortunately its cleanliness and sanitation leaves much to be desired. This is where our new household invention, the Toilet Tab, comes in. It provides a cleaner and safer option when making use of public toilets.”\nMost people are concerned about harmful germs and bacteria on the surface of toilet seats. Sometimes people kick the toilet seat up or use for other objects, such as toilet paper, to lift cover up. The Toilet Tab is a household invention that offers a safer and more hygienic way of making use of public toilets. This unique and highly functional invention also has a deodorizer feature which prevents toilets from emitting a foul or unpleasant smell. This bathroom accessory is simple and easy to use.\n“Everyone who uses the public facilities will benefit from this household invention,”says James M., inventor of the Toilet Tab. “Public toilets are essentially filthy and filled with bacteria. With this invention, people will be able to conveniently and easily lift the toilet seat up without having to actually touch the surface. Moreover, people with disability or injuries, such as arthritis, would have an easier time lifting the toilet seat up.”\nMatthew Robertson, a social media expert and frequent traveler from Phoenix, AR, has this to say about the Toilet Tab: “Men will be more conscious to lift the toilet seats up before they use it, thus preventing the toilet seat from getting soiled. In addition to this, it will appeal to young boys who are learning bathroom etiquette as fun logos or fun characters such as super heroes may be placed on the tab.”\nThe Toilet Tab is a household invention that helps keep germs at bay. It provides a cleaner way to use public facilities. So, the next time a toilet break is needed while out and about town, be sure to use the Toilet Tab.\nAbout World Patent Marketing\nWorld Patent Marketing is a vertically integrated manufacturer and engineer of patented products.
