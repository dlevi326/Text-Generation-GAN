(NYSE Paris:SESG) (LuxX:SESG) is exhibiting, at IBC 2015, a series of innovative solutions for broadcasters, platform operators and content owners to distribute their content in a converging broadcast-broadband ecosystem: linear or on-demand, over satellite or internet, on any device. \nThese demos are exhibited at the SES stand at IBC 2015 in Amsterdam and are managed by SES Platform Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SES. The demos include FLUID HUB, a “managed cloud” platform to play and deliver audio-visual content, LIQUID VOD (video on demand) and LUCID OVP (online video platform). \nFLUID HUB provides customers with efficient, automated archiving, processing and distribution on a variety of video platforms, including fast uploading and editing of videos, images and metadata. Since its launch in April 2015, SES Platform Services is already serving over 20 VOD portals. \nIn addition to serving VOD portals, SES has also designed its own VOD solution, LIQUID VOD, to serve communities living in underserved areas where there is a lack of broadband internet connectivity. LIQUID VOD demonstrates how SES can provide an instantaneous and premium video experience on demand via satellite that can be used by DTH platform operators and broadcasters to differentiate their services. \nLUCID OVD is an end-to-end online video solution, combining linear TV Streaming, catch-up TV and video on demand into one powerful online video platform. From content management and backend services to frontend application for mobile devices (iOS, Android) and TV screen (IP box), platform operators can complement their video business with online video and a multiscreen user experience, while broadcasters and content providers can set up an online video service to complement their DTH content. \n“With these services and platforms, SES continuously expands its offer along the broadcasting value chain and fosters its key competencies in the development and delivery of hybrid and smart video solutions,” said Ferdinand Kayser, Chief Commercial Officer of SES. “Our approach allows us to provide one stop shop services to broadcasters who want to stay ahead of the competition and deploy new offers in the converging broadcast and broadband ecosystem. SES has also been at the forefront of developing the SAT>IP technology, which converts satellite signals into IP, making it possible to distribute high quality content to any IP-enabled devices at home, such as tablets, smartphones and laptops.” \nThe demos will be presented at the SES stand at Hall 1, stand 1.B51 during IBC 2015, Amsterdam. \nFollow us on:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T17:57:07.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
