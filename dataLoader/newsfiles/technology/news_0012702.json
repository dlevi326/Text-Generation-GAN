Before the comment by the presidential hopeful, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was hovering around the flatline. Following Mrs. Clinton's remark, which referenced a New York Times article published Sunday that focused on a certain drug's sharp price increase, the biotech index started its tumble. The index ended 4.4% lower.\nMajor indexes recovered from their midday pullback in late afternoon trading, however, as the market shook off initial concerns.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 125.61 points, or 0.8%, at 16510.19, and the S&P 500 rose 8.94 points, or 0.5%, to 1966.97, after both indexes declined sharply on Friday. In early trading the Dow industrials had risen as much as 194 points before Mrs. Clinton's tweet. Following the tweet the index gave up all but seven points at its lowest level.\n\"Some stocks were getting hit a little in the morning, but when the tweet went out the selling was considerable,\" said Sahak Manuelian, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. He added that the sector fell on Friday, and entering Monday he expected biotech shares to lose some ground, but not this much. \"Guys started selling first and asking questions later,\" he said.\nShares of biotechnology companies, one of the hottest segments of the stock market in recent years, tend to be volatile. In March 2014, biotech companies sold off and dragged the broad market lower following a congressional complaint about the high price of a Gilead Sciences Inc. Hepatitis C drug.\nIn 2015, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index climbed more than 30% for the year through late July, as investors, enthused by new biotech drugs and potential treatments as well as some strong earnings growth, scooped up shares of the companies. But the segment then fell out of favor, tumbling more than 18% by late August.\nThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index remains 12% higher for the year.\nBesides the selloff in biotech companies, markets around the globe generally steadied Monday after the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision last week to keep interest rates at record lows sparked a global selloff amid fears about the fragile state of the global economy. Although rock-bottom rates have helped fuel years of rising stocks since the financial crisis, the Fed's reluctance to lift borrowing costs was seen as a reminder that growth in the U.S. and elsewhere remains vulnerable to a slowdown in China.\nSome investors warned the Fed's decision and the uncertainty it brings has created a lasting overhang on stock markets.\n\"We're in for a period of choppy markets,\" said Julian Chillingworth, chief investment officer at Rathbone Brothers PLC, which manages GBP28.3 billion ($43.9 billion) in assets.\n\"People are now going to debate whether the Fed does or doesn't raise rates this year. With that uncertainty, markets will be focusing on the short term,\" he said.\nIn Europe, markets were mostly higher, encouraged by Alexis Tsipras's resounding win in Sunday's Greek election. Mr. Tsipras's re-election after agreeing a bailout deal may soothe tensions with European creditors that jolted markets during the summer.\n\"We are left with the same government that signed the [bailout] deal. The positive part of the outcome was the parties critical of Europe didn't really gain,\" said Thomas Wacker, head of credit research at UBS Wealth Management.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 closed 0.9% higher, having fallen 1.8% in the previous session.\nIn Asia, most indexes fell as markets reacted to Friday's decline on Wall Street, the biggest one-day loss in two weeks.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.7% and Australia's S&P/ ASX 200 lost 2%. China bucked the trend, with the Shanghai Composite closing 1.9% higher.\nJapanese markets were closed for a holiday.\nIn currency markets, the dollar rebounded from its post-Fed-decision losses. The euro was recently 1.1% lower against the dollar at $1.1189. The dollar climbed 0.4% against the yen to Yen120.5190.\nIn commodities, crude oil rose 4.5% to $46.68 a barrel. Gold was down 0.5% at $1,133.10 a troy ounce.\nWrite to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com and Tommy Stubbington at tommy.stubbington@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nSeptember 21, 2015 16:55 ET (20:55 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T09:55:53.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
