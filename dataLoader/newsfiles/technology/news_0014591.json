Over 250,000 patients have been treated to date with Leonhardt inventions. In the 1980's the group developed market leadership in patented cardiovascular polyurethane balloon catheters including drug, stem cell and radiation delivery systems and also turn-key cath labs and CCUs. In the 1990s they developed over 20 additional devices including the first commercially successful stent graft for aortic aneurysm repair (TALENT – Taheri-Leonhardt Stent Graft) - SEE VIDEO https://vimeo.com/85232193 , the first percutaneous heart valve, intravascular lung catheter, the Pro-Cell intracavity stem cell delivery system and the MyoCath line of stem cell delivery catheters. Leonhardt patented inventions - http://patents.justia.com/inventor/howard-j-leonhardt - include the first heart failure pacemaker able to recruit reparative stem cells to damaged heart tissue (MyoStim Pacers - www.myostimpacers.com). In 2001 the team led the first in the world non-surgical case of stem cell repair of damaged heart muscle in a human patient with Bioheart MyoCell . That led to the first Phase II/III double blinded, randomized, placebo controlled trial for muscle stem cells growing new contractile muscle in post heart attack tissue in advanced heart failure patients – results published in the American Heart Journal Bioheart MyoCell patients 95.7 meters improvement in exercise capacity over placebo (minus 4 meters decline). The Leonhardt led team at BIoPace is preparing to complete the first ever biological pacemaker implantation made entirely of living cells in a human patient within the next 12-18 months.
