And those that do often emphasize abstinence .\nIn Denmark, falling birth rates have led policymakers to spice up the sex-ed curriculum. Rather than focus just on preventing pregnancy, teachers are also warning teens about the risks of waiting too long to have kids.\nAverage Age of Women at Childbirth in Denmark\nEurostat / Quartz “Young people want between two and three children and they are having between one and two,” says Bjarne Christensen, secretary-general of Sex and Society, a nonprofit group that provides much of Denmark’s sex-ed teaching materials. “Most people are getting fewer than they thought they could have, and fewer than they wanted. ”\nMore From Quartz With a Big New Influx of Design Students, China Sets Its Sights on New York Fashion Slovenia Is Becoming the Latest Hotspot in Europe’s Migration Crisis The Refugee Tripped by a Hungarian Camerawoman Has an Amazing New Job in Spain Across Europe, aging populations are putting pressure on the continent’s generous social services .
