Paint like Van Gogh: University of Tubingen's deep learning algorithm teaches computers how to turn photographs into paintings inspired by famous works of art (University of Tubingen) \nArtificial neural networks are inspired by the human brain and are designed to simulate the way neurons behave when they are shown a sensory input, such as sound or images. Besides image recognition, the technology is being developed as a way to greatly improve weather predictions as well as medical diagnosis and detection of breast cancer. \nCreating masterpieces in under an hour \nBut now German researchers have gone one step further, designing a deep learning computer algorithm that is able to distil and understand the essence of how a great masterpiece is painted, in terms of style, colours, technique and brush strokes. Deep learning algorithm: From a row of houses to Romanticist art Ã  la Joseph Mallord William Turner (University of Tubingen) \nWhen a photograph is fed to the computer, the computer can then turn the photo into an artistic painting using the painter's signature style, be it the work of artists like Van Gogh, Edvard Munch, Picasso or JM Turner. \nThe algorithm teaches the computer how to identify and separate the style and the content of images, so while the buildings and layout of the image stayed the same, the colours, lines and \"local structures\" changed to emulate the famous work of art that had been imputed into the system. The deep learning algorithm was also able to create a scream of a piece by imitating Expressionism artist Edvard Munch (University of Tubingen) \nUsing a series of paintings that included Van Gogh's The Starry Night, The Scream by Edvard Munch and The Shipwreck of the Minotaur by JMW Turner, the computer produced surprisingly beautiful results that still retained many elements from the original photograph. \nNo similar artificial system able to understand art \n\"In fine art, especially painting, humans have mastered the skill to create unique visual experiences through composing a complex interplay between the content and style of an image. Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities,\" the researchers write. Even painting like Picasso is possible, as the neural network shows by producing a piece inspired by Femme nue assise (University of Tubingen) \n\"The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images.\" \nThe open-access paper, entitled \" A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style \" is published on the Cornell University Library repository. \nThe researchers concluded: \"In light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised artificial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.\" YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS Sponsored Content by Taboola", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T21:17:59.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
