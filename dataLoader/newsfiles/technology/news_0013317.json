The four-week average, a less-volatile measure, increased 3,250 to 275,500. That average has fallen 9.2 percent over the past 12 months. \nThe report points to the resilience of the U.S. economy as international pressures are dampening growth. Employers largely have kept their staffs intact, as applications for jobless benefits, a proxy for layoffs, have remained near 15-year lows for the past several months. \nCoupled with steady job growth, the modest number of applications suggests that the economy will continue an expansion that just entered its seventh year, potentially enabling the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. \nEconomists expect that the government’s latest employment report due out today will show the addition of 207,500 jobs in August and a lower unemployment rate of 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent, according to FactSet. \nHiring at that pace suggests the U.S. economy has been insulated from uncertainty about China’s financial health, a Canadian economy that just slid into recession, a struggling Europe and the stock market sell-off of the past month. \nA private-sector jobs survey released Wednesday indicated that employers have weathered the global turmoil and kept hiring in August. \nPayroll processor ADP said that businesses added 190,000 jobs last month. This marks an increase from 177,000 in July, but it’s below a six-month high in June of 231,000. \nMuch of the hiring appears to have occurred at companies with less international exposure. The report found that small businesses with fewer than 50 employees accounted for 85,000 hires in August, while medium businesses with fewer than 500 employees added 66,000.
