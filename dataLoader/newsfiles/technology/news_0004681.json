These wireless monochrome printers are aimed at consumers and small business users looking for high-speed performance and easy-to-use functionality, including mobile printing and enterprise level security, as well as low operating costs. \n“Today, we’re often juggling laptops, tablets and smartphones all at once, managing our busy lives at the office, in our homes and everywhere in between. Having the ability to easily print from any of these devices on demand is not only extremely convenient, it’s often a necessity,” said Dave Das, Senior Vice President, Consumer Electronics Marketing, Consumer Business Division, Samsung Electronics America. “As consumers and business users alike are increasingly printing from mobile devices, Samsung printers make it easy to do so, resulting in a hassle-free experience from anywhere.” \nHigh-Speed Performance with Professional Results \nThe M2875DW makes it easy for everyone from small business owners to college students to print complex documents even when pressed for time, thanks to print speeds of up to 29 pages per minute (ppm). For maximum efficiency, these rapid print speeds are powered by a Cortex™ -A5 core processor and fueled with up to 128 MB of memory. \nPrint quality is enhanced by Samsung’s Rendering Engine for Clean Page (ReCP) technology, resulting in premium print results at home. ReCP enhances thin lines and sharpens edges, creating ultra-sharp text and clear images on a range of paper sizes and weights. The printer crisply renders images of any size and increases the readability of even the most intricate documents. \nProtecting Users’ Wallets and the Environment \nThe M2875DW features Samsung’s One-Touch Eco Button, aimed to help professionals with small businesses or home offices lower toner and paper usage, saving users money and limiting environmental impact. \nUnnecessary toner use can increase operating costs and the M2875DW is designed to help avoid such waste. The printer’s Easy Eco Driver, granted an Outstanding Achievement in Innovation Award from Buyers Laboratory (BLI), reduces toner use by up to 20 percent. The driver makes it easy for users to remove unnecessary images or bold text in the printed document, ensuring that only the toner absolutely needed is used. \nThe M2875DW also automatically adjusts print jobs to be more efficient through Eco Mode, which enables two-up printing (two pages on the same side) and duplex printing (printing on both sides). Eco Mode also offers users a toner save mode as well as the option to save paper by ensuring blank pages are skipped. \nThe M2875DW has a range of laser toner cartridges, from standard-yield cartridges (up to 1,200 standard pages) to high yield (up to 3,000 standard pages), meeting the needs of a variety of users while reducing the cost per page. \nImproved Productivity with Wireless Connectivity and 3-in-1 Multifunction Capabilities \nSamsung is committed to ensuring that the demands of today’s highly mobile consumers are met with ease by offering a range of wireless print options. The Samsung Mobile Print app, available in the Google® Play Store for Android™ and the App Store for iOS®, allows users to wirelessly print directly from their mobile devices with just a few clicks. The app detects any compatible Samsung printer on the same Wi-Fi network, and the user is synced effortlessly with the printer, with no complicated setup or additional drivers. The embedded Wi-Fi Direct connection allows up to five devices to be simultaneously connected to the printer, making it easy for families, roommates or small business employees to share access, all with equal ease-of-use. With 3-in-1 versatility including printing, copying and scanning functionality, the M2875DW offers flexibility without barriers. \nThe Samsung Multifunction Xpress M2875DW will be available on September 20, 2015 for an MSRP of $179.99.
