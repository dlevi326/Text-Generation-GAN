Some 65pc said they expected to hire up to five more staff over the next two years, compared with an average of 61pc. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) comes despite warnings that small firms could crumble under the strain of minimum wage hikes. Earlier this week, CBI chief John Cridland told The Telegraph the Government needs to do more to cushion the impact of the National Living Wage, a new payment threshold that means all people aged 25 and over will receive a minimum wage of £9 by 2020. \nSimos Kitiris and his wife Katie, founders of online food marketplace Yumbles, sold their house in Barnes, south-west London, to finance the launch of their business last summer . \n“We wanted to only go to investors once we had the company up and running, and had some initial validation to the assumptions we had made pre-launch,” said Mr Kitiris. “Bank lending is really not an option to businesses like ours. Internet businesses are typically riskier, but at the same time have the potential to scale up fast and this is not something that traditional banks are looking for.” \nYumbles, which features artisan products, employs eight people from its base in Hertfordshire and Mr Kitiris plans to double this by 2016. \nThere were 5.2m private sector businesses in the UK last year, according to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, after a record annual increase of 330,000 on 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T01:25:56.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
