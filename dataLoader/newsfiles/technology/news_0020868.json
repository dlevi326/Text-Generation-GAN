These challenges include the looming prospect of higher borrowing costs as the West African country adapts to a new era of low prices for oil and other key commodities. This, according to the World Bank Group’s latest Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report released recently. \nLow oil prices have considerably reduced growth in commodity-exporting countries (Angola, Nigeria), and also slowed activity in non-oil sectors . \nIn responding to the challenging business environment, senior management is increasingly looking to IT to provide innovation and transformation, reduce costs and improve business efficiency. \nThese challenges will require a new vision and operating model for IT infrastructure and service delivery—one that is far more responsive, adaptive, scalable and efficient than yesterday’s version. \nThis Innovation Dinner will address the many challenges faced by today’s IT leaders in Nigeria, and provide a roadmap towards delivering sustainable business. \nAbout Dimension Data: \nFounded in 1983, Dimension Data plc is an ICT services and solutions provider that uses its technology expertise, global service delivery capability, and entrepreneurial spirit to accelerate the business ambitions of its clients.
