On Monday, they rejected his appeal and allowed the execution to proceed. Glossip then petitioned the Supreme Court for a stay of execution and filed a writ of certiorari in which he argued he is innocent. On Wednesday evening, the court rejected his appeal.\nAn Oklahoma jury sentenced Glossip to death for his role in the murder of motel owner Barry Van Treese in January 1997. Glossip worked at the motel Van Treese owned, but did not kill him. Justin Sneed, another motel employee, claimed that Glossip paid him to bludgeon Van Treese to death. No direct physical evidence linked Glossip to Van Treese’s murder, though prosecutors cited his erratic behavior on the day of the murder at trial. In exchange for his testimony, Sneed received a life sentence.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/fordm/status/649312167292989442", "http://t.co/PxAVE9VNBV"], "published": "2015-10-01T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T23:20:56.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
