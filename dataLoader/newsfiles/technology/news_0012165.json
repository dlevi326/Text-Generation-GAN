Smartphone apps let you deposit checks. Websites let you pay bills and transfer funds. These days, you can do almost every banking chore without talking to a human being. Almost. But what if you need some old-fashioned customer service? Unfortunately, lots of local banks fall short.\nBay Area Consumers’ Checkbook and Checkbook.org surveyed banking customers (predominately Checkbook and Consumer Reports subscribers) and asked them to rate their banks for customer service. Checkbook found substantial differences.\nGenerally, small banks and credit unions rated higher than the largest banks. Among the banks that rated highest for overall service were First Republic Bank , Bank of Marin and Mechanics Bank , which were all rated “superior” by more than 80 percent of their surveyed customers.\nOn the other hand, some large banks, including Well Fargo, Chase, Citibank and Bank of America , each received “superior” ratings for overall service from fewer than half of their surveyed customers.\nBut a few large banks rated fairly high: For example, Bank of the West was rated “superior” for overall service by 70 percent of its surveyed customers.\nAmong credit unions, standouts include Contra Costa Federal Credit Union , Pacific Service Credit Union and Redwood Credit Union — all rated “superior” for overall service by more than 90 percent of their surveyed customers. Although some credit unions narrowly restrict membership, others have very loose requirements.\nFor example, although Pacific Service Credit Union originally was set up for just PG&E employees, now anyone who lives, works, worships or attends school anywhere in the Bay Area can join.\nMany banks received their lowest scores for “reasonableness of fee policies.” Because banks increasingly rely on special fees to boost profit, Checkbook advises that you review your bank’s policies, and consider taking your business elsewhere if you think you’re being charged unreasonable fees.\nName\nWebsite\nCounties served\nBranches\nBank of Marin\nwww.bankofmarin.com\nAlameda, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, Solano\n21\nFirst Republic Bank\nwww.firstrepublic.com\nAlameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Sonoma\n35\nMechanics Bank\nwww.mechanicsbank.com\nAlameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco\n27\nChevron Federal Credit Union\nwww.chevronfcu.org\nContra Costa, San Francisco\n4\nContra Costa Federal Credit Union\nwww.contracostafcu.org\nContra Costa, Solano\n5\nRedwood Credit Union\nwww.redwoodcu.org\nMarin, Napa, San Francisco, Solano\n12\nSan Francisco Fire Credit Union\nwww.sffirecu.org\nSan Francisco\n3\nStar One Credit Union\nwww.starone.org\nSolano\n5\nUNCLE Credit Union\nwww.unclecu.org\nAlameda\n3\nLimited time free access : The Chronicle is partnering with Bay Area Consumers’ Checkbook magazine and Checkbook.org, a nonprofit consumer group that rates service firms and professionals, to help you find the best services in the Bay Area.
