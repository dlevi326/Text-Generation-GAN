The Upper House is managed by Swire Hotels, an international management company with properties in Asia, Europe and North America.\nDesigned by architect Andre Fu, The Upper House is a distinctive modern luxury property that sits atop Hong Kong’s bustling urban landscape. Duetto provides the only pricing solution able to handle today’s complexity of different customer segments, room categories, length of stay restrictions and distribution channels. The company’s approach, combining Open Pricing and Big Data analysis, has enabled Duetto customers to far outpace their competitive sets, often seeing twice the rate of revenue growth over their competitors.\nMarcel Thoma, General Manager of The Upper House, said, “In a competitive and rapidly changing marketplace, it’s imperative that we are able to price across today’s complex distribution landscape and respond quickly to changing market dynamics. Duetto provides the latest technology to incorporate complex data sets and demand insights into our pricing decisions. We are also excited to apply Open Pricing to yield by room type to maximize our hotel’s revenue. We look forward to a long and productive partnership.”\nOpened in October 2009 and sister to Beijing’s The Opposite House, The Upper House occupies the top floors of Pacific Place. Its look and feel is decidedly modern and understated, with creamy, neutral tones, sleek, modernist furnishings and sizable studios filled with the latest high tech amenities. Famed chef Gray Kunz’s Cafe Gray Deluxe serves updated classics, while the bar and lounge and many of its rooms deliver incredible views.\n“We are happy to announce this partnership with The Upper House, as Duetto’s Revenue Strategy Solutions continue to gain traction at many of the region’s most distinctive hotel properties,” said Patrick Bosworth, Duetto CEO and co-founder. “The hotel community in Hong Kong and similar markets have a critical need to find solutions that allow for flexibility to fully optimize revenue and keep pace with the evolving distribution landscape, and we are proud to join with The Upper House, and Swire Hotels, to make those capabilities available.”\nSource:-Duetto", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:14:22.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
