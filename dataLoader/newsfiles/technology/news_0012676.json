Following successful launches in select U.S. cities, mobile ordering is emerging as the fastest and easiest way for Starbucks customers to order ahead, then pay and pick up their purchases – providing on-the-go customers a simple and quick alternative to get their favorite food or beverage item. Starbucks plans to introduce this feature in select company owned stores in the UK and Canada in October. \n“Bringing Mobile Order and Pay to our customers is about meeting their needs of convenience and customization at any time of the day” said Adam Brotman, Starbucks chief digital officer. “The fact that it also represents the fastest technology application rollout we have ever done is indicative of the strength of our digital ecosystem, how well it has been received by both our customers and store partners and the impact we think it can have on the future of retail.” \nFollowing the initial test of Mobile Order & Pay in Portland, Oregon in December 2014 and subsequent launch across the Pacific Northwest in March 2015, Starbucks expanded the program to 3,400 additional stores across 17 states in the U.S. earlier this summer. Today’s announcement marks the completion of the national rollout with the feature now available on both iOS and Android devices to use at Starbucks more than 7,400 company-owned stores across the country. \nThe Mobile Order & Pay feature allows customers to choose a store from a map view, browse, select and customize beverage and food items, view the estimated timeframe the order will be ready, and pre-pay for the order - all within the Starbucks Mobile App. Menu options highlight products available in specific geographic regions and stores, and orders are freshly prepared and ready for pick-up in the bar area. \nMobile Order & Pay is integrated into Starbucks world-class Mobile App and My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, providing a simple way for customers to sign up and earn coveted Stars. It’s available for customers using a Starbucks app for iPhone or Starbucks app for Android. \nSOURCE: Starbucks Like what you are reading?
