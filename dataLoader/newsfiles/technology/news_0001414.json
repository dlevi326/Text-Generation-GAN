This can be attributed largely to convenience and that the software's security audit did not turn up major critical vulnerabilities in the program. \nThe audit did find some issues which the VeraCrypt developers fixed (mostly) in previous updates. \nVeraCrypt, which is based on TrueCrypt code but still under active development, is one of several alternatives for TrueCrypt users who are looking for alternatives for the abandoned program. \nThe two vulnerabilities fixed in VeraCrypt 1.15 are: CVE-2015-7358 (critical): Local Elevation of Privilege on Windows by abusing drive letter handling. CVE-2015-7359: Local Elevation of Privilege on Windows caused by incorrect Impersonation Token Handling. \nBoth appear to be local attacks meaning that attackers need to gain local access to the PC to exploit them. While that is the case, it is certain that TrueCrypt won't be updated to fix these issues in the software which in turn means that TrueCrypt remains vulnerable to attacks exploiting them. \nThis in turn means that TrueCrypt users need to decide whether it is time to move to another encryption software or keep using the vulnerable TrueCrypt. \nVeraCrypt is one candidate for making the switch, especially since it can convert TrueCrypt containers and non-system partitions to the format it supports. The software can mount TrueCrypt volumes furthermore so that it is possible to switch to it without making any changes to the system provided that the system partition has not been encrypted using TrueCrypt. \nThe easiest way to deal with it is to decrypt it using TrueCrypt before you encrypt it again from within VeraCrypt. \nOther feature additions in VeraCrypt 1.15 and 1.14 include support for a volume expander in the Traveler Disk Setup, a regression fix in mounting of favorite volumes at user login, and options to verify a created rescue disk ISO image file. \nIt seems to be time to abandon TrueCrypt for good as it is likely that additional vulnerabilities will be found in the software in the future. Summary VeraCrypt 1.15 fixes two recently reported TrueCrypt vulnerabilities Author Martin Brinkmann Description The most recent VeraCrypt update to version 1.15 fixes two recently discovered vulnerabilities in the encryption software TrueCrypt.
