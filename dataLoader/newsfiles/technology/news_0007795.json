Could not subscribe, try again later Pikachu is one of the Pokemon you'll be able to catch \nThe monster-hunting Pokemon craze from the 90s has taken a step into the 21st century with a new app announced this morning. \nPokemon Go is a location-based app for Android and iOS that lets you hunt down the adorable little critters \"in the real word\". \nCo-developed by Nintendo and GPS-specialists Niantic Labs, the app puts characters like Pikachu right in front of you using your smartphone. \nForget Angry Birds, everyone will be playing this next year \nThere's also a Bluetooth accessory shaped like a Pokeball that you can use to capture the beastie. \nIt pairs with your phone and will flash and vibrate if you've successfully captured a Pokemon. Pokémon Go Plus notifies you of events in the game. That is never going to leave my wrist, LOL. #Pokemon pic.twitter.com/3FzS0X7mMY — Roger DiLuigi III (@RogersBase) September 10, 2015 \n“Our partnership with The Pokémon Company and Nintendo is an exciting step forward in real-world gaming and using technology to help players discover the world and people around them,” said John Hanke, founder and CEO of Niantic, Inc. \nPlenty of people took to Twitter to share their thoughts on the new Pokemon app. Pokémon GO is going to blur the lines between fiction and reality. Soon I'll be beating up people's pets and asking them for badges. — Sammy Paul (@ICOEPR) September 10, 2015 NO WAY - catch Pokemon IRL? BRB quiting life and become a Pokemon trainer!
