This led to a decline in the number of formal sector employees to 8.942-million from 8.986-million in the fourth quarter of last year.\nMining and quarrying, manufacturing and the trade industries contracted in the second quarter and the report was always going to show jobs had been shed.\nThe government will no longer be able to act as the driver of job creation, as it tries to bring down growth in the wage bill.\nWith sectors such as mining and manufacturing battling high input costs and low commodity prices the formal sector will also create very little employment until there is an improvement in the economy’s growth prospects.\nBut with employment prospects not looking so bright, spending and access to credit by households will remain subdued, which will not support economic growth.\nOn Wednesday the Reserve Bank is due to release the private-sector credit extension data for August, which will indicate developments around credit extended to households and private firms.\nIn July growth in private sector credit extension accelerated slightly to 8.4% from 8.1%. This slow pace of growth is in line with muted economic activity.\nGrowth in credit granted to households has been slow. Consumers are contending with tighter lending criteria from financial institutions, slower growth in wages, rising interest rates, and higher water and electricity tariffs.\nCompanies on the other hand continue to increase their credit uptake, not to invest in SA but other countries that have higher demand and less stringent business regulations.\nA small surplus is expected to have been recorded on the trade balance for August, which the South African Revenue Service will publish on Wednesday — indicating that SA exported more than it imported.\nA surplus on the trade balance could be an indication of slightly better demand in SA’s trading partner countries such as the US, and less demand for imports due to the effects of a weak rand. A small R397.4m trade deficit was recorded in July.\nThursday sees the release of the Barclays manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for September and the First National Bank/Bureau for Economic Research’s consumer confidence index for the third quarter.\nManufacturers and consumers alike have nothing much to be confident about. Economic growth is sluggish, commodity prices are nowhere near recovering, companies are laying off workers and more are threatening to do so, electricity tariffs are soaring, the petrol price relief appears to be coming to an end, and interest rates are set to rise further.\nThe FNB/Bureau for Economic Research consumer confidence index is likely to have improved slightly in the third quarter but remained in negative territory. It fell to a 14-year low of -15 in the second quarter. Factors that could have offset negative sentiment are the fuel price cuts in August and September and fewer days of load shedding earlier in the year.\nThe seasonally adjusted Barclays PMI fell by 2.5 index points to 48.9 last month — suggesting a contraction in manufacturing sector activity. A slight improvement in the index is likely, given fewer disruptions to manufacturing activity this month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:39:23.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
