The ‘Gove effect’ has led to a drop of more than 30 per cent in turnover in tourism business over the past two years.\nInfact, according to Robin Barker, chairman of the Tourism Society Westcountry, the rules were costing the industry £87 million a year.\nTwo-thirds of tourist firms in the West Country – including holiday cottages, visitor attractions and b&bs reported a drop in business due to the ban.\nThe new rules, introduced by former education secretary Michael Gove in 2013, mean families can be fined up to £60 a day for taking their children out of school. Parents who don’t pay up can be prosecuted and face a £2,500 fine and three months in prison.\nThe Daily Mail in an article reports that ‘there has been an 8 per cent drop in tourist spending across Cornwall and Devon and 19 per cent drop in visitors to Torbay alone.’\nAffected by the effect, the head of Cornwall’s tourist board is calling on the government to relax the rules and have even suggested rebranding mid-terms breaks as ‘family enrichment weeks.’\nPreviously headteachers were allowed to grant up to ten days leave for children to go on holiday outside school breaks – when prices can be considerably higher. But under Gove’s new rules, a mid-term break can only be approved under ‘exceptional circumstances’.\nThere has been a sharp increase in the number of parents prosecuted since the former Secretary of State for Education banned term-time holidays in 2013: last year, 16,430 parents in England were taken to court for failing to ensure their children went to school, up 25 per cent from 2013, when 13,128 were prosecuted.\nBut it hasn’t stopped as many as one in three parents risking fines and prosecution because they will not or cannot afford to pay the inflated holiday prices that kick in the day that the schools break-up, reports the Daily Mail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:51:43.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
