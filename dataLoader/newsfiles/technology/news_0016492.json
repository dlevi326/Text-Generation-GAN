New USF housing being built with innovative 3-D technology \nThe new USF off-campus apartments will include 163 units and a seven-story attached parking garage. it will be the first building of its kind in Florida. By Ashley Jeffery, Reporter Last Updated: Sunday, September 27, 2015 TAMPA -- \nThe Clark Builders Group (CBG) in Tampa is building one the newest, most innovative builds for off-ampus housing near the University of South Florida. \n“This building is the next step in construction technology,” said CBG Company Senior Vice President Chris Hirst. \nThe new six-story apartment building will be built using a patented 3-D model from the Denver-based technology company Prescient. The apartment will include 163 units and a seven-story attached parking garage. This will be the first building of its kind in Tampa and in the state of Florida. \n“We've built an algorithm that will actually take an architect's design and populate that with the system very, very precisely,” said Prescient founder John Vanker. “So now we have what I like to call an exact replica of what the build will be when it is completed.\" \nJohn Vanker's technology takes out the guesswork when it comes to materials for framing. This means no more cutting down two-by-fours to fit the frame; instead the framing will come in separate pieces, ready to install and put together. \n“In this building, we’re only bringing to the site exact things we’re going to use and no trash will be going off the site from the framing portion of the building,” Hirst said. \n“It’s really a paradigm shift for the construction industry,” Hirst said. This system fills the gap between wood and concrete or red iron construction.” \nThe framing portion of the building is expected to begin early November. The entire dorm is expected to be completed by August 2016. \nArtist’s rendering of the exterior of the courtyard. \nArtist’s rendering of the pool area. \nArtist’s rendering looking out into courtyard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T02:44:50.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
