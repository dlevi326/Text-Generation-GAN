And Amazon videos may be streamed from devices made by other manufacturers including Apple's iPads and iPhones, Android phones and tablets and Sony PlayStation consoles. \n\nAmazon last week unveiled a major home electronics push for the US market, led by a $50 tablet computer and other devices aimed at budget-conscious, gadget-hungry consumers. \n\nThe latest Fire TV devices, which compete with products from Apple as well as Roku and Google, allow users to stream in high-definition 4K. \n\nJapanese viewers will have access to TV Asahi's variety series Summers Summers, popular anime shows such as Yokai Watch and movies like Tanteiha Bar Niiru and Shirayukihime Satsujin Jiken, Amazon said. \n\nAlso available will be Amazon's original shows and US programs which may be dubbed or subtitled. \n\nThe move comes just weeks after Netflix launched its streaming television service in Japan. Netflix said in February it planned to launch this year in Japan, following rollouts in Australia and New Zealand in March. \n\nCurrently with some 65 million subscribers in over 50 countries, Netflix has set an ambitious goal to be in 200 markets by the end of 2016.
