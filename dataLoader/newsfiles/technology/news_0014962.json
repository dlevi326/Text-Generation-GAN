The software is completely powered by a smartphone, but requires a compatible host car to make use of the touchscreen, speakers and microphone; hence the requirement for a software update.\nEarlier this year, Chevrolet committed to bringing Android Auto and Apple's analogous CarPlay software to its 14 of its vehicles. The 2016 model year vehicles began getting the Apple CarPlay portion of the update in June, coincidental with the launch of the new Corvette. We now know that owners of compatible Chevrolet vehicles will be able add Android Auto to their bag of MyLink tricks as part of a software update due in March 2016.\nA representative for Chevrolet tells us that \"owners will need to go to a Chevrolet dealer to get the update,\" so on the surface this doesn't sound like a DIY solution. With the new software in place, drivers will be able to access Android Auto by plugging a compatible smartphone running the Android Lollipop 5.0 operating system into the MyLink system's USB port.\n2016 models eligible to receive the update include:\n2016 models w/ 7-inch MyLink 2016 models w/ 8-inch MyLink Spark Impala Cruze (except Limited trim) Cruze (except Limited trim) Malibu (except Limited trim) Malibu (except Limited trim) Camaro and Camaro Convertible Camaro and Camaro Convertible Silverado and Silverado HD Silverado and Silverado HD\nCorvette and Corvette Convertible Tahoe Suburban Volt With only a few exceptions, that's the majority of the Chevrolet's 2016 lineup, which makes the American automaker the brand with the most announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatible models to date.", "external_links": ["http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/05/27/7b9796cb-2388-4b52-a251-2ca396bb177d/resize/570xauto/fc01f40be67a61ef714ffdd482d01de9/chevroletandroidauto-image.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-24T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T02:31:29.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
