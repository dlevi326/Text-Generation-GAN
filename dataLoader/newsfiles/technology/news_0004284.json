Picture: Google, via EPA \nGoogle is always adding new features to its search page in an effort to give users the answers they want. Now the search giant is even giving users answers when they don’t know what they are looking for. \nFeeling bored, or just brushing up your knowledge for this evening’s pub quiz? Just type “fun facts” into the Google search box and you'll be rewarded with exactly that: a piece of trivia. Like “How many people have stood on the moon?” (12, with 8 still alive) or “Which year was the blue M&M introduced?” (1995). Want more? Click the “Ask Another Question” as many times as you want for an endless list of questions. \nOnce you've tired of trivia there is something else to try: On the Google.com page, hover over the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button and it will spin, like a slot machine, and offer alternative options like “I’m feeling hungry”, “I’m feeling wonderful” and “I’m feeling doodley”. \nThis latter trick appears to only work on the Google.com page and not country-specific Google pages. To force Google to use the .com site and not the country one, use the http://google.com/ncr link. The NCR stands for “No Country Redirect”. If you later want to go back to the country-specific site, just clear your cookies.
