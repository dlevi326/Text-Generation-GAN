With all those things taken into account, statistically sleep still carried the day and was an overwhelmingly strong predictor for susceptibility to the cold virus.\" \nScientists have long known that sleep is important for our health, with poor sleep linked to chronic illnesses, disease susceptibility and even premature death. \nPrather's previous studies have shown that people who sleep fewer hours are less protected against illness after receiving a vaccine.
