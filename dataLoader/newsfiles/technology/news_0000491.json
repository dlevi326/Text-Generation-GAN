So far nano-biologists have worked in 2D environments delivered by superpowered microscopes, but with Dr McGhee’s help they will be able to examine cell processes from an angle that could lead to discoveries and new approaches to fighting diseases such as cancer and developing drug treatments.\nDr McGhee works at a size where it is impossible to “see” anything. “It really is just pea soup because it is beyond the wavelength of light,” he said.\nHowever, using microscopic data he can reconstruct three-­dimensional cell struc­tures. The art is to make the picture comprehensible, using colours and textures to show different struc­tures.\n“It is about making the invisible visible,” he said. “This is enabling scientists to see cells in a new way. They have been looking from the outside in but now they will be able to look from the inside out — who knows where that might lead.”\nA former animator who worked on television commercials, Dr McGhee is now an academic at the University of NSW’s Art and Design centre, specialising in 3D visualisation. He was brought into the project by centre director Tom Davis, a nano scientist at Monash University who ­realised scientists needed artistic expertise and artistry to make their discoveries more accessible.\n“Too often we preach to the converted when we are communicating science,” he said. “We hope to reach a vast number of people in a way that hasn’t been done before, all aimed at increasing people’s understanding of ­nanotechnology.”\nDr McGhee said the project was part of a trend for scientists to reach out to artists to help them visualise and explain huge amounts of data produced by scanners and computer processing. “We are in a renaissance age of collaboration between disciplines,” he said. However, when working with scientists he still felt like the “oddball character”, confessing he is not sure whether to wear jeans and T-shirt or don a white coat. “It does represent a wardrobe problem,” he joked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T06:30:30.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
