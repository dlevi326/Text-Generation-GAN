This would not have been the global story that it has become if they had not responded that way.”\nThe ads, which suggest that users of the apps are at risk for diseases like chlamydia and gonorrhea, show the silhouettes of two couples leaning in. Tinder and Grindr are plastered across two of their faces in large pink letters, while the remaining two silhouettes have the names of STDs on their profiles. To the right of the couples, a website for free STD testing is listed.\n“There are consequences to hooking up,” Weinstein told the Guardian. “That’s not a moralistic judgement. It’s just a fact and minimizing that is important.”\nCurrently, there are 12 billboards up in Los Angeles and 45 bus bench ads. According to the AHF, they plan to expand the campaign to New York and south Florida.\nOne of the billboards is only a few blocks from Tinder’s Beverly Boulevard headquarters, according to CBS affiliate KCAL9 TV. Tinder sent a cease and desist letter to the healthcare foundation on 18 September.\n“These unprovoked and wholly unsubstantiated accusations are made to irreparably damage Tinder’s reputation in an attempt to encourage others to take an HIV test offered by your organization,” the letter read. “While Tinder strongly supports such testing, the Billboard’s statements are not founded upon any scientific evidence, and are incapable of withstanding critical analysis.”\nThe foundation responded just under a week later to deny Tinder’s request, saying it had “not made any false or disparaging statements against Tinder”. The organization cited an article in Vanity Fair titled Tinder and the Dawn of the “Dating Apocalypse that explores the role dating apps play in “encouraging casual sex among young adults” and a report released by the Rhode Island Department of Health in May that credited the rise in syphilis, gonorrhea, and HIV between 2013 and 2014 to high-risk behaviors like “using social media to arrange casual and often anonymous sexual encounters”.\nThey added: “Rather than trying to chill AHF’s public health message by threatening AHF with frivolous lawsuits, AHF urges Tinder to support its message of sexual health awareness by encouraging Tinder users to get tested for STIs and to get treated promptly if they have an infection.”\nTinder and Grindr did not respond to requests for comment.", "external_links": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating", "http://www.aidshealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Ltr-re-False-Accusations-Against-Tinder-Inc..pdf", "http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/09/27/dating-apps-like-tinder-and-grindr-come-under-fire-on-new-billboard-suggesting-they-promote-stds/", "http://www.aidshealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Letter-to-J-Reichman-9-23-2015.pdf", "http://www.ri.gov/press/view/24889"], "published": "2015-09-30T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:53:41.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
