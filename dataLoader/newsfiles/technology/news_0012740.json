Daniel Munoz \"We thought it was right to participate in an effort with a number of like-minded organisations to define the protocols around how blockchain technology could work on a global scale if it pans out that it is a technology worth using,\" said Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, the Commonwealth Bank's group executive of institutional banking and markets.\n\"These banks are looking at this very interesting blockchain protocol as an alternative means for transferring money.\n\"The most interesting part of this for CBA is to explore how these distributed ledgers might provide reduced cost and an increase in transparency, efficiency and choice for our customers.\"\nMs Bayer Rosmarin said one of the big challenges for blockchain technologies was having enough financial institutions agreeing to use them in a standardised way â€“ something the R3 project is attempting to overcome.\nRelated These banks are looking at this very interesting blockchain protocol as an alternative means for transferring money,\" said Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, CBA's group executive of institutional banking and markets. Tomohiro Ohsumi Blockchain trials The Commonwealth Bank and Westpac are working with Ripple Labs , which is developing blockchain-like technology to allow banks to send information to each other. The R3 project is complementary to the Ripple trials for the Commonwealth Bank.\nBitcoin experts said the banks could be interested in the technology to improve settlement processes by dealing directly with each other.\n\"It's likely the banks will use bitcoin or the blockchain as a settlement network because it has so many more efficiencies,\" said Atlassian software developer, Chris Mountford, who writes frequently on bitcoin.\n\"Two-party transactions are cheaper than three-person transactions. Irreversibility is cheaper than reversibility. Banks will always try to eliminate waste.\"\n'Potentially disruptive impact' Other big banks are also looking at bitcoin and blockchain technologies. \"The development of the blockchain will certainly have a very interesting and potentially disruptive impact on financial services,\" Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer said last week .\nWestpac venture capital fund Reinventure Group has invested in Coinbase, one of the leaders in bitcoin technology .\nThere are hundreds of open-source blockchain experiments under way. A widely discussed new protocol called Ethereum was released in July and is developing a new universe of programmable contracts, secured by its own proof-of-work blockchain.\nRather than decentralising just money and payments, like the bitcoin network, it can decentralise and transfer anything that can be computer programmed, such as bond contracts or shares.\n\"Ethereum is much more general purpose than bitcoin and could be useful for banks,\" said Mr Mountford. \"But that software hasn't the critical mass yet.\"\nThe Commonwealth Bank is experimenting with R3 to better understand \"latency\", which refers to the time interval between the asset leaving one party and arriving at another. Banks are thinking about how much server power will be required to run a network given they process so many transactions.\nBig challenge \"The challenge with payments is you do need a critical mass, which will require adoption across a number of organisations all around the world, and it also requires very clear protocols as to how you use it, otherwise you don't get interoperability,\" Ms Bayer Rosmarin said.\nIt remains unclear if the blockchain will ultimately replace the existing payments infrastructure and bankers say any developments are very long term. However, banks don't want to be caught out.\n\"It is very possible it will pan out to be a technology better suited to transferring other things aside from money, but it is absolutely worth us exploring it, as we would any new technology to see if it has a meaningful application,\" Ms Bayer Rosmarin said.\nThe R3 project is seeking to develop commercial applications and \"to establish consistent standards and protocols for this emerging technology across the financial industry in order to facilitate broader adoption and gain a network effect,\" R3 said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:29:32.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
