The cranes were designed in Liebherr Container Cranes , Ireland and manufactured in the state of the art facility in Ireland.\nThe completed cranes were assembled in the Liebherr Rostock plant and barged through the Baltic Sea to St. Petersburg.\nThe cranes are due to enter operation at the purpose built container terminal on the Baltic sea in the coming weeks. The terminal will be developed in stages, with this initial stage, stage 1 delivering an annual capacity of 1.45 million TEU on this important trade route between Russia and Europe.\nStages 2 and 3 of the development will see the capacity of the development reach 1.9 million and 3 million TEU respectively. \nSpeaking about the contract, Managing Director of Liebherr Container Cranes , Pat O Leary commented: “Liebherr is proud to have been selected as a partner to help deliver this important project. At Liebherr Container Cranes , we have been designing and manufacturing cranes at our facility in Ireland since 1958.\n\"This wealth of experience has given us an expertise and knowledge which is second to none. We supplied our first cranes to Russia, many years ago and since then have delivered both STS and RTGs to ports all across Russia. This particular project required that the cranes be delivered fully assembled and our maritime facility in Rostock was utilised to facilitate this.”\nCEO of Port Bronka Dmitry Mikhalchenko has written a paper on the Bronka project for the upcoming PTI Mega-Ports Edition, you can subscribe to reserve your copy here \nClick here for more information on Liebherr", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T18:34:45.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
