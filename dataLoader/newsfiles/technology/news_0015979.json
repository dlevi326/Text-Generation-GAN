Credit: NASA/NOAA GOES Project \nNOAA's GOES-West satellite saw the remnants of former Tropical Storm Linda begin to spread inland over the northern Baja Peninsula of Mexico, and they are expected to affect the southwestern U.S. over the next couple of days. \nAn image of the remnants of Tropical Storm Linda was taken from NOAA's GOES-West satellite on Sept. 11 at 10:15 a.m. EDT and showed the eastern side its associated clouds over the northern Baja peninsula. \nThe last advisory issued on Linda from the National Hurricane Center came on September 10 at 2100 UTC (5 p.m. EDT). At that time, Post-tropical cyclone Linda was located near 26.0 North and 118.6 West, about 260 nautical miles west-southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving northwest at 6 knots. Maximum sustained winds were near 40 knots at the time. The NHC noted that Linda had ceased to qualify as a tropical cyclone. \nBy September 11 at 1005 UTC (7:05 a.m. EDT), Linda's remnants were centered near \n26.5 North latitude and 119.5 West longitude. Winds of 20 to 30 knots were still occurring up to 150 nautical miles northeast of the center and out to 90 nautical miles southwest of the center. \nThe National Hurricane Center noted that moisture associated with the remnant low of Linda is spreading northward into northern Baja California and portions of the southwestern U.S., which could trigger some shower and thunderstorm activity. \nIn addition to the showers the Linda can bring inland, ocean swells are still affecting the Baja California peninsula, and continue to propagate toward the U.S. southern California coastline. These swells will result in an increased risk of rip currents and dangerous high surf through at least through September 11. \nNHC noted that the low will continue to gradually spin down during the next few days with winds diminishing to 20 knots or less and seas subsiding to less than 8 feet by Saturday morning, September 12. NASA sees Blanca blanking out over Baja June 9, 2015 \nThe remnants of former Hurricane Blanca are blanking out over the northern part of Mexico's Baja California today, June 9. NOAA's GOES-West satellite captured an infrared image of Blanca's remnants revealing a disorganized ... Satellite sees the end of Tropical Depression 11E August 18, 2015 \nTropical Depression 11E came to an end early today, Tuesday, August 18 when the National Hurricane Center noted that the storm degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. NOAA's GOES-West satellite caught an infrared image ... NASA's RapidScat sees winds increase in Tropical Storm Kevin September 3, 2015 \nNASA's RapidScat instrument observed tropical storm-force winds in the Eastern Pacific Ocean's Tropical Depression 14E or TD14E that helped forecasters see it was strengthening. NASA saw Linda's hurricane-force winds up to 30 miles from center September 9, 2015 \nHurricane Linda is rapidly weakening after reaching major hurricane status in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. When NASA's RapidScat observed Linda, data showed those hurricane-force winds extended about 30 miles from the center. RapidScat sees Tropical Storm Jimena's strong side away from Hawaii September 9, 2015 \nThe strongest winds in Tropical Storm Jimena were on its northern side when NASA's RapidScat instrument measured the storm's surface winds. The following day, NOAA's GOES-West satellite saw the strongest thunderstorms east ... Satellite sees Tropical Storm Linda weakening near Baja California September 10, 2015 \nNOAA's GOES-West satellite saw a much weaker Tropical Storm Linda near the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico on September 10. The infrared image showed Linda as a swirl of clouds with strongest thunderstorms on the eastern ...
