This will reduce traffic congestion and make driving on the Beltway safer and easier.\" \nApart from bringing the north-west section of the Beltway to full freeway standards, the project also covers flood control improvements, and an extension of the western Beltway bicycle/pedestrian trail. \nThe project contractor will also construct a new bridge to carry Centennial Parkway over the 215, and new highway interchanges at Lone Mountain and Ann roads. \nExpected to be completed in late 2018, the project will upgrade more than 45 miles of the 52-mile Beltway to full freeway standards. \nThe project is being funded through fuel revenue indexing, which takes a portion of payments made by motorists at the pump to support critical transportation projects.
