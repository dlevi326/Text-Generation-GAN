Cook didn't reveal a time frame for the change, hinting only that it's \"something we're looking at.\" \nApple declined further comment. \nBut Apple customers can expect their built-in apps to work differently with the iOS 9 update, available on September 16. \n\"[W]e're delivering a completely redesigned Notes app, support for transit in Maps, an all-new News app and new capabilities in Apple Pay,\" the company said in a press release last week .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T03:17:53.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
