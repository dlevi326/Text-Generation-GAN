All in the name of research. Source: News Limited \nThis meant their sugar-absorbing insulin stopped working, which caused glucose to build up in their bloodstream instead of getting absorbed by their cells — a factor that can lead to diabetes. \nCo-author Guenther Boden said while he expected to see some changes in the patients, he was shocked at just how fast they occurred. \n“I was more surprised at the rapidity of the onset than the magnitude,” he told Yahoo . \n“The change happened after a day or two — and became significant after three days.” \nMr Boden said as researchers now had proof overeating can be instrumental in the development of type 2 diabetes, the challenge was to move the research forward. \n“The very first thing we’re going to do is to see how reversible this is,” he said. \n“Now that we know you can cause insulin resistance very quickly if you overeat, but what if you return to your normal eating habits with a lower caloric intake — how long will it take to go away? And does it go away at all? \n“We’re going to find the answer, but my guess is it’s reversible just as fast as it comes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T21:54:08.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
