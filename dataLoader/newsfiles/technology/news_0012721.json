While in high school he once told me he wanted to study Theology and be a pastor. I didn't take him serious at the time because of the lifestyle he led ( womanizing this girl and womanizing that girl). Well, although he didn't get a chance to study Theology, but today he leads one of the biggest churches in his area. He is married to this girl we both knew from high school as well.\nI'm startled by one thing though. The guy is a prophet and I don't have issues with that, but his wife is a prophetess as well, now I have issues with that. My issue is centered around the following:\nWhy with the clergy when they get married their titles seem to pass down to their other halves? Is God anointed between the sheets or whether prophetic powers were sexually transmitted in that a prophet's wife becomes a prophetess, a pastor's wife becomes a pastor?\nSpeaking of which\nIn South Africa churches are classified under Section 21. This means that they are registered to provide services and do not intend to make profit.\nAlthough they are not legally obligated but It also means that whatever profits or funds they may receive from donors, they have a patriotic duty to provide services to various \"communities\" such as children's feeding schemes, AIDS orphans etc.\nHowever these Pentecostals have been milking the poor dry and making millions of rands/dollars out of their troubled souls. These gospelpreneurs must not be forgiven for buying the best houses in and outside the country, driving the most expensive cars, and living extravagant lifestyles but still cajoling the poorest of the poor to seed even more.\nSome of them own conglomerate companies which are registered under the section 21 church. One does not need to enlist the services of an Economist to see that these so-called prophets are merely business people taking advantage of the poor and troubled souls and raking through their misery.\nTo believe them is nothing but a mischief. To let them go without being taxed is nothing but fraud and economic mischief.\nPublic Protector, please rescue us from these snakes!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:05:09.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
