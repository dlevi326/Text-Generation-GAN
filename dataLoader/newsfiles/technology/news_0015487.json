First up, compact cameras. These days, compact cameras face stiff competition from smart phones, and if your usage is simply point-and-shoot, then you might be better off just upgrading your phone, as there are lots of good apps that can help you enhance basic camera phone photos. If you want a separate device for your photography, or a wider range of shooting options, or a more powerful camera with a better lens, then here are my top recommendations for compact cameras. Sony RX100 series (Mark IV) The Sony RX100 is one of my favourite series of pocket cameras for four years running, and if budget is not an issue, you should definitely go for a Mark IV, but even the RX100 Mark III is a great camera at a slightly cheaper price. This camera also shoots excellent video, and is a great starting camera for videos as well. Pros: Big 1-inch sensor in a super-compact body, fast lens, electronic view finder, Wi-Fi, NFC, tilting LCD screen which flips up a full 180 degrees for better selfies, 4K video and slow motion video. Cons: No touchscreen, 4K recording limited to 5 minutes, lens range not as long as Canon G7X. Canon G7X The Canon G7X has a 20-megapixel, 1-inch sensor with a 24-100mm zoom and a touchscreen which is really helpful to get quick focus. Like the Sony, it isn’t cheap, but it’s still a great all-around compact camera for stills and videos, which you can use in auto mode and experiment with in manual as well. Pros: Big 1-inch sensor in a super-compact body, fast lens, great auto focus with touchscreen, Wi-Fi. Cons: No viewfinder. Articulating LCD screen only flips up but does not tilt down like the Sony. Sony HX90V For those of you who want a camera with a really long zoom, the Sony HX90V is one of the smallest compact cameras with a 30x optical zoom. It gives you an effective focal length of 24mm at the wide end, all the way up to 720mm at the telephoto end. This camera also has useful features like an articulating LCD screen, GPS and Wi-Fi to transfer photos quickly to your smart phone to up your Instagram game. Pros: 30x stabilised optical zoom, NFC, electronic view finder. Cons: Noise at low ISO levels, sub par LCD screen with poor visibility, no RAW shooting. Recommended alternatives: Canon SX60 or Nikon Coolpix P900 (DSLR-sized bodies). Sony W830 Sony’s Cybershot W830 is one of the few cameras under Rs.10,000 that is worth buying. It’s a point-and-shoot compact with an 8x optical zoom, 20-megapixel resolution and 720p video packed into a slim and light body. Pros: In-camera charging, stabilised optical zoom, 20 megapixels at a low price. Cons: No 1080p video, no features like Wi-Fi and NFC. So there you have it.
