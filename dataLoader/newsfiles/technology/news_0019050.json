The deaths have led the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to declare an \"unusual mortality event\" for the animals.\nGuadalupe fur seals breed almost entirely on Guadalupe Island near Baja California, Mexico, more than 600 miles from where they are stranding in California.\nMale fur seals can grow up to 7 feet long and top out at around 400 pounds.\nHunting brought the species to near extinction in the late 1800s, but it had been slowly recovering.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-29T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T19:51:37.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
