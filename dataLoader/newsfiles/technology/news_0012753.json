Rob Homer by David Ramli Telstra has launched new mobile products capable of delivering download speeds of up to 600 megabits per second; six times faster than the national broadband network's fibre-to-the-node technology.\nIn Sydney on Wednesday, Telstra demonstrated the Wi-Fi 4GX Advanced III, a Netgear mobile hotspot. It has a theoretical peak download speed of 600Mbps and uses a technology known as carrier aggregation that combines multiple connections into one stream.\nHowever, the product, which will be launched on September 29 with a retail price of $264, was so fast that it would burn through Telstra's monthly mobile data allowances in a matter of minutes if used at full speed.\nSydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra and popular holiday spots will be the first locations to access the service.\nIn a live test, it was able to reach download speeds of 500Mbps and upload speeds of 40Mbps. By comparison, the NBN's fibre-to-the-node technology, which will become the internet connection for 38 per cent of Australian homes, can reach 100Mbps.\nHowever, fixed-line connections used by the NBN can transmit more data at much lower costs.\nA Telstra customer on a $55 a month plan with an eight gigabyte data allowance would burn through his or her cap in less than two minutes.\nTelstra has also launched its voice over long-term evolution (VoLTE) solution, which lets customers make high-definition phone calls over internet connections.\nRelated The telecommunications company is rolling out network upgrades that use the more efficient and effective 700MHz spectrum band, which helps signals penetrate buildings and travel long distances.\nThese factors combined mean it will soon cost Telstra less to transmit the internet and phone calls to people's phones.\nTelstra executive director for mobiles John Chambers would not commit to rapid discounts or increased data for customers.\nHowever, he said users were getting data increases at a faster pace than they needed and the company was continuously changing its plans as required.\n\"We've just come out with new data plans over the last few days,\" he said.\nTelstra networks general managing director Mike Wright also said the phone company had been continuously slashing the cost to send and receive data for 10 years as new technologies became available.\n\"We don't get the benefit [of lower costs] until the [compatible] devices penetrate the market,\" he said. \"Our job is to keep in sync so the business remains profitable and we add more value.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:26:29.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
