Rudi Bakhtiar   \nSTORY: Leave it to the French, famous for their gourmet cuisine, to create a new app to make sure not a bite is wasted. The app, called OptiMiam, connects local grocers and bakeries in Paris, to customers looking for bargains and a way to leave a smaller carbon footprint. Each day shopkeepers detail their surplus stock online - with the discounted price. Which then - as co-founder Roadath Aminou explains - flashes the information onto the cellphones of customers nearby. \"As I launch the mobile application, it finds my location using GPS and shows all the deals around me in terms of distance,\" she said. In the first nine months the application was downloaded 22 thousand times. Now, the founders are hoping to raise the necessary funds to extend their app outside of Paris. And increase their subscribers from 90 businesses to15 hundred in the next three years. Given all the delectable choices at stake, that could happen sooner than they think.  //reut.rs/1KUO111", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T09:38:31.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
