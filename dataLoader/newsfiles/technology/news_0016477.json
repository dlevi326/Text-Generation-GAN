The three month trial was undertaken at Department of Finance, Services and Innovation (DFSI) offices using Goget and Hertz 24/7 share-cars.\nHe said staff who participated in the carshare trial reported a high degree of satisfaction, enjoyed not having to fill in log books and were able to use share cars located near their homes.\n“We should be looking use these new economy services wherever it is feasible and practical,” said Mr Perrottet. “Car sharing is flexible, cost effective and convenient.”\nGoGet CEO Tristan Sender said he hoped the NSW’s lead would result in carshare being rolled out across all departments.\nThis article was first published in The Australian Business Review.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/nsw-government-to-free-up-1bn-with-car-fleet-shift/story-e6frgakx-1227502506094"], "published": "2015-08-28T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:23:09.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
