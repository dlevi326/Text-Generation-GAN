The local area, or Economic Impact Region, includes all counties within a 50-mile radius from the base center. The total value of KAFB’s annual economic impact is approximately $7.6B, of which the Department of Energy and Sandia National Laboratories is $3.6B and KAFB is $4B.

The aircraft, one of only 17 complete Superfortress aircraft remaining in the world, is in the final stage of external restoration, having received a new coat of primer and paint, bodywork, and vintage 509th Wing of the Strategic Air Command paint and trim. In addition, the museum hosted “Science is Everywhere” 2015 Summer Camps. These themed, week-long camps reached 100% of capacity, serving 519 children. Many of the Park employees enrolled their children in these educational and fun sessions. \nCenter for Collaboration and Commercialization – The Entrepreneurial Exploration & Training (EET) Program “Office Hours” was recently held at the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History.
