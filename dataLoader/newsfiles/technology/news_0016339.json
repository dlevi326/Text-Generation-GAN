Decreased CE may make certain ratings on the investments susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analysis by stressing a transaction's initial base case charge-off assumption by 1.5x and 2.5x and examining the rating implications. The 1.5x and 2.5x increase of the base case account chargeoffs represents moderate and severe stresses, respectively, and are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of the notes to unexpected deterioration of a trust's performance. \nDuring the sensitivity analysis, Fitch examines the magnitude of the multiplier compression by projecting the expected cash flows and loss coverage levels over the life of investments under higher than the initial base case chargeoff assumptions. Fitch models cash flows with the revised chargeoff estimates while holding constant all other modeling assumptions. \nUnder the 1.5x base case stress scenario, the multiple for the investments decreases from the initial level to 3.37x, corresponding to no rating impact. Under the 2.5x base case stress scenario, the multiple for the investments decreases from the initial level to 2.02x, corresponding to a one category downgrade to 'BBBsf'. \nFitch also stressed the timing of the account chargeoffs, modeling a front-, mid-, and back-loaded timing of account chargeoffs. The front-loaded timing curve is the most stressful and could result in a two category downgrade to 'BBsf', while the mid-loaded and back-loaded curves showed no rating impact. \nDUE DILIGENCE USAGE \nNo third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action. \nThe publication of a RW&Es appendix is not required for this transaction. \nAdditional information is available at www.fitchratings.com . \nApplicable Criteria", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:34:57.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
