If you place a lot of emphasis on the latter, then the Sync might be for you. \nAs can be seen, the Sync's steel frame takes the form of what its British designers call a \"double S.\" Although it's definitely eye-catching, they claim that it also offers strength and stability while still allowing some natural flexibility. \nIf its looks aren't polarizing enough, it also has no brakes or gears – its reversible rear hub allows it to be used in fixed-gear or freewheeling single-speed modes. The frameset with fork weighs 5.2 kg (11.5 lb), while the complete bike tips the scales at 9.8 kg (21.6 lb). \nSync Bicycles has already been making Syncs in small batches, since the bike was unveiled at the Excel London Bike Show in February. The company is now looking to increase production, however, and has turned to Kickstarter for funding. If all goes according to plans, backers can get a frameset for a pledge of £499 (about US$764) or a complete bike for £899 ($1,376). \nYou can see the Sync in action, in the video below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:25:30.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
