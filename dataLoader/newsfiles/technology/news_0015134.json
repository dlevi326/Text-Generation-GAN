As part of the company’s program called “Telmate Fallen Heroes,” Telmate donated an undisclosed amount to the Jason Ellis Memorial Fund.\n“The entire city of Bardstown continues to mourn the loss of Officer Ellis,” said Police Chief Rick McCubbin. “His memory will never be forgotten.” Bardstown Police K9 Officer Jason Ellis was shot and killed in the line of duty, which happened in the early morning hours of May 25, 2013. He was ambushed when he stopped on his way home from work to clear debris from the road on the Bluegrass Parkway outside the city limits in Nelson County.\nOfficer Jason Ellis’ widow, Amy Ellis, was in attendance for the presentation. Amy Ellis said “our family has been overwhelmed with the support the community has given and we are extremely grateful for the thoughtfulness and generosity of Telmate.”\nThe Telmate Fallen Heroes program is part of the company’s community outreach program called Telmate Cares. Every month, nominees are presented to a committee and one individual or organization is selected for the scholarship to support fallen officers or families of law enforcement officers in need.\n“We have the privilege of working with corrections and law enforcement agencies and personnel on a day to day basis,” said Telmate Chief Marketing Officer, Jeff Hansen, “and we are so honored to do what we can to support law enforcement agencies and their families. We recognize the sacrifice Officer Ellis made to protect his community and we are honored to make this award to support his family”\nThrough the Telmate Fallen Heroes fund, Telmate donated an undisclosed scholarship amount to the Jason Ellis Memorial Fund designed to support Ellis' surviving family.\nFor more information about Telmate’s Fallen Heroes Program visit telmate.com/fallen-heroes.\nAbout Telmate:\nTelmate is the fastest growing provider of inmate phones and video visitation, secure messaging, mobile applications, inmate tablets and investigator tools.
