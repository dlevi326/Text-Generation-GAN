Two breaches of security clearance applications exposed the personal data of more than 20 million federal employees.\nClapper did not explicitly blame China for hacking the Office of Personnel Management, but he said the breach could compromise the cover of U.S. spies abroad, though he said there had not yet been any signs of \"nefarious\" use of the data.\n\"It's a significant counter-intelligence threat,\" FBI director James Comey testified at the same hearing.\nChina has denied any involvement in hacking U.S. government and corporate databases and insists that it too has been a victim of cyber attacks.\nAfter the OPM hack, there have been increasing calls on Capitol Hill and on the Republican presidential campaign trail for President Barack Obama to take a tougher line against China on cyber issues. Obama is due to meet Xi in late September.\nClapper called for tighter U.S. cyber security measures and said improved U.S. cyber security would complicate Chinese cyber espionage \"by addressing the less sophisticated threats and raising the cost and risk if China persists.\"\nClapper said the risk of a \"catastrophic attack\" was remote now, but he added: \"we foresee an ongoing series of low-to-moderate-level cyber attacks from a variety of sources over time, which will impose cumulative costs on U.S. economic competitiveness and national security.\" (Writing by Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Bill Trott and James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:05:42.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
