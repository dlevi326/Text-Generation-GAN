Watch in Times Video » Ruthless, canny and tenacious, Mr. Jobs emerges as a formidable captain of industry in the vein of past fierce innovator-businessmen like Thomas Edison, with a Svengali’s coal-eyed stare to boot. Former associates and an ex-wife are on hand to marvel, gripe and even weep. Yet as frequent shots of peaceful Japanese gardens remind us, Mr. Jobs was also way into Zen — or at least a certain interpretation of Zen that, as Mr. Gibney underlines, yielded the focus of a monk but not the empathy. That disconnect, Mr. Gibney suggests, is echoed elsewhere in the Apple endeavor. His questioning voice-over repeatedly steps in to give a reality check to the high-flying story of best-selling products and core company values. Soon after recognizing the iPhone as a milestone, Mr. Gibney surveys Apple and Mr. Jobs’s less savory activity: backdated stock options, huge overseas tax shelters, scandalous Chinese factories and retaliatory police investigations. Photo Mr. Jobs with a Macintosh computer, introduced in 1984. Credit Magnolia Pictures Mr. Gibney’s film is a chunky mix, with a-little-too-proudly-rolled-out pop songs (even though they partly serve to echo Mr. Jobs’s self-regard). But even if this isn’t the iPhone of documentaries, it gets its point across, and unlike Mr. Gibney’s Scientology exposé “Going Clear,” this movie has a harder target (albeit with its own devoted following). He also brings out the uncanny details that help rediscover the strangeness of widespread cultural changes. When Mr. Jobs is reported to seethe at the news that he has fathered a child by his girlfriend, Mr. Gibney segues into the unveiling of Mr. Jobs’s apparently preferred offspring — a new Mac — suggesting some god-player figure out of science fiction. By the end, Mr. Gibney has also skewered Apple’s marketing of its consumer devices as a form of creative expression (“Think Different”), and has drawn out the dissonance between that individuality and the danger of self-absorption. While his conclusion verges on a public awareness announcement, he re-evaluates Mr. Jobs and elucidates a cultural technological landscape that is too often taken for granted. “Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).
