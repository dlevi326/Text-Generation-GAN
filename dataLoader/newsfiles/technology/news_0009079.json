The privately funded $3.8 billion proposal would have renovated the arena and built 8.8 million square feet of retail, hotel space housing. The Town of Hempstead rejected the proposal, citing density, traffic and environmental concerns.\nNassau Winning and other proposals for Coliseum Mangano's proposal must clear several hurdles.\nHe must persuade the state to provide him with the funds. He also needs to attract bio-tech firms willing to pay for the construction of their office space.\nMangano said he expected to succeed, calling the development \"necessary to strengthen our economy and provide jobs to graduating college students.\"\nThe 2016 state budget includes $400 million for \"transformative\" projects on Long Island and downstate. The funds were added after local lawmakers complained that Long Island had received only $150 million from a $5.4 billion windfall from national banking settlements.\nCompeting with Suffolk\nNassau is competing for the money with Suffolk County, which wants a yet-undisclosed amount for rapid bus transit and a new airport terminal on the north side of Long Island MacArthur Airport, along with railroad and sewer improvements.\nSuffolk spokesman Justin Meyers declined to comment on Nassau's funding request.\nKevin Law, president of the Long Island Association, the region's largest business group, chaired a group of local officials who will help identify projects that would qualify for the funds.\nLaw said he was \"optimistic the state will approve some of the Nassau County projects at the Hub.\" He described Mangano's proposal as \"exciting.\"\n\"Of all the recent plans and proposals for the Hub, this sounds the most realistic,\" Law said.\nLaw said he expects to submit the proposal to the Empire State Development Corp, the state's primary economic development agency, later this month. Law said he expects the agency to make a decision this fall.\nCuomo and State Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan (R-East Northport) are expected to play roles in the funding decision.\nFlanagan spokesman Scott Reif said, \"While we welcome input from local officials across Long Island on the use of these funds, ultimately our decisions will be guided by the Long Island State Senate delegation.\"\nCuomo's office referred questions to the state development agency. Spokesman Jason Conwall said, \"We will support projects that attract private investment, generate economic opportunities and deliver jobs, in a big way, for both Nassau and Suffolk counties.\"\nMangano's proposal comes as Brooklyn developer Bruce Ratner is beginning a $260 million project to renovate the Coliseum and build an adjacent retail and entertainment complex. Ratner spokeswoman Ashley Cotton called Mangano's new plan \"an ideal complement to our plans.\"\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center also is planning to build a $140 million outpatient treatment and research facility and parking garage on the southwest portion of the Coliseum property.\nAfter allocating space at the Hub for roadways, Mangano said there are 51 acres, or 1.4 million square feet, remaining for development.\nMangano said the key to opening the land to development is to replace the sprawling surface parking lots with garages.\nMangano's request to the state includes $121.9 million to build a 2,700-spot parking garage on the western portion of the Hub property. Two floors of parking would be built underground, and another would be at ground level, shielded by berms, he said.\nMangano envisions two floors of new bio-tech office space on top of the parking structure, which would also feature \"green\" infrastructure such as a landscaped rooftop and stormwater-runoff reduction system.\nMangano said he's in \"discussion\" with several companies about building at the Hub, but declined to identify them.\nA planned second phase, not included in Nassau's funding request to the state, calls for $103.9 million for a 2,300-spot parking structure. Nassau has not identified a funding source for this parking structure.\nA lure for families\nMangano's plan also calls for the state to spend an additional $34.9 million to build an outdoor plaza, located south of the arena, to attract families to the Hub area. The 4-acre park would feature playgrounds, a skate park, rock climbing wall, a water play area and fountains.\nMangano's plan also would connect the Hub to surrounding institutions via a new bus route.\nNassau plans to extend the contract of Nassau Inter-County Express, or NICE Bus, which runs the county's municipal bus service, to also operate a new rapid bus transit route.\nThe battery-powered buses would depart from the Mineola Long Island Rail Road station, with stops at Roosevelt Field mall, county offices, Merchants Concourse, Museum Row, Nassau Community College, Hofstra University and the Hub. The 8.5-mile route would end at the Hempstead LIRR station.\nThe system, with an operating budget of $4.2 million a year, would operate from 5:30 a.m. to midnight, said NICE chief executive Michael Setzer.\nNassau also is asking the state for $18.4 million to construct three pedestrian bridges from the Hub: one over Hempstead Turnpike would link to RXR Plaza and Kellenberg Memorial High School; another at Earle Ovington Boulevard would link to Hofstra; and a third across Charles Lindberg Boulevard would connect with Nassau Community College.\nHofstra University president Stuart Rabinowitz said the state should approve Mangano's entire funding request. \"A vibrant Hub that attracts businesses, residents and students, and has numerous transportation options available would be a center of economic and recreational activity and would reinvigorate central Nassau,\" Rabinowitz said.\nHempstead Town Supervisor Kate Murray said she has not been briefed on the project \"but at first glance it looks good\" and appears to comply with the town's zoning.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T03:45:26.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
