Is it property, something to be owned? Is it a currency, something to be spent? Or is it a commodity, defined by Webster's Dictionary as \"any useful thing,\" andor \"anything bought and sold; any article of commerce.\" \n\nThe US Internal Revenue Service thinks bitcoin is property; a federal judge thinks it's a currency; now the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has decre ed it a commodity. That means the regulator can now bring charges against any wrongdoers trading cryptocurrency futures and options. In a statement, CTFC's director of enforcement, Aitan Goelman, said: \"While there is a lot of excitement surrounding Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, innovation does not excuse those acting in this space from following the same rules applicable to all participants in the commodity derivatives markets.\" \n\nDoes the ruling change the fundamental nature of what Bitcoin is, and how its advocates will use and develop it? \n\n\"There are so many regulators in the US, and they all want more jurisdiction, which leads to a constant stream of bizarre rulings. None of them has much work to do because there's not a whole lot of financial innovation happening in the States. So when they find a small one-man startup they can't resist giving themselves work to do -- so they go in and whack it, especially in California,\" Mike Hearn, a software developer specializing in Bitcoin said. \"This ruling is consequential to US-based Bitcoin futures trading platforms, but it's important not to overplay the implications. These rulings concerning what Bitcoin is or is not are for certain purposes only, but they often get taken out of context,\" said Vili Lehdonvirta, research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute.
