These grades represent LLDPE, EVA and EMA based resins to meet all adhesion needs. All grades of Fuse Rx show excellent adhesion to Pebax, TPU, and HDPE resins. \nFuse Rx Tie-Layer resin is a polyolefin modified with Maleic anhydride or other adhesion promoters; it can be used as the tie layer in the production of multilayer co-extruded catheter tubing and bonds materials that would typically not adhere together during processing. Fuse Rx resins were tested and passed ISO-10993-05 Cytotoxicity testing. Fuse™ Rx can be used in disposable Class I & Class II devices. “The current tie-layer resins in the market have been subject to numerous changes over the last 5 years, along with complete discontinuation of certain grades. Coupled with the resistance of the manufacturers to offer medically approved grades, this has placed much uncertainty within the coextrusion device market.” states Nathan Doyle, Sales & Marketing Manager, Compounding Solutions. “Fuse Rx is the only for medical use tie-layer resin in the market, and will be subject to no-change agreements.” Fuse Rx is available exclusively through Compounding Solutions.
