The software will be implemented initially at Sharp Rees-Stealy Medical Group to assist in reporting to CMS under the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS). \nBased in San Diego , Sharp HealthCare is a not-for-profit integrated regional health care delivery system with four acute-care hospitals, three specialty hospitals, two affiliated medical groups, and over 17,000 employees and 2,600 affiliated doctors. Sharp Rees-Stealy Medical Group currently employs 500 primary care physicians and specialists. \nTraditional reporting processes limited to reporting on data captured in structured fields in the EHR leave providers at risk for lower performance scores, as up to 90% of quality-critical factors are found in notes made by doctors and nurses. The traditional approach to solving this problem has been to use expensive clinical resources to manually abstract charts. QPID Health software uses all available data and documentation so providers can present a more complete picture of their quality achievements, at lower costs. Using advanced clinical logic and natural language processing (NLP), QPID Health's software locates and synthesizes patient facts from anywhere in patients' health records and maintains a complete audit trail. \nMichael W. Murphy , Sharp HealthCare President and CEO commented: \"We are committed to providing the highest quality of care to our patients and are excited to partner with QPID Health. We selected QPID Health because of its unique ability to help us ensure that our quality reports are commensurate with Sharp's organizational focus on optimal care.\" \nKen Lawonn, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer for Sharp HealthCare noted that: \"Integrating QPID Health with our existing EHR will improve the speed and efficiency with which we can report on quality measures, and will optimize the investment we've made in health information technology.\" \nParag Agnihotri , Medical Director for Continuum of Care for Sharp Rees-Stealy Medical Group added: \"In an ongoing effort to continue delivering 'value-based care' to our consumers, having tools like QPID permits Sharp Rees-Stealy clinicians to demonstrate the high quality of care provided to patients.\" \n\"Our partnership with Sharp is testament to QPID's continued ability to help providers reach their quality goals by providing solutions that streamline reporting and improve performance on quality measures,\" said Mike Doyle , QPID Health President and CEO. \"Sharp understands that leveraging all of the information captured in patient records is the only way to report at the levels of efficiency and timeliness required to thrive in the industry's transition to value-based care.\" \nAbout Sharp HealthCare: Sharp HealthCare, San Diego's most comprehensive health care delivery system, is recognized for clinical excellence in cardiac, cancer, multi-organ transplantation, orthopedics, rehabilitation, behavioral health, women's health, home health and hospice services.
