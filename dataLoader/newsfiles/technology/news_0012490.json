Legal Aid Society , which provides free legal services to the most disadvantaged in the community, including survivors of domestic violence.Funded Program: Collaboration and Advocacy to provide Safety and Empowerment (CASE) Project , a partnership between LAS, the Center for Women and Families, the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law, and the Kentucky Association of Sexual Assault Programs, to provide advocacy and representation to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. In January 2015 , LAS expanded the CASE Project to provide services to college and university survivors of sexual assault, and train Title IX coordinators on college campus on how to comply with the law. UK Office for Policy Studies on Violence Against Women , which works to enhance direct services to victims, legal response and legislative reform related to violence against women through policy research and analysis, and empirically driven advocacy and practice.
