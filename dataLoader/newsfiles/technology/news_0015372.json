Considered one of Philadelphia’s hottest up-and-coming brands, Lobo Mau was started in 2008 by Nicole Haddad while she was a graduate student studying fashion design at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Haddad had worked for several local designers before starting her own business. “I knew I had a unique design sensibility and I wanted to share it with women who liked my aesthetic,” she said.

That kind of mindset starts with Gene and is apparent throughout the entire organization.”\nAbout Lobo Mau\nLobo Mau is one of Philadelphia’s hottest up-and-coming brands.
