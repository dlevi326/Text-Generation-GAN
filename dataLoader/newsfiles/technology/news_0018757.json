With significant changes to app signing and deploying to enterprise users in iOS 9, Apperian is also making resources with best practices available to help those being impacted to better understand and prepare for a smooth transition to the latest iOS release. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150218/176449LOGO \n\"Each mobile operating system update brings new capabilities that help advance how mobility can be used in the enterprise, but the updates also come with challenges that can be difficult for developers and IT departments to prepare for,\" said Mark Lorion, Chief Marketing Officer and Head of Product at Apperian. \"Our product teams understand this at the deepest level and we have a track record of helping our customers and their users manage transitions smoothly and quickly to keep getting the most out of their mobile initiatives.\" \nWith Apple's move toward requiring all enterprise apps and their associated extensions to be signed with explicit provisioning profiles, the use of 'Wildcard' profiles may interrupt certain features of an app under iOS 9. Apperian's platform allows enterprises to easily make this transition by upgrading app policies code-free, automating re-signing with an explicit provisioning profile, and then notifying users of the updated version available for download for both managed and unmanaged devices. \nResources to learn about iOS 9's impact on enterprise application distribution: -- \"App Signing and iOS 9 Impact on Enterprise Apps\" - a blog post uncovering the impact of iOS 9 and offering tips for implementing new security and management capabilities -- \"Life in the Mobile Enterprise\" - a special podcast on best practices for signing apps in Apperian's ongoing series \nAbout Apperian Apperian is the leading enterprise-class mobile application management (MAM®) and security platform for the delivery of critical apps to 100% of users across an organization. Apperian provides fine-grained security and dynamic policy controls at the individual app level for deployments where mobile device management approaches are not possible or desired, such as BYOD, contract workers and other unmanaged devices. \nApperian's easy to use interface offers a private, branded consumer-like enterprise app store that greatly increases mobile app adoption and a comprehensive app management back-end for administrators to easily protect and manage their business apps and data. The company has helped IT and line of business professionals secure and deliver more than 1.7 million enterprise apps to organizations such as Maxim Integrated Products, NVIDIA, Nationwide, New Balance, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. \nApperian is headquartered in Boston with teams throughout the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
