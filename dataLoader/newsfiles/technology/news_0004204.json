Successful bidders will be announced Oct. 3.\nBusiness See which stores are closing On Friday, the federal bankruptcy judge, Robert Drain, approved up to $3.9 million in retention pay, to be divided among fewer than 500 executive and management employees, in an effort by A&P to prevent them from resigning while the company sells its stores. The company had initially requested about $5 million.\nThe judge also ordered that A&P add nearly $1.1 million toward the payment of severance to union and nonunion employees not included in the retention bonus plan. In addition, the judge said A&P would make severance payments of 52 percent of the severance amount stipulated in union contracts for each year of work.\nLast month, A&P announced more than 5,000 employees at stores on Long Island could lose their jobs between October and Thanksgiving. It's still uncertain exactly how many workers will lose their jobs. Much will hinge on whether A&P can sell 153 stores, including 35 on Long Island.\nSeparately, Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. and Key Food Stores Co-operative Inc. are interested in buying 11 of the company's stores on Long Island. They could rehire workers now employed by A&P.\nThe latest LI business news in your inbox daily.
