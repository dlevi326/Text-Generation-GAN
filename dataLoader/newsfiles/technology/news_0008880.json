It features cyan, yellow and magenta dye crystals under a polymer coating that are activated by the camera when you hit the shutter.\nLike the Polaroids of old, the Snap will print out square photos that are 2x3-inches.\nAnd even if you don't want a proper picture, you can use the built-in microSD card slot to s tore the pictures digitally .\nUnfortunately, because of the tech involved you'll have to fork out for special packs of the ZINK paper. A pack of 50 currently costs $25 (£16.30) - although the fact they have adhesive backs mean you can use them as stickers.\nThe camera itself will be on sale later in 2015 with a US price of $99 (£64).\nPoll loading …\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T23:14:43.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
