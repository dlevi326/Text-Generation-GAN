(Reuters/Beck Diefenbach)\nApple unveiled its largest-ever iPad and a new Apple TV set-top box at a glitzy event in San Francisco's Bill Graham Civic Auditorium Wednesday.\n“Today, we have the biggest news in iPad since the iPad,” said the CEO, unveiling the iPad Pro. “This is the most capable and powerful iPad we have ever created.”\nThe iPad Pro has a 12.9-inch screen, significantly larger than the 9.7-inch screen on the iPad Air 2.\nTV shows and movies are more cinematic on the larger screen, added Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing. \"Watching movies now is incredible.\"\nThe large-screen iPad also features a new A9X chip, which is 1.8-times faster than the iPad Air 2’s A8X processor, according to Schiller. In processing terms, the iPad Pro is faster than 80 percent of the portable PCs that shipped in the last 12 months, he added.\nAimed at enterprises and creative professionals, Apple also unveiled Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessories for the iPad Pro. Highlighting the iPad Pro’s target markets, Microsoft Office and Adobe software were demoed on the new tablet, along with a medical imaging app.\n“This is the most advanced iPad we have made by a longshot,” said Schiller.\nAvailable in November, pricing for the iPad Pro starts at $799. Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard are priced at $99 and $169, respectively.\nAs expected, Apple also revamped its Apple TV set-top box with a new interface and remote.\n\"Our vision for TV is simple and perhaps a little provocative. We believe the future of television is apps,\" said Cook.\nRunning a new operating system, called tv OS, game apps are now available on the set-top box. \"The app store is just as easy to use as it is on the iPhone,\" said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services. Cue also noted that Apple Music is now available on the set-top box. \"We have also brought Apple Music to the big screen,\" he added.\nPowered by a 64-bit A8 chip, the device also comes with a new Siri-enabled remote, which connects via Bluetooth.\n\"Siri will search iTunes, Netflix, HBO and Showtime,\" said Cue. \"We will be adding more over time.\"\nAvailable in late October, pricing for the new Apple TV starts at $149 for a device with 32 GB of flash storage. A 64GB version is priced at $199.\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @ jamesjrogers", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jamesjrogers"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:23:00.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
