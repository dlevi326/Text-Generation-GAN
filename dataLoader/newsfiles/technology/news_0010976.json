Getty Images by Lulu Yilun Chen\nAlibaba Group surrendered the title of Asia's largest Internet company to Tencent Holdings, capping a 10-month slide for the e-commerce giant that wiped $US140.7 billion from its market value.\nThe shares of Alibaba fell 4.7 per cent to $US60.91 at the close in New York on Tuesday, making the online marketplace worth $US153 billion. That's below Tencent's value for the first time since billionaire Jack Ma oversaw Alibaba's record-breaking initial public offering in September 2014.\nAlibaba's reliance on consumer spending in China, where it gets 83 per cent of its revenue, leaves it vulnerable to the domestic slowdown. Tencent is adding pressure by buying Hollywood content for its video platform, investing in cloud computing and on-demand mobile services, while forging an e-commerce alliance with JD.com.\nTencent is defying a three-month downturn in Chinese stocks by gaining 15 per cent this year in Hong Kong trading. The owner of China's most-popular messaging services WeChat and QQ closed trading Tuesday with a market capitalisation of $HK1.22 trillion ($US156.9 billion).\nChina may have lent its shares a hand. Last month, the government cut rates for the fifth time since November and resumed intervening in equities, seeking to arrest a stock market rout that wiped out trillions of dollars in value. That's helped prop up stocks in neighbouring Hong Kong.\nAlibaba shares went in the opposite direction as investors' early optimism over its prospects was superseded by worries about a Chinese economy headed for its slowest pace of annual growth in 25 years. Alibaba debuted September 19 and surged 38 per cent the first day.\nThe Hangzhou, China-based company has since faced several obstacles that weighed on its share price, including slowing sales growth, criticism by the Chinese government about its business practices and lawsuits in the US.\nAlibaba fell below its $US68 IPO price for the first time on August 24. That prompted Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang to urge employees not to focus on the share price but rather the company's longer term.\nAfter blanketing urban China, the company now wants to expand into rural areas and abroad, particularly Russia and Brazil. Ma said in March he wanted more than half of of Alibaba's revenue to come from overseas.\nThe company also is trying to help Chinese buyers gain more access to brands from the U.S. and Europe.\nTencent posted record quarterly profit in August. By comparison, Alibaba trailed analysts' revenue forecasts in two of the past four quarters, and its sales grew at the slowest pace in at least three years.\nTencent is capitalising on the more than 1 billion users of WeChat and QQ. Billionaire Chairman Ma Huateng is finding new ways to make money through advertising, payment services and health care through the apps.\nAdvertising revenue almost doubled to 4.1 billion yuan last quarter, boosted by higher-cost video ads linked to hit shows like The Voice of China and NBA basketball games.\nTencent earns more than half its revenue from games, and in April invested $US126 million in San Francisco-based Glu Mobile Inc. to add a portfolio of action and role-playing games for smartphones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:21:29.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
