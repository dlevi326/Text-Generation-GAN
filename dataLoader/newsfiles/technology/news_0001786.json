Coca-Cola holds a 17% stake in Keurig. \nKeurig invested around $100m this year on the development of the machine and plans another $100m in the next fiscal as well. It expects the new appliance to drive its fortunes. \nKeurig Green Mountain CEO Brian Kelley was quoted by the New York Times as saying: \"We're literally bringing a bottling plant into the home with this machine.\" \nThe company claimed that this appliance is different from other carbonated machines, as it can produce drink without the requirement of a carbon dioxide canister. \nThe countertop pod machine works with Kold Pods, which are available for anywhere between $4.49 and $4.99. \nKold Pods, which chill beverages to almost freezing point in 19 seconds, are available in a four-pack, and consist of carbon dioxide beads. \nFor the last six years, the firm has been working on this technology and has drawn some components, as well as processes from the aerospace and defence industries. \nKeurig primarily faced three issues while developing this machine; temperature, carbonation and taste. The carbonation problem was addressed by creating pods with carbon dioxide beads. \nThe company entered into agreements with Coca-Cola and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in order to allow its home customers to find their chosen soft drink brands. \nCurrently, Keurig Kold has been rolled out in six US cities; Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York, and plans to launch the machine across the country by the 2016 holiday season. \nBy December, the firm intends to extend the technology to other non-alcoholic mixers as well.
