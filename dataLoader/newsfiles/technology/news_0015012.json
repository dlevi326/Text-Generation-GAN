By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter \nMukilteo-based engineering firm Electroimpact has won a big contract to supply Boeing with the equipment that will assemble the giant wing of the forthcoming 777X jet. \nElectroimpact vice president John Hartmann said more than 70 engineers are already designing the fixtures and the automation equipment that will comprise the wing assembly system and the effort is set to expand beyond 100 engineers. \n“It’s an anchor project for us,” said Hartmann. \nHe said Boeing won’t allow disclosure of the value of the contract. A big wing assembly system Electroimpact installed for Airbus in the early 2000s was worth about $200 million.

About 50 engineers are working on that contract. \nBoeing will fabricate those wing parts inside a vast facility — the composite wing center — under construction behind the main assembly building in Everett. \nElectroimpact robots will lay down the carbon fiber and form it into wing skins, spars and stringers, which will then be baked to hardness in 120-foot-long pressure ovens called autoclaves. \nThose finished components will then be brought to the main assembly building at the Everett plant, where mechanics will form them into finished wings using the assembly system to be designed and installed by Electroimpact. \nElectroimpact made its name by designing sophisticated wing assembly systems for Airbus in Wales. The latest of those was the assembly system for the A350 wing, which is made from carbon fiber composites like the 777X wing. \nAnd its radical revamp of Boeing’s 737 wing assembly system in Renton has allowed Boeing to step up production there , now planned to reach 52 of the single-aisle jets a month by 2018. \nHartmann said the 777X system will be similar to the A350 and 737 work, only bigger. \nThe system will consist of fixtures large enough to accommodate the 777X wing, which is more than 100 feet long. \nElectroimpact has about 750 employees worldwide, about 560 of them engineers. About 620 of the employees are in the U.S., about 440 of them engineers.
