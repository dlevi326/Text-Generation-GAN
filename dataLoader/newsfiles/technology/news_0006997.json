Peter Richards’ outstanding trade and export achievements throughout the years, alongside his ability to build strategic alliances and to surround himself with talented people in pursuit of success for all, made him the perfect candidate for this year’s award.”\nBesides Canaveral, Gulftainer’s current portfolio covers operations in the United Arab Emirates at Khorfakkan Port and Port Khalid in Sharjah, as well as activities at Umm Qasr in Iraq, Recife in Brazil, Jeddah and Jubail in Saudi Arabia and in Tripoli Port in Lebanon, which will be operational in Q4, 2015.\nFact File: Gulftainer is the largest privately-owned, independent port operator in the world.
