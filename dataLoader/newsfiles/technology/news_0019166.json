Worldwide deployment of SmartDV’s AMBA AHB, APB3, APB4, AXI3, AXI4 and AXI4-Interconnect will enable KYOCERA Document Solutions to further improve system-on-chip (SoC) quality and reduce time to market. \nSmartDV’s AMBA VIP products are compliant with the ARM® AMBA® protocols, an open standard, on-chip interconnect specification for the connection and management of functional blocks in an SoC. KYOCERA Document Solutions was previously using internally-developed AMBA models, for which support and maintenance was time consuming and resource intensive. SmartDV VIP helps them use their engineering resources more efficiently even as the VIPs provide complete coverage of AMBA protocol compliance. Additional value comes from the collaboration and support provided by SmartDV to customize their VIP to fit the KYOCERA Document Solutions simulation environment. \n“This shift to using externally-developed VIP allows us to utilize our engineering resources more effectively. We can focus on extra verification, which will further improve quality and also allow us to move resources to new projects,” said KYOCERA Document Solutions General Manager, Michihiro Okada. “SmartDV’s low-cost solution simplified our decision-making process. We were pleased that support turnaround was within 24 hours. Their response to enhancements was quick. Their test suite and coverage models, along with quick support turnaround, are helping us improve our engineering efficiency, time to market and quality of products.” \nSmartDV’s VIPs are configurable, reusable, plug-and-play verification solutions for standard interfaces based on HVL. All VIPs are supported natively in SystemVerilog, verification methodology manual (VMM), open verification methodology (OVM), universal verification methodology (UVM), SystemC, and non-standard verification environments. All components come with advanced commands, configurations and status reporting interfaces for ease of use and debugging.

It’s a pleasure to hear that the combination of our leading-edge technology and support have helped KYOCERA Document Solutions improve their verification process.” \nAbout KYOCERA Document Solutions \nKYOCERA Document Solutions Inc., headquartered in Osaka, Japan, is a leading manufacturer of document imaging solutions and document management systems, including color and monochrome multifunctional products, printers, and wide format devices.
