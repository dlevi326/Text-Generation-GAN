We’ll be calling it the new Ghostbusters, even though we used to call it things like the “all-girls Ghostbusters.” It turns out that director Paul Feig, who wrote and directed hits like Bridesmaids and The Heat , doesn’t like it when people get all butthurt (an official dictionary word now !) about the Ghostbusters being ladies. \nPart of this was revealed in the Sony email hack of late last year, but when Sony approached Paul Feig about making another Ghostbusters movie, that movie was still a tweaked version of Ghostbusters 3 . Instead, Feig wanted to do his own take on the material, professing his love for the original series and not wanting to tread onto shark-jumping territory. Feig was given the go-ahead and penned a script with writing partner Katie Dippold (also from The Heat ) that re-imagined the Ghostbusters as a team of four women in the modern era. As far as we know, the Ghostbusters of the late 80s and early 90s don’t exist in this story world. \nFeig cast Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, and Kate McKinnon as the new Ghostbusters and proceeded to design new proton packs, a new Ecto-1, and a new Ghostbusters headquarters that isn’t housed in a fire station. The movie went into production this summer in Massachusetts and New York (though will reportedly take place in New York City, not Boston) and pretty soon after all the news came down some guys on the internet got really offended that the Ghostbusters were girls. For reasons that are nebulous to anyone that recognizes a remake or a sequel doesn’t immediately erase the original version from, fans of the original cast of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson thought Paul Feig was ruining Ghostbusters. \nErnie Hudson, Winston Zedmore in the two Ghostbusters movies, might have even been one of those fans. “I heard it was going to be a total reboot, and that it would have nothing to do with the other two movies,” he said last year . “If it has nothing to do with the other two movies, and it’s all female, then why are you calling it Ghostbusters?” Although Hudson might just be hurt that he wasn’t invited to reprise his role as Winston. “Maybe it will come out and be the most amazing thing,” he added, “but in my opinion I think it would be wrong to do another movie that didn’t include the guys. And that didn’t include me!” \nWhile production went on, Feig seemed to be ignoring the haters and pushing forward with his movie. The crew did stop at one point to fire off a pro-feminism missive at the haters online with a group picture of all the women involved in the Ghostbusters production, but it wasn’t addressed directly at any specific complaint against the new film. 3 cheers to Ellen from all the remarkable women of #Ghostbusters .When we stand together we are unstoppable! #GirlPower pic.twitter.com/fEq7PpD78G \n— Melissa McCarthy (@melissamccarthy) August 25, 2015 \nFeig continued on through production, occasionally taking to his Twitter account to favorite or retweet positive fan reactions to the new Ghostbusters he was actively filming. Word came down that Bill Murray, the original cast member most opposed to returning to the franchise, had shot a cameo in the film where he wasn’t Peter Vankman. In Boston, on-set flyers cautioned local residents that Dan Aykroyd was in the area and people rightly speculated that he was going to make an appearance in the new movie. Ghostbusters did the end of their shoot in New York City and – lo and behold – Feig himself revealed he had converted a previous hater… \nThanks to the great @Ernie_Hudson for joining us on our last day of production. He is a class act and an incredibly talented and funny man. — Paul Feig (@paulfeig) September 19, 2015 \nThat meant that all three of the living original Ghostbusters will be appearing in the new Ghostbusters . How could you still call yourself a fan of one and not the other? Strangely, people did. \nThe shoot recently wrapped as 2015 transitioned into the fall and Feig has been enjoying his vacation and winding up on post-production on the film. It’s a wrap on Ghostbusters!!! pic.twitter.com/gzQFRrLUYU \n— Paul Feig (@paulfeig) September 19, 2015 \nMostly, Feig has been using his Twitter account to keep people updated on the status of Ghostbusters, but now that the shoot is over the director is taking a more pro-active approach to tweet-promotion. First, he got news that some other cameos he had filmed were about to leak. \nGang, everyone should know that any and all cameo announcements are leaks and nothing we wanted made public. Media, please take note. — Paul Feig (@paulfeig) September 23, 2015 \nApparently, he couldn’t shut the leak down and decided to add another original Ghostbusters cast member to the list of cameos in his film, the fantastic Sigourney Weaver. Gang, trying to keep surprises but this is about to leak, so I’ll tell you myself: the awesome Sigourney Weaver is going to be in our movie! \n— Paul Feig (@paulfeig) September 25, 2015 \nWeaver played Dana Barrett in the original films, and different versions of the now-dead Ghostbusters 3 had her son Oscar grow up to take his place in the Ghostbuters franchise. Like Bill Murray and the others, however, it’s expected Weaver will pop up in a new role. That’s not the best thing that’s been happening with Ghostbusters on Paul Feig’s Twitter account, however. It seems the director took to drinking a bit and saw a tweet that criticized new Ghostbuster and frequent collaborator Melissa McCarthy. Then Feig let loose. \n— Paul Feig (@paulfeig) September 23, 2015 \nWhen Twitter seemed to love the director of Ghostbusters slapping down sexism, the director continued, highlighting a particularly horrible internet troll. And since I’m on a roll, you, sir, are the biggest ass of them all. Seriously. You shit on all your former heroes. https://t.co/8BMi9YxZ5n \n— Paul Feig (@paulfeig) September 23, 2015 You’ve been ranting at me and my cast for months with misogyny and insults. So go fuck yourself. Goodnight. #enough https://t.co/r3XNfWP68c \n— Paul Feig (@paulfeig) September 23, 2015 \nThen you should embrace a new generation getting their own version. GB is a positive force. Your negativity isn’t. https://t.co/MOKZpLLIBo \n— Paul Feig (@paulfeig) September 24, 2015 \nLooks like any exciting developments in the future of next year’s Ghostbusters movie won’t be coming from Sony, but from Paul Feig’s Twitter account. \nGhostbusters hits theaters July 15th 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T06:02:33.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
