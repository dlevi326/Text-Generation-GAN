This includes providing grants for medical equipment, advocacy for rare disease research, and direct support for the children and their families. In addition to donating $1,000, DocuCopies.com is featuring the organization in their homepage's Charity Spotlight, where thousands of eyes will see it every week.\n\"Tackling rare childhood diseases is an ongoing fight in the medical community,\" says Roe Pressley, who works in DocuCopies.com's philanthropy department. \"But there are good people with big hearts spending their love and energy to make life better for the children and their families in the mean time, and we're happy to support the Little Miss Hannah Foundation in that mission.\"\nPart of DocuCopies.com's company ethos is to affect positive change in the lives and the communities they serve.
