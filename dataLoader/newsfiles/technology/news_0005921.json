This technology can compensate for the mistakes every driver makes because the systems are always on alert, monitoring the road ahead and never getting tired or distracted,” institute President Adrian Lund said.\nThe automatic emergency braking systems are designed to prevent or reduce the impact of crashes, especially where one vehicle drives into the rear of another. The technology uses on-vehicle sensors such as radar, cameras or lasers to detect an imminent crash, warn the driver and, if the driver does not take action, engage the brakes.\nWhat speeds they work at depends on the manufacturer and the systems. Some are effective at preventing crashes at the slower speeds cars drive in traffic while others can work at nearly highway speeds.\nTraffic Safety Administration research found that one-third of all police-reported crashes in 2013 involved a rear-end collision with another vehicle at the start of the crash. The agency also found that a large number of drivers involved in rear-end crashes either did not apply the brakes at all or did not apply the brakes fully prior to the crash, failures that can be corrected by the robotic braking systems.\n“Automatic emergency braking is the next big safety feature on vehicles,” said Clarence Ditlow , executive director at the Center for Auto Safety . “It’s up there with electronic stability control and front and side air bags.”\nBut Ditlow said he wanted to see the performance details of the feature and the timeline for making it standard.\n“This can’t be voluntary,” Ditlow said. “This needs a mandated safety standard with rigorous performance measures that trigger a recall if you don’t meet them.”\nConsumer groups also should have the opportunity to ask questions about what type of systems automakers will be placing in their cars.\n“We go in and we raise the hard questions,” Ditlow said. “We would ask if you are going to test the braking to make sure it stops a car going at 25 mph then why not at 50 mph, which is closer to highway speeds?”\nIn January, the safety agency proposed adding automatic emergency braking to the list of recommended advanced safety features included in its New Car Assessment Program, a guide that allows consumers to compare the safety features of cars they are considering purchasing.\nThe agency said that since 1960, additions to its new car checklist have saved more than 600,000 lives. Earlier additions include seat belts, air bags and electronic stability control. Items added to the checklist typically become standard equipment.\n“We must work to expedite the implementation of advanced technologies to save lives at every opportunity,” said Mark Rosekind , the safety agency’s administrator.\nAlready, more cars are coming equipped with automatic braking.\nThe insurance industry group said 52 percent of the 784 new-vehicle models come with technology that alerts a driver to a pending crash as either a standard or optional feature.\nAmong 2015 models, 27 percent also offer robotic braking, which automatically slows or stops the vehicle without driver intervention if a crash is imminent. That’s more than twice as many as in 2012.\nAlthough the trade group has not measured the technology’s effect on insurance premiums, it believes that fewer crashes will soon be reflected in lower rates, said Russ Rader , a spokesman for the group.\nBut Janet Ruiz , spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute , said people who drive cars with the safety feature won’t necessarily see lower rates. When companies have data showing savings, they will lower premiums, but other factors also determine rates, Ruiz said.", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-12T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T14:32:42.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
