Globalisation, Innovation and the Future of Learning”, held at University Hall at the National University of Singapore (NUS) on Aug 17. \nAccording to Prof Tan, teachers need to guide their students to adapt to the future of learning. \n“It is very important for individuals to be able to curate this information, to have a really good scaffolding to understand where it stands in this network of knowledge and how you can use it.” \nOthers experts on the panel include David Edwards, Head of Education, GEMS World Academy Singapore; Stephanie Hung, Senior Director, Public Sector Group, Microsoft Singapore; and Dr Richard Yen, Founder and Managing Director, Ednovation. The Perspectives panel, led by moderator Teymoor Nabili, put forward to industry experts if the education system is helping students and the workforce of today to be future ready. \nIGNITING PASSION \nMr Edwards said student-teacher interactions in classrooms are now different, where the teacher is no longer the “purveyor of all information”. \n“The importance of the teacher (today) is to ignite the passion, to be an example of life-long learning, to be a mentor and a guide for that learning is even more important now than ever,” said Mr Edwards. \nDr Yen, who runs a company that supplies e-curricula to preschools in Singapore, South-East Asia and China, said that the role of teachers is to kindle passion in learners. \n“Once you have that passion, with technology, all the resources are there online and they can learn anything they want,” he said. \nHowever, schools and learning institutions need to find a way around the implications of habitual reliance on technology, in particular, on the attention spans of young people and students, which many believe are becoming shorter. \nSaid Dr Yen: “If (young children) are very passionate about certain topics, they can spend hours and hours dwelling on that topic, so it’s not relevant whether your attention span is eight seconds or not.” \nCOMPUTATIONAL THINKING \nNonetheless, the future of education will undoubtedly be one that will rely on technology, and Ms Hung emphasised the need to build “computational thinking” skills in the younger generation, so there is a basic understanding of how computers work. \n“Young children now can then differentiate what computers can do and what the human being can value add in the whole process. That is where the creative thinking, engineering thinking, social thinking come into the picture,” said Ms Hung. \nAll of this to prepare students for their future career. \nSaid Dr Yen: “The biggest change for this generation of children is that in the future, in their career, they’ll be competing with intelligences that are more than just human. They’ll be competing with intelligent machines – computers.” \nBut one basic fundamental, the panel highlighted throughout the hour, was that teaching, with or without technology, should be about encouraging a journey of life-long learning. In doing so, it should focus on the importance of nurturing creativity, passion and motivation. \n“The net of education technology is about bringing the curiosity and the interest in the students about any subject that they want,” said Ms Hung. \nWatch the full episode of the panel discussion online at the Perspectives microsite . - CNA/kc", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T08:52:00.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
