The exclusive distribution deal encompasses LCTV's entire catalogue and ongoing productions covering more than 800 hours of brand new HDTV content never previously released. \nPrime is now handling the exclusive worldwide distribution of the pay-TV channels for their original content. It recently signed a deal with Mountain TV for its catalogue of lifestyle, outdoor and discovery programs, and has already been distributing hundreds of hours of sport and wellness from My Sport Channel and My Wellness Channel. \n\"Our distribution branch has developed a lot for the last three years. Our portfolio of client keeps increasing and they all have needs for more content,\" commented Prime founder and managing director David Freydt. \"Our goal is to keep widening the spectrum of content we have to offer, and to have continuously new material. We are extremely happy that LCTVI chose us for its distribution. [Its] content is great, very high production value, and it reinforces our presence in the field of lifestyle, comedies and magazines, music and art.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T10:16:10.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
