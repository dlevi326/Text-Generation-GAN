The complimentary audit is available through September 30, 2015. “There is an enormous cost associated with the continued use of outdated business software,” said Antwine Jackson, President, Enitech. “It’s costing many small businesses hundreds of dollars each year to keep using XP, and it’s going to cost others hundreds of thousands of dollars to continue to support Server 2003. By making available this timely and free audit, businesses can easily upgrade to the latest operating systems to avoid unnecessary costs, minimize downtime and increase productivity.”\nWith the recent expiration of popular Windows operating systems and even other out-of-date business software, companies run these risks by using outdated technology:\n Crashes and system downtime as businesses waste time fixing IT issues rather than focusing on their business. Increased costs as businesses spend money fixing IT issues instead of growing their business. Decreased productivity as employees work to resolve IT issues instead of focusing on business tasks. Security holes as outdated software leaves businesses open to cyberattacks. Legal and regulatory compliance risks as auditors fine companies that migrate from unsupported software.\nTo learn more about Enitech’s free Unsupported and Unsecure Software Audit and to order one today, please visit http://www.enitechsolutions.com or call 877.952.8324.\nAbout Enitech IT Support & Consulting\nEnitech is a RTP-based managed service provider (MSP) that offers IT support and business solutions to small businesses as well as healthcare and dental providers throughout the State of North Carolina, made up of Wilmington, Chapel Hill, Raleigh, Durham, Greensboro, Winston Salem, Charlotte, Asheville, and surrounding areas.
