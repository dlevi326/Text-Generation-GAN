It had raised a small seed fund from India Quotient in January 2014. RELATED BENGALURU: Mumbai can make you feel very poor, if you are not extremely well off. Pankhuri Shrivastava, then 22, like many others, could not afford a flat on rent in Mumbai on her own. She was looking for a shared accommodation and a landlord who could be trusted. Originally from Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, Shrivastava was wary of people in this unknown metropolis. And all those concerns were not without reason. She had to change five houses in two years. That experience did not go in vain though. After two years in the Maximum City, in 2013, Shrivastava founded Grabhouse, a startup which helps consumers find houses without brokers. The startup also provides on-ground assistance well after the lead generation, for a fee. However, when it was founded, the startup was more of a matching service for probable flat mates and landlords, born out of Shrivastava's experiences. Earlier this year, Grabhouse raised $2.5 million from Kalaari Capital and Sequoia Capital. It had raised a small seed fund from India Quotient in January 2014. Shrivastava had moved to Mumbai to work with Teach for India (TFI), an NGO that works towards educating underprivileged children. The organization offered a small stipend for the two-year long fellowship. Shrivastava was paid Rs 15,000, while living in Goregaon East, Mumbai, out of which Rs 7,000 went for rent. She was also wary of her future flatmates -- whether their habits and culture would clash with those of hers. \"I had seen frequent clashes erupting among my friends on issues like vegetarianism,\" says Shrivastava, a computer science engineering graduate from Rajiv Gandhi Technical University in Bhopal. \"It was difficult to survive, but when you are working for an NGO that works at the grassroots level, you don't think much about it,\" Shrivastava said. During her stint with TFI, she met Prateek Shukla, who was interning for the non-profit educational organization. He was fresh out of IIT Kanpur. Shukla also had had similar bad experiences in house hunting. Together they worked on the idea of Grabhouse for about four to five months before hitting the ground. The startup now has more than one and a half lakh visitors a day . The firm has an active rolling inventory of 3,000 homes across 11 cities.It launched operations in seven new cities last month.\"We plan to go deeper in these 11 cities before expanding to new cities,\" she says. Grabhouse has a two-pronged revenue model. The company charges between Rs 99 and Rs 500 for the lead generation. It also charges between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 for on-ground assistance. \"People who are new to cities avail our premium services,\" says Shrivastava.
