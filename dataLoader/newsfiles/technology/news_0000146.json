This is true both for companies and for nations. Being better at innovation is critical for Australia to ensure our national prosperity in the modern era.\nIn today’s high cost and highly competitive markets, good companies will always seek efficiency and productivity gains through incremental innovations — for example, process improvements and adoption of best practices. But at the same time, they must also drive up market relevance and value for money for high-cost products, by seeking out value-creating innovations using science, technology, design, art and reverse hermeneutics — productivity defined as doing smarter things in smarter ways.\nYet most innovation activities are focused on incremental improvements. Only about $1 out of every $7 spent on R&D by firms across the globe is directed at radical or ‘break-through’ innovations. Given the ever-increasing rate of technological development, this balance is not sustainable. Most chief executives say they want to shift towards backing riskier initiatives.\nThis is easier said than done. Most firms lack the necessary capabilities in-house. They need to reach outside their comfort zones, to cooperate more closely with others in the innovation ecosystem -- universities, individuals and government research organisations -- to develop a pipeline of high real option value innovation projects; improve execution of these projects to hasten both time-to-market and time-to-full-cost-recovery; and maximise the net present value of the innovation when brought to market.\nUnfortunately, Australia is currently not very good at this kind of cooperation.\nThe Australian Council of Learned Academies report published last month, Australia’s Comparative Advantage, provides a wealth of insights into the current state of innovation in Australia and what needs to be done to improve it. Australia ranked 17th of 143 countries (49 of which, including Australia, were classified as high-income) on the 2014 Global Innovation Index, but only 81st for innovation efficiency.\nThe challenge for Australia in improving the success of its innovation framework to deliver greater prosperity boils down to a few main issues.\nThe first is a mismatch in the present innovation system between the producers of new knowledge, and the potential users of this new knowledge to convert it to prosperity. We have too much knowledge being produced in the system (by universities, for example) as compared to the current capacity of Australian businesses to absorb and use it.\nThere is also a mismatch between the qualitative nature of what is being produced, compared to what has the potential to actually be used. This mismatch is exacerbated by the very low degree of connectedness in the innovation system.\nThis is probably one of the key explanations for Australia’s very low innovation efficiency ranking. There is lots of effort to produce new knowledge, but the knowledge leads to little commercial output.\nThe second big issue for Australia is low and declining economic complexity, which is a precursor to national prosperity. The kind of economic complexity needed to jump-start Australian national prosperity requires three things: a broad portfolio of products and services with export potential; a high degree of Australian uniqueness across these products and services (i.e. few or preferably no other countries can also produce them); and that the products and services are all complex in their own right, requiring many different inputs, ideally from Australian suppliers.\nA country's economic complexity is a function of its diversity of technical expertise, specialised capital equipment, and its specialised relationships, processes, systems, information and knowledge. All of this contributes to higher efficiency and effectiveness, as well as increased productivity of both labour and capital that make use of all this. It is reflected in the structure that emerges for holding and combining all these resources.\nContinuous development of this structure allows for increased absorption, diffusion and utilisation of all these resources, which in turn leads to increased specialisation, increasing the ability to absorb, distribute and deploy the result of this increased specialisation in a virtuous circle.\nAdvanced economies thrive in an environment of mutual dependence that requires cooperation between different actors. There is a strong correlation between the level and extent of cooperation in a national innovation ecosystem, and growing economic complexity and thus prosperity.\nThis model provides a basis of national competitive advantage that differs from normal price-based competition. Countries like Germany, Japan, Switzerland and Sweden have been able to prosper by leveraging unique competitive advantages built on carefully fostered national strengths. Australia can prosper from a similar approach.\nGöran Roos is an academic and innovation policy specialist, and is a speaker at the ADC Forum’s Future Summit 2015, taking place in Melbourne on September 28-29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T03:53:01.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
