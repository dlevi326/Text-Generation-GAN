UROC competitor and LifeBEAM brand ambassador Kaci Lickteig and others will rely on heart rate, calorie and cadence data from LifeBEAM's Smart Hat and Smart Visor to optimize their performance during UROC's ultra long distance events on Sept. 26 in Auburn, Calif. Elite and recreational competitors wearing LifeBEAM's comfortable, all-weather Smart Hat or Smart Visor will have real-time access to precise biometric measurements to improve results. With 17 hours of continuous battery life and wireless connectivity to compatible fitness and mobile devices, LifeBEAM wearables deliver intelligence critical to endurance athletes.  \nLickteig, widely known as the \"Pixie Ninja,\" is one of the country's top female ultramarathoners. She enters the UROC having finished second at another prestigious 100-mile race in June. Wearing the LifeBEAM Smart Hat for runs totaling more 80 miles per week and competitions, Lickteig relies on the biometric data to improve her outcomes.  \n\"For ultra distance races, listening to your body is essential,\" commented Lickteig. \"Races like the UROC push you physically and emotionally. Having access to your body's data is critical in understanding how to pace yourself, when to kick it into high gear and when you need fuel. LifeBEAM's Smart Hat gives me this information in a comfortable, non-intrusive way.\"\n\"For Kaci and other elite and recreational runners participating in the UROC, LifeBEAM will provide the most advanced biometric information to ensure they are in-tune with their physical condition and performance,\" said Omri Yoffe , founder and CEO of LifeBEAM. \"UROC's challenging terrain and distance align perfectly with LifeBEAM's sophisticated technology that can withstand harsh, rugged environments while still out-performing other smart wearables.\" \nKaci Lickteig and Omri Yoffe are available to discuss the features and benefits of LifeBEAM technology and smart wearables.
