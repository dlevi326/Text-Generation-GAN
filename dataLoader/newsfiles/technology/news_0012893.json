All times local: \n3:20 p.m. \nGovernors from five U.S. states met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and six other Chinese leaders to talk about ways to work together on clean energy technology. \nThe officials signed an agreement Tuesday to cooperate on boosting businesses that create renewable and clean energy. \nThe U.S. and Chinese officials touted their local efforts at reducing carbon emissions, including promoting solar and other renewables, low-carbon transportation standards, energy efficiencies and research into clean technologies. \nOregon Gov. Kate Brown says that by working together, the two countries can lower carbon emissions and grow their economies. \nThe governors stressed the strength of the relationships between cities and local governments. \nMichigan Gov. Rick Snyder says governors and other local officials \"can be the core for our national leaders to learn from.\" \nThe other U.S. governors at the meeting with Xi were Jay Inslee of Washington, Jerry Brown of California and Terry Branstad of Iowa. \n--- \n2:12 p.m. \nChinese President Xi Jinping will dine on cuisine from the Pacific Northwest during a banquet in his honor in Seattle. \nThe menu says Tuesday evening's meal includes \"Duo of Pan seared Double R Ranch Washington Beef & NW Steelhead.\" The wines, a Cabernet Sauvignon and a Chardonnay, come from Washington state winery Chauteau Ste. Michelle. \nGuests at the dinner will include former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Penny Pritzker, President Barack Obama's commerce secretary, as well as the governors of Washington state, Michigan, California and Iowa. \nXi was to deliver a policy speech following the meal. \n--- \n10:55 a.m. \nHundreds of protesters are banging drums, crashing cymbals and holding banners in Chinese and English in downtown Seattle as Chinese President Xi Jinping visits the city as part of a trip to the U.S. \nMany protesters who turned out Tuesday are affiliated with the religious group Falun Gong, which says it is persecuted in China. \nSabrina Chang of San Francisco said the demonstrators want to let Xi know the issue is about compassion and tolerance. \nSome protesters are carrying signs that read, \"Stop Forced Live Organ Harvesting.\" \nLast year, the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee endorsed a resolution calling on China to immediately end what it calls state-sanctioned harvesting of human organs from prisoners. \nAt the time, China said the panel was making false and irresponsible accusations. \n---- \n9:41 a.m. \nChinese President Xi Jinping has arrived in Washington state to begin his first official visit to the U.S. \nXi's plane, an Air China Boeing 747, landed Tuesday at Paine Field in Everett about 30 miles north of Seattle. \nHe was greeted by a group that included Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, former Washington governor and U.S. ambassador to China Gary Locke and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray. \nXi will spend his first day in the U.S. in a Seattle hotel, where talks between five U.S. governors and six of their Chinese counterparts will take place over issues that include improving energy efficiency in buildings, modernizing electrical grids and commercializing renewable energy. \nHe was also to deliver a policy speech Tuesday evening. \nXi on Wednesday is set to tour Boeing's large airplane production plant in Everett and travel to Microsoft's headquarters. \nHe leaves the Seattle area on Thursday for a White House state dinner on Friday. \n--- \n8:17 a.m. \nChinese President Xi Jinping is kicking off his U.S. trip with a visit to the Seattle area, and commuters are warned to expect gridlock. \nXi is scheduled to arrive in Washington state on Tuesday morning. Transportation officials are urging people to avoid driving to downtown Seattle, where dozens of government and business leaders will convene Tuesday and Wednesday. \nXi's itinerary Wednesday will take him throughout the metro area: Boeing's campus in Everett, north of Seattle, to Microsoft east of the city and to a high school in Tacoma in the southern Puget Sound. \nAuthorities say his police-escorted motorcade will mean traffic slowdowns. \nSeattle Mayor Ed Murray has said the city is honored to host President Xi but asked residents \"be patient, re-evaluate their commute plans, add in extra travel time, and monitor traffic alerts.\" Chinese President Xi Jinping, left, and his wife Peng Liyuan exit their aircraft upon arriving Tuesday, Sept. 22, 2015, at Boeing Field in Everett, Wash. Xi is spending three days in Seattle before traveling to Washington, D.C., for a White House state dinner on Friday.
