New Zealanders would not put up with a law that stopped us buying our favourite foods. We think the same applies to online content streaming and other services.\" \nCopyright law has big effects on what we can do, watch, and share online and the Copyright Act is due for a review in the next couple of years. \n\"We are asking people to think about these questions now, so that the upcoming reform of copyright law delivers what New Zealanders want,\" says Mr Carter. \nGeoblocking means excluding paying customers from outside a particular country or region. With Global Mode turned on, customers of some New Zealand ISPs could access content as if they lived in an unrestricted region. This proved a popular way for New Zealanders to access new episodes of Game of Thrones and other TV series. This innovation proved less than popular with local companies that had purchased exclusive rights to such content. Part of the copyright law discussion to come is about the degree to which such deals - which work against the openness and consumer choice people want - should be protected in law. \nMedia companies brought legal action alleging that the Global Mode service breached copyright law. The case did not go to court. Despite uncertainty about the legal position, a settlement between the parties saw the Global Mode services switched off on 1 September. \nView the video here: https://internetnz.nz/blog/passport-control-checkout", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T05:30:04.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
