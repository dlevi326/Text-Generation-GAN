This is the second issue of the report; and it reflects changes and additions that occurred recently in the LMR/PMR development; and particular in their applications for public safety communications (PSC) and for specialized commercial applications (railroads, utilities and similar). The report highlights include: 1. The updated analysis of P25 and TETRA radios phased development. The current status of technologies, markets and standards, and survey of vendors' profiles are presented. 2. The updated analysis of narrow-band LMR/PMR technologies and markets, including NXDN and MOTOTRBO (as well as dPMR, DMR and other). 3. The growing role of LTE in the PSC development is emphasized. Though, at the present time, LTE is not ready to support some major requirements of first responders' critical communications, the standards organizations indicate that in 3-5 years major standardization work will be mainly accomplished. Meanwhile, the PSC market will integrate P25/TETRA and LTE environments where traditional networks will be primarily used for voice applications. LTE is selected as the main technology for the FirstNet - the nationwide U.S. PSC network; similar developments are observed all around the globe.4. The industry is also actively working on production of systems that can support multi-standard radios (for example, TETRA/LTE). Practel will continue the analysis of LMR technologies and markets trends: dynamics of developments require periodic updates of reports.
