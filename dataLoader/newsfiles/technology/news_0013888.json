And carriers would face even more pressure to compete on price and service. By Scott Moritz Bloomberg News \nApple’s decision to finance and lease iPhones to consumers could accelerate price competition and step up margin pressure at the nation’s wireless carriers. \nApple users can now buy an iPhone 6s starting at $27 a month over two years, rivaling similar offers at each of the four nationwide carriers. Through an “iPhone Upgrade Program,” they could get the same phone — and upgrade to a new one once a year — for monthly payments starting at $32. \nIf iPhone users opt for Apple’s plans, they might be more inclined to ditch their provider more frequently, taking their phones with them. And carriers would face even more pressure to compete on price and service. \n“The plan will lower barriers to switching for wireless subscribers and boost industry churn,” Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, wrote in a note. “This should accelerate the rate of share gains for T-Mobile US Inc., at the expense of the incumbents.”   \nIn March 2013, Bellevue-based T-Mobile became the first carrier to use financing combined with lower-priced service plans. The offer took hold with consumers as T-Mobile sacrificed profit to gain market share. Larger rivals have been forced to respond and industry margins have been squeezed. \nIn response to Apple’s announcement Wednesday, T-Mobile introduced an iPhone leasing program for $20 a month over 18 months, with the option to upgrade the phone “whenever you want.” The promotion starts Saturday at midnight on iPhone pre- orders. \n“We love this,” Mike Sievert, T-Mobile’s chief operating officer, wrote in an emailed statement regarding Apple’s leasing and financing plans. “Anything that gives customers total choice is a win for them and it is a win for T-Mobile. Unlocked phones give consumers the freedom to try out any carrier. That is a fantastic thing for T-Mobile too.” \nThe newest iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are also compatible with new airwaves that T-Mobile uses in 170 U.S. markets, which gives T- Mobile an even bigger boost, Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche wrote in a note Thursday. \nAs a result, T-Mobile could see strong subscriber gains at the expense of Verizon Communications and AT&T, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics in Dedham, Mass. \n“The next step is that AT&T and Verizon will start their own leasing plans to bring down phone costs and compete against Apple,” Entner said. “Then it becomes even more of a price battle.” \nSpeaking at an investor conference Thursday, AT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said if customers want a leasing option, the company would look into it. \nVerizon spokesman Jeffrey Nelson said the company is not pursuing leasing as an option right now. “Most customers prefer direct purchases,” Nelson said. “If that changes, and customers start asking for it, we will take a look.” \nWireless carriers used to lock customers into two-year contracts by selling phones below cost. Providers like AT&T and Verizon now spread the full cost of the phone over 24 monthly payments. The popularity of the zero-rate, no-money-down offers has given the carriers a new revenue stream that can be sold to raise cash. \nFor Apple, financing and leasing could benefit the tech giant in several ways. \nFor starters, the Upgrade Program could yield a sales increase of 5 million to 7 million iPhones a year, Macquarie Securities USA analyst Kevin Smithen wrote last week. \nApple will also gain more control over the recovery and resale of used iPhones in the U.S. and internationally, while carriers will spend less on iPhone inventory, Smithen said last week. \nThe benefit of leasing is that consumers can trade in their phone for a new one after a year. With financing, consumers end up owning a relatively good phone at the end of a payment period and are less apt to buy a new one, which has put pressure on sales at phone makers. \n“Consumer loyalties probably lie more with smartphone vendors or brands than the carriers,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts John Butler and Matthew Kanterman wrote in a research note Thursday. “This could mean consumers will be more inclined to finance through Apple.” Scott Moritz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:28:53.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
