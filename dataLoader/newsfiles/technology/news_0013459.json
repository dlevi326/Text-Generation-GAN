I saw the chief editor saying they were joining top Media sites like CNN in disabling comments. It's funny that they mention those only and what about HuffingtonPost, The Verge, Mashable, New York Times who actually do allow comments?\nWell what else can we do as readers? It's like voters being told by the government that they won't be receiving grants because of ABCD. There was a record response as people continued speaking against or for the decision.\nThe biggest websites are actually communities. They accommodate different opinions. I can tell you now, as the editor in chief spoke saying \"We don't want to be known for our comments but our journalism\", no one knows news 24 for comments only. Comments can only be attracted by the type of sensationalism in those headlines that they have.\nTo me this sounds like a cut to freedom of speech on the 24.com network but what can a little me say? They could disable comments on farm killings, kids rape cases and other articles that would really spark hateful comments instead of saying comments will be disabled by default. They were already doing that and you could see users complain why some articles had comments disabled.\nNews24 like HelloPeter in SA Media\nNews24 was like our Hello Peter in media. We could lash out against Malema, Maimane and Zuma anyway we felt like but of course we know the ANC was the one being trampled mostly by the users of the site being predominantly of a certain race I won't mention lest the article goes bias. After those comments by Hlaudi that media must be regulated, we saw the change coming and we wondered if it had anything to do with censorship.\nI know for sure that News24 is backed by Naspers and so money is not really a thing to them. Your editors moderated the comments quite well but maybe got tired with the whole thing. You guys even ran a column on Fin24 with stories like best comments on such and such this week.\nWelcome to MyNews24\nCommenting is reacting and does not take a long time at all. Asking people to submit thoughts via MyNews24 will obviously slow the contributions but I guess as well that will weed out the trolls. The best you can do for us is leave all the comments turned on, on MyNews24 and we can continue voicing our thoughts on the platform and that's if you value them.\nVerdict\nMy verdict on disabling comments is that another honest platform of voicing our opinions has been shut down. Loyalists like me won't run to other websites as we have for long looked up to you. Your comments system worked so well with mobiles unlike disqus or Facebook comments which only take high end smart phones and personal computers going up.\nYou will be shocked at how some News websites will market themselves as being comment accepting. Maybe this will decentralize your hold in the news space in South Africa. Let's wait and see. I see doomsday looming from disabling comments.\nThe mighty HelloPeter won't allow people to complain so another HelloSam will come up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:18:20.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
