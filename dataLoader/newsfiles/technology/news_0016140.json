The patented print solution allows consumers to print coupons without the burdensome requirement of downloading coupon printing software, making the process more streamlined while incorporating the controls needed to maintain coupon integrity and security. \nAfter listening to consumer feedback and acknowledging the need for a new print-at-home solution, News America Marketing worked for over two years to formulate the ideal solution. The groundbreaking result is a patented solution that benefits both manufacturing and consumer constituencies by giving manufacturing clients the print security they need without requiring coupon printing software. The solution was soft-launched last month, and has seen print success improve by rates approaching 100% over the previous solution. \n\"SmartSource now offers consumers a secure printable coupon solution that frees them from the frustrating requirement of downloading print control software that severely limits consumer print success rates,\" said Henri Lellouche, SVP Global Innovation. \"We're thrilled to have resolved a problem that has plagued this industry since its inception, namely extremely high print failure rates. News America Marketing worked with two industry-leading technologies, Adobe Reader Extensions through Adobe technology provider Datalogics, and ThreatMetrix's Trust Defender to bring this technology to life. \nThe new printing solution launched concurrently with a redesign of the SmartSource .com website. The new look makes it easier for consumers to find savings on the products most important to them, and gives the popular savings site a fresh, updated feel. \nAbout News America Marketing (®) \nNews America Marketing , a subsidiary of News Corp [NASDAQ: NWS, NWSA; ASX: NWS, NWSLV] is the premier marketing partner of some of the world's most well-known brands.
