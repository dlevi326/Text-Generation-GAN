We moan, wallow in self-pity, sometimes enroll for therapy, pick up fights with God and take ages to get a grip and move on.\nWhile we continue to complain about the unfairness of it all and crib about how horrid life is, people like former national volleyball champion Arunima Sinha, who lost a leg when thieves pushed her off of a moving train, Pakistani artist Muniba Mazari, a paraplegic who lost control of her legs after a car accident, and adventurer Miles Hilton Barber, who lost his eyesight in his 20s, are not just achieving their dreams, but doing things that otherwise “normal” people find impossible.\nFor example, it has been 25 years since he lost his eyesight but that didn’t stop motivational speaker Barber from becoming the first blind pilot to undertake a 55-day, 21,000 km microlight flight from London to Sydney. His website says he relied on “Revolutionary speech-output technology on his instruments for navigation, accompanied by his sighted co-pilot.”\nHe also completed the toughest foot-race on earth — 200 kilometres across the Sahara, climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Blanc and has taken part in several marathons. On his website Miles says, “We too can live our dreams, because ‘the only limits in our lives are those we accept ourselves’.” And it is due to this immense self-belief that Arunima Sinha became the first amputee to climb Mount Everest and Muniba Mazari became not just an artist and motivational speaker but also Pakistan’s first wheelchair-bound model (she models for brands like Toni & Guy).\nSurviving a grenade blast - Malvika Iyer\nOne day, thirteen-year-old Malvika Iyer, who loved to dance, decided to dress up the back pocket of her jeans by sticking on an accessory to it. Instead of using super-glue or sewing it in, she decided to look in her backyard for a heavy object that could help her hammer in the accessory. But she found a grenade shell in the garden, at home in Bikaner. It had landed there a few months ago thanks to a blast at a nearby ammunition depot.\nThinking it was a harmless, empty shell, Malvika used it, only to have the grenade blow up on her. The explosion ripped her hands off and caused major damage to her legs. Doctors managed to save her legs, but could do nothing for her hands. How did she cope with the aftermath? “There was no point in complaining or crying. This is what I learnt at a young age. Being able to accept the situation helped.”\nFor months, Malvika was in agonising pain. “For three months my legs were cut open... there were splinters everywhere and they needed to be cleaned everyday. The pain was excruciating.” When asked what kept her going, she says, “Hope. I was clear in my head that this is not going to be me forever. I am going to come out of this situation.” After spending one-and-a-half years in the hospital, Malvika recovered and decided to get back to normal life. Such was her determination that she topped her Class 12 exams.\nAnd after school, Malvika got admission into St. Stephens College in Delhi. “Initially it was intimidating, because I was surrounded by CBSE and state toppers, but the exposure I got in St. Stephens and living in a metro helped me a lot. I got a lot of confidence.” But were there no negatives? “What used to hurt the most was how people looked down at me. That was horrific. Even now people stare, point to my hands. But now I don’t let this affect me.” A motivational speaker, Malvika is also a junior research fellow at the Madras School of Social Work.\nShe uses myo-electric arms that are designed to mimic human anatomy and motion by using electrical signals generated naturally by one’s own muscles. The devices run on batteries and cost Rs 5 lakh. “They opened a whole new world for me as I could write, use a spoon to eat, comb my hair and apply make-up,” she says, adding, “The hands gave me a new lease of life, especially in public.”\nA holiday she’ll never forget - Virali Modi", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150920/commentary-op-ed/article/against-life’s-greatest-odds", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/sc_20092015-FINAL.png", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/sc_20092015-FINAL.png", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php"], "published": "2015-09-20T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T01:18:50.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
