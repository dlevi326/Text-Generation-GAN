BABA, -4.69% expects the value of its e-commerce transactions to be lower than expected in the quarter ending in September due to slower consumer spending. It is the latest in a series of disclosures by the Chinese e-commerce giant that, combined with souring investor sentiment on Chinese stocks in general, has sent the company’s shares lower. Alibaba’s shares are now 10% below where they made its debut in a blockbuster $25-billion U.S. initial public offering a year ago.\nInvestors and analysts have been looking for signs of how China’s economic challenges have affected Alibaba’s e-commerce business. Some had hoped that online retail would be far more resilient than other sectors such as heavy industry and brick-and-mortar retail.\nAt a conference Tuesday in New York, the e-commerce giant’s head of investor relations, Jane Penner, said Alibaba is “observing some negative impact to the magnitude of the spending” by Chinese consumers on their online platforms.\nThe company believes its total transaction value, a closely watched measurement called gross merchandise value, will be “mid-single-digits lower than our initial expectations,” she said. “We do think this will have an impact on the September quarter.”\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-expects-slower-online-sales-1441766584"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:59:34.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
