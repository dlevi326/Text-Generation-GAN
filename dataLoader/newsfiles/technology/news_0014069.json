The integration of Face Recognition was the next step for BioSSL because mobile phones and laptops mostly have an integrated web camera, which makes the deployment of BioSSL Web Security cost effective.\nWellington, United Kingdom, September 23, 2015 --( PR.com )-- The face can replace or be an add-on to the web password. The uniqueness lies in the fact that BioSSL creates a one-time biometric key in the same was as they do with their fingerprint verification and sends the data encrypted to the server. No data is locally stored and the data of the server is useless for hackers.\n\"Face Recognition does not replace the fingerprint or voice or iris. Every biometric technology has its pros and cons. BioSSL’s top priority is to consult its customers to integrate different biometric solutions, separate or combined, but with the focus to remain omni-channel and protect the identity and provider fully against cybercrime, fraud or hacking,\" confirms Johann Caubergh, CEO of BioSSL ltd.\n“BioSSL ltd has partnered with Ayonix, a Top 3 World Face Recognition algorithm provider. We work with the best of breed biometric technologies, thoroughly tested to protect the identity fully against cybercrime.\n\"Ayonix is a dynamic company improving constantly the accuracy of the recognition. Their advanced 3D modelling is so powerful that we did not hesitate to add their technology on the BioSSL framework.\n\"The algorithm has been approved as the second fastest in the NIST 2014. NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology, based in the USA.\n\"On top, the coming live recognition option will eliminate fake identities and increase the security level tremendously.\n\"There is online demo available on the website, which can be accessed after registration.”\nMore about BioSSL ltd\nBioSSL secures online financial transactions, online platforms, confidential document or media access and other high risk web based environments through fingerprint and/or face identification and verification. BioSSL is the answer to criminal attempts to acquire confidential information by hackers.\nNo more need of complicated external devices.\nRegistration and authentication is done online through the standard web browser. Verification ensures that the user’s identity is unique.\nwww.biossl.com\nMore about Ayonix\nAyonix corporation is a Global Face technology provider established in Japan.\nAyonix intensively delivered face recognition products for security industry by 2012. Ayonix started to develop their proprietary world’s fastest 3D Face engine after 2012 and now Ayonix has developed the most accurate 3D engine called “Air-1 Engine.”\nAyonix provides more products which have more advanced features such as gender and age detector, smile detector, sunglass detector, mask detector.\nLatest face recognition tests (NIST 2014 vendor test) has proven that Ayonix is the second fastest company in the world and the fastest company in commercial face products.\nhttp://www.ayonix.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T14:38:51.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
