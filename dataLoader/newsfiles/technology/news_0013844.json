Information can also be added to the visual along with any notes and text labels pointing out specific points on the image. This information can then be sent on to key contacts for Quote: s, to clients for design approval and saved for reference to aid invoicing and cut down on time consuming emails and paperwork.\nQuick, simple and always at hand, the Just Build App is specifically designed for the iPhone, making quoting for jobs and communication between trades easier. This app enables standard images to be labelled, notes to be taken and arrows to be added to highlight key areas. Images can then be transferred to the Just Roof app if further functionality is required.\nStored images can also form a useful online brochure to demonstrate past and present projects, helping to secure new business.\nJustin Carter, Director of Building Apps Ltd said: “We designed the apps primarily as an on the job tool for roofers, to bring a new roof or window design to life for a client. However, as the idea evolved, we started to combat other issues faced by the trade, creating apps that could become a go-to tool to speed up Quote: s, communicate with trade contacts and clients and cut down on paperwork. Having worked in the roofing industry for nearly twenty-five years, I understand the everyday difficulties faced by roofers. It was my experience within the roofing trade and on the job knowledge that helped shape the app’s development and make it such a useful tool.”\nGreg Newton, Director of Building Apps Ltd added: “The Just Roof and Just Build Apps are designed to fully embrace modern technology, offering the pitched roofing industry a fresh approach to engaging perspective clients and homeowners. The initial feedback from our roofing trade contacts has been overwhelmingly positive and we have a number of ideas in development to continue to support the construction industry going forward.”\nThe Just Roof App for the iPad and the Just Build App for the iPhone are now available from the App Store priced at £3.99 and £1.49 respectively, with android versions of both apps to follow later in 2015.\nIt is available on the below links.\nJust Build: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-build/id994844514\nJust Roof: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-roof/id994845121\nContact Detail:\nName: Greg Newton\nCompany Name: Building Apps Ltd\nAddress: The Old School House, 4 Manor Rd, Rushton, Northants NN14 1RH\nPhone: 07881 249 241\nContact Email: greg.newton@normansonroofing.com\nVideo Link: https://youtu.be/jMP6CaKDEA4 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJeDe1fbypI\nTwitter Link: https://twitter.com/roofdesigner\nFacebook Link: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Just-Roof/379456155594977", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Just-Roof/379456155594977", "https://youtu.be/jMP6CaKDEA4", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-build/id994844514", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJeDe1fbypI", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-roof/id994845121", "https://twitter.com/roofdesigner"], "published": "2015-08-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T03:57:10.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
