The way forward should include a mix of federal tax incentives and discounts on insurance premiums to steer consumers toward available safety technologies.\" \nThe study said additional systems are expected to become available in the coming years including \"traffic jam autopilot,\" \"highway autopilot with lane-changing,\" and \"urban available.\" \nBut the report noted that \"at current adoption rates, making these partially autonomous features affordable to consumers poses a challenge.\" \nEarlier this month, major global carmakers pledged to install auto-braking technology as a standard feature for vehicles sold in the US market. \nThe technology, which is already an option on some cars, uses on-vehicle sensors to detect a possible collision and applies brakes if the driver fails to respond to warning sounds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T23:14:53.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
