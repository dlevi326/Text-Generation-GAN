Since then, the focus has been on building the vibrating continuous fluid bed processor due to the many advantages and broad range of applications it allows. \nConventional fluid bed processors rely on the airflow alone to both process the material and transport it throughout the vessel. \nThis may be satisfactory in some situations, but the applications and performance is limited. \nPlease download this free white paper to read more.
