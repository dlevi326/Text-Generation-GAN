The overall power semiconductor market, including both power discretes and power modules, is predicted to grow 5% in 2015 to reach $17 billion. In 2014, year-over-year power discrete revenue grew 5% and power module revenue grew 12%, according to the latest Power Semiconductor Discretes and Modules Report from IHS Technology. \nThe global power module market is projected to comprise 30 percent of the power semiconductor market by 2019. \n\nPower modules contain multiple discrete power semiconductor devices. Compared to discrete power semiconductors, power module packages provide higher power density and more reliability. The modules are typically found in inverters for wind converters, photovoltaic solar energy systems and other renewable energy applications. They are also found in industrial motor drives and hybrid and electric vehicles. These modular power solutions can be easily integrated into subsystems. \n\nDiscrete power semiconductors have become commoditized according to the report. Suppliers will continue to face challenges, when it comes to increasing profit in commodity segments of the power discrete market. \n\nThis report is interesting because it also looks at how the mergers and acquisitions are affecting the module vs discrete market. Infineon continued to be the largest supplier for the global power semiconductor market in 2014, with an estimated market share of 13 percent. Mitsubishi ranked second, at 7 percent. STMicrosystems moved up to the third market position, displacing Toshiba, with an estimated market share of 6 percent. \n\nWith the acquisition of International Rectifier (IR) by Infineon last year, the market landscape for power semiconductors is changing. The merged companies held almost 27 percent of the power transistor market in 2014. The transistor product category includes bipolar transistors, MOSFETs, and IGBT products, accounting for about two-thirds of the total discrete power semiconductor market. \n\nMitsubishi Electric was the largest supplier for power modules in 2014, although the company’s estimated share of the market remained at 24 percent for 2013 and 2014. Infineon maintained the second-ranked position at 20 percent. The top four power module suppliers – Mitsubishi, Infineon, Semikron and Fuji Electric – accounted for 65 percent of the global power module market in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T02:17:34.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
