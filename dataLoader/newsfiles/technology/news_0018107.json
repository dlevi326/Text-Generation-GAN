Four years later this goal has been accomplished. During that time Catapult became the only HLS tool that can automatically generate production-quality RTL from a C/C++ and SystemC description, establishing Catapult as the technology and market leader. The readiness of customers such as Google, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and ST Microelectronics to publicly discuss their production results using Catapult at events like the Design Automation Conference (DAC) shows just how impactful the technology is. \nThe successful integration of Catapult with Calypto's SLEC® technology will provide customers with the best solution for C-to-RTL verification regardless of their system-level design language of choice. \nCalypto's power optimization platform, PowerPro® is seeing strong adoption at leading edge semiconductor companies. PowerPro is a full suite of RTL power optimization tools featuring new RTL power analysis capabilities, production-proven optimization techniques for reducing dynamic and leakage power in the logic, memory, and embedded processor section of a SoC, and is the only solution that provides sequential formal equivalence checking. \n\"Calypto has been on a great path with its superior technology,\" stated Badru Agarwala, general manager of the Calypto business unit at Mentor Graphics. \"The Catapult LP flow integrates power optimization technology in HLS and provides the foundation for what the industry is seeking - a fully integrated flow from C to power-optimized RTL. Calypto has been working with leading customers to solve the challenges of FinFET-based design, and its newest power product will be a breakthrough in design-for-low power. The combination of Calypto's amazing engineering resources and Mentor's worldwide field organization and market leadership will accelerate the adoption and make sure that we accelerate the momentum.\" \nAbout Mentor Graphics Mentor Graphics Corporation (NASDAQ: MENT) is a world leader in electronic hardware and software design solutions, providing products, consulting services and award-winning support for the world's most successful electronic, semiconductor and systems companies.
