There have been many documented cases of congressional staffers sprucing up their boss's biographies on Wikipedia. The website even has an entry dedicated to the subject. \nThe study didn't determine who removed the negative facts, but it did track how long it took for the information to be deleted. \nThe study was done by two political scientists, one at the University of California and one at Yale University. It was published on the website, PLOS ONE. \nIn the summer and fall of 2014 — right before congressional elections — researchers gathered two verifiable facts about each senator that were not already on their Wikipedia pages. One fact was complimentary and the other was negative. \nResearchers then added the facts to senators' Wikipedia pages and tracked whether they were removed. \nAn example of positive information used by researchers: During the government shutdown in 2013, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp , D-N.D., donated about $8,000 of her salary to North Dakota charities. \nAn example of negative information: The Annenberg Public Policy Center (Factcheck.org) has accused Sen. Patty Murray , D-Wash., of lying to voters by insisting that if they liked their health insurance plan, they would be able to keep it. \nThe results: Negative facts were 36 percent more likely to be removed within 12 hours and 29 percent more likely to be removed within three days. \n\"We find strong evidence of an editorial bias toward positivity,\" the study said. \nThe results were consistent across party lines, for longtime senators and newer ones, for those from big states and those from small states. \nBut when researchers did the experiment on former senators who no longer held public office, they found that positive and negative facts were removed at about the same rate. \n\"Our findings suggest the editorial bias is limited to active politicians, the types of people for whom the stakes of a positive public image are the highest,\" the study said. \nOnline: \nFollow Stephen Ohlemacher on Twitter: http://twitter.com/stephenatap \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:58:55.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
