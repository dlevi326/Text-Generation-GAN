The fire, which is currently at 211,356 acres, is only 45% contained, however, the snowfall was able to prompt officials to put on hold a plan to burn 22,000 acres of grazing allotments in between the North Star Fire and the Tunk Block fire in order to stop the two fires from merging. \nEven after a week of cold, wet weather the fire is still burning.
