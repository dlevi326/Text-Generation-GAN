Wrapped in a silicone casing to withstand hard drops, it now allows two units to be linked wirelessly to create a stereo pair, creating a discrete, more enriched immersive listening experience that pumps out louder and more natural sound. It also features a built-in speakerphone, enabling users to take calls directly from the speaker. To make the Duo even more adaptable, an extra inch was added to the flexible tail attachment, allowing users to securely loop the device to virtually any object, like a paddle, bike handle bar, pole, or tree branch. Additionally, the Swimmer Duo's flexible tail is detachable and can be swapped out with an included suction cup for sticking it to flat surfaces like a window or shower wall. \nThe compact Swimmer Jr. is about the size of a racquet ball, yet delivers surprisingly loud, high quality audio for those in search of an ultra-portable speaker. The Swimmer Jr. also features a hard shell with silicone bumper around the grille for protection, and it has speakerphone capabilities. \nBoth the Swimmer Duo and Swimmer Jr. offer the same rugged features consumers love most about the original Swimmer, including certified shock and drop resistance and a waterproof IPX Level 7 rating, which allows the speakers to be submerged in 3 ft. of water for up to 30 minutes. \n\"Pushing the limits of where you can take sound is the core of what drives us,\" said Polk BOOM's founder, Ryan Minarik. \"With the development of Swimmer Duo and Swimmer Jr., our primary goals were to pack as much punch into the smallest sized speakers while extending the flexibility of placement and amplifying the soundstage via stereo linking. We believe these updates continue to provide and expand a 'Ready 4 Anything' listening experience.\" \nSwimmer Duo and Swimmer Jr. retail for $59.99 and $39.99 respectively, and both models are available now on Polk BOOM's website, AT&T stores and online at AT&T.com, Amazon.com as well as other online retailers. Both models will be available at Target and Target.com in October. Swimmer Duo colorways include Monochromatic Black, Blue, Orange and a limited edition, two-toned Green/Orange offering. Swimmer Jr. comes in Monochromatic Black, Blue and Gray with a Green bumper. \nAbout Polk BOOM Polk BOOM is a company within the Sound United family of high performance audio brands.
