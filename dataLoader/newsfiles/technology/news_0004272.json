Some three hundred years later, this quote is still an important lesson in business and finance. \nNumerous reports in the UK and the US over the past couple of years have highlighted the industry’s ever growing issue of charging for time, the need to be competitive and having to write off fees. With the increasing awareness of set fees and clients demanding more added value services, it’s not surprising that since 2008, the Profit per Equity Partner of the top ten law firms on average has dropped 29%.In the next tier down (11-25) the drop was more significant at 37% * \nSo with margins already being squeezed how does a Law Firm keep a tighter control over the hours spent on each client? One solution is to look at how much time is being spent preparing client or corporate documentation. One fee earner spending an hour or two formatting (as opposed to writing) a document or preparing a contractual agreement in the correct company style is not efficient use of time and can lead to fees being written off. \nAn article posted online by Frank Strong in December 2014 from US leading industry giants LexisNexis, put together a collective of predictions for 2015 by leading law experts, stating that law firms will have to use technology in a more proficient manner to keep profit margins in the black. The ever so well documented Legal Technology Audit by Casey Flaherty stated how much better law firms could use the technology they already have to utilise their time better and be more productive. \nIf you fall into one of the categories of firms that are not being ‘document’ time efficient maybe you need to speak to the team at Brochet.
