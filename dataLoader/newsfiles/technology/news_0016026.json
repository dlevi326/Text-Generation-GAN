REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said its 'Dash' button, which allows customers to place orders instantly, will now be effectively free. \nThe company's Prime members can now buy the button for $4.99 and get the amount discounted on their first purchase using the button, the e-commerce giant said on Wednesday. \nThe button will now be available to all Prime members - those paying $99 a year for two-day delivery and other benefits. \nThe company said it will add 11 more brands to the button, bringing the total to 29. \nThe 'Dash' button, launched earlier this year, allows Amazon's Prime members to order a product with just a push, using a WiFi connection, and can be hung or hooked anywhere in the home. \n(Reporting by Sai Sachin R in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:12:00.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
