The \" Business Analytics \" Specialization will provide \"insights into how cutting-edge businesses use data to optimize marketing, revenue, operations, hiring and management practices.\" \n\"We are pleased to offer the first 'Business Analytics' specialization through Coursera to reach learners worldwide who want to speak the language of analytics,\" said Anne Trumbore, director of Wharton Online , in a press release. \"With an understanding of data so critical to business managers today, there is a great need for the type of rigorous yet practical knowledge Wharton can provide.\" \nTo complete the specialization, students take a series of four courses taught by Wharton professors: Customer Analytics, Operations Analytics, People Analytics, and Accounting Analytics. Each course runs for four weeks. Students then apply their knowledge to real-world business challenges in a Capstone Project designed in partnership with Yahoo. Those who complete the specialization earn a Wharton Online Specialization Certificate. The total cost of enrollment for the four courses plus the capstone is $595. \nFor more information, visit the Wharton Online site .
