Now I’ve installed a Wi-Fi thermostat.\nA few years ago, I reviewed the original Nest thermostat, and at the time, I said it was great but too expensive ($249) for my taste.\nI’ve kept an eye on new models and finally found one that has features I like and that fits my wallet.\nIt’s the Emerson Sensi Wi-Fi Thermostat ($139.99, www.sensicomfort.com). Unlike with most of these reviews, I’m not just testing it out and sending it back. I bought this thermostat and liked it enough to tell you all about it.\nI live in an older house, and while the air conditioner is fairly new, the thermostat was as basic as it gets. It was digital but offered no scheduling.\nMy house’s thermostat wiring was a very basic four-wire setup with no C wire, which provides power for some new-fangled thermostats. The Sensi runs on two AA batteries, so it doesn’t need a separate power wire.\nThe batteries should last more than a year, and there’s a battery level icon on the Sensi’s display.\nEasy setup\nSetup was easy and took about 15 minutes.\nThere are minimal instructions in the box. You need to download the Sensi app from the iTunes or Google Play stores and follow the directions.\nYou’ll be asked to take the old thermostat off its base and snap a photo of the existing wiring.\nThen you are presented with a screen full of buttons corresponding with the different wire colors.\nMy old thermostat had green, white, yellow and Rh wires. I selected the wires on the screen and was led through the installation. You remove the wires from the old base, attach small label stickers to each wire and remove the old base plate.\nScrew the Sensi’s base plate to the wall, attach the wires to the corresponding posts on the plate and you’re ready to attach the thermostat. The Sensi’s snaps onto the base plate.\nThis is where the app takes over and helps you connect Sensi to your Wi-Fi network.\nThe Sensi is simple. It controls the air conditioner or heater and allows you to change the temperature setting at the wall or through the app.\nScheduling\nThe app also allows you to set up simple or complex schedules to automatically change the temperature to help you save money.\nFancier Wi-Fi thermostats like the Nest try to figure out your family’s habits and make changes to the temperature without much input from you.\nThe Sensi has no such feature — it just does a good job of letting you control the temperature.\nI have three schedules set up: one for Monday-Wednesday-Friday, one for Tuesday-Thursday and one for the weekend, when we’re home.\nI have the weekday schedules set up to raise the temperature when we leave for work and drop it back down just before we come home.\nThe weekend schedule keeps our temperature constant.\nThe Sensi and its companion app are a marvel of simplicity. I really like how the buttons on the thermostat are clearly labeled and the LED screen is large and easy to read.\nAt a glance I can see the current temperature and the target temperature and see if the schedule is on or off.\nI can also see the status of the Wi-Fi network (connected or not) and the battery level.\nThe Sensi can also use the Internet to show the outside temperature and humidity based on our ZIP code.\nThe app is easy to use. If the air conditioner is running, the app screen is blue. If the heater is on, the app background is red. If it’s gray, you’ve reached your target temperature, and the system is not running.\nChanges made to the target temperature on the app or at the wall are quickly registered on the Sensi, and you can hear the system start up in just a few seconds.\nWink-compatible\nIf you have a Wink hub for home automation, you can add the Sensi to the Wink app on your phone as well. This allows the Sensi to be a part of home automation robots.\nWink robots are sets of automated commands that allow home automation gadgets to talk to each other.\nYou can set up a robot to automatically turn off your lights and turn up the temperature on the Sensi when you leave your house, for instance.\nAdding the Sensi to a Wink hub also gives you an Apple Watch app to allow control of the temperature from your wrist.\nThe Sensi has everything I’m looking for in a Wi-Fi thermostat.\nI certainly loved the Nest, and its users have great things to say about it, but I found we were home so much that the Nest had trouble finding appropriate times to work its magic.\nI just wanted a thermostat I could control from my phone and use it to set up the heating and cooling system according to our complex schedules.\nThe Sensi does what I want at a price I like, and with elegant simplicity.\nPros\nInexpensive, easy to install and simple to use.\nCons\nNone.\nBottom line\nThis is my dream thermostat. I voted with my wallet.\nOn Twitter:\n @jimrossman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jimrossman"], "published": "2015-09-20T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:43:51.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
