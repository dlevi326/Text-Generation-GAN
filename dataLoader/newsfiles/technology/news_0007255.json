TotallyHer Media’s TotalBeauty.com , the leading website in online beauty editorial product reviews, was also nominated within the same category. \nCreated in 2004 to honor agencies and advertisers that push the potential of digital advertising, OMMA stands for Online Marketing Media and Advertising. Web Site Excellence Awards go to web publishers and/or web developers whose websites show outstanding content, visual design and user interface creating value for users. \ntheFashionSpot was similarly recognized by the OMMA Awards in 2012; since then, the site received a complete design overhaul, bolstered its content offerings, and employed a popular Guest Editor program that welcomes monthly columns from notable icons within the fashion industry. Past Guest Editors include Tim Gunn, Kelly Cutrone, Tracy Anderson, Trish McEvoy, Josie Maran, and Maria Menounos. Over recent years, theFashionSpot has also been heralded within the press for championing diversity in the fashion industry—its widely cited Diversity Reports on both Fashion Week and fashion advertising campaigns are regularly quoted within articles on race, age, and size equality on the runway. \nOriginating in July 2001, theFashionSpot made a name for itself as an invitation-only community of designers, stylists, and fashionistas that dissected designer collections, celebrating some and skewering others. Building on the largest fashion-focused community on the web, theFashionSpot.com has grown into a respected fashion editorial site alongside its strong and active community element. The site currently covers beauty, style, wellness, celeb style, life, and industry buzz. theFashionSpot is part of the TotallyHer Beauty and Style Portfolio, reaching nearly 13 million unique visitors (comScore, May 2015). \n“Since its inception, theFashionSpot has grown exponentially in its editorial model, aesthetic, and site capabilities. Throughout this expansion, our team has done an incredible job of staying true to the site’s authentic voice—this is what has allowed us to both maintain and widely expand upon our passionate community of readers,” said Rebecca Schmitt, General Manager of TotallyHer Media. “Once again, we are thrilled to receive this honor from the OMMA Awards, and are incredibly proud of our deserving editorial team for their hard work, leadership, and relentless ability to push theFashionSpot forward.” \n“It has been a true honor and privilege to be part of theFashionSpot's evolution over the past five years.
