The public needs to have confidence that there is one system of justice and it applies equally regardless of whether that crime occurs on a street corner or in a boardroom.\"\nYates was to discuss the new policy in a speech on Thursday at the New York University Law School.\nThe memo said companies would not get credit for cooperating with investigators unless they identify employees responsible for crimes and turn over evidence against them. Civil and criminal attorneys both should focus on individuals from the beginning of an investigation, it added.\nThe memo also said cases against corporations should not be resolved unless there is a clear plan to resolve related cases against individuals.\nYates said companies would not be allowed to let low-level employees take the blame in criminal cases.\n\"We’re not going to be accepting a company's cooperation when they just offer up the vice president in charge of going to jail,\" she said.\n(Writing by Bill Trott ; Editing by Peter Cooney )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:22:27.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
