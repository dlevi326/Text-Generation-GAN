The report also revised up the June increase in construction spending to 0.7 percent from 0.1 percent previously. \nGroundbreakings for houses, apartment complexes and commercial centers have helped to improve overall economic growth. The government said last week that the U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the April-June quarter, after having edged up just 0.6 percent in the first quarter. \nTotal construction spending has risen 13.7 percent over the past 12 months.
