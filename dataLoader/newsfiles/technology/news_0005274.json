Under the broad umbrella is the search for life on Mars and the detection of ancient clues to life in rocks.\nWhen did you become interested in space? I very much had an interest in the night sky at a young age. But in high school in Brisbane, in about year nine or 10, when the science teacher asked my class at my all-girls school who wanted to be a scientist, only one put her hand up and it wasn’t me. I had a total misconception about science and the stereotypes that went with it.\nSo how did it happen? Later, I heard one of the scientists on the Voyager mission, Carolyn Porco, speak compellingly about being one of the scientists on the receiving end of some of the first images coming back from Saturn. I thought, “I want to do that”. But astrophysics wasn’t my cup of tea, so I did a geology degree.\nWhat was the progression from studying rocks in the Pilbara to NASA? In the Pilbara I worked on 3.5 billion-year-old stromatolites – cone and dome structures – trying to figure out if they really were biological. This landed me in the middle of a very spirited debate about the antiquity of life on Earth. Eventually I figured out they were part of a huge microbial reef ecosystem, showing life was well-established and diverse by that time. This was published in Nature magazine and I was offered a post doctorate at the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab. Finding evidence of life on the early Earth is a similar challenge to finding signs of life on ancient Mars.\nYou’re leading one of seven NASA teams working on the Mars 2020 rover mission. What are you up to? We’re building PIXL (Planetary Instrument for X-Ray Lithochemistry), an instrument that measures the chemicals in rocks at high spatial resolution. We’re starting to cut metal for the prototype. In five years it will be on the launch pad, then it will fly to Mars.\nDoes that seem surreal? It will be an amazing feeling to see it out there on the end of the rover’s arm in the red dust and radiation, scanning the rocks, measuring chemistry at the scale of individual sand grains and telling us about past environments and the possibility that life may have once existed there.\nWhat would be the mission’s best outcome? I don’t expect it will find a single “holy grail” clue in one sample to prove life. The best outcome would be a suite of samples that’s rich with diverse geological information.\nDoes your three-year-old daughter know what you do? Sophia knows I work with rockets; she’s afraid I’m going to go to Mars. She once held a piece of a Mars meteorite in her hand and she was amazed by that.\nYou live in Los Angeles. What do you miss about Australia? Mangoes. It’s the smell of Christmas. My family has a farm in far north Queensland, at Topaz. I miss the Australian rainforest and the smell, it’s just lovely. It brings a tear to my eye whenever I have to leave.\nWhat do you most like about the American culture? Its diversity. I always thought Australia was a melting pot but the United States is even more so. There are more people and strong communities and lots of different cultures that are really celebrated. Also, as a scientist what we’re doing is something that’s appreciated in this country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T01:44:30.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
