He had won £100 ($281 in 1959) as well as a place in Nigeria's history books.\nIt was October 1959, exactly a year before Nigeria's independence.\nAkinkunmi is now a retired civil servant who resides in one of the poorer areas of Ibadan, in a green and white house that can only be reached on foot. Separated from his wife for about two decades, his only live-in companion is his 28-year-old son.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T16:06:30.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
