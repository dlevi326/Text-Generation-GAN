The environmental health officers in the Health Service Executive issued the orders. \nFSAI chief executive Dr Pamela Byrne said: \"We continue to find unacceptable levels of non-compliance with food safety legislation. \n\"Food businesses must recognise that the legal onus is on them to make sure that the food they serve is safe to eat. This requires ongoing compliance with food safety and hygiene standards.\" \" There are still some food business operators who are potentially putting their customers' health at risk by not complying with their legal obligations.\" \nThe firms that received orders under the FSAI Act include Canton House restaurant, Sweet Nosh restaurant, Tikka Balti take away and Brandon Bay Lodge/B&B. \nOn the other hand, the food business closed under EC Regulations include Jade Dragon Restaurant, Gleeson's Bakery, Nan's Takeaway, Jade Palace Restaurant, Caspian's Restaurant, and Rishab's Tandoori House Restaurant. \nFSAI issued prohibition orders to Kamaceuticals and Mad Cow Milkshakes Burgers & Kebabs. \nByrne added: \"There are still some food business operators who are potentially putting their customers' health at risk by not complying with their legal obligations for food safety and hygiene. \n\"There is absolutely no excuse for these negligent practises.\" \nDr Byrne also urged businesses to take full advantage of the information and support provided by the inspectorate and the FSAI to ensure better food safety. \nImage: In August, ten food businesses were closed Ireland for breaches of food safety legislation.
