(Reuters/Beck Diefenbach)\nPre-orders for Apple’s new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus kicked off on Sept. 12 with early signs indicating strong demand for the gadgets, which will be available later this month.\n“Initial demand looks strong based on estimated wait times as displayed on Apple's Web site and various blogs,” wrote Daniel Ives, senior analyst at FBR Capital Markets, in a note released on Monday. Ives noted that demand looks particularly strong in the U.S. and U.K., with wait times of roughly three to four weeks for the 6s Plus, and shorter wait times for the 6s, depending on the phone model and carrier.\nRelated: Apple unveils iPad Pro, new iPhones, revamps Apple TV\nThe Apple Insider website also noted that the new rose gold iPhone is proving particularly popular with consumers.\nIn a statement released on Monday, Apple cited strong demand for the new devices around the world. The tech giant said that it is on pace to beat the 10 million first weekend unit sales record set by the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus when they became available last year. The new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be available Sept. 25.\nFBR Capital Markets’ Ives also noted robust pre-orders for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in China, which, unlike last year, is now in the initial wave of the iPhone rollout. “While there are still unknowns about inventory levels, we note that China demand in particular looks ‘very strong’ out of the gates and is a positive sign that the white-hot momentum out of this region shows no signs of abating despite macro headwinds,” he wrote.\nRelated: iPhone 6s: The 9 best new features\n“It'd be shocking if iPhone sales weren't really strong, given the previous pattern,” wrote Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, in an email to FoxNews.com. “I know there's been some question about whether iPhone sales would still grow year-on-year, but I'm certainly expecting them to and Apple seems to be suggesting that first-weekend sales should exceed last year's.”\nUnveiled at a glitzy event in San Francisco on Sept. 9, the new phones feature enhanced cameras, retina display flash technology and 4K video. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus also feature a new gesture control technology called 3D Touch, which builds on the Force Touch that first appeared on the Apple Watch.\nThe phones run iOS 9, the latest version of Apple's iPhone operating system. iOS 9 enhancements include new iPad multitasking, support for public transit systems and schedules in Maps and a News app that collects stories that users want to read based on topics they are interested in.\nPricing for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus starts at $199 and $299, respectively.\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @ jamesjrogers", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jamesjrogers", "http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/09/12/consumers-favor-apples-rose-gold-iphone-6s-plus-with-early-preorders-hong-kong-sells-out", "http://9to5mac.com/2015/09/14/apple-says-its-on-pace-to-beat-10-million-preorder-record-with-iphone-6s-and-6s-plus/"], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T03:58:20.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
