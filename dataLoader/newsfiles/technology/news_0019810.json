She became the 34th senator to say she backs it, giving Obama the backing he needs to push through the deal.\n\"No deal is perfect, especially one negotiated with the Iranian regime,\" Mikulski said in a statement. \"I have concluded that this Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is the best option available to block Iran from having a nuclear bomb.\"\nShe said she would vote in favour of the deal, but added that she felt Congress must also reaffirm US commitment to the safety and security of Israel. The nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers, including the United States, has exacerbated tensions between the United States and Israel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T00:40:56.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
