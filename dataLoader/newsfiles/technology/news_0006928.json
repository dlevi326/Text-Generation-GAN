(NASDAQ: RFIL) today announced results for the three and nine-month periods ended July 31, 2015. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140904/143210 \nThird Quarter Results Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 61%, or $3.4 million, to $8.9 million compared to $5.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net income was $211,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to $372,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year. The third quarter 2015 net sales increase was the result of additional net sales of $2.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively, from the Company's newly acquired Comnet Telecom Supply and Rel-Tech Electronics subsidiaries. Both the Comnet and Rel-Tech subsidiaries were acquired in fiscal 2015. \nThird quarter gross profit increased $347,000, to $2.8 million, or 32% of net sales, compared to $2.5 million, or 45% of net sales in the same quarter last fiscal year. Margins decreased in the 2015 quarter primarily due to the additional sales from the recently acquired Comnet and Rel-Tech subsidiaries, which have historically lower gross margins. Margins were also affected by lower sales and gross margins at the RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment. \nSelling and general expenses increased $823,000, to $2.5 million from $1.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, primarily due to the additional operating expenses attributable to the acquisitions of Comnet and Rel-Tech and related amortization of intangible assets and acquisition costs. Selling and general expenses declined, as a percent of net sales, to 28%, from 29% of net sales in the third quarter last year, due to the increase in sales from the recent acquisitions. \nJohnny Walker, CEO/President said, \"Our revenue increase was the result of our recent acquisitions of Comnet Telecom and Rel-Tech Electronics, which were both profitable and met our sales expectations for the quarter. However, the continuing slowdown in the wireless infrastructure market affected sales and profitability at the RF Connector and Cable Assembly division, which decrease affected our overall sales and profitability. While we are tightly controlling expenses and working to improve the profitability of all of our divisions, our primary focus is on pursuing opportunities for sales growth at each of our business segments.\" \nNine Months Results For the first nine months of fiscal 2015, net sales increased 39%, or $6.7 million, to $23.9 million compared to $17.2 million in the same period last fiscal year. Net income was $724,000, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to $1.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the same period last fiscal year. The first nine months of fiscal 2015 include additional net sales of $9.0 million from the newly acquired Comnet and Rel-Tech subsidiaries. \nThird quarter gross profit increased $582,000, to $8.4 million, or 35% of net sales, compared to $7.8 million, or 46% of net sales in the same period last fiscal year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was lower for the 2015 period due to the Company's acquisition of the lower margin Comnet and Rel-Tech businesses in the current fiscal year. Margins were also affected by lower sales and gross margins at the RF Connector and Cables Assembly segment. \nSelling and general expenses in for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 increased $1.4 million to $6.8 million from $5.4 million in the same period last fiscal year, reflecting increased operating expenses attributable to the acquisitions of the Comnet and Rel-Tech businesses and related amortization of intangible assets and acquisition costs. Selling and general expenses declined to 29% of net sales, compared to 31% of net sales, in the same period of fiscal 2014. \nBalance Sheet Data At July 31, 2015, the Company reported working capital of $15.7 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $7.9 million, a current ratio of approximately 4.2?to?1, no long?term debt, and stockholders' equity of $26.2 million.
