Overstock gets that, and the company has committed to telling stories that speak to its audience and pertain to its desires, lifestyles, and major life-events. We’re thrilled to be able to share the company’s experience at Content Marketing World 2015.”\nThe Skyword team will be available at Booth 45 to discuss how attendees can build brand storytelling into the way they communicate and how its content marketing platform, cited for its “rich functionality” in The Forrester Wave: Content Marketing Platforms, Q2 2015 report, can make the process sustainable.\nAbout Skyword:\nSkyword moves marketing leaders and those who create content for them forward.
