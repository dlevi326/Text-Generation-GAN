These indexes indicate that worries are at their greatest level since 2000. Shiller expressed concerns around a valuation confidence index in an interview with MarketWatch in the spring , when he noted confidence had been dropping for the past year.\nRecent increases in the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, -4.80% and market volatility also indicate that people are thinking “worried thoughts... and it suggests to me that many people are re-evaluating their exposure to the stock market. And we could see aftershocks of the correction,” though he said that may not happen right away.\nHowever, Shiller downplayed any potential market fallout if the Federal Reserve goes ahead with an interest-rate increase at its meeting this week. Markets are divided over whether the central bank go ahead with a hike.\n“It has been talked about for so long, everyone knows that it’s coming. It’s just not that much of a big deal,” he said.\nRead: Fed clarity won’t help to ease stock market volatility\nHe also discussed his much-debated valuation measure, the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio or CAPE. It’s the ratio of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.45% to trailing 10-year average earnings. Shiller and others say the CAPE ratio shows stocks are overvalued, but that’s been the case for years while stock prices have been going up.\nAmong the criticisms, some say CAPE isn’t reliable as it was distorted by a drop in earnings after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in 2008. Shiller said that fall in earnings came from a deep recession, and that normally companies take write-offs early during a recession, giving earnings time to recover. “If I average over 10 years I don’t see that as a problem,” he told the FT.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/85d0becc-58c5-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.html#axzz3lh7jdW8S"], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:05:38.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
