Such an event would have roiled Twitter, but that evening the term `Maoists' was the last among the top 10 national trends of the day . Deemed trendier were #HereComesBajrangiBhaijaan and #WhatMothersWant, one a tag to promote an upcoming film, the other, a contest hosted by the manufacturers of a dishwashing liquid. Obviously, Twitter's trend list, once considered the barometer of online public mood, had capitulated to savvy marketers. \n\nTwitter's trends algorithm measures a particular term as a function of time, the user's location and the people he or she follows and any term that sees a sudden burst over, say , an hour, may make it to the trends list.The game has been successfully conquered as is evident in trend toppers such as gadget launches and sales on e-commerce sites. \n\nThe Twitterati have been quick to notice this. \"No more free fun trends on Twitter. Every trend is a paid for affair. So different from 2012-13. Old timers feeling like fish out of wa ter,\" tweeted @RoflIndian, a Twitter user with over one lakh followers. \"True testament to the power of #Twitter -The trends column shows more marketing initiatives than actual topics of discussion. #marketing,\" remarked @Vishant_Reuben, another user. \n\n\"If I were Twitter, I'd be worried because this essentially makes the trends list a blind spot. It stops being meaningful,\" said columnist and Futurebrands India CEO Santosh Desai, himself a marketing professional. He added that it is difficult to get a sense of \"online zeitgeist\" with such trends dominating the list. \n\nWhen asked about the meaningfulness of the trends list in such a scenario, Twitter India's business head Taranjeet Singh said, \"Brands utilise the plat form for targeted advertising and brand engagements, whereas customers use it for day-today expressions and discussions and sometimes to seek brand support. Popular conversations in both the categories result in trends.\" \n\nBut experts like Nishant Shah, research director at the Bangalore-based Center for Internet and Society , feel all is not lost because Twitter can, after all, be customised by the user.\"The people we follow, the circles we create, the choices we make about what to share are important. Depending more on the friend of a friend network rather than just taking paid news items, and relying on a human network rather than trending networks might be a way out of it,\" advised Shah.The question now is: Will that ever become a trend?
