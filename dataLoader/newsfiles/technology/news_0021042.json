Then Think Beyond Average \n'Average is where the best of the worst meets the worst of the best.' \nBy Jim Boomer The Accounting Firm Operations and Technology Survey Boomer \nThe Accounting Firm Operations and Technology Survey provides some great insights on where firms stack up in both practice management and technology. I encourage you to view this as the starting point, though. Strive to be better in all areas regardless of whether you are below, at or above average. After all, average is where the best of the worst meets the worst of the best. \nBreak Away From the Herd \nWhether it is technology, processes or new service lines, we, as a profession, have the tendency to follow the herd. Large firms look at peers and do what they do. Small firms tend to look at other small firms.I challenge you to look beyond the firms of similar size for additional ideas on how to support your firm’s continued improvement and growth. We’ve found that small firms can learn a great deal from those that are larger and vice versa. \nKey Insights \nAlthough there is a wealth of information included in this year’s survey results, here are the insights that stand out to me. Firm leadership is still spending too much time working in the business rather than working on the business. Improved workflow is both a goal and challenge for many firms, yet not enough are adopting the workflow tools and process improvement methodologies to address this challenge. Although a majority of respondents spend 25 percent or less of their time away from the office, firms need to prepare for this growing trend. Technology is facilitating and fueling expectations among current and future employees. Managing this will require a greater investment in collaboration tools like video conferencing, instant messaging and presence. Too many firms are still lacking basic management systems like document management, business intelligence, and workflow automation tools. With 85 percent of firms lacking a per-person technology budget, too many firms are still taking a reactive approach to technology spend. This often leads to investing in maintenance rather than innovation (the things that move you forward). \nThink 10X \nAsk yourself what you would need to do to if your firm was 10 times the size it is today. This question often creates excitement, change, innovation and exploration rather than striving for average or doing exactly what similarly sized firms are doing. By thinking differently, you can transform IT from a cost of doing business to a competitive strategic advantage in your firm.
