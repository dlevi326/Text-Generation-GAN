CameraLends is the world’s largest peer-to-peer lending community for camera and video equipment that includes a variety of products from Canon, RED, GoPros and drones to audio and lights. The partnership began in August and includes IdentiFraud Consumer and Dynamic Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) products, which are extremely important in keeping users’ information safe and secure in the peer-to-peer industry. When an individual signs up to be a CameraLends member, he or she will go through EVS’ IdentiFraud Consumer and KBA questions to verify that the user is actually a person instead of spam, and that he or she is who they claim to be. EVS’ KBA engine utilizes multiple data sources from public, private and credit databases to generate multiple-choice questions for the customer that only the member would know.\nThere are risks with loaning out any personal item, especially with camera and video equipment that can be extremely expensive. It is essential for companies like CameraLends to protect their customers from fraudulent transactions and potential theft. Implementing IdentiFraud Consumer and KBA questions ensures that the CameraLends community is 100% verified and approved before any payments are made.\n“Although CameraLends has only been a partner for a short time, we are very excited to have them as a client and see EVS implemented in the peer-to-peer industry,” Eric Knapp, EVP of Client Development, said. “We sincerely look forward to providing CameraLends with identity verification and KBA products for years to come.”\nWhether it is a company that shares cars, vacation rentals or camera and video equipment, it is crucial that peer-to-peer focused companies assure that they safeguard their customers and their data.\nAbout Electronic Verification Systems (EVS)\nElectronic Verification Systems (EVS) is a leading provider of identity verification and age verification solutions designed to help businesses combat identity theft, control costs, satisfy governmental regulation and support audit and control requirements.
