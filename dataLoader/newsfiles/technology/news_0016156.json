Running on the Zynq ® All Programmable SoC, the PFP Cybersecurity eMonitor was designed on a System on Module (SOM) platform created by iVeia, a Xilinx Alliance Member. The PFP Cybersecurity eMonitor provides a smart, differentiated solution that addresses the real world concerns of cybersecurity in IoT applications. Smart Medical Imaging Development Platform – Presented by Topic, a Xilinx Premier Alliance Member This demonstration will illustrate the use of the Zynq All Programmable SoC to create real-time, high contrast filtering of a high resolution MRI scan to provide improved diagnostics. This visual augmentation is implemented on Topic's medical development platform and their Dynamic Process loader development environment (DDE) for dynamic runtime hardware and software configuration. High Availability Intelligent Gigabit Ethernet Gateway – Presented by SoC-e, a Xilinx Certified Alliance Member This demonstration will showcase the SoC-e design implementation of an intelligent gateway system doing sensor acquisition and data processing while also serving as a connectivity hub supporting multiple industrial connectivity standards. The gateway provides a high reliability system utilizing both the Industrial Ethernet HSR/PRP ring topology and the IEEE1588 standards to interconnect and synchronize system nodes allowing \"Plug and Work\" operations without system disruption. Smart Grid Power Monitoring – Presented by National Instruments, a Xilinx Alliance Member This demonstration will display how the NI Compact RIO cRIO-9068 with NI Linux Real-Time can be used to create a power monitoring system to measure, display, and analyze typical power quality measurements in a smart grid infrastructure. High Performance Electric Drive System – Presented by QDESYS, a Xilinx Alliance Member This demonstration will exhibit how the Zynq All Programmable SoC is used to provide improved efficiency over existing drive control systems by utilizing the programmable logic to implement an extremely fast and low noise pulse modulation control loop, with improved EMI and harmonics.
