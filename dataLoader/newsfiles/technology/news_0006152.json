Measures would include ensuring more diligence on matters relating to sensitive issues like national security and privacy, which attract immediate public reactions, especially given the deepening influence of social media. Also, all sensitive matters would need to be vetted at higher levels before being released in public domain, sources said.\n\nDeitY was forced to withdraw the controversial 'draft encryption policy' just over 12 hours after making it public late on Monday after it came under severe criticism, especially on social media, for its move to make individuals legally bound to retain personal chats/messages and provide to law authorities, if asked.\n\nInsiders said timing of the policy release -- just before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US where he would meet Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg among others -- had left the ministry red faced and forced the document's withdrawal. \"The problem that happened (withdrawal of the draft policy) was not because of any intent on part of an officer but due to miscommunication or lack of communication and we will try and clearly establish certain procedures,\" a senior government official told ET. \"We are now trying to encourage much more communication and consultation to avoid fiascos.\"\n\nBesides the encryption policy episode other policy flip-flops that hurt the ministry in recent times include a ban on 800 porn websites and its subsequent roll back, again after a social media backlash.\n\nThe new advisory may also seek to increase the role of public participation in policy formation by inviting comments on matters that affect consumers of technology. \"We would like to incorporate views and aspirations of people at large through public consultations such as the one on 'encryption' to make the final policies more relevant and user friendly,\" the official said. Officials said the language and methodology of consulting the public will be made much more 'reader friendly' and 'engaging'.\n\nAll officials ET spoke to said the speed of technology usage and adoption required the government to restructure and refashion its processes and systems in much lesser time. \"In this particular case, the word 'users' (in the draft encryption policy) was misinterpreted. We will need to be much clearer and sharper in our communication. It is an evolving process and we will soon be there,\" said the official quoted earlier.
