Indeed, they could be the skeletons that change our understanding of early humans. \nWhile they have some human features, they also have some features that anthropologists have described as 'primitive' and 'bizarre'. \nWith more, Geraldine Doogue is joined by RN Breakfast 's science correspondent, Chris Smith.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T07:22:37.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
