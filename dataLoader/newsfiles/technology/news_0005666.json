The proposed spinoff is now in \"uncharted territory,\" Evercore analyst Ken Sena wrote in a Tuesday research note.\nYahoo is still proceeding with its plans to place the Alibaba stake and a small-business service into separate company called Aabaco Holdings, while its board members \"carefully consider\" other options, according to the regulatory filing.\nInvestors interpreted the IRS development as a setback, causing Yahoo's stock to fall $1.22 to $29.68 in Tuesday's extended falling. The shares have already dropped nearly 40 percent so far this year amid mounting frustration with Mayer's inability to revive Yahoo's revenue growth more than three years into her tenure.\nYahoo's stock still has nearly doubled since Mayer became CEO, largely because Alibaba has been thriving, although it has been hurt by a slowdown in China's economy. Yahoo's stake is currently worth about $23 billion, down from $40 billion at the start of the year.\nThe Alibaba holdings will be worth even less if Yahoo has to pay taxes on its gains. If the Alibaba stake is taxed, it will be worth about $22 per share to Yahoo stockholders instead of $31 per share in a tax-free spinoff, Sena estimated.\nYahoo \"is likely to face a higher bar to satisfy tax authorities, and this news will at least lengthen the process for the proposed spin,\" Sena wrote.\nMayer has been hoping to complete the spinoff by the end of this year. Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, declined further comment beyond its filing.\nThe spinoff may now hinge on the opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, the law firm assessing the tax implications of the deal. The firm told Yahoo that the IRS's ruling didn't reflect any change to U.S. laws, nor would it prevent its attorneys from making their own determination about whether the deal can be done tax free.\n___\nAP Technology Writer Brandon Bailey contributed to this story.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:18:32.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
