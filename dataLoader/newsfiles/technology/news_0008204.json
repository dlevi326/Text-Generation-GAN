Contractors and manufacturers from across the state, along with the Waco-based Texas Masonry Council, have donated money and in-kind contributions that total more than $225,000 to kick-start the schools. \nUT Arlington has leased space and is operating in Grand Prairie's Great Southwest Industrial District and the northern area of Houston. \nBryan Sims, executive director at UTA's Division for Enterprise Development, said the effort is a new training initiative for teaching construction trades at the Division for Enterprise Development. \n\"There were so many contractors and project managers coming to us and saying they couldn't find qualified masons,\" Sims said. \"This fits in nicely with what we do at DED and that is to prepare workers for the workforce.\" \nDennis Knautz, Acme Brick's president and chief executive officer, said the Fort Worth-based company produces the finest building products in the marketplace. \n\"However, if no one is available to install our brick, block and stone, builders and masonry contractors will understandably look to alternative materials,\" Knautz said. \"In recent years, this has become an acute issue as we have witnessed many long-tenured masons retiring or leaving the trade altogether for the oil patch or other industries.\" \nKnautz said that as the industry leader, Acme believed it needed to help initiate a program that could provide the training necessary to move interested job-seekers into a career in masonry. \n\"The staff at UT Arlington has been extraordinarily receptive, helpful and creative in putting together this program that should help ease our industry's shortage of masons by developing candidates who will be qualified for these good-paying jobs,\" Knautz said. \"We are excited about partnering with UTA, and we hope others in our industry will follow our lead and help support this effort.\" \nLindsey Stringer, Texas Masonry Council association manager, said the level one training certification program that UTA's DED is starting is an eight-week accelerated discipline. \n\"It's been created to train individuals faster, allowing them to enter the workforce sooner,\" Stringer said. \"The construction climate in Texas is to continuing grow at a steady pace resulting in an overwhelming demand for masons.\" \nStudents graduating from the eight-week program will have an great understanding of brick and concrete masonry unit construction, earn a 10-hour OSHA certification card and have the potential to earn a substantial starting salary. \nMany masonry contractors in Texas offer employees 401k matching benefits, health insurance, and are looking forward to employing these new young men and women entering the masonry field. \nClasses will be taught in English and Spanish in both the Grand Prairie and Houston locations. The program's strategic plan calls for expansion in to the Austin, Central Texas and San Antonio markets. ### \nAbout the UT Arlington Division for Enterprise Development \nThe Division for Enterprise Development at The University of Texas at Arlington supports the University's missions of public service, community outreach and lifelong learning.
