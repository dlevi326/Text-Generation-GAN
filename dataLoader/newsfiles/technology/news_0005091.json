Helen Mirren says young women should say “f*** off” much more.

And yes, we’re making a lot of mistakes along the way.\n“At 70-years-old, if I could give my younger self one piece of advice, it would be to use the words “f*** off” much more frequently.”\nAs arguably the most vocal voice of older women, Mirren is also not shy about her sex life, which she says “just gets better with age”.\nIn demand ...

Then they were asked about their parents’ sex lives — and oh, they were horrified!” she said.\n“The young always want to feel as though they’re the ones to do everything first. But naturally, it’s all been done before.”\nMirren has often spoken out about feminism and women, slamming Hollywood’s sexist double standards when it comes to female roles (“It’s f***ing outrageous. It’s ridiculous. Honestly, it’s so annoying. We all watched James Bond as he got more and more geriatric, and his girlfriends got younger and younger. It’s like ‘grrrr’. It’s so annoying”) as well as telling the The Times in April that calling women “sassy” and “feisty” was “insulting”.\n“Only women are feisty,” she said. “It just makes me gag.”\n“We need new words for female power and funniness and smartness.”\nControversially, she also said that women were often crueller than men, adding that “level of cruelty and judgementalism” of women towards other women, particularly in the age of social media, was more damaging “than from men to women nowadays”.\n Mirren: ‘Men, stop putting arms around women’\nLifestyle Big lie over free-range eggs exposed Mirren: ‘Men, stop putting arms around women’ Meal plan: A week of healthy dinner recipes Aussies with STIs on the rise Collar a clue in neck-and-neck race Lifestyle Realestate Travel Money Health Body+Soul Daily Health News Food taste.com.au Seasons Food News Fashion Vogue Trends Fashion News Parenting Parenting Kidspot Moments Parenting News Relationships Home & Garden Home & Garden Collections Home & Garden News Horoscopes", "external_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-3226225/Helen-Mirren-don-t-damn-getting-older-snapped-bus-no-make-on.html", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/mirren-it-annoys-me-when-i-see-men-with-their-arm-slung-around-their-girlfriends-shoulders-its-like-ownership/story-fnixw28e-1227526576032?sv=efd5e44030765b483adc90c3ab85e3f3&title=Mirren%3A+%26%238216%3BMen%2C+stop+putting+arms+around+women%26%238217%3B", "http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/article4405640.ece", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/mirren-it-annoys-me-when-i-see-men-with-their-arm-slung-around-their-girlfriends-shoulders-its-like-ownership/story-fnixw28e-1227526576032?sv=efd5e44030765b483adc90c3ab85e3f3&title=Mirren%3A+%26%238216%3BMen%2C+stop+putting+arms+around+women%26%238217%3B", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Mirren%3A+%26%238216%3BMen%2C+stop+putting+arms+around+women%26%238217%3B&c=SHE%26%238217%3BS+known+for+her+amazing+acting+and+her+ability+to+stay+visible+in+a+world+that+only+values+young+women.+And+Helen+Mirren+is+not+impressed+by+men.&u=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/mirren-it-annoys-me-when-i-see-men-with-their-arm-slung-around-their-girlfriends-shoulders-its-like-ownership/story-fnixw28e-1227526576032?sv=efd5e44030765b483adc90c3ab85e3f3", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/14/1227526/575167-7063989e-5a95-11e5-82be-38282d6ee84e.jpg", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/mirren-it-annoys-me-when-i-see-men-with-their-arm-slung-around-their-girlfriends-shoulders-its-like-ownership/story-fnixw28e-1227526576032?sv=efd5e44030765b483adc90c3ab85e3f3", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/mirren-it-annoys-me-when-i-see-men-with-their-arm-slung-around-their-girlfriends-shoulders-its-like-ownership/story-fnixw28e-1227526576032?sv=efd5e44030765b483adc90c3ab85e3f3&h=Mirren%3A+%26%238216%3BMen%2C+stop+putting+arms+around+women%26%238217%3B", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/14/1227526/575113-4bc5647c-5a95-11e5-82be-38282d6ee84e.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/mirren-it-annoys-me-when-i-see-men-with-their-arm-slung-around-their-girlfriends-shoulders-its-like-ownership/story-fnixw28e-1227526576032?sv=efd5e44030765b483adc90c3ab85e3f3", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/mirren-it-annoys-me-when-i-see-men-with-their-arm-slung-around-their-girlfriends-shoulders-its-like-ownership/story-fnixwvgh-1227526576032", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T07:50:45.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
