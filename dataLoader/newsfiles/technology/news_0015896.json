This marked a shift away from its own BlackBerry 10 platform that failed to regain market share ceded to Apple Inc's iPhone and a slew of Android-powered devices.\n\"This phone is the answer for former BlackBerry users who miss the physical keyboard but also need apps,\" Chief Executive Officer John Chen said on a conference call.\nThe company could jettison its own platform if the Android device gains acceptance with its core base of government and financial industry clients, Chen added.\nBlackBerry shares, which fell as much as 8 percent before the morning bell, were down 2.7 percent at US$6.84 in morning Nasdaq trading.\n\"What they said on the call, speaking more about the outlook as opposed to the results itself, painted a less bleak picture,\" said Cormark analyst Richard Tse.\nEYE ON SOFTWARE SALES\nBlackBerry, whose smartphone market share has dwindled, said earlier this month that it would buy rival mobile software maker Good Technology for US$425 million. It expects the deal to help win new clients for its services business, a priority as it shifts its focus to device management software for enterprise customers.\nStill, analysts noted revenue growth from the software arm was weak.\n\"I'm happy to give them credit for patent licensing, but that's not what we're talking about in terms of high-value recurring revenue,\" said CIBC analyst Todd Coupland.\nExcluding restructuring charges, a non-cash credit tied to the value of debentures and other one-time items, the company reported a loss of 13 cents a share for the second quarter ended on Aug. 29.\nOn that basis, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had, on average, forecast a loss of 9 cents.\nRevenue fell 46.5 percent to US$490 million, well below the analysts' average estimate of US$610.6 million.\nNet income was US$51 million, compared with US$68 million in the prior quarter and a year-earlier loss of US$207 million.\n(With additional reporting by Allison Martell and Alastair Sharp; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Lisa Von Ahn)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-09-26T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T22:04:11.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
