A tap on the add button in the lower right bottom corner displays options to scan an installed application or a file. \nVirustotal Uplink displays a file location selector first that includes recent files created or added to the system, popular locations on the device such as the download folder, and connected cloud storage drives. \nThe hash of the file is calculated first and results are displayed immediately if the hash is known already. Results display the number of hits and the date and time of the scan. \nA tap on the overview loads detailed inforamtion that include different hash values, detailed scan results of all antivirus engines used by Virustotal, and a link to the results page that you can open in an external browser. \nApplication scans work similar but are limited to installed applications on the device. When you select the option the list of installed applications is loaded by the app. \nAll that is left to do then is to pick an app that you want scanned, tap on the upload button afterwards and wait for the results to be displayed in the main interface. \nThe settings list some options to change the apps' functionality. You may change the configuration to delete old reports automatically, or change notification options (the default notifies you in the notification bar whenever a scan completes). \nVirustotal Uplink adds itself as a share provider on the device so that you can check files from most Android applications that support the sharing of information. \nClosing Words \nVirustotal Uplink is a useful application for Android that is more useful than the official Virusttotal application for Android thanks to its support for checking files and integration in the share menu.
