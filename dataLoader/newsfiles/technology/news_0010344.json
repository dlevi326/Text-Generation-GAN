Datiphy offers the only highly scalable breach detection and database activity auditing platform providing the context needed for information security and network security teams. Datiphy will use the funding for continued rapid growth.\n“The interest in security has never been greater and concerns are only growing as enterprises are undergoing changes to their own business infrastructure. Datiphy has developed a unique approach and technology to resolve the security and compliance concerns of these companies,” said Corey Mulloy, General Partner at Highland Capital Partners. “We look forward to working with CEO Ted Ho again after the successful IPO of our previous collaboration. Similarly, we’re thrilled to be in partnership with the rest of the management team who have proven to be quite accomplished at developing innovative security technologies and scaling their respective organizations.”\nAs enterprises adopt public, private and hybrid cloud offerings and enable user and device mobility, network perimeters have completely disappeared. These trends are creating situations where data, workloads, users and devices have physical locations that change from moment to moment. So, rather than taking a network-centric approach to security with the idea of a perimeter and endpoints, a data-centric approach is required to visualize and protect valuable data assets no matter where they live or how they have been accessed.\n“By analyzing the behavior of the data, we can derive things like user behavior, distinguish between what’s normal and anomalous, and dramatically reduce the time to detect breaches,” said Ted Ho, CEO of Datiphy. “Previous security approaches have been based on the concept of a network perimeter and analyzing network activity for threats. As enterprises adopt new technologies for business agility and flexibility, this security model completely breaks down. Our method looks to the data itself as the target of interest for hackers and nefarious actors and, therefore, the ideal security focal point. Legacy approaches and ‘band-aid solutions’ can’t address these security challenges because they have the wrong fundamental approach and simply can't scale.”\nDatiphy uses a proprietary, high performance and scalable architecture to audit every data transaction within an enterprise environment. With this data-centric approach, context can be provided for all data activity for analysis and visualization of asset relationships and behaviors. In addition, by looking at every transaction rather than a sample of transactions, the accuracy of analysis is orders of magnitude greater.\nSecurity teams manage the Datiphy platform through an advanced management portal with natural language querying to quickly and easily verify threats and discover the extent of a breach for greatly accelerated resolution. Analytics from the Datiphy platform can be exported as feeds to other security and event correlation tools, governance and compliance solutions and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) offerings.\nAbout Highland Capital Partners\nFounded in 1988, Highland Capital Partners is a global venture capital firm focused on putting the entrepreneur first.
