Case closed. Lights off. What's for dinner? \nBut last week, Microsoft and Epson made a big splash - one figuratively, the other literally - introducing new generations of their standbys that expand significantly on the core mission. That seem more social in spirit, and generous in value. \nOffice Politics: Even if you've evolved into a telecommuter, working from home, Office 2016 will make you feel connected as you never did sitting in HQ at International Widgets or the venerable law offices of Dewey, Cheatem & Howe. \n\"Real Time Collaboration\" is a major new theme blossoming in Office 2016, especially finessed (at the moment) for Word and best generated on Windows 10-based computers/tablets like the new Surface Pro 3, my loaner testing tool. But iOS and Android device users may also participate in the real-time fun, even with free mobile Microsoft apps. \nClick on \"Share.\" Now a bunch of your colleagues can jump into the Word document you're writing from their computerized devices. Not just to observe but to make \"live\" changes (note the orange flag alert) and dish real-time comments via instant messaging, video, and audio calling powered by Skype (a Microsoft company). \nDon't like others' \"improvements\"? By saving your documents in the cloud with Microsoft's One Drive, \"you can always roll back to a previous version,\" noted Office 2016 developer Shawn Villaron. \nOutlook also is going social. A new feature called \"Groups\" gathers related messages, files, and calendars to keep the gang in the collective loop, while \"Delve\" shows which documents are getting the most heat/attention of the team. \nFeeling time-pressed, a little antisocial? Outlook for 2016 runs interference with \"Clutter\" - determining which incoming mail you regularly ignore and shuffling it off to a separate folder. \nGroup projects - work and play - become a glossier/interactive thing in Excel spreadsheet land, too. Going camping with pals? Make and share a vacation-items checklist, so you won't hike in with 12 beer coolers and only one tent (though some might like that). \nLike to share PowerPoint presentations? Office 2016 creations with \"Smart Lookup\" automatically make every term a hot button linked contextually to Microsoft's Bing search engine. If the subject is carbon \"dating,\" you won't be fed info about match.com. \nCoolest of all is \"Sway,\" a completely new Office application that is \"Microsoft's view of the future of productivity,\" suggested Villaron. \nSway automatically constructs an animated storybook-style presentation from fed text, photos, maps, etc. It even finds and inserts content on its own that fits the theme! And automatically reformats to the screen it's playing back on. Friends will thank you for sharing. \nEpson EcoTanks: As visualized last week with a giant fuscia-hued water tank in Times Square occupied by the U.S. synchronized swim team, Epson is diving into new waters with its EcoTank brand of all-in-one color printers/scanners/copiers/fax machines. \nBreaking away from the rest of the printer pack (HP, Canon, Lexmark) that rely (and make lots of moola) on small, short-life ink cartridges, Epson's new series packs four large ink reservoir tanks that you fill up - quite easily - from a matched set of ink bottles. \nWith an Epson Expression ET-2500 EcoTank ($379), the included set of bottles yields up to 4,000 black and 6,500 color pages, equal to the output of 20 sets of ink cartridges! \nGo for a larger capacity (150 pages) and speedier (11 pages per minute) model like WorkForce ET-4550 EcoTank ($499) boasting Precision Core print heads, and the yield with two supplied sets of larger bottles jumps collectively to 11,000 black/8,500 color. \nGiven a replacement cost of $52 to $60 per EcoTank bottle set, bargain hunters who've long stuck with monochrome laser printers for the low cost per page now have a \"wonderful world of color\" alternative that brings alive prints of presentations, posters, and Web pages with razor-sharp clarity (equal to laser) and instant-drying inks. \nEpson's EcoTank series also delivers decent photo reproductions on plain paper or glossy photo stock. In my testing, I sensed a trade-off (with a rougher look ) when making a wireless (instead of USB-wired) WiFi connection to the printer from a computer, smartphone, or tablet. But being able to print a page from across the room (or halfway around the world) sure is convenient! \nLike other makers, Epson has conditioned customers to think inkjet printers are intrinsically cheap - you could buy a stripped-down model for $50, virtually the same price as a replacement cartridge set (the real moneymaker). Over time, though, an EcoTank printer/copier/etc. will more than pay for itself, be far more pleasurable to operate and much kinder to the environment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T22:00:04.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
