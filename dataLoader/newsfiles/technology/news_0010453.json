(Photo: Tech-1)\n55 CONNECT 50 TWEET 16 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Just because you’re tight on cash doesn’t mean you can’t afford some high-tech toys.\nYour local dollar store has a gadgets section, believe it or not – it’s small, but it’s there – and you might be pleasantly surprised at what you can buy with loose change found in your pocket or purse.\nAs long as you have reasonable expectations when it comes to quality, you can’t go wrong with most of these $1 to $3 items.\nAs a follow-up to last year’s dollar store gadgets round-up, yours truly spent some time rummaging through store chains like Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, Dollar General, 99¢ Depot and Dollarama (in Canada) – and the following are a few of the best bargains.\nBe aware, however, not all stores have the same products, plus you might find a very similar one under a different brand name.\nTech-1 Retractable Mouse\nDon’t bother hitting up a big box store if you need a spare computer mouse. Instead of paying more than you need to, for $2 you can find a compact Retractable USB Mouse from Tech-1. Available in white or black, this small right- or left-handed mouse plugs into an available USB port on your PC or Mac – no drivers needed – and you can pull on the cord to give yourself as much space as you need. No, it’s not wireless, but this small and affordable accessory could be an invaluable travel companion, and perhaps more comfortable than cramping your hand to use a laptop’s trackpad.\nFoldable Clip-On LED Book Light\nUnless you're using a tablet with a backlit screen, reading textbooks or novels on an ebook reader (or paper book) can be an issue in dimly-lit environments – unless you turn on a lamp or use a book light. If you prefer the latter, you can pick up this no-name Clip-On LED Book Light for just $1, which clips onto your e-reader, paperback, or hardcover. Simply press the silver button to slowly extend the “robotic arm,” which you can position to shine the bright LED light accordingly. Three small batteries are required, but included.\nBYO Neoprene Tablet/Laptop Sleeve\nAvailable at Amazon.com for up to $15, a neoprene sleeve for tablets or laptops was found for just $1.25 or $2.50 (depending on the size). With multiple colors and designs to choose from (including polkadots), these BYO (“Bring Your Own”)-branded sleeves can fit a 7-inch tablet all the way up to a 16-inch laptop, and protects your tech from the bumps and knocks of everyday student life, thanks to its soft inner lining and stretchy outer “wetsuit” skin. This fashionable and functional accessory is well worth the small investment. Also found: XtremeMac-branded iPad cases for a couple of bucks, too.\nTilt Top Calculator\nWe all know how expensive it can be to be a student these days. So, while you’re at the dollar store picking up paper and pens, be sure to visit the electronics aisle to snag a calculator, too. We liked the solar-powered Tilt Top Calculator from Studio ($1), with an easy to read and adjustable 8-digit display (which can be propped up for a better view), large buttons, auto power off feature, and handy palm rest for those late night cram sessions. Scientific calculators are also offered at dollar stores.\nStylus Pen (3-Pack)\nEver found yourself taking notes on your smartphone or tablet during a meeting or presentation and realized an old-fashioned pen and paper might just be faster? Stylus pens for \"capacitive\" multi-touch screens can cost up to $15 – or you might opt for a no-name 3-pack of stylus pens for a single, smiling George Washington. These stylus pens have a thick, soft tip that lets you write, draw, or tap on your digital device, and a handy clip to attach to a smartphone or tablet cover or case. This product is also ideal for those with long nails or if you want to keep your gloves on in the winter months and access your phone outside.\nSunbeam Battery Tester\nNot only can you pick up an 8-pack of Sunbeam-branded AA batteries for $1, you can also pick up a battery tester for that price. Determine if your batteries need replacing or charging with this red and silver device that can test AA, AAA, C, D, and 9V batteries using the topside sensors. Three red lights on the face of the unit tell you if the power status of your batteries, ranging from 20 percent to 100 percent. If the battery is dead, no LEDs will light up at all. Naturally, this product requires batteries, too (three AG13 watch batteries), but they're included.\nVibe HDMI Cable\nAre you hooking up your new Xbox One or Apple TV? Pick up a 5-foot (1.5 meter) HDMI cable for a cool $2. For uncompressed, high-definition video and sound, simply connect the Vibe HDMI cable from the output jacks of your home theater components – such as a digital cable or satellite box, video game system, Blu-ray player or media streamer – to the input jack of your television or HDMI-supported audio-video receiver. You can also use an HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) cable to connect laptops to your TV, monitor, or projector.\nPhone chargers\nFor years you’ve been able to find standard microUSB cables to charge and sync your Android-based smartphones with a PC or Mac, or a wall outlet (with a small AC plug added to the end). But Apple’s 9-pin Lightning phone charger was harder to find – leaving many to hit up the electronics stores or mall kiosks to buy for $20 or more. Fast forward to today and you can in fact find buck or two iOS cables with a Lighting connector on one end and a male USB prong on the other. But no, they’re not Apple certified. Some have a small clasp to close it into a small loop, allowing you to wear it like a bracelet, or in other cases, the ends magnetically stick together. There were many brands available at the various stores visited.\nElectra Facets Stereo Headphones\nWe know what you’re thinking: What kind of idiot buys over-the-ear headphones at your local dollar store? But you might just be surprised at the decent sound quality with the $2 Facets Stereo Headphones from Electra. Found at Dollar Tree, these headphones are available in a few different colors, and have an adjustable headband and padded ear cushions for added comfort. Compatible with any 3.5mm (“mini”) audio devices – like a smartphone, tablet, or laptop – these wired headphone might be good to use in a pinch to block out your annoying dorm roommate. Also from Electra are the Vortex Stereo Headphones, also over-the-ear headphones but with a different shape and colors to choose from.\nFollow Marc on Twitter: @ marc_saltzman .
