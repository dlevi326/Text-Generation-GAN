He also declined to comment on a possible motive, asking \"Why does anyone kill a 2-year-old child? What could she have done?\" \nA composite picture of the chubby-cheeked, brown-eyed girl, known before Friday as only Baby Doe, had tugged at heartstrings across the country after authorities asked for the public's help. Her image was seen by millions of Facebook users. \n\"At just shy of three years old, Bella Bond was a true innocent,\" Conley said at a news conference announcing the charges. \"This child, whose very name means beauty, was murdered.\" \nThe girl was named Baby Doe by investigators who launched a massive social media campaign to find out who she was and how she died. \nUsing photos of her remains, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created a composite image of what the girl might have looked like when she was alive. Within two weeks, the image of the girl had reached an estimated 47 million people on Facebook. \nHouse Speaker Robert DeLeo, D-Winthrop, said Bond and McCarthy are blaming each other for the girl's death. \n\"It appears as though it was a situation of the boyfriend who was involved and apparently, I think, mother and boyfriend sort of blaming each other in terms of who harmed the child.\" \nConley said McCarthy was being treated at a Boston hospital for a medical condition unrelated to the case. \nBoth Bond and McCarthy are due to be arraigned on the charges Monday. Neither could be reached for comment. \nOfficials from the state's child protection agency said they had contact with Bella twice, for four months in 2012 and three months in 2013. In both cases, officials described the involvement as \"support for neglect,\" and the cases were later closed. \nBetween 2001 and 2006, the Department of Children and Families terminated parental rights for two of her mother's older children. One of the children was later adopted by her maternal grandmother; the other was adopted by someone outside the family, DCF officials said. \nThe girl's body was found June 25 by a woman walking a dog. \nDespite the widespread publicity, a text tip line and billboards with the girl's image, investigators were frustrated for months as they tried to learn her identity. They got their big break after Boston police received a tip and a search warrant was executed Thursday at Rachelle Bond's apartment. \nBond had a history of drug and prostitution arrests. \nOn her Facebook page, she appears to be a doting mother, posting numerous photos of her daughter, who she calls \"Bell\" and \"monkey.\" \nOn Sept. 15, 2014, a photo shows Bella wearing a tight-fitting, one-piece romper. \"Look at my Bell,\" Bond wrote. \"The outfit isn't supposed to be a catsuit ...Love her to death. I am on top of the world because of her. My life is complete again and worth living. I give her the world and more if I can...\" \nConley said he received at least 10 offers from people who wanted to take care of the little girl's burial, including Cardinal Sean O'Malley. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Collin Binkley, Bob Salsberg and Steve LeBlanc contributed to this report.
