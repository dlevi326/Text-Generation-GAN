The PhD will be working on the project “Large Scale Component Flexible Machining Cell (INNOMILL)” which is co-funded by Innovation Fund Denmark, Global Castings A/S, CNC Onsite ApS, Bila A/S, DAMRC F.M.B.A., Aarhus University and DTU Mechanical Engineering. The project will be carried out in an exciting combination of academic and industrial environments. \nResponsibilities and tasks The PhD project will focus on the development and validation of a model for anticipated calculation of cutting forces and process heat generation applicable to the specific conditions encountered in large structures machining. Using the model estimations, machined profile errors will be calculated along the tool path as a consequence of part, tool and machine tool deformations in order to implement error compensation. The developed model shall be validated experimentally both in the research laboratory and in an industrial setting. The position encompasses both theoretical work related to model development and implementation and experimental work on model validation through machining tests, process monitoring and dimensional, geometrical and surface characterization of machined profiles. Sensors selection and implementation, data acquisition and signal conditioning will be part of the experimental activities of the PhD project. \nThe position has both project and academic responsibilities. The scientific development work conducted must be positioned relative to current literature and published in conference and journal articles. \nQualifications Candidates should have a master's degree in engineering or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to the master's degree in engineering. Good knowledge of production engineering technologies and machine tools is a fundamental requirement. Knowledge of process monitoring, manufacturing metrology, CAD/CAM and programming tools such as Matlab will be desirable. The candidate should have good mathematical/analytical skills as well as good communication skills. \nApproval and Enrolment The scholarships for the PhD degree are subject to academic approval, and the candidates will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes of DTU. For information about the general requirements for enrolment and the general planning of the scholarship studies, please see the DTU PhD Guide . \nApplication To apply, please read the full job advertisement at www.career.dtu.dk \nApplication deadline: 15 September 2015 . \nDTU Mechanical Engineering covers the fundamental engineering disciplines within Solid mechanics, Fluid mechanics, Coastal and Maritime Engineering, Energy systems and energy conversion, Materials and Surface Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Engineering design and Product development. The department has a scientific staff of about 100 persons, 105 PhD students and a technical/administrative support staff of more than 85 persons. \nDTU is a technical university providing internationally leading research, education, innovation and public service. Our staff of 5,800 advance science and technology to create innovative solutions that meet the demands of society; and our 10,300 students are being educated to address the technological challenges of the future. DTU is an independent academic university collaborating globally with business, industry, government, and public agencies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:14:18.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
