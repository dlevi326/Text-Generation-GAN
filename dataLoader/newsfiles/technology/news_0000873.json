Vissolis believes that they have found a solution that meets this need. \nMany companies are focused primarily on short-term energy production. There is a considerable pressure to avoid long-term investments, as many of the largest companies in the world are heavily invested in concentrated energy production, such as gas and coal.

They help many commercial buildings connect with the desired solar power, often working between the 50 kilowatt and 10 megawatt commercial products. \nRenewable energy has become an important industry for the future.
