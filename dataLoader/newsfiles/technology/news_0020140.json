This is normal.\"\nA source familiar with Man Group said the firm had no trading operations in mainland China and only had a $50 million Qualified Domestic Limited Partner license that allowed it to raise capital onshore to invest in offshore assets.\nAs Chinese regulators investigate reasons behind a steep fall in the country's shares, they have jangled nerves in the financial industry and also raised questions over the ruling Communist Party's commitment to free-market reforms.\nEarlier this month, China's markets regulator froze a trading account linked to Citadel Securities, a unit of the U.S. group that also owns hedge fund Citadel LLC.\n\"I guess a company like Man has to be in China. After all, their original business was built on being where others were not,\" said Christopher Cruden, chief executive of Insch Capital Management.\n\"But as always, the problem is not just that everyone rushes for the exit at the same time. Itâ€™s that the door simultaneously gets smaller.\"\nAt 1125 GMT, Man shares were down 4.5 percent at 154 pence in a mid-cap index .FTMC down 1.2 percent.\nLi became Man's China chairwoman in 2011, having previously worked as the head of MTV China.\n(Additional reporting by Nishant Kumar and Sinead Cruise in London; Writing by Rachel Armstrong; Editing by Alex Richardson and Mark Potter )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T14:42:39.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
