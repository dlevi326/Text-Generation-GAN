While KineMaster 3.0 was released last August, featuring a new UI design concept and support for multi-layer text and images, the new video layer feature can display multiple videos at the same time on a single screen and is widely used for news, sports, in interviews and more to show various scenes simultaneously.\nMulti-layer video is one of the most requested features from experienced users editing with KineMaster who want to create more dynamic videos using B-roll footage. Since support for video layers was added in the latest version 3.1, KineMaster has surpassed 5 million worldwide downloads in addition to receiving positive feedback from users saying that a PC is no longer needed to edit videos and that no extra application is needed to edit video.\nMatthew Feinberg, principal engineer and director of KineMaster says, \"We are very excited about the addition of Video Layers to KineMaster, and look forward to seeing how our users put them to use on their YouTube channels. We’re already hard at work on more great new features and improvements for upcoming KineMaster updates.\"\nKineMaster’s video layer feature is available with a paid subscription on Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, LG G4, Nexus 9 and a number of other high-end smartphones, and support for the feature will be continuously expanded to more devices. KineMaster can be downloaded from Google Play .\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12973916.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12973916.htm", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexstreaming.app.kinemasterfree"], "published": "2015-09-23T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T08:24:50.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
