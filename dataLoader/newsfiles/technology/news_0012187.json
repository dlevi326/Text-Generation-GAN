Kuhlman of the Planetary Science Institute. \n\"'Space weathering' is a catch-all term for what happens to surfaces exposed to the environment of space over time. This includes the micrometeorite impact damage and redeposition, effects of UV radiation, and the effects of implantation of solar wind particles ,\" said Kuhlman, lead author of \"Simulation of solar wind space weathering in orthopyroxene\" that appeared in Planetary and Space Science . \"More space weathered surfaces become redder and darker from the formation of nano-scale particles of iron.\" \nBodies in the Solar System that exhibit space weathering include the Moon, Mercury and asteroids. \nKuhlman shot hydrogen atoms at solar wind speeds into tiny, polished samples of the common Solar System mineral orthopyroxene that had been placed on top of a silicon wafer. She then examined the compositional changes in the outer 20 nanometers of the implanted orthopyroxene using a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), and for the first time discovered the particles of iron beginning to form. \n\"This continuing work will allow us to estimate the rate at which these 'nanophase' iron particles form as a consequence of exposure to the solar wind . Linking this to the spectroscopic effects will allow scientists to infer the age of the body surfaces via remote sensing, which in turn will inform our understanding of a wide range of physical processes in the Solar System,\" Kuhlman said. New type of 'space weathering' observed on asteroid Vesta October 31, 2012 \nThe surface of the giant asteroid Vesta is weathering in a way that appears to be completely different from any other asteroid yet visited, according to new data recorded by NASA's Dawn spacecraft. This new type of space ... Solar wind and space dust create new source of water, laboratory study suggests January 21, 2014 \nWater ice is the most abundant solid material in the universe. Much of it was created as the byproduct of star formation, but not all. John Bradley of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and his team may have discovered ... Study suggests space dust carries water and organic compounds January 24, 2014 \nResearchers from the University of Hawaii-Manoa (UHM) School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and University of California â€“ ... Electric sparks may alter evolution of lunar soil August 21, 2014 \nThe moon appears to be a tranquil place, but modeling done by University of New Hampshire and NASA scientists suggests that, over the eons, periodic storms of solar energetic particles may have significantly altered the properties ... SMILE space mission passes first hurdle June 4, 2015 \nA space mission called SMILE (Solar Wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer) which is jointly led by UCL and the Chinese National Space Science Center has received the go-ahead for an initial study phase this summer by ... Scientists simulate the space environment during New Horizons flyby July 10, 2015 \nWhen destined to stay close to Earth, spacecraft often must withstand the hazards of our space environment. They can be exposed to regular radiation showers from the sun and - if the space weather is particularly intense, ... Recommended for you Earth observations show how nitrogen may be detected on exoplanets, aiding search for life September 4, 2015 \nObservations of nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere by a NASA spacecraft 17 million miles away are giving astronomers fresh clues to how that gas might reveal itself on faraway planets, thus aiding in the search for life. Using stellar 'twins' to reach the outer limits of the galaxy September 4, 2015 \nAstronomers from the University of Cambridge have developed a new, highly accurate method of measuring the distances between stars, which could be used to measure the size of the galaxy, enabling greater understanding of ... Hubble survey unlocks clues to star birth in neighboring galaxy September 3, 2015 \nIn a survey of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope images of 2,753 young, blue star clusters in the neighboring Andromeda galaxy (M31), astronomers have found that M31 and our own galaxy have a similar percentage of newborn stars ... Move over Milky Way, elliptical galaxies are the most habitable in the cosmos September 2, 2015 \nThe search for extraterrestrial life is surely one of the most important tasks we humans can undertake. However, the cosmos is vast and we don't really have any idea which bits of it are actually habitable. But what if we ... New Horizons team selects potential Kuiper Belt flyby target August 29, 2015 \nNASA has selected the potential next destination for the New Horizons mission to visit after its historic July 14 flyby of the Pluto system. The destination is a small Kuiper Belt object (KBO) known as 2014 MU69 that orbits ... Prawn Nebula: Cosmic recycling September 2, 2015 \nDominating this image is part of the nebula Gum 56, illuminated by the hot bright young stars that were born within it. For millions of years stars have been created out of the gas in this nebula, material which is later ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:34:59.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
