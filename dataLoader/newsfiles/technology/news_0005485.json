Coli presence within 24 hours 4 September 2015 Print Email \nA Canada-based researcher has developed a method to detect contamination of meat products with Escherichia coli-O157 (E.Coli), a bacterium that causes foodborne illness in humans, in less than 24 hours. \nThe current process of detecting pathogens requires a minimum of 48 hours to determine positive or negative contamination, Investigation and Development reported. \nAccording to the microbiology specialist from the La Salle University, Yadira Tejeda, the new process will allow a quick sampling of the products and identify the contamination through a process similar to a pregnancy strip test. \"I work with E.coli-O157 because it has caused many epidemics, and has contaminated both raw and ready to cook meats.\" \nTejeda was quoted as saying: \"The contamination by E.coli O157 is possible because it is a bacteria present in the gastrointestinal tract of cattle and, while not harmful to the animals, there is a high risk of contaminating the meat when the animal is sacrificed\". \n\"I work with E.coli-O157 because it has caused many epidemics, and has contaminated both raw and ready to cook meats; for example, burgers, sausages, beef and pork. In these circumstances, the products had to be removed from the market.\" \nYadira Tejeda is planning to implement a validation of this method, in order to see how feasible it is to release. \nAccording to food safety laws, food companies are required to test for absence of E.coli O157 before releasing products to the market. \nIn July, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists revealed that E.Coli is more likely to contaminate lettuce when downy mildew is already present \nDowny mildew is a lettuce disease caused by the fungus-like water mold Bremia lactucae.
