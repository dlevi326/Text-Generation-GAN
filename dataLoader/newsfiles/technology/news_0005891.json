Saeed Adyani Share on twitter by Dominic White The ABC has joined Screen Producers Australia in calling for the government to consider making Netflix, Google and other overseas digital video giants contribute to a new digital content fund, or a proportion of their revenues, to ensure Australian drama, documentary and children's content remain well represented.\nThe ABC says 2015 is a \"watershed year\" in the television industry with the explosion in on-demand viewing. It agrees with the independent producer's umbrella group SPA that it is no longer reasonable to leave major investment in local video content to free-to-air television networks and Foxtel.\nThe push comes after Google claimed its video platform, YouTube, reached more 18-to-54-year-olds in Australia than \"any single individual TV channel\" and has more than twice the reach of subscription TV, escalating the battle over viewers and advertising revenues, worth more than $4 billion in Australia.\n\"There is a strong move from new players in the market like YouTube to move towards professional and longer form content and they will do that in vast volumes most of which will come from international markets,\" said Richard Finlayson, the ABC's director of television.\n\"The model of a fund which works effectively in Canada and was previously proposed in the (then-Labor government's 2012) Convergence Review is worthy of consideration as a way of making sure new digital content players make a contribution our screen culture.\"\nMr Finlayson noted that the Convergence Review said the free-to-air networks' content obligations equate to between 3 per cent and 4 per cent of their revenues. He said such a contribution would be \"a reasonable place to start\" for digital competitors with more than $200 million in revenues and an audience of more than 500,000 for television-like content, the threshold proposed by the review.\n\"We are seeing a watershed change in our industry this year and it is happening very quickly and we need to start these conversations now because these things take a long time to make happen.\"\n\"The ABC is now competing with global platforms,\" said Matthew Deaner, chief executive of SPA. \"This is fragmenting audiences creating big challenges for everyone in the content industry.\n \"New entrants such as Netflix already have 1.5 million subscribers since their launch some six months ago and have to date not shown any indication that [they] will invest in local content in any meaningful way, while the ABC remains one of the most innovative and supportive commissioners of a wide range of Australian content.\n\"This is complex, but we shouldn't put it in the too hard basket just because it is difficult ... with good will and diligence, some consensus should be possible.\"\nA Google Australia spokesperson said: \"We care a lot about Aussie voices reaching a global audience, which is why we invest in programs like Skip Ahead with Screen Australia [a $250,000 investment for Google], run regular creator trainings, and bring new business models to Australia so that creators can make money from their talents.\n\"Aussies are having huge success on YouTube, attracting millions of viewers here and even more overseas.\"\nNetflix and Facebook declined to comment.\nIndustry estimates put total content investment from the free-to-air and subscription TV industries at $3 billion annually, including news and sport.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/netflix-and-other-videostreaming-services-could-overtake-foxtel-by-2018-20150807-gitnzi.html", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/DomWhiteAFR"], "published": "2015-09-20T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:06:36.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
