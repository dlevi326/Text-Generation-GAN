REUTERS Start out by checking how much total storage you have and determine how much is still available under your phones settings. \nCape Town - While you’re doing your spring cleaning, why not take the time to clear out the clutter on your Android smartphone? Getting rid of the apps you don’t use, the songs you no longer love, and all old messages, videos and emails can clear up some storage space for new content. \nStart out by checking how much total storage you have and determine how much is still available under your phone’s settings. If you’re running short of space, HTC recommends that you take these easy steps to clear up room for new apps and media on your device: \n1. Save photos to online storage \nPhotos, videos and docs on the phone take up a lot of storage space. To reduce the impact on your storage space, you can set your phone to automatically upload photos to an online service such as Google Drive, which you can download from Google Play. \n2. Remove unused apps \nIf you have apps installed on your phone that you rarely use, uninstalling them will free up some space. Clearing out the app cache on your phone is also a great way of freeing up some space. \n3. Export files and data to a computer \nIf you have work-related documents or other confidential files on your phone, you can easily move them to your computer. Using your USB cable, plug your phone into your computer, your phone will be recognised as a removable drive, allowing you to access the file storage and from here you can find and copy the files. Once done, you can delete the original files from your phone \n4. Clear out your downloads folder \nYour Downloads folder can get clogged with images, with PDFs and other files. Check through the Downloaded folder on your phone and delete these files from there. Alternatively, you can connect your phone to your computer and delete files from there. \n5. Use High-Speed Memory Card \nAdd a micro-SD card to your device to increase storage space and transfer your files onto the SD card once installed. This will not only boost your phone’s storage, but the speed too. \nAdapted from a press release for IOL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:39:05.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
