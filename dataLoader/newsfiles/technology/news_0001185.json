This happens as the nano-trap, which can be made of gold using conventional nanofabrication techniques, creates a highly localized force field surrounding the molecules. The team envisions using scanning probe microscopy techniques to access individual nano-traps that would be part of an array. \n“The scanning probe microscope offers a great deal of maneuverability at the nanoscale in terms of measuring extremely small forces,” Passian said. “This is a capability that will undoubtedly be useful for future trapping experiments. \n“Once trapped, we can interrogate the molecules for their spectroscopic and electromagnetic properties and study them in isolation without disturbance from the neighboring molecules.” \nWhile previous demonstrations of trapping molecules have relied on large systems to confine charged particles such as single ions, this new concept goes in the opposite direction, at the nanoscale. Next, Passian, Siopsis and Salhi plan to build actual nanotraps and conduct experiments to determine the feasibility of fabricating a large number of traps on a single chip. \n“If successful, these experiments could help enable information storage and processing devices that greatly exceed what we have today, thus bringing us closer to the realization of quantum computers,” Passian said. \nSalhi envisions a similar future, saying, “These advances are unveiling the beauty of the optical response for many complex geometries and opening the door to handcrafting the electromagnetic environment. We envision applications not only for trapping but also in designing new optically active devices.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T13:36:06.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
