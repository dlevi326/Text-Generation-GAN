During the Mesozoic era, crocodiles and their early relatives (hereafter referred to as crocodilians) were fierce competitors of the dinosaurs. While a large portion of crocodilians survived the mass extinction that killed the dinosaurs, only 23 species survive today, with 6 currently under direct threat of extinction.But what influenced the drastic shifts in crocodilian diversity seen over geologic history? New research from Philip Mannion from Imperial College London and colleagues in Nature Communications examines the fossil record and shows drastic fluctuations in sea level and cooling climates significantly impacted crocodilian diversity over the past 250 million years. Mannion and colleagues gathered data from the entire known fossil record of crocodilians and compared it to shifts in climate and sea level over Earth’s history to see if there was any correlation.[caption id=\"attachment_799\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Sarcosuchus was 6 meters long and 8 metric tonnes (Image credit: Imperial College London and Robert Nicholls)[/caption]Because crocodilians are ectotherms, meaning they rely on the sun for body heat, they are greatly influenced by temperature and climate fluctuations. About 10 million years ago, at lower latitudes, increasing aridity impacted their survival—their previously lush habitat was turning into the Sahara desert. Crocodilians that lived in marine settings during the Mesozoic, such as the fierce Metriorhynchus , had their numbers and diversity controlled by fluctuations in sea level that influenced the amount of available habitat. During times of low sea level, prey abundance decreased and the mighty marine crocs could not thrive.Extinct crocodilians occupied a more diverse range of habitats in the past. Now, their ranges are restricted to warm, wet parts of the world, where they are threatened by humans. Study co-author Jon Tennant of Imperial College explains: \"Destruction of their environments is also clearly going to be a major issue both now and in the future, and we should be looking not just to conserving crocodiles, but the whole environment and ecosystems in which they live.\"Knowing how climate impacted crocs in the past helps researchers understand what will happen to them in the future—except it seems humans will likely influence their populations faster than any environmental changes. While crocodilians were able to survive and thrive in the absence of dinosaurs after the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction, the impact of humans may be no match for them.", "external_links": ["http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150924/ncomms9438/abs/ncomms9438.html"], "published": "2015-09-24T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T13:14:51.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
