The study showed that a combination of three proteins gave an early warning of the disease, with more than 90% accuracy.\nTo help confirm their findings a large number of urine samples from healthy patients, patients with a variety of liver and gall bladder diseases as well as pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis were used in the study.\nLong Term Commitment\nProfessor John Neoptolemos, said: “Pancreas cancer remains a devastating disease and early diagnosis and better treatments require focused high caliber research for which Liverpool is known for around the world.”\nMaggie Blanks, from Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund that supported the research, said: “This is an exciting finding and we hope to see this research taken forward into a much-needed early diagnostic test.\n“Early diagnosis is an important part of our overall efforts against this aggressive cancer, alongside developing new treatments to tackle the disease once diagnosis is made.”", "external_links": ["http://www.nihr.ac.uk/", "http://www.liv.ac.uk/translational-medicine/staff/eithne-costello-goldring/", "http://www.pcrf.org.uk/", "http://www.bci.qmul.ac.uk/", "http://www.liv.ac.uk/translational-medicine/staff/john-neoptolemos/"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T11:44:37.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
