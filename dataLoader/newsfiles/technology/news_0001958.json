GOP Control removes unnecessary information in a scene which results in a lower bit rate. \nTogether, these features can effectively provide a substantial bit rate reduction (the number of bits per second that can be transmitted along a digital network) in the recorded video without a loss in image quality. \n“Smart Coding provides up to 70 percent improvement in bandwidth reduction, depending on the scene and the amount of movement,” said Charlie Hare, Panasonic’s National Category Manager, Security and Mobile Video Solutions. “This innovative encoding technology will help users better manage network bandwidth resources, reducing storage requirements and lower the overall total cost of ownership, while still providing the crisp, high-resolution images they’ve come to expect from Panasonic.” \nPanasonic’s entire portfolio of security solutions for businesses, schools, public safety and retail organizations will be on display at ASIS International 2015, Booth 3709. \nTo learn more about Smart Coding or the entire line of Panasonic cameras, please visit www.us.panasonic.com/security and follow us on Twitter at www.twitter.com/PANSecurity . \nPanasonic Solutions for Business \nPanasonic delivers game-changing technology solutions that deliver a customized experience to drive better outcomes—for our customers and our customers’ customers.
