A network of fake accounts approving articles for a price \nThe editors wrote on Wikipedia that they had detected a curious pattern whereby a new Wikipedia page created by a user would fail to pass inspection by the Wikipedia community due to concerns about excessively promotional content or lack of notability. \nThen a sockpuppet account would start editing the article and develop it sufficiently to be reviewed again by the community. The sockpuppet would then contact the creator of the page and offer to publish the article for a price, pretending to be a genuine experienced editor on the website. \nOnce the creator paid the scammers, another sockpuppet account would review and approve the article so that it went live on the website. But in time, the creator would be contacted again and told they now had to pay a monthly fee – $30 (£19.64) in some confirmed examples – in order for the \"editor\" to continue to protect the page from being deleted or vandalised. \nPaid editing is allowed, but only with full disclosure \nPaid editing, while not encouraged by Wikipedia, does exist, but the editor must abide by Wikipedia's paid editing guidelines . For example, PR firms might be hired by a company or celebrity to maintain their Wikipedia page, while museums and universities get their employees to keep their pages up to date. \nThis is permitted as long as the guidelines are followed and the users disclose their official affiliations, and the edits they make are scrutinised by the Wikipedia community. Any other private transactions to charge or receive money for editing a Wikipedia page violate the Wikimedia Foundation's terms and conditions and the edits will be deleted when discovered. \n\"Readers trust Wikipedia to offer accurate, neutral content, and undisclosed paid advocacy editing violates that trust. Sadly, it also deceives the subjects of articles, who may simply be unaware that they are in violation of the spirit and policies of Wikipedia,\" the online encyclopaedia wrote in its official blog . \n\"No one should ever have to pay to create or maintain a Wikipedia article. Wikimedia volunteers are vigilant, and articles created by paid advocates will be identified in due time. The Wikimedia Foundation stands with the Wikipedia community in their efforts to make reliable, accurate knowledge available for everyone.\" Read more about Wikipedia:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T15:11:21.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
