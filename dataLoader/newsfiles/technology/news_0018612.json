Asif comes with 17 years of rich experience in building web scale technologies, Product Management and building highly specialised teams focused on a data platform and ad tech products. We are confident that Asif and his team will further strengthen our technological capabilities,” said Rohit Bansal, co-founder of Snapdeal. \nReduce Data, which also has presence in Chennai, was set up in 2012 by Ali, Vagmi Mudumbai (CTO) and Darryl Jose (COO). Prior to Reduce Data, Ali founded ZestADZ, which was acquired by Komli Media in 2011. Mudumbai ran Dharana Software before this, while Jose had earlier founded two service businesses out of Iowa. \nReduce Data helps advertisers identify and eliminate wasted ad spend, which in turn leads to an improvement in campaign ROI. Its proprietary platform leverages artificial intelligence, real-time data and other tools.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T11:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:10:16.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
