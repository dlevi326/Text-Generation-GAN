With over 750 submissions for the awards across a number of B2B and consumer sectors, Maersk Line stands alongside other winners such as Volvo, Mattel, Coca-Cola and Jyske Bank.\nThe jury recognised Maersk Line’s shift ‘from communications to commercial’ and the success in embedding social media in a company that, at first glance, doesn’t seem like a natural fit for social media.\nDavina Rapaport, Maersk Line’s Pulse and Social Media Manager, said: “This is hugely exciting for Maersk Line. Determining social media’s contribution to a company like Maersk Line hasn’t been an easy task but we’ve managed to leverage our millions of fans into a channel through which we can extract bottom-line benefits for the company.”\nSuruchi Sharma, Maersk Line’s Community Manager, said: “It goes beyond simply accumulating followers, it’s about curating the right conversations with the right groups.”\nWith over 2 million followers across a number of platforms, Maersk Line’s social media is vital for communicating to a number of key audiences, including its customers, the shipping industry, the media, and Maersk Line employees.\nFact File: Maersk Line is the world’s largest container shipping company, known for reliable, flexible and eco-efficient services. They provide ocean transportation in all parts of the world and serve customers through 374 offices in 116 countries. The Danish liner employs 7,100 seafarers and 25,500 land-based employees and operate 608 container vessels.\n\n(Source: Maersk)\nFor all the latest on Maersk, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T19:14:24.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
