Advances such as Lab-On-A-Chip – new technology that can put several laboratory functions in just a few millimeters’ space – and other point-of-care diagnostics push manufacturers to the cutting-edge of miniaturization while demanding speed of production and cost containment. Eric Resnick, president of proprietary products of West Pharmaceutical Services answered some questions regarding this: \nWhat healthcare trends are driving new molding technologies and processes? \nResnick: As the healthcare industry moves to more localized points of service and care—including the home, clinic and physician offices—diagnostics, too, are moving from the large laboratory into smaller settings. This move coincides with a demand for newer technology requiring smaller patient samples and less reagent, which leads to lower costs, and faster results. \nTo address these “care at home” demands in the marketplace and to best meet the needs of our pharmaceutical industry partners, we are putting a strong focus on utilizing new molding processes and technologies in our offerings, including Daikyo Crystal Zenith Polymer Ready-to-Use Systems, SelfDose Self Injector System and SmartDose Electronic Wearable Injector. \nWe hear a lot about 3D printing. How is that used in drug packaging and devices? \nResnick: Additive manufacturing, commonly referred to as 3D printing, is the next industrial revolution and it’s already arrived in automotive and aerospace industries. Healthcare is following quickly. It enables the device developer to cut development times and avoid unnecessary expenses. Using additive manufacturing, the developer can create and evaluate concepts quicker when compared to conventional tooling and manufacturing methods. \nIn addition to reducing the development cycle, there’s an opportunity for cost savings during the development stages, as additive manufacturing has a lower cost per unit than conventional prototype molding. More recently, the technology has moved from creating components to creating tooling, which can be used to produce units at higher volumes. As more materials become available, design developers will have increased options and flexibility. \nAt West, we’re currently using additive manufacturing for prototyping, but next up is manufacturing, making aluminum or steel molds. This could reduce the development time by 80% to 90%, and offer the designer the liberty to create features that might not have been otherwise possible or prohibitively complex to execute. This opens up a number of possibilities for our industry. \nHow does precision part handling allow design flexibility for pharma partners? \nResnick: Precision part handling allowed West to develop Daikyo Crystal Zenith Polymer Ready-to-Use Systems. When producing polymer-based syringe systems for biologics, the precision and accuracy required to handle and load the needles into multi-cavity injection molding is significant. \nImproved vision systems and robotics now provide drug delivery system developers with the ability to customize the syringe or primary container and, in the process, become more creative in developing the overall delivery device. The combination of design flexibility and precision manufacturing of the polymer-based syringe system leads to improved devices and increased adherence. \nMulticomponent molding is seen everywhere in from toothbrushes to personal electronics. What benefits does it bring to healthcare? \nResnick: Multicomponent molding—often referred to as two-shot injection molding or over-molding—produces parts made of two or more materials in a single process, versus assembling or bonding multiple parts together, which is a more costly approach. The ability to injection-mold a soft surface for gripping or handling over a rigid plastic allows the designer to realize both structural strength and ergonomic comfort for the user. The multicomponent technology has been used in food and beverage packaging for decades and, while not a new technology in medical devices, the advent of new materials, improved tooling fabrication, and molding machine flexibility has created opportunities for more flexibility in design and enhanced device functionality. \nYou have plans for incorporating micromolding into West manufacturing. Explain why it matters. \nResnick: While not a new technology to the manufacturing sector, micromolding is becoming more critical to medical device customers, such as point-of-care diagnostics. Next generation microfluidic microwell plates – which allow extensive testing on smaller sample sizes – as well as microfluidics in the form of Lab-On-A-Chip, require extremely precise, high-volume micromolding where the critical part features are so small, they’re not visible to the naked eye. Working within micron sizes requires specialized tool manufacturing, molding, and inspection equipment; all of which will be critical to support the growing interest in point-of-care diagnostics. \nHow does micromolding fit into device manufacture? \nResnick: We know from device development that the need for much smaller parts has expanded. Previously, those parts would have come from a machining operation. The breakthrough has been in the precision of the molding. \nWhat benefit does micromolding offer over machining? \nResnick: To get the precision and accuracy these miniaturized devices require, you formerly had to micromachine the parts individually out of metal, which took much longer. This allows us to produce parts out of plastic that meet the tighter tolerances. \nLooking ahead, micromolding allows for in-molding assembly. This normally would have required post-molding assembly process, however, now we can combine it into one process, which represents an opportunity for cost savings and reduced production time. \nWith injection molding, for example, something could be made in an eight-cavity mold every 10 seconds, which is 48 per minute. Even a high-speed machining center would not be able to produce that volume within the same time span. Of course, there are some materials for which machining will continue to be critical, as is in cases where the application dictates specific material properties. However, aside from those exceptions, injection molding will most often be the most time and cost effective option. \nHow are pharmaceutical partners reacting to these new manufacturing technology opportunities? \nResnick: Our pharmaceutical partners often understand the science behind molding and are eager to collaborate on new and innovative approaches. We have deep expertise in our organization throughout the manufacturing process – from assembling, molding and tooling to quality control, testing, and inspection. Because of that, we’re able to collaborate with our partners to provide the highest-quality product, in the most time-efficient and cost-effective way possible. By continually evolving our manufacturing processes and embracing new approaches, together we’re able to develop innovative, easy-to-use delivery systems that help ensure safe, effective treatment and improve patient experience and outcomes.
