We have two apps that are both similar and yet completely different to each other. One is for online gmaing and the other is for slightly more real-world gaming. \nYouTube Gaming \nYouTube recently added a section of its website devoted to gaming and released a companion app to match. YouTube Gaming is essentially a funnel for the millions of hours of game content on YouTube, bringing it to you in a neat package. The app should look familiar to anyone who has used a YouTube app before – it has the same controls and search features. But this one highlights live content, particularly related to video games. Users worried about data use should monitor how much they're using the app on cellular networks, particularly if they're watching streams. WiFi might be the best option. Streams can lag, so be patient. Free, for iOS and Android devices. \nGameOn \nSometimes you've got to shout. When you're watching a game and your team is down – or up – it can be hard to keep your feelings to yourself. GameOn is an app that lets you organise chats around a game of your choice and share your thoughts, whether experiencing the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat. Users need an account to sign up, but can then organise private chats or join public chats. Stickers, game updates and stats build out a rich chat that can make the bleachers feel not quite so far away. \nParents and others concerned about profanity should know that the language in these chat rooms is not always appropriate for, say, a tea party. Free, for iOS and Android devices. – Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T04:23:58.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
