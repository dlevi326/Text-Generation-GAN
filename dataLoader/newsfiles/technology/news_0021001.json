Enhancements to DocuSign for Real Estate Plus, Broker Edition further position brokerages to improve agent performance, ensure compliance and data protection, and deliver a world-class client experience.\nThe addition of new task management capabilities provides the flexibility to support task management within any brokerage. Key highlights include:\nTasks Lists and Templates – The new task management feature in DocuSign for Real Estate Plus, Broker Edition allows brokerages to create a custom workflow unique to their organization that will help drive transaction efficiency and agent productivity. Task list templates can be created for each stage of the transaction to ensure that the client experience is consistent no matter which Agent is representing the brokerage.\nTasks Overview – A new “Task” tab can be found in every DocuSign Transaction Room to provide Broker Edition users with quick visibility into all tasks related to a specific transaction. Tasks that require document actions are found here in addition to tasks not associated with documents. New task status icons make it easy for transaction parties to monitor tasks through completion to ensure deals continue through to close.\nDynamic Due Dates and Reminders – Task due dates are dynamically set based upon the dates associated with each transaction, allowing brokers to ensure that specific actions are completed at specific times during the transaction. Additionally, a brokerage can configure reminders specific to each task. For example, when a task list template is applied to a DocuSign Transaction Room, the due date for a task will be automatically set based upon the expected closing date of the transaction and reminders can be sent at pre-determined times. Should the closing date change, the due date for the task and associated reminders will adjust accordingly.\nRead Entire Article at: http://realstreettech.com/latest-docusign-for-real-estate-plus-broker-edition-released/\nAbout Us:\nTechnology’s impact on commercial real estate is moving at an exponential rate.
