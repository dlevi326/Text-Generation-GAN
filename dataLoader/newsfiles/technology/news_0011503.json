The latest addition to their Semiconductor product portfolio offers an increased current rating for reduced package sizes, improved power cycling capability for superior reliability, and is capable of continuous operating temperature of 175°C for increased output current. \n“The enhancements we’ve made to the 7 th Generation IGBT modules are significant and will make a real difference for our customers,” said Phil Charatz, President and CEO of Fuji Electric Corp. of America. “Fuji Electric is looked upon as a market leader, and our customers rely on us to develop products that are smaller, faster, stronger, and better. This product lineup exceeds those expectations.” \nAdditional product features include a performance improvement in the trade-off relationship between Von and Eoff (characteristics) as a result of the thinner drift layer and fine pattern of the trench pitch. The structure and materials of the module have been improved to increase its stability and durability under high-temperature operation, thereby improving the stability and reliability of the equipment on which the module is installed. The series will be available in phases: 1200V IGBT modules are currently available for shipment, and will be followed by the 650V and 1700V modules. \nAbout Fuji Electric Corp. of America \nFuji Electric Corp. of America is a wholly owned subsidiary of Fuji Electric Co., Ltd., and has been responsible for sales and distribution of the company’s products since 1970.
