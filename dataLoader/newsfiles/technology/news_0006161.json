Fifteen percent of them came from Australia. “Given budget and resourcing limitations, skills gaps, legacy infrastructure, overall technology fragmentation and immature lifecycle workflows, IT departments are ill-equipped to meet the demand for mobile apps,” 452 Research said. “There is also still a disconnect between the intention for the majority of internal development to be done by professional developers and the availability of those skills to enterprises.” The study found that, among respondents’ companies, professional developers within the IT department presently spend 43 percent of their time on internal mobile application development projects, but this figure is expected to rise to 68 percent in two years. And the app development workload will be heavy: 50 percent of respondents expect to develop more than 10 customer apps over the next two years, more than 10 employee apps and 42 percent expect to develop more than 10 partner apps. 451 Research said: “Given budget and resourcing limitations, skills gaps, legacy infrastructure, overall technology fragmentation and immature lifecycle workflows, IT departments are ill-equipped to meet the demand for mobile apps. There is also still a disconnect between the intention for the majority of internal development to be done by professional developers and the availability of those skills to enterprises.” The research firm said that, as a result, enterprises were “falling unplanned into the ‘citizen developer’ model,” and “a burdened IT is beginning to look at other infrastructure strategies.” It said there was a danger that “a burdened IT is caught between the ‘rock’ of suboptimal existing middleware and the ‘hard place’ of new mobile solutions lacking extensibility,” and faced with this choice, would look to stretch existing investments. 452 Research warned IT departments that, in the case of both the bulk of internal mobile app development and project management, business units want input and greater collaboration, but only selective empowerment — not sole responsibility for projects and budgets. Therefore: “It is critical that IT facilitate this to prevent fragmentation of tools and projects.” \nAbout IT Masters and Charles Sturt University IT Masters and Charles Sturt University are proud to offer a unique series of Online Masters Degree qualifications that are: Relevant : Preparation for the world’s premium IT industry certifications from Cisco, ITIL, Microsoft, the Project Management Institute and Oracle are included as an integral part of the Masters.
