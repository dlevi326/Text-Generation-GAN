(Reuters/Beck Diefenbach)\nApple’s iOS 9 software is already installed on well over 50% of existing devices, according to what Apple revealed in the first weekend after releasing the operating system. The new iOS version brings over a slew of improvements — though it doesn’t necessarily make older devices faster — as Apple focused mainly on performance gains rather than flashy new features.\nEven so, there are plenty neat tricks available in iOS 9 , including 3D Touch (only on iPhone 6s series), a smarter Siri and improved battery life. But there’s also one awesome feature that can turn out to be a nightmare for users.\nREAD MORE: Apple announces iPhone 6s sales numbers, beating last year’s record\nCalled Wi-Fi Assist , the iOS 9 feature is enabled by default and it’s supposed to make sure that you’re getting a decent Wi-Fi experience. That means instantly switching to cellular data when Wi-Fi is spotty. For most users, that isn’t a problem, especially if they’re on large plans, or if they’re not consuming lots and lots of data by streaming video and music.\nHowever, as Quartz explains , Wi-Fi Assist can turn out to be quite a data hog, as the device will continually try to supplement weaker Wi-Fi performance with carrier data.\nThe new feature can be turned off quickly — and you should do it whenever you’re roaming, or if you have dependable Wi-Fi networks at home and work. To do so, just go to Settings , then Cellular , and scroll down to the bottom to see if Wi-Fi Assist is turned on.\nThe blog says that the increased data consumption is not a bug, and Apple is aware of the issue — if you can call it an issue. Therefore you’ll have to fix it yourself to avoid unexpected data usage and get back to your regular monthly data consumption.", "external_links": ["http://bgr.com/2015/09/17/ios-9-vs-ios-8-feature-comparison/", "http://qz.com/510329/you-might-want-to-turn-off-this-new-ios-9-setting-if-you-dont-have-unlimited-data/", "http://bgr.com/2015/09/18/ios-9-vs-ios-8-4-1-speed-wi-fi/", "http://www.bgr.com/", "http://bgr.com/2015/09/28/iphone-6s-opening-weekend-sales-2015/"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T21:55:48.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
