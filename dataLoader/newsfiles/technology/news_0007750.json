This follows a solid 0.7 percent gain in inventories and 0.4 percent sales increase in June.\nCheaper oil prices are weighing on the value of wholesalers’ holdings, while consumer spending elsewhere has yet to fully offset the steep drop in petroleum costs. Oil inventories – which are measured in dollars – plunged 4.8 percent in July and 19.8 percent over the past 12 months.\nThe combination of falling inventories and sales are generally signs of slower economic growth. This is because companies are anticipating weaker sales in the coming months, causing them to reduce their stockpiles.\nBut the decline occurred in July despite clear positives for the economy in terms of hiring. Steady job growth since early 2014 has lowered the unemployment rate to 5.1 percent, a level usually associated with an economy at full health.\nSales by wholesalers have dropped 4.2 percent over the past 12 months, mostly because of the steep 35.7 percent decline in the petroleum category.\nDespite the overall July decrease in stockpiles, wholesale inventories are at a seasonally adjusted $584.3 billion, 4.9 percent above a year ago. Inventories for autos, furniture and groceries advanced in July, while pharmaceutical drugs fell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T01:09:26.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
