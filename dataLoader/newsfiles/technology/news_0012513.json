Times have changed! Some time ago, Loribeth had a friend recommend that she use LinkedIn to find a realtor who could help with a cross-country real estate purchase. The search, introduction and closing of the transaction started Loribeth’s obsession with LinkedIn.\n“If it could help me find a realtor in another state, what else could it be used for? When my brother and I launched our business, I watched many LinkedIn training videos and thought Wow, LinkedIn could really help me to reach my goal\" (and it did). Fast forward to now.
