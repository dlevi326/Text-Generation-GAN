Mr. David Magabe and it is indeed sad that the outgoing Mayor wants to lecture people on how he has led youth structures, which is a cheap attempt to deviate attention from the core issue which youth development, he decided to take his time and lecture on how he led youth structures but failed to explain why the Municipality has functioned for more than seven years without a youth officer under his watch and tenure.\nAs a party we still re-iterate our call for the implementation of the Zithabiseni conference ANC that the outgoing and desperate Mayor must and should be expelled as a matter of urgency.\nWe will like to take this opportunity to remind the Outgoing and desperate Mayor that, his expulsion shouldn’t be attributed to individuals within communities and be characterized as an attack on him, but our call is informed by the Communities resolution where the outgoing and desperate Mayor was part of and defeated to retain his position as a regional chair of ANC.\nAll Progressive Communities in Sekhukhune agreed that David Magabe must be expelled. So David must stop being a cry baby. Being a Mayor is not an inheritance or chiefiency.\nThe Bolsheviks Party of South Africa is not apologetic to call for David Magabe and Mapule Mokoko’s removal and we will continue to do so till they are removed, it doesn’t need a rocket scientist that since the appointment of David Magabe as an Executive Mayor the state of development in Sekhukhune under his leadership has deteriorated beyond recognition.\nThe challenges that we face is that:\n1. David Magabe has failed to appoint a youth officer for more than 7 years who will be charged with responsibility to facilitate and mainstream youth development within the Municipality;\n2. There is no clear and coherent programme of action towards youth development in the whole of the Sekhukhune area;\n3. Bursaries and internships only benefit children, girlfriends of officials and Politicians, therefore we call David Magabe and his Security guard Willy Mosoma to publish the name and addresses of beneficiaries that have benefited from these bursaries and internship opportunities that he facilitated;\n4. Employment opportunities still benefit girlfriends, children, and immediate families of officials, and we are not sure whether David Magabe and his reckless directors are challenging us to publicly release their corruption\n5. Business Opportunities still benefit people from Gauteng and Mpumalanga Province, young people and citizens of Sekhukhune remain excluded in their own economy\n6. Sekhukhune is rich in minerals; our people remain excluded from employment\\and business opportunities, as it only benefits children and girlfriends of officials.\n7. Relocation of Sekhukhune district offices from Lebowakgomo to Sekhukhune;\n8. There is no contingency plan, while Sekhukhune citizens still waiting for the completion of the “De Hoop dam;\n9. Proposals\na. We proposed that all Municipalities to adopt the JS Moroka procurement model, wherein Business opportunities are ring fenced and preference will be given to the people of Sekhukhune;\nb. A sizable and decisive budget should be set aside for Youth Projects empowerment;\nc. Integration of LED units and Youth Units\nd. Establishment of Youth Directorates in all Municipalities, so that youth matters can find expression at highest decision level within municipalities\ne. Establishment of unemployed youth data base\nf. Establishment of a mining academy which will be situated in Sekhukhune\ng. The SDORM Programme should be supported , our offices must be relocated and be spread across the regions, Provincial government public works owns many unused buildings in the region while we still waiting for the finalization of land from Makgosi as purported by the security guard of the outgoing and desperate David Magabe;\nh. A clear contingency plan should made available for our people to continue to get clean and drinkable water till the de hoop construction is finished and ready to supply our people with water\ni. Establishment of a University satellite branch in Sekhukhune\nwith the Bolsheviks Party of South Africa rejecting the statement issued by outgoing and the desperate David Magabe where we view these statement as a blackmailing statement for ‘shoes’ to remain at the helm of the Municipality so that he can continue with impunity, corruption and looting of state resources. The Bolsheviks Party of South Africa cannot and will never be used to defend corruption, impunity and patronage.\nThe Bolsheviks Party of South Africa chooses not respond to the thumb suck numbers presented by the security guard of the outgoing David Magabe, we all know how Willy Mosoma was rewarded with the managerial position in the district, we will not degenerate, it is expected for the security guard Mosoma to lie and claim provincial and national programmes and record them as their own initiative in defense of his supervisor David Magabe\nj. The Bolsheviks Party of South Africa wants to confirm it again that Sekhukhune is a recruitment agency for girlfriends, children and immediate families of Politicians and officials, whether this is viewed as rationalistic, or xenophobic by the security guard, its immaterial to us, we will not be ashamed to call for beneficiation of our people\nWayward\nk. The Bolsheviks Party of South Africa has noted calls from Communities for a need to convene a Lekgotla in the region, with a view of finding lasting solutions on the state of youth development, details will be communicated to all our Communities as soon as we have finalized every detail;\nl. The Bolsheviks Party of South Africa is considering a possible march to occupy Sekhukhune offices to intensify our call and the implementation of his dismissal ; we will make necessary consultations with all stakeholders in the Moutse and information will be provided in due course\nm. The Bolsheviks Party of South Africa remains unapologetic to call for Economic Emancipation of people of Sekhukhune.\nTHE HONEYMOON IS OVER AND WE SHALL NOT REST TILL ‘SHOES’ IS REMOVE.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:28:49.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
