Peter Rae Share on twitter by Ruth Liew Cyber risk insurance has become the fastest-growing protection sold by global broking giant Aon, as companies become increasingly alarmed by cyber threats and data breaches across their businesses.\nEric Lowenstein, cyber risks practice leader at Aon Risk Solutions, said the broker sold about $US2 billion of cyber insurance premiums in the United States, and demand is burgeoning quickly in the Australian market.\n\"Cyber insurance is the fastest-growing insurance line for Aon globally. At an estimate, this time last year our gross written premium was around $12 million in Australia ; and we're writing half of that quarter on quarter now,\" he said.\n\"The average cost of a data breach in Australia is $2.8 million in damages, in 2014,\" he said. \"Stolen records cost $125 per breach.\"\nHigh-profile breaches Australian companies have been on high alert after the high-profile attacks on \"cheating\" website Ashley Madison, retail giant Target in the US and Japanese conglomerate Sony.\nResearch from Lloyd's found the risk of cyber attacks could cost the economy $14.26 billion â€“ ranking second behind a market crash, which could wipe out $43.6 billion in gross domestic product.\nMeanwhile, cyber risk has skyrocketed from 19th place to become the biggest fear of insurance companies in just four years, says PwC.\n The risk comes ahead of macroeconomic uncertainty.\nAustralia has the dubious title of one of the most hacked countries in the world, according to Mr Lowenstein, with criminals enjoying a 95 per cent success rate on their attacks.\nLegal firm Norton Rose Fulbright said the surge in data breaches highlighted the increasingly important role of \"data breach coaches\" on the Australian business landscape.\nData breach coach \"The role of the data breach coach is a co-ordinator of the various elements that need to come together ... to manage a breach when it occurs,\" Norton Rose Fulbright senior associate John Moran said. These include legal counsel, data management, public relationships, and responding to threats.\nNorton Rose Fulbright partner Tricia Hobson said the role of the coach was not as wide in Australia compared with Europe or the US, but it was growing.\n\"We don't have mandatory breach reporting requirements but they're slated to come in soon. You're seeing a lot more companies taking up an active interest at what they can do about the risk and protect themselves for it,\" she said.\nAt a recent King & Wood Mallesons briefing, company director Nicola Wakefield-Evans said cyber resilience should be one of the top issues being addressed by board members.\nThe director of Toll Holdings and Macquarie Group said companies needed strict protocols for confidentiality, and information should be encrypted to protect company data.\n\"These [attacks] are tangible perils,\" Mr Lowenstein said. \"When they get hacked into a mainframe, they access data [of customers] and once organisations understand where this risks sits, it's a serious issue that is increasingly on the agenda of companies.\"\n\"Awareness is growing particularly at a board level, and the appreciation and reality of the risk is starting to sink in. This is helping drive demand for cyber insurance,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-09-14T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:22:31.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
