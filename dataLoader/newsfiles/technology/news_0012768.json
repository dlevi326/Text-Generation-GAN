It did not say when it will launch, only that it will happen \"shortly.\"\nThe Cupertino, California, company has not said how many watches it has sold, though a recent report estimated it was about 3.6 million in the second quarter of this year. That's more than some analysts had forecast.\nThe public's response to the Apple Watch has been the subject of intense speculation. Critics have questioned whether it's useful enough for consumers to need or want one on their wrist.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-16T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:50:12.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
