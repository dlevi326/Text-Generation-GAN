Pope Francis is poised to eclipse national politics with his tour of the western hemisphere and Congress faces serious decisions about whether to fund or close the government.\nTrump's campaign, meanwhile, is soaring past uproars that would have sunk other candidates. Although the first nominating votes aren't until next year, Republican leaders and establishment figures have been unnerved to see Trump's national poll numbers rise to rival leading Democrat Hillary Clinton. They fear Trump's incendiary comments about women and Mexicans could tarnish the Republican brand and undermine their hopes for regaining the White House after President Barack Obama's eight years in office.\nAmong Republicans, still-early surveys suggested that the reality TV star has more support than the trio that had been expected to lead the race: Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Marco Rubio combined.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T08:48:42.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
