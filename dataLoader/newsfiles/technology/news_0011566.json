Trucks, vans and utility vehicles of all shapes and sizes also helped make the show the major industry event it was. Plush, first-ever SUVs from the cunning British luxury minds at Bentley and Jaguar were contrasted by far more rugged products like the the Mercedes G500 4x4 Squared and dirtied Land Rovers. Similarly, world-class business luxury vans were offset by fun-loving camper and sport vans. \nThe biggest SUV news out of Frankfurt had to be the world premiere of the Bentley Bentayga . Everyone was wondering what exactly an ultra-premium Bentley SUV would look like, and they finally got to find out. While we did find it more impressive in person than in photos, it's certain to be a polarizing design that some will love and some will hate. Welcome to the new world order of utility vehicles from auto brands we're used to seeing design anything and everything but. \nJaguar was the other British luxury brand to show its very first SUV effort, giving consumers a curvier, sportier alternative to the hard lines over at sibling brand Land Rover. After a world record stunt drive, the F-Pace rolled into Messe Frankfurt and showed the world what a cat-badged crossover is all about. \nThe Frankfurt show also served a reminder that a few SUVs are still built to actually go off road. After giving it the green light a few months ago, Mercedes showed the G500 4x4 Squared in bright yellow attire. And if the 422-hp stock version somehow isn't tough enough, Brabus has tuned things up to 500 hp. Land Rover reminded us who the real SUV-maker at Jaguar Land Rover is by showcasing two of the starring Rovers of the upcoming James Bond Spectre film. \nBeyond SUVs and Crossovers, Frankfurt also had plenty for truck and van lovers, from ultra-comfortable, spacious van limousines for wealthy businessmen to trucks and campers designed for weekend warriors. Check out each and every new model, concept vehicle and old favorite in our photo gallery .

Realizing he was better off making cynical comments from afar than actually getting involved in all that mess, he turned away from matters of government and news to cover the things that really matter: outdoor recreation, cool cars, technology, wild gadgets and all forms of other toys. He's happily following the wisdom of his father who told him that if you find something you love to do, it won't really be work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:12:20.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
