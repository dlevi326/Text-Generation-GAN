Bloomberg Yahoo may have to abandon its plan to spin off its $US23 billion stake in Alibaba after US tax authorities refused to rubber stamp the proposal, in an unusual move that could affect future corporate spin-offs.\nThe Silicon Valley company had its request for a so-called private letter ruling denied by the Internal Revenue Service, leaving it once again debating the future of its 15 per cent stake in the Chinese e-commerce group.\nShares in Yahoo fell as much as 4 per cent in after-hours trading as investors worried that the group could be hit with a multibillion dollar tax bill if it presses ahead with its plan to create a new company to hold the shares - or could have to pursue another, more costly plan for the stake.\nMark May, an analyst at Citigroup, said: \"We believe it's unlikely that the spin-off will take place as previously contemplated.\" He said Yahoo could now consider a spin-off of its core business or a sale to a strategic acquirer.\nAabaco, as the planned new company has been named, was due to be formed by the end of the year, containing about 384 million shares in Alibaba, worth $US23 billion at Tuesday's closing price, and a minor operating business formed from Yahoo Small Business, which provides website design and domain hosting services for small business owners.\nThe inclusion of the operating business is essential to ensure the company is not just seen as an investment vehicle.\nThe value of the potential spin-off has fallen dramatically since it was proposed in January, as shares in Alibaba have dropped 41 per cent so far this year. Yahoo stock is down 39 per cent in the same period.\nSenior lawyers and bankers told the Financial Times in February that the IRS could challenge the spin-off. Advisors said that the spin-off of an entity containing mostly stock would have made it hard for the IRS to approve the deal as tax free.\n Under US rules, for a spin-off to be tax free the IRS has to be convinced that it contains an actual business that has employees and generates revenues.\nYahoo said it was continuing to work on the pending spin-off plan, with the board of directors set to \"carefully consider\" the company's options - including pushing ahead with the spin-off based simply on the opinion of its own lawyers.\nOne lawyer specialising in tax deals said it was unclear whether Yahoo would go ahead, warning that it was in \"uncharted territory\".\nThe private letter ruling that Yahoo had requested is frequently handed out to companies considering spin-offs, to give them clarity as to how the separated companies will be treated for tax purposes.\nBut in May, almost three months after Yahoo first requested a ruling, the IRS said it was reconsidering its ruling policy.\nAn IRS official said at the time that one of the agency's concerns was whether these spin offs were being implemented for companies in which the operating entity made up just a small portion, or a \"hot dog stand\" in the new publicly traded business.\nThe Obama administration has been cracking down on what it views as corporate tax loopholes, including so-called inversion deals in which a foreign company acquires a US firm in a way that lowers its US tax burden.\nA year ago, the Treasury issued new rules aimed at limiting such inversion deals, and the transactions have also drawn Congressional scrutiny.\nMarissa Mayer, Yahoo's chief executive, devised the plan to spin off the shares in a tax efficient manner at the start of the year. She was under pressure from disgruntled shareholders who feared she could spend the money from the sale of Alibaba shares on mergers and acquisitions, rather than returning it to investors.\nYahoo had insisted that it did not think IRS statements about reviewing the rules for spin-offs were directed at the company.\nShareholders have also pushed Yahoo to spin off its stake in the Yahoo Japan joint venture.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:20:07.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
