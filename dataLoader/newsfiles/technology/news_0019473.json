Mr. Harris will share his 5-step Value Visualization Framework (VVF) aimed at helping all stakeholders “Visualize the Value” and will encourage an active conversation with the audience on best practices that drive the value of software development initiatives.\n“We need to stop keeping IT in the dark when it comes to the value details for their initiatives,” said Mr. Harris. “When IT is provided details about the economic value of a software development initiative, data-driven tactical decisions can be made, resulting in the desired business and economic outcomes. I look forward to discussing my Value Visualization Framework concept and helping CIOs enable their business units and IT departments to jointly focus on the value streams for their projects.”\nFor more information on the VVF or Mr. Harris, visit http://www.valuevisualization.com .\nAbout Michael D.
