Indiana now has 80 school districts and institutions utilizing the Canvas learning management system (LMS), a modern learning platform that schools and districts use to create digital classrooms for teachers and students. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150219/176684LOGO \n\"Canvas has really put simplicity back in education by streamlining every step of the learning process on its platform,\" said Donald Chase, director of Technology at Southwest Allen County Schools. \"It's important for us to integrate technology in a way that enhances, not disrupts, the learning experience, and our teachers and students have responded positively to Canvas.\" \nIndiana's rapid migration toward Instructure's Canvas began when news broke earlier this year that My Big Campus was no longer being supported by LightSpeed. Since that time, Greater Jasper Community Schools, Lake Central School Corporation, Southwest Allen County Schools, Yorktown Community Schools and dozens of other institutions began their move to Canvas. Now, nearly 400,000 Indiana students and teachers are transitioning to Canvas, which is the same technology that hundreds of institutions in K-12 and higher education use every day across the United States. \nWith modern functionality and user-friendly design, Canvas makes it easy for teachers to transition from outdated paper record keeping to the digital age. They can easily create digital assignments, communicate to students and parents through group messaging, and even live stream lectures. Canvas makes grading simple and allows teachers to engage students with multimedia without having to be technology experts. \n\"Our goal is to make the lives of teachers easier by getting clunky technology out of the way. Enabling teachers and students to truly focus their attention on learning is critical,\" said Mitch Benson, vice president of K-12 at Instructure. \"Canvas makes it easier for teachers and schools to create a great digital classroom for their learners.\" \nAbout Instructure \nInstructure, Inc. is the software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology company that makes software that makes people smarter.
