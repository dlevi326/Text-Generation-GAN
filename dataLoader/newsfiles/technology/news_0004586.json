RVCC is providing ID Resolution's proprietary WRAP service to every victim or suspected victim of identity theft, allowing them unlimited access to a personal Fraud Specialist who will facilitate the resolution of virtually any identity related problem from start to finish. \n\"At RVCC we take a holistic approach to the lives of our students, faculty and staff.

For many students, college is their first foray into an adult world full of newly realized responsibilities. Many are managing bank accounts and credit cards for the first time, dealing with medical insurers and paying bills online. This a world fraught with danger to their financial and personal well being as they learn the importance of security regarding passwords, personal information online, use of social media, using unprotected Wi-Fi networks and more. \n\"Identity Theft knows no social, economic or age boundaries, and colleges and universities are showing increased interest in having services to support their students and employees who become victims of identity theft,\" said Nick Williams, ID Resolution's CEO. \"RVCC is showing great leadership as they address the issue head on and provide ID Resolution's services to assist college staff and students dealing with what can be a very complex problem.\" \nID Resolution's WRAP service provides every victim or suspected victim of identity theft unlimited access to a personal Fraud Specialist who will facilitate the resolution of virtually any identity related problem from start to finish. The Fraud Specialist works with creditors, agencies, law enforcement, professional associations, credit reporting agencies and collection companies.
