Nick Flaherty reports on the strategies emerging to make that happen. General Motors is adding vehicle-to-vehicle communications to its cadillac CTS Sedan model in 2017 as a key step towards driverless vehicles (Courtesy of General Motors) \nTo read the full print version of this article, please subscribe to the U nmanned Systems Technology magazine . \nIt may not be obvious, but comms links are a key technology for autonomous systems. While there is a huge amount of r&d being carried out on sensing the environment immediately around the vehicle and using the resulting data for decision-making, there are key advantages to having data coming in from the wider area. For example, in the military sector, submersible mine detection systems keep in touch with each other by sharing timing data that allows them to maintain both absolute and relative positions under the sea. \nOne of the most active sectors for making this approach a reality is in the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) data links for driverless cars, building on the development of collision and threat detection for the ‘connected car’. The consensus is that an onboard camera or radar can only see one to two cars in front, while the connected car will get data from many cars ahead, with that data being broadcast to every nearby vehicle. Development programmes over the past five years in Europe such as Car2Car, and in the US the Department of Transportation’s Connected Vehicle Safety Pilot Model Deployment, have resulted in that technology rolling out now. \nThe next stage is to use this technology for techniques such as ‘platooning’, where the speed of a string of vehicles is adjusted according to the conditions ahead. This could mean avoiding ‘stopstart’ traffic or adjusting the speed of a group of cars so they all roll through a green light in one go. \nThe timetable for the deployment of connected cars in Japan for example has three stages, and began last year with the deployment of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) data links from cars to the side of the road, for applications such as signal recognition, rear-end collision prevention, and stop-sign recognition enhancement. In parallel, the V2V applications provide a transition from a field operation test to a pilot programme this year, the aim being to deploy this technology in cars in 2016 and 2017. \nA key issue though is which frequency band to use for V2V, as a global agreement allows system developers to produce lower-cost equipment instead of having to make different versions for different markets. In Japan, the 760 MHz band is available for V2V and V2I applications, in contrast to the 5.8 GHz-5.9 GHz band in the EU and the US. \n760 MHz has greater range and so can be operated with far lower power than 5.9 GHz, but 760 MHz is not available in Europe or the US as it has already been sold to the mobile industry for 4G services. However, this is an opportunity for ‘cognitive radio’, which is where a highly flexible radio front end ‘sniffs’ for the frequencies available and then reconfigures the hardware to match in a software-defined radio (SDR). \nSuch hardware should soon be commercially available. For example, Dutch chip designer NXP has teamed up with Australian mobile specialist Cohda Wireless on the first reference design for connected production vehicles from 2015. The MK4 is based on a chipset called RoadLINK, which combines an SDR radio chip from NXP with a baseband processor and software from Cohda that handles the network, facilities and applications layers for developing the communications subsystems. Adding cognitive radio is a further step. \nRoadLINK exchanges messages about location, speed and direction across an extended range using the various radio links available, and provides strong security, as it incorporates a hardware encryption accelerator and tamper-proof chip to prevent unauthorised access to the system and reject ‘spoof’ signals from hacking attempts. …subscribe to read the rest of this article: Unmanned Systems Technology magazine . \nFind suppliers of Data & Communications solutions for unmanned systems . \nThis is an excerpt from a five page “Insight” article in Unmanned Systems Technology Magazine Issue 1 . \nTo read the rest of this article and many more technical engineering-based articles on unmanned vehicles get your copy of Unmanned Systems Technology Magazine Issue #01 , or subscribe to Unmanned Systems Technology magazine to make sure you receive every issue going forward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:55:18.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
