IntelliCabin is the first IFE solution in the commercial airline industry to secure approval from a major Hollywood studio for the streaming of early window content — movies recently out of theaters, but not yet available for home viewing — to both passenger- and airline-owned devices. \n“The IntelliCabin solution is the premium wireless IFE system on the market today,” said Jared Shoemaker, director of cabin systems at BAE Systems. “We are now able to provide airlines with the extraordinary capability to stream early window content to passengers’ devices. This is a game changer for our industry and will enable airlines to provide exceptional travel experiences to all its passengers.” \nWith this approval, the early window content will be streamed from a server locally installed on the aircraft. For approval to share such content, the IntelliCabin IFE system successfully satisfied rigorous data security requirements to safeguard copyrights. \nBAE Systems’ wireless IFE solution is one component of the company’s IntelliCabin suite of products, which provides an integrated, scalable approach to aircraft cabin management through in-seat power, in-flight entertainment, and integrated cabin systems.
