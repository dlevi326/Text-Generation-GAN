Users in India are allowed to use only the products registered in India. Government reserves the right to take appropriate action as per Law of the country for any violation of this Policy,\" the draft said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T10:13:18.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
