(President and CEO, Kiyoshi Nakashima, with its corporate headquarters in Yokohama, Japan) announced the establishment of a venture capital initiative called Macnica Ventures. Macnica Ventures plans to seek strategic investments in ventures with unique business models and promising technologies. Macnica will collaborate and support these ventures to create new markets and businesses. Macnica’s office in San Jose, CA (Macnica Networks USA, Inc.) will search for investment opportunities and coordinate with its headquarters while the investment will be managed through its captive fund called Macnica Investment Partners. \nMacnica Ventures’ investment areas range from ICT markets, where the technology and business model innovations are expected to accelerate, to emerging technologies, where Macnica could breed new business areas for the group’s long-term growth. We expect the strategic investments will aid in expanding our current business areas as well as enhancing our ability to create new businesses. \nAs a leading global distributor of advanced technology products ranging from semiconductors to network products and services, Macnica has acted as a significant partner to over 300 venture companies. As a distribution partner, our business model for growth is intimately tied to the growth of our partners or technology producers.

By the early 2000s, our investment activities included direct investments into start-ups to add a new dimension in supporting our partner companies beyond distribution. Macnica Ventures seeks to integrate our capabilities in the business of distribution and investments in providing a new framework to create new markets and businesses with innovative ventures. \nWhile Macnica Ventures will have core operations in Silicon Valley, its geographic investment horizon is global. It is flexible in investment stages, ranging from early to late stages, depending on the development stages of our partner companies and the optimum stages for collaboration. Furthermore, Macnica Ventures plans to deepen its relationships with the venture capital industry, including cooperation with venture capital firms, to search for new growth areas and innovation. \nAbout Macnica, Inc. \nSince its establishment in 1972, Macnica, Inc. has acted as a technology-based distributor as well as a solution provider of electronic components and IT network equipment and software.
