Now with 4K support for its embedded management client (ASM200) and its VMS based software management offerings from Video Insight, Panasonic can now deliver the industry’s most complete, end-to-end 4K ready solution for video surveillance image capture, recording and management. \nWith the new enhancements to the ASM200 i-PRO® video management software, a Windows®-based application that enables a centralized and scalable surveillance and control environment supporting multi-camera, multi-recorder systems from a single PC platform, surveillance operators can now utilize 4K imaging technology end-to-end realizing a complete 4K ready capture/record/control solution. The new 4.0 version of ASM200 delivers a 4K native Graphical User Interface (GUI) experience and can support multiple 4K monitor output. The use of 4K security monitors running a native 4K GUI allows more high-definition screens to be displayed simultaneously and permits edge-to-edge 4K resolution to be displayed, both of which significantly enriches operator usability and effectiveness by minimizing the zooming action typically required on lower resolution displays. The ASM200 4.0 also fully supports the advanced analytics capabilities delivered by Panasonic’s i-PRO® ULTRA 360-degree cameras (based on Panasonic True 4K Engine) including moving object removal, heat mapping and people counting. \n“Now, with Native 4K GUI, ASM200 users can capitalize on genuine 4K resolution images in their surveillance capture and monitoring activities,” said Charlie Hare, Panasonic’s National Category Manager, Security and Mobile Video Solutions. “Our goal is to continue to deliver the highest quality capture, recording and viewing capabilities to maximize overall surveillance effectiveness.” \nPanasonic’s Video Insight VMS Delivers 4K Enhancements and Unlimited Camera License \nPanasonic has begun broad distribution of its Video Insight Video Management Software to the systems integrator channel, bolstering the software platform’s capabilities with new features and continuing to offer an unlimited camera license for most late model Panasonic i-PRO® cameras.* The latest version of VI’s VMS delivers a host of valuable enhancements, including an improved 4K native GUI and support for all of Panasonic’s latest industry-leading 4K cameras. \nThe latest version of VI software is available now, offering feature set updates to IP Server 6.2 and VI Monitor Client 6.2.12. These software updates apply new capabilities, such as PTZ camera prioritization; video anti-tampering settings; motion event details per server and camera; multi server access control integration support; and more. Health Monitor Cloud – V1, a new and improved cloud-based health monitor version for users, is also available as part of the VI VMS suite. \nVI VMS is an open platform, scalable system that supports more than 3,000 camera models from over 100 manufacturers and integrates with the most popular access control systems. The VMS is a highly integrated, easy-to-use video management software that offers an intuitive user interface, robust client options for Windows, Mac OS and Android mobile devices as well as its own built-in access control. \nSecurity professionals who own select Panasonic i-PRO® video surveillance cameras manufactured after October 2014 are eligible for an unlimited camera license from Panasonic for use with the VI VMS, providing existing customers with a significant reduction in total cost of ownership. \nIn addition, a free, 60-day trial of the Video Insight Video Management Software is available now via complimentary download. The software trial gives security professionals a risk-free opportunity to experience Video Insight VMS, a powerful and elegant enterprise-class surveillance recording and monitoring solution. Channel partners can download their free trial today at: http://info.panasonic.com/VI-free-60-day-trial.html . \n“Delivering native 4K user environments on both our VI VMS system and the ASM200 i-PRO® Client Software supporting our embedded solutions are just some of the ways Panasonic is evolving our products to ensure we are making our customers jobs easier and much more effective,” said Charlie Hare. “This is just the beginning of our long-term strategy to deliver products and solutions that are truly innovative and provide the best image capture, recording and management capabilities available.” \nGroundbreaking True 4K Imaging \nShipping since August, Panasonic’s new True 4K cameras, WV-SFV781L (Dome) and WV-SPV781L (Box) feature a 12MP 4K ULTRA HD imaging sensor and custom-designed 6x optical zoom lens to deliver the industry’s highest integrity 4K images. \nBuilt on Panasonic’s high-performance imaging platform, the True 4K line-up produces a 12MP image at 15fps and a 4K/2K image at 30fps for very high resolution streams at standard frame rates. The enhanced resolution of True 4K can effectively cover a four times wider view compared to a 1080p full HD camera, and a nine times wider view compared to a 720p HD camera. In addition, True 4K cameras set a new standard for low-light performance, offering high-sensitivity in color at less than 0.3 lux illumination and its built-in SmartIR-LED ensures solid low-light performance even in 0 lux environments. \nThe True 4K line-up features a new, custom 4K-ready 6X optical zoom lens, optimizing a broad 17- to 100-degree field of view that meets the demanding resolution requirements of 4K. Other features include IK10 vandal-proof housing and Panasonic’s water-resistant ClearSight Dome coating for both models to ensure better visibility and viewing even in wet and moist conditions. \nShipping since January, Panasonic’s popular i-PRO® ULTRA 360-degree cameras, WV-SFN480 indoor and WV-SFV481 outdoor IP66 rated weather and vandal-resistant fixed dome cameras also boast a 12 megapixel sensor built on a 4K ULTRA HD engine, producing a 9MP 3K x 3K Fisheye image at 15fps and a 4MP Fisheye image at 30fps. In addition to offering outstanding resolution and impressive day/night performance, the cameras also integrate on-board video analytics capabilities such as heat mapping, bi-directional people counting and moving object removal which can provide valuable business intelligence for retail businesses and other environments. \nLike all i-PRO® cameras, the True 4K and ULTRA 360 cameras feature on-board processors that have the ability to encode two H.264 streams simultaneously and offer JPEG modes for maximum flexibility, as well as edge recording via an SDXC memory card slot. \nPanasonic’s entire portfolio of security solutions for businesses, schools, public safety and retail organizations will be on display at ASIS International 2015, Booth 3709. \n(*Unlimited license for select Panasonic i-PRO® cameras manufactured after October 2014.
