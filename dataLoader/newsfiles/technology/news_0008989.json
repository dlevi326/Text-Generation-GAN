According to one general, the flash was a “golden, purple, violet, gray, and blue light” that illuminated “every peak, crevasse, and ridge” of a nearby mountain range, “with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described.” Wellerstein notes that several eyewitnesses described Trinity’s light as “cosmic.” This was apropos, he says, for nowhere else, “except in the interiors of stars do temperatures reach into the tens of millions of degrees,” as they do during a nuclear explosion.\nA team of astronomers recently tried to determine whether Trinity’s light might be cosmic in a different sense. The Trinity test involved only one explosion. But if there were many more explosions, involving many more nuclear weapons, it might generate enough heat and light to be seen from nearby stars, or from the deeper reaches of our galaxy—so long as someone out there was looking.", "external_links": ["http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-first-light-of-the-trinity-atomic-test", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.08530v1.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-08T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T19:37:34.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
