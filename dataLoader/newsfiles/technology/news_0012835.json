Kasich, we saw how collaborative efforts can lead to a more investment-friendly environment in our state, and this announcement is a great example of the public and private sectors working together to expand economic opportunities in Ohio .\" Understanding that broadband deployment in some remote areas is not economically viable, in late 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) created the Connect America Fund (CAF) to expand broadband in rural areas where market forces and economics do not support expansion. \"It is exciting to announce that AT&T in Ohio will accept more than $14 million annually over the next six years to supplement the expansion of high-speed Internet service to more than 37,000 rural homes and businesses across the state,\" said Adam Grzybicki , president of AT&T Ohio. \"AT&T has been investing in our innovative networks in urban and rural areas across Ohio for more than 135 years, and we are pleased to participate in this program to continue bringing high-speed Internet services to more Ohioans.\" AT&T has elected to participate in the second phase of the CAF program in Ohio , committing to deploy broadband to more than 37,000 homes and businesses in rural areas the FCC has targeted. In those areas AT&T will deliver broadband at speeds of at least 10 Megabits per second (Mbps) for downloads and 1 Mbps for uploads. About AT&T AT&T Inc.
