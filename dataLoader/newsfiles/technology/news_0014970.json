Combining these services helps companies establish a profitable online presence. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150923/269798 \nOver the past decade, social media has become one of the most popular methods of advertising for companies. Not only is it free to advertise on many social media websites, but it is also argued to bring in a bigger audience than the traditional marketing methods of television campaigns and billboard posters. One of the most useful websites for multimedia marketing is YouTube. YouTube has branched out to become one of the most popular websites around the world, receiving billions of visits per day. \nAccording to the CEO of fishbat, Clay Darrohn, \"YouTube is a marketing haven for any sort of business. It's very popular and allows companies to reach people around the world.\" \nWith simplicity of use and the countless amount of content on each topic, it is no wonder why many agree that YouTube will eventually replace television programming. Its popularity and rapid expansion has presented many companies to use this social media platform as an opportunity to expand the popularity and awareness of their company. \nDarrohn discusses 3 reasons why you should look into YouTube to market your company. \nIt's better than television advertisements. Television advertisements can be tricky and constraining. Not only do you have to pay a channel to run your advertisements, but you're also limited in time. Therefore, a company has to get out as much information with as few words as possible, hoping that viewers will be able to retain this information. YouTube on the other hand, does not have these limitations. By creating a channel, the creators can have hundreds of videos on their page. Not only this, but their videos don't have to be limited in time--although it is generally a good idea to limit the video between 5-8 minutes. Having multiple videos allows the target audience to look further into the product or service. The best part about it is that it's free to post. \nYou can tailor your product to its target audience . Advertising to the target market has never been simpler. It so happens that there are famous YouTube users (YouTubers), who focus on a specific topic. In this case, they will usually only provide topic related content and as a result, their fan base usually comprises of viewers who care about the topic. This provides a gateway for companies to introduce their products to potential consumers, by reaching out and paying YouTubers to advertise for the company and its products. This is a great way of getting the message to the target market, as many companies have already started to use this method. \nConstant consumer reports . YouTube provides a comment section for every video on the website. This allows viewers to articulate their honest opinion about the video. In the case of marketing a company and/or product, the comment section exposes the company to what consumers really think about the product, and what improvements they think can be made, and much more. \nfishbat is a full-service online marketing firm and social media agency dedicated to connecting all types of businesses with their target audiences in the most effective and efficient way. Through innovative strategies in social media management, search engine optimization (SEO), branding, web design, reputation management and public relations, fishbat promotes a consistent and professional online voice for all of its clients. \nMedia Contact: Scott Darrohn, fishbat, 855-347-4228, press@fishbat.com \nNews distributed by PR Newswire iReach: https://ireach.prnewswire.com \nSOURCE fishbat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T00:19:21.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
