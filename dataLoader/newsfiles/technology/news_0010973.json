(Photo: Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY)\n1 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE NEW YORK—There'll be plenty of time over the next couple of weeks to dissect today's Apple product news, a lot of which was leaked in advance. But as much as the Apple fanboys live for every last detail imaginable surrounding the new iPhones Pad Pro and revamped Apple TV, what the events out of San Francisco tell us yet again is that most everybody else is paying close attention too.\nWatching Apple's every move remains one of our most cherished spectator sports--even if you don't like the company or its products. or think Apple has lost its mojo. If you doubt it why are you reading this column?\nIt's obvious why investors can't look away, not with Apple the most widely held equity out there and not with the stock in the doldrums most of the year.\nUSA TODAY\nLive coverage: Apple to reveal next iPhone\nI get some variation of these questions all the time. What can you tell me about the new iPhone (that's what people still seem to care about the most). What's with Apple's stock? Oh, and is anybody buying the Apple Watch?\nOn that score, Apple pushed new watchbands and styles, promoted the latest watch software said there are 10,000 apps, It wouldn't say how many were sold.\nI'm not ready to predict off today's launch if any of Apple latest products will approach the blockbuster numbers that have come to define the company's rise to prominence these many years, especially in the iPhone's case with all the new smartphone competition coming out of Asia.\nThat story will play out soon enough. My expectation is that the note yet announced iPhone 6s and 6s Plus with motion-feedback \"Force Touch\" technology and 4K cameras wlll be very nice, albeit, incremental updates--emphasis on incremental.\nThe new $799 iPad Pro that was announced will tell us if there's an appetite for a productivity-driven tablet with a mammoth 12.9-inch display, and if so how that might cannibalize Apple's own stable of MacBook branded notebooks.\nMeantime, Siri's expected presence on the newer, pricier Apple TV is a bonus—though voice search on such set-top boxes isn't new; versions of Roku and Amazon's Fire TV have the feature. Opening up the TV platform to developers is potentially a big deal as is the prospect for using Apple TV as a hub for controlling \"HomeKit\" capable devices. We'll see if that happens.\nMaybe, finally, Apple TV will indeed be more than the \"hobby\" product that Steve Jobs referred to way back when. Either way I bet you'll be watching.\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com ; Follow USA TODAY tech columnist @edbaig on Twitter\n1 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1EVtLcJ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1EVtLcJ", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/51a46fcbabc9f806319cd2a798025ddbf9ee12ba/c=817-0-2817-2000/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635773816018727523-AP-Apple-s-Show.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EVtLcJ&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635773971159771297-Apple-special-event.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635773971159771297-Apple-special-event.jpg", "http://twitter.com/edbaig", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EVtLcJ&text=Baig%3A%20Can%27t%20keep%20your%20eyes%20off%20Apple%27s%20new%20iPhone%2C%20iPad%2C%20Apple%20TV&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/765a6272dd9cac88bf615d5d4c4493a3329faa46/c=2-0-1279-960&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635773971159771297-Apple-special-event.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-09T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:17:21.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
