Registration is now open for NCL, which provides students from two and four-year colleges additional opportunities to experience hands-on practice with virtual cybersecurity lab exercises and challenges. After three successful seasons setting record high participation, the 2015 registration is expected to continue growing as new platforms are introduced to the NCL games. The Cyber Skyline platform will host scenario-driven challenges that will engage students of all skill levels. During the competitions, students will be tasked with helping restore a virtual city that has been infiltrated by hackers. Tasks will include identifying and recovering from security breaches as well as tracking down hackers. The challenges built into the platform will help students build NCL-specified skills.\n“Our partnership with the NCL will help address the lack of qualified cybersecurity professionals through the use of a safe learning environment that attracts new students and challenges existing ones,” said Franz Payer, CEO of Cyber Skyline.\nWhat makes NCL stand out is the integration of learning objectives in all its activities. This is accomplished by aligning preparatory lab exercises in the NCL Cyber Gymnasiums with the games themselves. Players use the “gym” to develop knowledge and skills before demonstrating what they learned in competitive individual and team play.\nNCL measures each participant’s game performance and produces individualized Scouting Reports. These reports focus on strengths and weaknesses amongst various industry-recognized learning objectives.\nThe NCL season is also designed with faculty in mind. Teachers can freely access syllabi, recommended textbooks, lab exercises, and video tutorials to incorporate the NCL into the college classroom.\nRegistration is free for faculty/coaches and $20 per student. To register, go to http://www.nationalcyberleague.org/registration.shtml .\nAbout National Cyber League\nThe National Cyber League (NCL) provides cybersecurity training in a game-like environment that requires participants to work individually in regular season and in teams during postseason games.
