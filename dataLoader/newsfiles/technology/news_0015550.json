Do I have to replace my still-great SLR in order to be able to post my photos to Facebook instantly?\nA. Many people take photos and videos with smartphones to share quickly. But many like the better quality and features of an advanced camera, and most models that are more than two years old don’t include built-in Wi-Fi. Don’t want to shoot with a camera and phone? Try an Eyefi card, a Wi-Fi SD memory card that stores photos and connects to wireless devices. These Wi-Fi SD cards are available in 4GB to 32GB capacities and cost $30 to $100.\nHere’s how they work: Once the Eyefi card in your camera is recognized by your smartphone, tablet, or computer, it will appear on the list of networks in the settings for those devices. Select it; once it’s paired, the Wi-Fi SD card will automatically transfer copies of your photos and videos to your device, and you can share them from there.\nNote that this type of Wi-Fi SD card is compatible with many—but not all—older cameras, and it won’t work with SLRs that store photos on CompactFlash cards. Find your model at eyefi.com/cameras, then watch the demo in the video below.\nFor related information you can check our digital camera buying guide .\nSend your questions to ConsumerReports.org/askourexperts.\nThis article also appeared in the November 2015 issue of Consumer Reports magazine .\nCopyright © 2005-2015 Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.
