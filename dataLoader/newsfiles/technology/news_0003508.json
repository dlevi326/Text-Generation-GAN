The US ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach handled approximately US$200 billion in goods from or bound to China , and Bingham believes that this lucrative trade could be at risk:\n“Concern is clearly warranted. This is their [ China ’s] biggest customer. If we are running a business as a region [Southern California] and our biggest overseas customer is in trouble financially, we have to be concerned what is going to happen.”\nA key area Bingham further highlights is the differentiating import and export outcomes of the Chinese crash:\n“Imports may actually increase slightly as prices for some goods are made more competitive with the decline in the Chinese currency compared to the dollar, allowing [US] consumers and businesses to purchase more for the same amount of money… [exports] are going to decline. There is a proportion of that export trade which will see sharp declines in demand from consumers and businesses in China .”\nAs was predicted at the time of the Chinese crash by economists, the major impact would hit China hardest domestically as value is drained from shareholders’ reserves, yet manufacturing isn’t likely to drop significantly low.\nThe Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach are both set to feature in PTI’s upcoming Mega-Ports Edition which features 20 of the biggest ports in the world articulating their vision for the future.\nThe Port of Los Angeles is contributing a piece covering its world-renowned green practices and the Port of Long Beach is contributing a piece explaining how it is driving its port and region into the future.\nIssue 67 – The Mega-Ports Edition – of PTI will be released mid-to-late September, 2015.
