The vote required to approve this matter is a simple majority of the ordinary shares present and voting at the meeting in person or by proxy. This amendment was based on Dialog's determination that an amendment of its articles of association will not be required to complete the transaction. The merger agreement amendment deletes the reference to a possible articles amendment and the 75% vote that would have been required for such an amendment. Dialog expects that its shareholder meeting will be held in the fourth quarter of 2015. \n- Dialog expects to make antitrust or competition law filings only in the United States, Germany and Romania, with all requisite clearances expected to be received during the fourth quarter of 2015. \n- Dialog expects to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a Registration Statement on Form F-4 in connection with the proposed acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015. \n- Dialog expects that the Atmel shareholder meeting to consider matters in connection with the acquisition will be held in the first quarter of 2016, and that, subject to the other conditions to the closing of the merger having been satisfied or waived, the closing of the merger will occur shortly following that meeting. \nFurther information regarding the acquisition, including a recently updated investor presentation, is available on Dialog's website: http://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/atmel . \nAbout Dialog \nDialog provides highly integrated standard and custom mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs), optimised for smartphone, tablet, IoT, LED Solid State Lighting (SSL) and Smart Home applications.
