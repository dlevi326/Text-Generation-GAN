With the lens, even at the telephoto-end with a focal length longer than 600mm (135mm film equivalent), the F value, which indicates the brightness of the lens, is 2.4. \nAlso, with the employment of an aspherical lens and UD (ultra-low dispersion) lens, aberration increased by the increase in diameter was reduced, and the size of the lens unit was also reduced. \nConventional nighttime monitoring is possible only by applying infrared light over a limited distance or in the \"night mode\" (black-and-white photo mode). On the other hand, the new camera can recognize the face of a person 100m away from the camera in color even with a brightness of 0.08lx, which is equivalent to the brightness of moonlight, by combining the large-diameter lens, high-sensitivity sensor and high-performance video processing circuit, Canon said. \nMoreover, because the new camera has the super-telephotographic lens and an electrically-driven pan/tilt mechanism that controls the orientation of the camera, it can shoot an image of a wide area. It can be used for monitoring for natural disasters at rivers and harbors, monitoring cities from the roofs of buildings, recognizing the license plates of vehicles on roads, etc. It is suited for use in places where nighttime monitoring is required in addition to daytime monitoring. \nCanon aims to release the camera in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:04:39.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
