The strikes came as Putin and US President Barack Obama push rival plans on ways to defeat the Islamic State group in Syria and on the future role of the country's embattled leader Bashar al-Assad.\n\"They gave us a heads-up they were going to start striking in Syria,\" a US defence official said. \"It was in the vicinity of Homs.\"\nPutin had just hours earlier won permission from the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, to deploy troops abroad.\n\"The Federation Council unanimously supported the president's request,\" Kremlin chief of staff Sergei Ivanov said.\nHe said the decision was taken after Assad asked Russia for military support, a request confirmed by Damascus.\nIvanov, a former defence minister, declined to give details of the operation, saying only it would be limited in duration and ruling out ground operations by Russian troops.\nPutin is seeking to muscle his way back onto the world stage after months of Western isolation following Russia's seizure of Crimea from Ukraine and support for a separatist insurgency in the east of the ex-Soviet country.\nAddressing the UN General Assembly for the first time in a decade, Putin on Monday proposed a broad UN-backed coalition to fight IS militants and clashed with Obama on the future of Assad.\nWashington and its allies blame Assad for the mayhem in Syria, where four years of bloodshed have killed more than 240,000 people.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:34:40.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
