Some were told the professional was male and others were told that the professional was female. The participants viewed three images of the person’s work and rated the work on its creativity, originality, and outside-the-box thinking.\nAccording to the researchers, male architect would be rated as more creative than female architect, but that this gender difference would not emerge in the context of fashion design because traditional male stereotypes might be more difficult to apply in the domain of fashion.\nThe researchers also found that male executives tended to be judged as more innovative than their female counterparts were and male manager who took risks was viewed as being more adventurous, courageous, and independent and this boosted perceptions of his creativity.\nLead researcher Devon Proudfoot of the Duke University said that these results suggested that gender bias in creativity judgments might affect tangible economic outcomes for men and women in the workplace.\nThe study is published in the Journal Psychological Science.\n 29, 2015 1:24 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:42:23.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
