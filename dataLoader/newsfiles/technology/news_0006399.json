Bengaluru-based Housejoy provides basic door to door services such as plumbing, electric repairing, computer fixing, laundry services and much more.\n\nChatterjee joined Flipkart in 2012 and was leading the e-commerce major's product management and design for its consumer experience and platform team. He was also involved in building out Flipkart's new advertising business, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\n\"I am very excited about the home services industry and joining Housejoy,\" Chatterjee said. \"The crucial piece here is in meeting or exceeding the customers' expectations and in the process building the confidence and trust in their minds towards the Housejoy services and brand,\" he added.\n\nWhile Chatterjee will focus on products, operations and technology in his new role, Goel would look into expansion and Kumar into marketing.\n\n\"Both Arjun (Kumar) and I wanted some management bandwidth and this appointment gives us more time to focus on our respective areas,\" Sunil Goel, co-founder of Housejoy told TOI.\n\nChatterjee, who will report to both the co-founders, was also with Yahoo for about six years in various roles including senior director for global product management, business management & operations director among others. He's also had stints at companies like OmegaMobile and Fujitsu Network Communications.\n\nGoel said Chatterjee's experience of how to scale companies rapidly would be useful for Housejoy. The company, promoted by serial entrepreneur Krishnan Ganesh and his wife Meena Ganesh, raised $4 million in Series A funding from Matrix Partners in June which was used to scale it's technology and expand to new cities.
