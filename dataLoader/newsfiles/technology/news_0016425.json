Spectral purchased the shares from a minority shareholder in exchange for 5,000,000 common shares of Spectral stock, par value $0.0001 and warrants to purchase 5,000,000 common shares at $0.85 per share, expiring on March 13, 2013. There were no commissions associated with the transaction and shares were issued to non US shareholders of a Sargas Capital, Ltd., a Canadian company. \nOn September 30, 2015, management of Kontexto announced the closing down of the business with no cash or assets available for distribution to any shareholders, meaning Spectral will experience a total loss of our investment. Spectral is currently valuing the investment in Kontexto at $232,00.00 as of our last 10 Q dated August 12, 2015. The company expects to write this amount down to $0 as of the quarter ending September 30, 2015. \n\"Kontexto developed very complex analytical software that fueled their 7 year run as a company. The team has a number of talented and creative people and we hope to continue to work with a few of them on our other endeavors\", stated Spectral president Jenifer Osterwalder. \"Most importantly, as shareholders know that we are putting more focus on our other portfolio company, Monitr, we see real benefit in utilizing this talent pool for Monitr\". \nABOUT SPECTRAL: \nSpectral Capital (FCCN) is a publicly traded technology startup accelerator that invests primarily in emerging and fast growth technology markets.
