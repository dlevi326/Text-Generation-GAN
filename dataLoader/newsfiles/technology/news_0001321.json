He said the proper forum to discuss sensitive issues regarding surveillance tactics is with Congress, which is tasked with overseeing intelligence agencies.\nColombia's constitution guarantees citizens' right to private communications and all interceptions must have a judicial warrant. Colombia's chief prosecutor's office maintains with law enforcement a separate, more-targeted surveillance system, called Esperanza, for that very purpose.\nBut Privacy International said inter-agency rivalries, a deep-seated culture of spying, and legal loopholes in a recently revamped intelligence law that allows for monitoring of the electro-magnetic spectrum for national security purposes has opened the door to gathering massive amounts of personal data on Colombians' private communications.\nMuch of the intelligence-gathering technology was developed with the U.S., which has provided billions of dollars in cash, training and equipment to Colombia over the past 15 years.\nSurveillance technology and direct assistance by the DEA and CIA have been instrumental in the arrest of cocaine kingpins and a key weapon in Colombia's fight against the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, as evidenced by the interception of phone calls that located and led to the killing of the guerrillas' top commander, alias Alfonso Cano, in a 2011 military raid.\nBut the U.S. assistance also has been abused.\nSome elite intelligence and police units receiving direct U.S. aid and equipment were among those found to be illegally spying during last decade on Supreme Court justices, journalists, victims' rights groups, and political opponents of hardliner former President Alvaro Uribe. Several top generals were fired as a result and the domestic intelligence agency, or DAS, was disbanded in 2011. U.S. officials were not implicated in the illegal acts.\nDespite public outrage over the illegal spying, and revelations last year that government negotiators in peace talks with leftist rebels had their communications tapped by the Colombian army, law enforcement agencies continue to invest in sophisticated snooping technology without substantive checks against abuse, according to the report.\n\"After all the serious scandals that have shocked the country and many promises about tightening the control over intelligence and police activities, we learn that Colombian authorities, indeed, have mass surveillance capabilities over mobile and internet communications,\" said Carolina Botero, a privacy activist and lawyer at the Bogota-based Karisma Foundation. \"It's clear that there's a long way ahead for the compliance of intelligence and criminal investigation activities with human rights standards.\"\n___\nAP Writer Frank Bajak contributed to this report from Lima, Peru\nFollow Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjoshgoodman\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
