These figures mean that Busan has to improve on a 1.6 million throughput per month if it’s to reach its ambitious 20 million TEU goal for 2015. \nHowever, with peaks witnessed in winter months as demand increases, Busan could quite viably hit a higher monthly average of around 1.8 TEU handled to creep over the 20 million TEU mark yet. \nThe Dongsam-dong Innovation District has been constructed to be a research and education hub for the maritime industry, and built near the port to ensure smooth discourse between both entities. \nIt is another ambitious modernising project at the port, with Busan already constructing its ‘distripark’ that aims to optimise assembly and packaging operations, its North Port with a focus on tourism, and it’s the creation of Busan New Port which aims to be the logistics hub for Northeast Asia. \nIt was also recently reported that Busan aims to become the world’s number two port by focussing on being Asia’s key transhipment hub. \nWhen Kim Li-Tack departs as President of the BPA, it has been announced that Woo Ye-jong will be his successor . \nThe developments at Busan New Port continue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T12:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T14:17:09.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
