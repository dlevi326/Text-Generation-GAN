Many Android devices may have carried the Nexus brand but the new Pixel C, unveiled yesterday, is the first tablet built \"end-to-end\" by Google itself. \nThe last time Google built its own hardware, the resulting device, the Chromebook Pixel, was high on quality. It looked like an Apple MacBook Pro, but was similarly high on price, costing US$5,000 (RM22,200). \nThe Pixel C takes the Microsoft Surface Pro for inspiration instead and features a full-sized, hinged yet detachable keyboard that can be used with or instead of the device's 10.2-inch HD touchscreen display. \nBehind the aluminium shell it will be powered by the latest Nvidia Tegra X1 processor and will come with 32GB or 64GB of on board storage. \nAs for when it will be going on sale, all that Google will say is that it will be available before the holiday season gets into full swing and that prices will start at US$499 for a 32GB version without the keyboard. – AFP Relaxnews, September 30, 2015. \nShare with others", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T10:56:08.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
