Apple App Store Less than 48 hours after the “Peace” mobile app was released–and rapidly hit the top of Apple’s chart for paid apps–its well-known creator pulled the advertising blocker from the App Store over pangs of conscience.\nMarco Arment, a popular developer who created Instapaper and was a lead developer on Tumblr, suggested he was troubled by the harm that came from depriving some businesses of advertising revenue. He explained his reasons for pulling the $2.99 app in a blog post titled “Just doesn’t feel good.”\n“Achieving this much success with Peace just doesn’t feel good,” wrote Mr. Arment, an influential presence in the tech landscape who has 86,000 Twitter followers. “Ad blockers come with an important asterisk: while they do benefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don’t deserve the hit.”\nPublishers had been bracing for the arrival iOS 9, the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system that was released Wednesday. For the first time, the update allowed users to download extensions that would block ads in Apple’s Safari mobile browser. (It works similarly to the way Apple now allows apps for third-party keyboards.)\nApple itself doesn’t block advertisements, but it permits developers to release such extensions in the App Store. Several are available, including “Crystal” and “Purify.” Peace, which Mr. Arment made using data from Ghostery, a privacy-minded software developer, climbed to the top of the paid-apps chart.\nIn the run up to and through the release of iOS 9, a war of words erupted on Twitter and in the blogosphere over the benefits of ad blockers (speed, efficiency, security, control) versus the chief drawback: depriving publishers of their lifeblood. People took sides. Advertising is one of the few ways publishers – particularly smaller, independent ones – have to monetize their online audiences, particularly on mobile devices. At the same time, too many publishers have tracked users, violating their privacy and slowing the load times of mobile Web pages, critics argued.\nWidely followed developers and writers weighed in, including Apple seer John Gruber , Casey Johnston in the Awl and the Verge’s Nilay Patel, on what else could be driving the ad-blocking war. There are many, many more thinkpieces.\nWhen he launched Peace on Wednesday, Mr. Arment said it would bring “peace, quiet, privacy, and – as a nice side benefit – ludicrous speed.” He decried the pervasiveness of online ads and trackers, particularly on mobile devices. Before long, publications were writing about Peace’s ascent .\nIn pulling the app, Mr. Arment said that, to sit well with his conscience, he needed his ad blocker to be more nuanced.\nPeace will continue to work for everyone who bought it, Mr. Arment said, but won’t be updated. Customers can request a refund .\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KJ442_adbloc_G_20150918150235.jpg", "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/08/28/apples-ad-blocking-is-potential-nightmare-for-ad-sellers/", "http://www.marco.org/about", "http://qz.com/504879/the-most-popular-paid-iphone-app-right-now-is-an-ad-blocker/", "http://www.theawl.com/2015/09/welcome-to-the-block-party", "http://www.imore.com/how-to-get-refund-itunes-app-store", "http://www.vox.com/2015/9/18/9351759/ad-blocking-controversy", "http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web", "http://www.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=TWTR", "https://daringfireball.net/2015/07/safari_content_blocker_imore"], "published": "2015-09-21T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T02:31:26.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
