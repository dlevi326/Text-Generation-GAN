It then generates an analog output proportional to the pressure or a switching output, which operates at a particular pressure level. Pressure sensors are used for controlling and monitoring thousands of applications, such as consumer electronics, automotive, and healthcare, among others.The global pressure sensor market was valued at USD 6.7 billion in 2014 and is expected to reach USD 9.48 billion by 2020, at a CAGR of 5.9% between 2015 and 2020.The global pressure sensor market is primarily driven by increased demand for pressure sensors from the automotive industry. The automotive industry across the globe, is witnessing a period of relatively increased growth and profitability. Global production levels for automotive industry have increased along with growing sales, which have resulted in the growth of the industry as a whole. This growth of automotive industry drives the global pressure sensor market, as the pressure sensors have great applicability in this industry. Advancements in micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) technologies have resulted in the reduction of package size, cost, and weight of pressure sensors. Thus, this is also expected to boost the overall growth of the global pressure sensor market.The report includes company profiles of the key players, recent activities in the market, new product launches, mergers & acquisitions, and collaborations and partnerships, along with SWOT analysis. Some of the companies profiled in this report are Honeywell International, Inc. (U.S.), Measurement Specialties, Inc. (U.S.), Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.
