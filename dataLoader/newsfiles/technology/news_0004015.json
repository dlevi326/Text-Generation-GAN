Castel-Branco, an associate professor at Eduardo Mondlane University, wrote an open letter on social media questioning how then President Armando Guebuza ran the southern African country.\nNewspaper editor Fernando Mbanze was prosecuted for abusing press freedom by republishing the commentary, Amnesty International said.\n\"Both men were simply exercising their right to freedom of expression by speaking out about the governance of Mozambique on social media and in a newspaper. That is clearly not a crime,\" said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International's Southern Africa director.\nIn Angola, a human rights activist was convicted with \"rebellion\" for organizing a peaceful demonstration, rights groups said.\nJos√© Marcos Mavungo was arrested in March this year. After a court found no evidence against him, the state continued to detain him while investigating further, according to a statement from several rights groups. He was later charged with rebellion and convicted.\nMavungo's conviction may set a precedent for the 16 other Angolans detained under similar charges, the rights groups said.\n\"It intensifies our concerns that these individuals are unlikely to receive a fair trial,\" said Jacob van Garderen of Lawyers for Human Rights in South Africa.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:58:50.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
