Thomson Reuters will distribute its free, open data catalog of companies, people, instruments and related metadata with Tamr Catalog, an enterprise metadata catalog. The Thomson Reuters catalog is based on Thomson Reuters Permanent Identifier (PermID), which can be accessed online at https://permid.org . Tamr Catalog just entered its public Beta, and can be downloaded as a free, standalone app at http://www.tamr.com/tamr-catalog . Dan Meisner, Head of Open Data at Thomson Reuters, will join Nidhi Aggarwal, Global Head of Strategy, Operations and Marketing for Tamr, on stage at Strata + Hadoop World October 1 to present the joint offering. \nThomson Reuters is the world’s leading source of intelligent information for businesses and professionals. Tamr’s Data Unification Platform uses a machine-driven, human-guided approach to catalog, connect and curate the vast reserves of underutilized data ─ so-called “dark data”─ and bring them into the light of the analytical, data-driven enterprise. \n“Thomson Reuters Permanent Identifier provides an authoritative catalog of entities and records against which other data sources can be matched ─ think of it as 'bar codes' for data,” said Wilbur Swan, Vice President of Enterprise Metadata Services for Thomson Reuters. “By distributing our PermID catalog with the free download of Tamr Catalog, we can help users ensure that their data matches the real-world organizations and people it represents.” \n\"Enterprises with lots of data about people and organizations understand that putting data in context requires an authoritative list of those entities to match against. By including Thomson Reuters’ Open PermID with the free download of Tamr Catalog, we can help bridge the gap between what’s in users’ databases and the real-world entities they represent,\" said Nidhi Aggarwal, Global Head of Strategy, Operations and Marketing for Tamr. \nAbout Thomson Reuters \nThomson Reuters is the world's leading source of intelligent information for businesses and professionals.
