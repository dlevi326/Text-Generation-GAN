Sept. 16, 2015. The briefing is hosted by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), a global, cause-based, not-for-profit organization focused on better health through information technology. \nMike Byrnes, senior product manager at Entrust Datacard, will present a session titled “Enabling Digital Healthcare with Trusted Identities.” The presentation will explore various topics surrounding the role of mobile in creating more secure, more convenient, multi-purpose trusted identities within a healthcare enterprise and explores a variety of use cases where mobile can be used as healthcare companies look to becoming a password-less enterprise. \n“As more and more healthcare organizations move to using digital identities across a variety of functions – administration, patient care, research or payments – it has become increasingly important to ensure that those identities are trusted and secure, whether patient, provider or other,” said Byrnes. “By providing tools that help healthcare organizations move towards the next generation of trusted identities, we are helping them to not only increase productivity and drive business process improvement, but more importantly, we are helping them to improve the patient care experience.” \nToday’s organizations require the ability to properly authenticate individuals accessing networks and applications to protect from the theft or altering of sensitive information. Entrust Datacard works with thousands of organizations to authenticate and protect critical information -- combining the security and convenience of mobile devices. \nTo learn more about or to register for the virtual briefing, click here . \nAbout Entrust Datacard \nConsumers, citizens and employees increasingly expect anywhere-anytime experiences — whether they are making purchases, crossing borders, accessing e-gov services or logging onto corporate networks.
