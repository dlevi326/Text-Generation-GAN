This allows us to carry more water and leaves our hands free for other purposes. This pack is called a camel back. I have had a camel back for many years.\nIt cost a humble $15.00. It wore out and I found a new camel back at Dick's Sporting Goods yesterday. It is of great quality. I got it discounted from $100.00 to $60.00. I brought it home and organized it for my next hike.\nIt made me think back to January of 1990. I was in Durban, South Africa with a woman friend named Shona. She took me to visit an inventor. The South African army had special operations troops operating in the Kalahari desert. They could not carry much weight because they often had to parachute into an area or land by helicopter.\nThis innovative man invented a pack with a collapsible water tank inside. The South African troops loved it. This inventor started to sell a civilian version in South Africa. Thanks to Shona, I got to spend one afternoon with him.\nHe lived in a small apartment. He was a very modest and unassuming man. Little did he know the revolution that he had started for bikers and hikers all over the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:06:41.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
