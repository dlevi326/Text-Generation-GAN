The cybersecurity solution is a smart alternative to complex and impractical use of legacy VPN solutions to secure IoT devices. Security is an essential ingredient for the Internet of Things and the solution from CENTRI can protect users of IoT devices by authenticating and securing their data throughout its entire lifecycle - in use, in transit and while at rest. \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150929/272046LOGO \nCENTRI has also joined the Intel IoT Solutions Alliance in order to bring their much needed data protection platform for the Internet of Things to Intel and their rich ecosystem of developers. The Alliance currently features over 400 members that complement Intel platforms across hardware components, embedded software solutions and service providers for this emerging movement. \nBitSmart For the Internet of Things represents the next generation in data protection technologies. It provides many of the essential security features that are missing in legacy security solutions: -- Low latency data throughput -- Secure authentication of endpoint device -- Encrypted communication between device and application server -- Lightweight data optimization between device and application server to reduce bandwidth at real time -- Encrypted data on devices and cloud shared storage -- Mitigates denial of service impact and business systems disruptions \n\"The Internet of Things brings a completely different paradigm of security for enterprises and technology providers,\" said Vaughan Emery, CEO and president of CENTRI. \"Network firewalls, SSL or VPN solutions will not be able to scale or provide the protection needed in a world where most things are connected. BitSmart will have tremendous appeal as a simple, software-only data protection platform for companies rolling out IoT projects from the smallest sensors to the largest pieces of equipment.\" \nBitSmart can be used in several IoT scenarios on various platforms, chipsets and devices. Energy firms can secure and control remote operations, equipment or the grid from hackers and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Industrial manufacturers can securely deliver sensitive manufacturing data, across cloud or corporate networks. Transportation industries can protect operational controls of vehicles or trains without losing the benefits of connected services. \nFor more information about CENTRI, please connect with the company on LinkedIn , Facebook and follow @CentriTech on Twitter. \nAbout CENTRI CENTRI provides next generation data encryption and optimization solutions for the connected world.
