Conference 2015 (ELC15). G4S (#12), NASCAR (#15), Facebook (#16), AlliedBarton (#17), McDonald’s (#28) and Google (#38), were named to The Elearning! Media Group’s (EMG) Learning! 100 for developing outstanding learning cultures, innovations, or collaborations that drive performance.\n“First and foremost, a big congratulations to all six companies for being recognized as leaders in the enterprise learning space. It’s an honor to be named to the Learning! 100, and we are really excited to continue working with training departments of this caliber,” said Chip Ramsey, Chief Executive Officer of Intellum. “It’s very easy for a company to get stuck in the status quo, following the same static, boring approach to learning that companies of all shapes and sizes have followed for years. In very unique ways, these six companies have demonstrated their desire to push the boundaries, as well as their ability to deliver exceptional results. All six companies deserve this recognition.”\nThe Learning! 100 is a research-based program that provides organizations a benchmark for future development; is quantitative and qualitative; and is unbiased by size of the organization. Learning! 100 applicants are evaluated on three sets of criterion: EMG’s Learning Culture Index, Collaborative Strategies’ Innovation & Collaboration Ratings and overall organizational performance.\n\"The Learning! 100 recognizes the top 100 global learning organizations for high performance. These organizations are innovative, collaborative and have a truly immersive learning culture,\" said Catherine Upton, Elearning! Media Group Publisher & Event Producer. \"Organizations from 2 to 1.6 million employees were honored this year, and shows size does not matter when it comes to making a difference in the learning field.\"\nThis year’s Learning! 100 were announced at the the 2015 Enterprise Learning! Conference (ELC15), held on June 15th, in Manassas, VA, and published in the August/September issue of ELearning! magazine.\nAbout Intellum\nIntellum is an Atlanta-based technology company that provides employee collaboration, performance and learning tools for the modern workplace.
