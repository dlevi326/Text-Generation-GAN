These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Core retail sales were previously reported to have increased 0.3 percent in July. The retail sales report was the latest indication of sturdy economic momentum and suggested the recent stock market sell-off had little impact on consumer spending. Signs of sustained strength in the economy could encourage the Fed to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero.
