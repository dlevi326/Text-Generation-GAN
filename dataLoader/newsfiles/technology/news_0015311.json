Weighing in at less than half an ounce (0.42), the Point is no lightweight when it comes to advanced technologies and crystal-clear sound quality. Lose the Noise. Get the Point.\nAnyone who’s used a typical small Bluetooth headset knows that their sound quality leaves something to be desired—especially in noisy environments. The new BlueParrott Point is the exception. Stylishly small and comfortably light, the Point employs VXi’s advanced technologies to deliver natural, highly intelligible sound quality as well as remarkably effective (82%) microphone noise canceling. Because Point makes it easy to both hear and be heard, even in noisy environments, it enables users to be more productive. Wherever they go.\nAvailable in black or white, the Point incorporates many of the class-leading features found in VXi BlueParrott’s larger mobile headsets. Pairing is fast and easy, thanks to Near-Field Communication (NFC). The Point can be paired with two Bluetooth devices at the same time, and is equipped to stream audio, such as music or GPS directions, from any Bluetooth device. Six hours of talk time and up to 66 feet of Bluetooth range make the Point real-world convenient and user friendly.\n“We’re proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish with the Point,” said Mike Ferguson, president and CEO of VXi. “Users who absolutely must have a very small Bluetooth headset now can enjoy the form factor they prefer, without sacrificing sound quality.”\nPricing & Availability\nThe Point has an MSRP of $79.99 and is available now through VXi BlueParrott retailers and resellers. It is also available online at Amazon.com, BestBuy.com and on the company’s website.\nAbout VXi Corporation\nVXi provides the best-performing headsets, telecommunications and speech recognition solutions for the benefit of mobile professionals, small and large businesses, and contact centers around the world.
