That’s what Jessica Alba’s company, Honest Co., is facing right now as dissatisfied customers join together to sue the company for false advertising. \nHonest brands itself as a natural company, and carries a line home products including hand soap, diapers, and even sunscreen. This latter product has gotten some criticism for not actually working, as customers have started posting pictures on the internet of the sunburns they got while wearing Honest Sunscreen. \nThe suit refers to the sunscreen complaints, and points a finger at four other products in the Honest line for being “deceptively and misleadingly labeled,” according to Business Insider . The sunscreen, states the suit, was “was ineffective in preventing unhealthy exposure to harmful UV rays.\" \nThe effectiveness of the products is not the only thing in question in this lawsuit, though. The company is also under fire for labeling itself as natural, when in fact its products use unnatural ingredients. The suit claims that Honest is selling its products at a 10 to 20 percent markup thanks to their marketing themselves as “natural.” \nThe plaintiff in the suit, Jonathan D. Rubin, then goes on to point out synthetic preservatives used in the line, including Methylisothiazolinone and Phenoxyethanol. Natural products, according to Rubin, should contain no artificial ingredients. \nThe lawsuit states: “Honest deceives and misleads consumers by labeling and marketing its Products as ‘natural’ where many of the Products, including Honest Hand Soap, Honest Dish Soap, Honest Diapers, and Honest Multi-Surface Cleaner, are made with unnatural ingredients.” \nHonest Co. has recently raised $100 million in funding, giving it an overall value of $1.7 billion. The company is now seeking even more funding, which would push its value up to $2 billion. This lawsuit will likely not even make a dent in the company’s image.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T09:39:58.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
