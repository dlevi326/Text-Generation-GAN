Channel 8 is expected to be restored for DirecTV customers before the Chargers preseason finale, he said. Kickoff is at 7 p.m.\nAsked about viewer reaction to the dispute, Nevin said, \"I think people were frustrated. Twenty one days is a long time to be without something you grew up with.\"\nThe agreement means that DirecTV's roughly 150,000 subscribers in San Diego County can watch Chargers games this season. Channel 8, the local CBS affiliate, has local broadcast rights to 14 of the Chargers' 16 regular season contests. \nMike Freeman   More from Mike Freeman ViaSat looks to offer in-flight Wi-Fi to Boeing customers Qualcomm cuts 1,314 jobs in San Diego San Diego's HouseCall raises $6 million Michael Gehlken  More from Michael Gehlken Chargers notes: Result trumps record, coach misses game Gordon a bright spot in Chargers loss Chargers out-bungle the Bengals in loss", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:13:02.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
