Jive Software , Inc. (Nasdaq: JIVE ), the world's leading provider of modern communications and collaboration solutions for business, today announced that Sysomos , a leading social intelligence company, selected the Jive-n solution to help increase employee engagement across its rapidly growing global workforce. The company's new interactive intranet will empower executives and co-workers to more effectively share knowledge and promote best practices. After spinning off from its parent company earlier this year, Sysomos focused on establishing its own distinct culture and internal communications cadence in preparation for aggressive growth. Employees were drowning in email and the company knew this challenge would only intensify as it doubled headcount and expanded its global footprint to offices in ten cities across six countries. After reviewing several social intranet solutions, Sysomos selected Jive-n to offer employees a central place where they could store documents and communicate efficiently between groups and across time zones. \"Our mission is to help businesses understand and engage with their customers online. To accomplish this, it's critical that we help our employees engage with each other more easily,\" said Amber Naslund , senior vice president of marketing at Sysomos. \"Our Jive-n intranet is helping us move beyond basic email with intuitive, enterprise-grade communications and collaboration. As a SaaS company ourselves, we appreciate Jive's robust security and extensibility, as well as its document management, ideation and mobile capabilities.\" Sysomos recently acquired another technology vendor, Expion, and will use Jive-n to help promote alignment and a unified culture across the newly integrated company through open, transparent internal communications. The interactive intranet helps employees easily collaborate on documents, share discussions and ideas, and answer each others' questions via desktop or mobile devices. In addition, Jive-n brings together the organization's tribal knowledge and key documents regarding product development, competitive intelligence, marketing collateral and sales enablement into one location where anyone can easily find information they need. SocialEdge, a Jive consulting partner, designed and implemented Sysomos' cloud-based intranet, successfully rolling out Jive-n to the company's employees worldwide this spring. In just its first few months, the internal community has achieved 85 percent adoption and employee interactions have quadrupled. Later this year, Sysomos plans to integrate Jive-n with Google Apps, Okta, JIRA and Confluence in order to establish the intranet as the central hub for all of the organization's collaboration needs. \"We see a lot of hyper-growth companies like Sysomos pushing the boundaries of what's possible in their own industries and needing cohesive communications and collaboration tools to maintain agility as they expand organically and through acquisitions,\" said Robert Block , chief customer success officer at Jive Software. \"Sysomos is an innovative business that is unlocking tremendous value by leveraging a modern interactive intranet to both accelerate ideation around its product direction, and promote human connections amongst employees.\" Sysomos is the social intelligence company backed by data science that gives businesses immediate context to the hundreds of millions of conversations happening online every day. More than 1,400 brands and agencies, including 80 percent of the most valuable global brands, as ranked by Interbrand, trust Sysomos for their social intelligence. Sysomos is one of several technology businesses that use Jive to accelerate product development, increase sales, align global employees and demonstrate thought leadership. Companies like Akamai, EMC, FICO, GoDaddy, Hitachi Data Systems, Nuance, Okta, Tableau and Toshiba turn to Jive's internal and external communities to power more effective knowledge sharing, customer support, and sales, channel, developer and partner enablement.
