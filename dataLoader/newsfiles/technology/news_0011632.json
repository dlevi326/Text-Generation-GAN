Well, other than extending the expiration date, nothing has changed. There is no metal chip embedded on the front as you and other articles have advised. So where does this leave me? â€” Dean Fritzler, Lakewood\nA: Chip cards, with the shiny chip on it, have been rolling out slowly to U.S. consumers before the Oct. 1 deadline. The chip adds security to verify users are who they say they are.\nBut because of the expense of adding a chip to a card, most banks are waiting to issue new chip cards after existing ones expire. In your case, call the bank and ask for the chip card, which is also called an EM card for Europay, MasterCard and Visa.\nWhy would you want one? To fight fraud. If you use the chip card at a merchant with a special new reader, the chip, which has dynamic information on it, talks to the card reader to authenticate the card. Magnetic strips, on the other hand, are static so they can be copied to make fake credit cards.\nOn Oct. 1, merchants that haven't upgraded to new card readers will be liable for fraudulent purchases made with fake credit cards. But you might have noticed that few merchants have the new readers or use them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T15:23:29.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
