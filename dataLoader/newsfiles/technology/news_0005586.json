This app store would come installed on new smartphones made for the Chinese market that run on Google's licensed version of Android, the people said.\nOne of the people said Google hopes the new phones will be available by the end of the year, though it isn't clear if the company will hit that target. Google needs licenses from the Chinese government and it isn't known whether those have been approved, the people said.\nGoogle abruptly ceased most operations in mainland China in 2010 following cyberattacks against Gmail users and disagreements with the government over censorship of search results. At the time, there was debate within the company about whether Google could exert more influence by staying in China. Since then, China has become the world's largest smartphone market, and Google rival Apple Inc. is a leading player there.\nGoogle co-founder Sergey Brin was among the most outspoken critics of China's government in 2010. But Mr. Brin recently stepped back from day-to-day operations, as Product Chief Sundar Pichai took on more responsibility, ahead of becoming Google's chief executive later this year. Last year, Mr. Pichai said the company was \"committed to serving the [Chinese] market the best we can.\"\nGoogle's plans were earlier reported by technology website The Information.\nGoogle's Android operating system is the world's most popular for smartphones. But the Google-licensed version of Android isn't available in China. That has opened the door for Chinese phone makers such as Xiaomi Inc. and OnePlus to create their own versions of Android and others, such as Baidu Inc., to create their own app stores, which don't provide any revenue to Google.\nSimilarly, other Google services, including search and Gmail, aren't available in China.\nHiroshi Lockheimer, the head of Android, met recently in Beijing with Hugo Barra, a former Android executive who is a top executive at Xiaomi, according to a picture Mr. Barra posted on his Facebook account last week.\nGetting a version of the Play store on Google-approved Android phones in China would help the company better control the operating system and generate revenue from apps.\nSome Android phone makers are eager to sell devices in China that run on Google-licensed Android software. China's Huawei Technologies Co. will launch a new Android phone under Google's Nexus brand in the U.S. in coming weeks, raising expectations that it may also make an Android phone compatible with a new Play store for China. A Huawei spokeswoman said late last year that the entry of a major industry player like Google would benefit Chinese smartphone users. A spokesman for the company in the U.S. declined to comment Friday. A message left with the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., also wasn't returned.\n\"I would be surprised if Google bent a knee to China and acquiesced to material government censorship,\" said Carlos Kirjner, an analyst at Bernstein Research. He said Google hopes to \"prevent, delay or limit\" alternative versions of Android in China.\nThat will be an uphill battle because Chinese companies like Qihoo 360 Technology Co., search-engine Baidu and social-networking company Tencent Holdings Ltd. have their own app stores and services that already attach to mobile devices in the country, Mr. Kirjner added.\nLong-term, Google hopes to resume services such as search and Gmail for Android devices in China. That is more sensitive because it would likely require storing user data in China and giving the government a way to monitor information. That would represent a major about-face by Google on issues of censorship and data privacy and isn't part of the current plan, a person familiar with the situation said.\nOnce a Google Play store and official Android phones are in China, Google will use that to push for more of its services to be unblocked in the country, one of the other people said.\nWrite to Alistair Barr at alistair.barr@wsj.com\n 04, 2015 19:19 ET (23:19 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T03:06:32.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
