Closing in on Einstein's window to the universe August 1, 2013 \n(Phys.org) —Nearly a century after the world's greatest physicist, Albert Einstein, first predicted the existence of gravitational waves, a global network of gravitational wave observatories has moved a step closer to detecting ... Tabletop experiment could detect gravitational waves November 28, 2014 \n(Phys.org)—A coin-sized detector might observe gravitational waves before the giant Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), according to two Australian physicists. Eliminating terrestrial noise sources to improve the LIGO gravity wave detectors June 8, 2015 \nIn their search for gravitational waves—stretches in space-time produced by dramatically violent events in the distant universe—researchers at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) have created ... Improved sensors help navigate gravity waves June 26, 2015 \nEfforts to detect gravitational waves—which were first predicted by Albert Einstein nearly 100 years ago—are advancing with international researchers including UWA researchers boosting the sensitivity of wave detectors. Dense star clusters shown to be binary black hole factories July 29, 2015 \nThe coalescence of two black holes—a very violent and exotic event—is one of the most sought-after observations of modern astronomy. But, as these mergers emit no light of any kind, finding such elusive events has been ... Five myths about gravitational waves September 7, 2015 \nThe scientists behind the BICEP2 (Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization) telescope, last year made an extraordinary claim that they had detected gravitational waves, which are ripples in space-time. Initially ...

One big step for man as astronaut controls robot from ISS September 8, 2015 \nEuropean experts have pulled off a major advance that might one day help build new worlds in space after an astronaut in the International Space Station remotely guided a robot on Earth by feel. Surprising giant ring-like structure in the universe September 7, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—Five billion light years is a distance almost inconceivable, even on a cosmic scale. To better illustrate the extent of this physical quantity, it's enough to say that 35,000 galaxies the size of our Milky Way ... Astronomers detect the farthest galaxy yet with Keck telescope September 4, 2015 \nA team of Caltech researchers that has spent years searching for the earliest objects in the universe now reports the detection of what may be the most distant galaxy ever found.
