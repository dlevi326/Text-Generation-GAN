WORTH, Texas, Sept. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Galenfeha, Inc., (OTC: GLFH) introduced the company's iWaV intelligent injection control system at the recent West Texas Oilfield show in San Antonio, Texas, to resounding approval from the attendees. \nGalenfeha's iWaV system is an innovative and exclusive product, capable of revolutionizing the oil and gas chemical injection marketplace. Well location chemical maintenance is a costly, labor intensive, and sometimes dangerous necessity. The iWaV system seamlessly interfaces with existing SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquistion) infrastructure to completely automate the process on both solar/electric as well as pneumatic driven systems. Galenfeha's new iWaV system allows the operator to regulate all aspects of chemical titration remotely, eliminating travel to well sites. This complete control, combined with an attractive price point, makes the iWaV system an asset to any customer. \nLucien Marioneaux, Jr., Galenfeha, Inc. President/CEO commented, \"We are proud to introduce Galenfeha's groundbreaking iWaV system. This new development demonstrates our company's commitment to provide the oil and gas industry with state-of-the-art and environmentally conscious products.\" \nAbout Galenfeha, Inc. \nGalenfeha (OTC:GLFH) is a design, engineering, and manufacturing firm with a focus on stored energy solutions with low environmental impact.
