In April, Intuitive Surgical reached out to the facilities that hadn’t upgraded to newer models and let them know the S would be discontinued in December 2017 after more than a decade of availability.\nJustin Higgs, senior manager of public relations at Intuitive Surgical, explained that, in the last decade, advancements have been made in minimally invasive robotic surgery this system wasn’t designed to accommodate. Between now and the end of December 2017, facilities can upgrade to a newer model, or purchase instruments for future replacement. This should be enough time for facilities to prepare for a transition, Higgs noted.\n“With over 3,400 da Vinci Surgical Systems in use worldwide, Intuitive Surgical remains fully committed to supporting surgeons who provide robotic-assisted surgery options to patients,” Higgs added, pointing to the company’s history. The first of four da Vinci Surgical Systems was launched in 1999 and received FDA clearance in 2000. In 2006, the da Vinci S was launched, followed by the da Vinci Si in 2009 and the da Vinci Xi in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T11:44:51.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
