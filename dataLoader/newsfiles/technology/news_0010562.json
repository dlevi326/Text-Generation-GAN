The C2B business model completely transposes the traditional business-to-consumer (B2C) model, where a business produces product and then looks to market and build consumer demand. In this case, consumer demand dictates supply quantity and price directly from the manufacturer. \nAccording to Bruce, it’s all about cutting out the go-between while the manufacturer is still able to create mass quantities at mass quantity prices. \nConsumers create their own wish list of items -- or search from tens of millions of catalogs from Alibaba’s global factories, and are notified when the deal is in-effect. See something you want? Wish for it on WUSIC. Share and spread the wish via social media to “rock” for mass savings. Once a wish list for a specific product hits the minimum quantity required by manufacturers, WUSIC goes straight to the manufacturer to work out a deal at incredible prices. \nGetting Back 1% \nFor additional savings, consumers have the option of sharing their referral code to earn a 1% kickback from WUSIC on all future purchases. These credits can then be used on their own future purchases. \nLatest ibattz iPhone 6/6S battery cases promotion on WUSIC \nGetting cool gadgets through WUSIC is easy -- and you can get a FREE ibattz iPhone 6/6S battery case, too!
