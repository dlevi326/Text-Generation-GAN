Each offers the S&P 500 Â® without exposure to a sector: energy, financials, technology or health care. \n\"S&P 500 ETFs force you to invest in a sector you might already have a desired level of exposure to or you may want to avoid,\" said Michael L. Sapir, co-founder and CEO of ProShare Advisors, LLC, the advisor to ProShares. \"Now, for the first time, you can invest in an S&P 500 ETF and leave behind the sector you don't want.\" \nProShares S&P 500 Ex-Sector ETFs allow investors to reduce or eliminate exposure to a sector they believe may underperform. For example, over the 12 months through the end of August, the energy sector underperformed the S&P 500 by over 30 percentage points. 1 Alternatively, an investor might already have enough exposure to a sector through work or other holdings and can use these ETFs to avoid that sector. \nProShares S&P 500 Ex-Sector ETFs include: S&P 500 Ex-Energy Index S&P 500 Ex-Financials Index S&P 500 Ex-Health Care Index S&P 500 Ex-Information Technology & Telecommunication Services Index \nAbout the Indexes: \nEach S&P 500 Ex-Sector Index seeks to provide exposure to the companies of the S&P 500 except those in the specific sector excluded. The S&P 500 is a measure of large-cap U.S. stock market performance. It is a float-adjusted, market capitalization-weighted index of 500 U.S. operating companies and real estate investment trusts selected through a process that factors in criteria such as liquidity, price, market capitalization and financial viability. \nThe indexes market-cap weight each component security according to the same rules as the S&P 500. They classify each company in the S&P 500 using S&P's Global Industry Classification Standards (\"S&P GICS\"). The following sectors are included within S&P GICS: consumer discretionary, consumer staples, energy, financials, health care, industrials, information technology, materials, telecommunication services and utilities. The portion represented by the excluded sector is redistributed among remaining S&P 500 companies on a pro rata basis. \nAbout ProShares \nProShares helps investors to go beyond the limitations of conventional investing and face today's market challenges.
