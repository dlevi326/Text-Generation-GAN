The new Marketplace called Pink & Press appeals to the feminine only market offering a variety of premium theme choices. Customers will be backed by the Pink & Press Promise that assures the quality code and support of each theme made available.\nThe Pink & Press mission is to:\n1. Make the Internet Beautiful one website at a time by creating and providing beautiful feminine WordPress themes that you can trust and are easy to get up and going.\n2. Equip women with the tools to actually have a more beautiful website and ultimately a successful business.\n3. Help women achieve their dreams by showing them that it is possible to do what they love, have a beautiful website, and help them over that hurdle where most tend to give up.\nLauren set out on a mission to solve a problem that so many small business owners are experiencing with the lack of site theme support by the developer and a good approach to feminine quality design.\n“With the growth in the online world, and WordPress more specifically, there has been an influx in themes that have appeared all over places like Creative Market, Etsy, and the like... but with that comes a lot of unknowns... so the negative in that is that buyers begin unknowingly buying child themes that are poorly coded, less than quality, and end up not getting the support they need to get their website up like they had hoped.”\nVisitors can now come to one central hub location in the WordPress world for feminine only themes created by accredited, proven, and trusted developers.\n“This is a place that anyone can go and purchase a beautiful feminine WordPress theme that is coded to the latest coding standards by developers that have been doing this for many years. It's also a place where you know the customer support is there when you need it! We even created the Pink & Press Promise that all our developers will adhere to, so that you know exactly what you're buying!”\nVisitors can visit the Pink & Press marketplace worldwide at www.pinkandpress.com\nMedia Contact: Lauren Gaige - hello@pinkandpress.com\nAbout Restored 316 LLC\nRestored 316 is a service site owned and operated by Lauren Gaige and is the founder of Pink & Press.
