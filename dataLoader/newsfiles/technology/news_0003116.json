It said it aims to hit monthly positive operating profit and cash flow by the end of 2018.\nThe initial public offering (IPO) will allow Deezer to expand its offering, \"drive deeper distribution through our telecom and manufacturer partnerships\" and improve its product and content, Chief Executive Hans-Holger Albrecht said.\nDeezer's largest shareholder is tycoon Len Blavatnik's Access Industries, and three music labels - Access' Warner Music, Sony Music, and Universal Music - own around 15 percent of the shares.\nAlbrecht said none of the current shareholders would sell their stakes in the IPO, adding that the proceeds would largely go towards investing in its distribution and sales network in the next two years.
