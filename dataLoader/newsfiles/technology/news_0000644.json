But it's the automation of production lines which is driving productivity processes and making 'made in Japan' popular again. Bloomberg by Kana Inagaki After decades of pursuing cheaper manufacturing overseas, \"made in Japan\" products - from Honda scooters and Panasonic microwaves to Canon cameras - are back in the vogue thanks to the weaker yen.\nBut reshoring (in effect, reversing years of offshoring manufacturing) this time around is more about robots than human jobs and bigger factories - a far cry from the multibillion-dollar investments of the mid-2000s that soured in the wake of the global financial crisis. Expansion is also largely aimed at serving the domestic market, rather than making goods for export.\nThus what is good for Japan Inc is less likely to feed through to the broader economy and instead, with more robots manning the production lines, prolong the blocked transmission between a tight labour market and higher wages.\nTake Canon - it aims to fully automate the production of digital cameras by 2018 to lift its domestic production ratio to 60 per cent, from 43 per cent last year. It also plans to invest $110m in a technology development facility in Oita prefecture of southwestern Japan.\nThe installation of more robots at its factories will allow Canon to lower manufacturing costs, while addressing the deepening labour shortage in Japan. Officials insist, however, that employment levels will be maintained by shifting workers to roles that cannot be replaced by machines.\n\"Automation is positively affecting the return to domestic production and it will help to offset the demerits of Japanese manufacturing [such as higher labour costs],\" says Yoshiyuki Fukuda, senior economist at Tokyo-based think-tank Toray Corporate Business Research.\nThe tilt towards domestic production comes three years after the yen started its decline on the back of prime minister Shinzo Abe's bid to reflate the economy through massive monetary easing. The weaker yen has driven the profits of many companies to record highs.\nThe latest survey by the Development Bank of Japan also showed that major Japanese groups are planning to increase domestic capital spending 13.9 per cent from a year earlier, in the financial year ending March 2016. That compares with a rise of 5.8 per cent on overseas spending.\n The lower manufacturing costs in Japan also coincide with rising labour costs in China and other emerging markets where Japanese companies have historically shifted their production in the strong yen era.\nIn another tailwind, the value of \"made in Japan\" watches and other goods has been buoyed by the influx of tourists from China and other parts of the world. To meet strong inbound demand, Casio, maker of the G-Shock watch, increased production of luxury watches at its plant in Yamagata, northern Japan last month, by 60 per cent from a year earlier.\n\"We're promoting 'Made in Japan' and 'Made in Yamagata' since people from other countries find value in these labels,\" Casio says.\nIn spite of increasing chatter of \"reshoring\", most of the action, however, has been limited to locally manufacturing goods that will be sold in the Japanese market rather than importing them from overseas. Panasonic, for example, is shifting production of some microwaves and air cleaners from China to Japan.\nMizuho Securities estimates that a switch to domestic production for imported goods targeting Japanese consumers could still lift Japan's overall industrial production by up to 3 per cent. Mr Fukuda further projects that if 30 per cent of machinery products manufactured in Asia shift to domestic production, that could create 90,000 jobs, although the actual figure could be smaller with the use of more robots.\nLast week Honda shifted production of smaller-sized motorcycles intended for the Japanese market from China to a domestic plant, restoring an idled production line in southwestern Japan. By bringing manufacturing back to Japan from China and Vietnam, it plans to raise the domestic production ratio of these motorcycles from 10 per cent to 80 per cent.\nBut Honda's move highlights a deeper problem of weak demand. Its Kuma-moto plant was intended to produce 500,000 motorcycles a year. In reality, annual production is stalled at 140,000 units. Even by shifting production from China and Vietnam, the boosted annual capacity will still be half its initial target.\nCompanies such as Toyota have also been reluctant to increase capacity in Japan due to bitter memories of the previous cycle of yen depreciation a decade ago. From the early to mid-2000s, car and electronics makers such as Sharp and Panasonic built expensive new factories in Japan that turned into massive financial burdens when the yen surged in the wake of the global financial crisis. Less than 10 per cent of the country's manufacturers have plans to shift production to Japan from overseas for the current fiscal year according to the Development Bank of Japan survey published in August.\n\"If Toyota decides to increase domestic production, that will only come if global auto demand increases and its overseas plants reach full capacity. Ultimately, it will depend on the growth of the global economy,\" said Tomochika Kitaoka, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.\nThat global outlook has appeared uncertain with Japanese exports remaining mostly flat in recent months due to the economic slowdown in China and emerging markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:07:42.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
