Its defenders believe it allows users a choice and protects their privacy. Opponents say Apple is enabling theft that will lead to a loss of writing jobs at small media companies desperate for any revenue they can get. \nAnother argument I've heard put forward by opponents is that Apple should allow people to go into its local retail Apple stores and steal products to make things even, as Dan Primack of Fortune suggested tongue-in-cheek in an article entitled, \" Dear Apple: I may rob your store. \" I saw a few people retweeting it with intros like, \"Oh, this is clever\" or \"neat argument.\" Over the weekend, I heard Jay Yarow use essentially the same logic in his podcast against ad blocking , saying it was akin to him going into Duane Read and wanting to pay a quarter for a Gatorade instead of $2.50. \nBut these analogies are weak and don't represent what's really happening. Both of these \"clever\" arguments equate the advertising sales model with commercial business models. But the reality is, they are entirely different. \nApple has not promoted some new technology that allows you to buy a Gatorade from Amazon ( AMZN ) for a quarter when it normally sells for $2.50. It is deploying a technology that lets you ignore something you never had to pay for previously, namely ads. \nMust Read: Will the Apple App Store Hack Hurt Its Stock? \nA better analogy may be Tesla ( TSLA ) using a new kind of dashboard glass that allows you to selectively blur out billboards as you drive by them. Sellers of billboard ads would be outraged. \nThey might say: \"How can you take away the essential service we provide, letting drivers rest their weary eyes for a couple of seconds on our ads? This is tragic because there are a lot of small little billboard ad companies out there who aren't behemoths. What's going to happen to the people that work at those companies? They might lose their jobs.\" \nBut if the technology existed and enough car buyers were willing to pay Tesla for that technology, guess what -- Tesla would sell it. Is it Tesla's fault that its technology might put small billboard ad companies out of business? No doubt some billboard companies employ writers to come up with the snappy slogans on their signs. What if the well-meaning writers who think up mottos like \"Savannah: A Nice Place to Raise a Family\" lost their jobs because of this technological innovation? \nQuite simply, this is natural creative destruction of the business world in action. It's not the fault of Henry Ford that he put horse-sellers out of business. Nor is the fault of the creator of DVR technology that broadcast TV revenue has stagnated for a decade. I'm sure many hard-working people ended up losing their jobs through no fault of their own. They ended up finding new jobs or starting entirely new companies. \nIf a small website is going to go out of business because of ad blocking, they will figure out a better way to get their content to users -- if that content is truly desired by those users. If there's a market for it, a business model will be found. It just won't be the old business model based on ads. The world will keep turning. \nThis article is commentary by an independent contributor. At the time of publication, the author held no positions in the stocks mentioned.
