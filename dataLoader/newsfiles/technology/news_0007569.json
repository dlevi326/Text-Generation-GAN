Pokemon Go uses characters from the popular children’s card game, animation and videogame series in an augmented-reality setting similar to Niantic’s +Ingress game.\nNiantic, a startup that announced its split from Google on Aug. 13, said +Ingress has been downloaded more than 12 million times and attracted more than 250,000 people to live events around the world, according to the company’s website.\nPokemon Go will be available on Apple Inc. iPhones and Google Android devices. Users can hold up their smartphone camera in a public place to “see” game characters placed around the landscape by the game, according a video demonstration on the company’s website.\nA wristband also notifies users of the presence of characters by vibrating or lighting up. Players can collaborate with other users in the same location to battle the virtual-reality monsters.\nNintendo has yet to announce how or when it will use its best-known videogame characters including Mario and Zelda in smartphone games, after announcing a partnership with mobile system operator DeNA Co. earlier this year.\nNintendo’s mobile games will generate about 6 billion yen ($49.7 million) in profit this fiscal year and 10 times that in the next, Eiji Maeda, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., estimates.\nThe company resisted turning to smartphones for years, saying its games were designed for its own machines , where players can use a joystick and physical buttons to move through the virtual world.", "external_links": ["http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-go/\\"], "published": "2015-09-10T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T12:08:48.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
