The leading domestic hunger-relief organization will launch Spoontember (TM), a social media activation encouraging those to join the effort to support the fight to end hunger in America. Spoontember supporters can share a ‘spoon selfie’ – an image of themselves balancing a spoon on their nose – along with hunger-related statistics and challenge a friend to do the same.\nThe spoon is a utensil that is most often used to prepare and provide food for others. Feeding America hopes the Spoontember social activation will help the public actively engage in spreading domestic hunger awareness and take steps to support the 1 in 6 Americans who struggles with the issue.\nIt’s easy to share a ‘spoon selfie’ and support Hunger Action Month:\nGrab a spoon Do your best to balance it on your nose Take a picture of your ‘spoon selfie’ Post the image to your social media accounts to raise awareness and tag a friend to do the same: -I’m taking a spoon selfie to raise awareness for the 1 in 6 Americans struggling with hunger. I challenge (name) to join me! #Spoontember #HungerActionMonth @FeedingAmerica\n-Join me and take a #Spoontember selfie to raise awareness for the 1 in 6 facing hunger! #HungerActionMonth @FeedingAmerica\nUse #Spoontember and #HungerActionMonth to fuel the movement\n“Hunger impacts every community in the United States, which makes it up to every one of us to get involved to support those in our area who are struggling,” said Matt Knott, president of Feeding America. “There are so many ways to join the fight to solve hunger. Simply taking the time to post on behalf of Spoontember can help bring awareness to the 49 million Americans who may not know where they’ll find their next meal.”\nIn addition to posting a ‘spoon selfie’, individuals can help show support for hunger relief and Spoontember by joining the Hunger Action Month Thunderclap, which will launch on September 3 at 12 pm EDT. By visiting the Hunger Action Month Thunderclap page , advocates can ‘donate’ their personal Facebook and Twitter feeds to share a message in tandem with thousands of others in support of Feeding America, Spoontember and the millions of people in America who face hunger.\nTo encourage even more participation in this effort, Feeding America will give people the chance to get their spoon selfie on a billboard in Times Square in New York City. Advocates will be handing out orange spoons on September 3 from 12-2pm ET for passersby to participate in a chance to see themselves on a big screen. Snapchat and Feeding America are also teaming up for one of Snapchat’s first nonprofit partnerships. On Hunger Action Day®, Thursday September 3, users in the Times Square area will be able to access an orange spoon filter from 11am-3pm ET in support of Hunger Action Month.\nHunger Action Month shines a light on the 1 in 6 Americans who face food insecurity and promotes ways for individuals across the country to get involved in the movement to help end hunger. The Feeding America nationwide network of food banks, philanthropic and corporate partners, as well as hunger-relief supporters and advocates across the country will hold events, volunteer and elevate the conversation around solving domestic hunger.\nSpoontember was created by Feeding America in partnership with the Ad Council and advertising agency 360i.
