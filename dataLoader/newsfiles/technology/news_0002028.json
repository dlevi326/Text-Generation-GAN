and perhaps the way it thinks about itself.\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop is in New York over the next week to discuss a new set of aims to replace the expiring millennium development goals (MDGs), which were set in 2000.\nThe new aims, known as the sustainable development goals (SDGs), will guide Australia and other members of the United Nations over the next 15 years.\nThe eight millennium goals - which set time-bound and quantified targets to address extreme poverty and hunger - have had varying degrees of success.\nThe goal to cut infant mortality rates by two-thirds, for instance, was missed by a wide margin, UN reports suggest.\nAn estimated six million newborns, infants and small children have died from preventable causes in the past year - almost half from malnutrition.\nHowever, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has fallen from just under 47 per cent to 22 per cent.\nCelebrities from soccer star David Beckham to singer Beyonce and Olympian Usain Bolt have thrown their weight behind the new goals.\nThis Saturday in New York's Central Park there will be a concert to highlight the goals, featuring Coldplay and Pearl Jam.\nOnline giants such as Google, Yahoo and YouTube will also be involved in their global promotion.\nThe 17 ambitious new goals, which have 169 specific targets, range from ending poverty in all forms to taking urgent action on climate change.\nWhile the millennium goals covered areas such as poverty, hunger, education and health, the SDGs go further to set new goals for economic growth, peace, infrastructure, climate and energy.\nSam Mostyn, from the Australian Council for International Development, said the millennium goals signed by John Howard in 2000 had been helpful in setting out priorities for aid.\nBut the SDGs would help to refocus the public and government on how being a better global citizen cannot only benefit the poorest nations but also improve the way in which Australians think about themselves.\nThe signing of the goals, coupled with the change of leadership in Canberra, provides the opportunity for the Turnbull government to rethink aid budget cuts, Ms Mostyn said.\n\"Any work we do on the reintegration of the aid budget needs to be seen as positive for Australian community and the Australian economy, rather than decoupling it and seeing it as a net cost,\" she told AAP.\nIn December 2014, the Abbott government announced savings of $3.7 billion in the foreign aid program over the next four years to offset spending on defence and national security.\nThe cuts mean Australia's annual aid budget has fallen to $4 billion, down from a peak of $5.6 billion in 2012-13, the Lowy Institute says.\nAustralia's spending of 0.22 per cent of gross national income - a global measure of donor generosity - in 2017-18 will be the lowest level in history and well short of the UN's target of 0.7 per cent for developed nations.\nMs Mostyn said cutting the aid budget to its lowest level ever flew in the face of Ms Bishop and Mr Turnbull wanting Australia to be a \"creative and dynamic nation open to being part of great global shifts\".\nIt could also be woven into the government's plans to improve cities and tackle indigenous health and education.\n\"The language of the SDGs opens up a new conversation about how we set achievable, bold targets ourselves that we can apply in Australia,\" Ms Mostyn said.\nFormer Victorian deputy premier John Thwaites, who is a co-chairman of the UN's Sustainable Development Solutions Network, said it was too early to say whether the SDGs would change the way government thinks.\nBut they were consistent with Mr Turnbull's idea of a \"21st century government\".\n\"Aid spending is an investment by Australia in the future of other countries,\" Mr Thwaites said.\n\"This isn't about charity; it's about mutual benefit.\"\nNew Minister for International Development Steve Ciobo said the signing of the SDGs will \"really build momentum\" towards tackling poverty.\nHowever, he does not expect it to signal a radical departure from the way the government handles aid and development.\n\"They will dovetail very nicely with our emphasis on economic growth, particularly in terms of the private sector investment and trade,\" Mr Ciobo said.\nHe hinted budget changes were unlikely while the government worked to address debt and the deficit.\nBut he said the government would be seeking innovative ways to work with the private sector to enhance the prosperity of the region in a sustainable way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T10:22:56.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
