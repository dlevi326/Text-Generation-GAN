Dreamforce brings together thought leaders and industry pioneers for four high-energy days of fun, inspiration, networking, and giving back. With over 1,500 sessions and thousands of live solutions from the cloud ecosystem, Dreamforce has grown from 1,300 registered attendees in 2003 to 135,000 attendees in 2014, making it the largest nonprofit and higher education technology conference in the world. The Billhighway exhibit booth will be present in the Foundation Zone and provide attendees the opportunity to see firsthand how to facilitate impact and efficiency in their organization with back-office systems automation and integration. The automation and integration whitepaper that debuted at the 2015 ASAE Annual Meeting & Exposition in Detroit will be front and center at Dreamforce. Attendees will have their choice of t-shirt at the exhibit booth depending on how they would identify themselves on the innovation spectrum; are they a dreamer? Or a doer?\nThis year’s conference highlights include:\n Fireside chat with Marc Benioff and Travis Kalanick, Uber Women’s leadership keynote with Susan Wojcicki, YouTube; Jessica Alba, The Honest Company and Gayle King, CBS This Morning Dreamfest and UCSF Benefit featuring 11-time Grammy winners, the Foo Fighters and Gary Clark Jr.\nAs Dreamforce put it, last year was awesome, but the best is yet to come!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:05:44.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
