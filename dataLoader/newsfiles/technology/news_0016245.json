The laboratory mouse through gene modification method will be used for searching TNT explosives. The idea has become a reality in a laboratory in New York. The mice are 500 times greater than normal mice in detecting DNT, the same with TNT, and they are able to alert people the presence of a mine with a fall. A biological Engineer Charlotte D'Hulst at Hunter Institute of Technology in New York said: \"Regardless of how they react, we think we can track their behavior by implanting a microchip in their skin, which can actually transmit their behavior to a computer.\" According to the United Nations, the rat has helped to save people's lives where the mine kills 15,000 to 20,000 people every year. A Belgian non-profit organization has trained a large African kangaroo to find a mine explosion in a few hours, compared with metal detectors which need a few days. However, the kangaroo needs to be trained for 9 months with a banana food reward. \"The transgenic mice can reproduce more quickly and require less training time,\" D'Hulst said. \"The main advantage of this approach is that we will create a super sensitive animal to the genetic DNT, which makes the training speed greatly accelerated. Mice are small, cheap and easy to breed, so it is possible to make more animals work at the same time (about 500).\" Recent research suggests that the rat may fall down when smell TNT. But, regardless of how they react, researchers are expected to use implanted microchip to detect whether rats have found the explosives. D'Hulst and her colleagues still need to test the reaction the rats to DNT in the lab and in the field. But she hopes that if everything goes well, the mice will be able to be used in 5 years.
