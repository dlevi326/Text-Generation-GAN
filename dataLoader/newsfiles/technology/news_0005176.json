This announcement follows news that Macgregor had optimised a mega-ship for container line UASC by equipping the ultra large container ship with a cargo handling system. \nThe ships are under construction at South Korean shipyard Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries.\nThey are planned for delivery between October, 2016 and May, 2017 and will primarily be deployed on South American routes. \n \nTommi Keskilohko, Director at MacGregor's Customer Solutions, said: \"Cargo system flexibility during loading and unloading operations, in combination with attaining a vessel's actual payload capacity, is crucial for maximising a ship's revenue and long-term profitability.\nTo read more about Cargotec in our Supplier Directory, click here\nâ€œSuch efficiency can only be achieved when all parts of a cargo system are designed as one integrated element at an early stage of any newbuiding project, before any restrictive decisions have been made.\n\"MacGregor is pleased to be working together with Hapag-Lloyd and Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries on this new project. In fact, its relatively tight schedule would not have been feasible without this forward-thinking approach and seamless cooperation between all parties.\"\n \nThe optimised MacGregor cargo handling system for each new vessel will comprise hatch covers, lashing bridges, a loose lashing system and container fittings, along with related software and a lifecycle support package.\nFor all the latest on Macgregor, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T19:03:39.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
