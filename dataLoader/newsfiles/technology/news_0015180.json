The annual holiday showcase, dedicated to previewing consumer electronics for the upcoming holiday season, will take place from 6–9 p.m. on September 30 at the Metropolitan Pavilion, 125 West 18th Street in New York City.\nA Trio of Sound Holiday Choices\nVXi will highlight three recent innovations at the event. The just-released BlueParrott Point is the solution for users who insist on a more compact form factor, but have been dissatisfied with the sound quality of typical small Bluetooth headsets. Stylishly small and comfortably light, the Point employs VXi’s advanced technologies to deliver natural, highly intelligible sound quality as well as remarkably effective (82%) microphone noise canceling.\nThe BlueParrott Reveal features an extendable microphone boom, giving users unprecedented noise canceling flexibility. When ambient noise is low, leave the boom retracted. When life gets loud, slide the boom out, and enjoy a 90% reduction in unwanted background noise.\nThe customizable BlueParrott B350-XT is the only Bluetooth headset that offers its combination of 96% noise canceling and excellent intelligibility, to ensure that users are both heard and understood—even in the noisiest environments. The B350-XT also features a full 24 hours of talk time, on a single charge. But what really sets the B350-XT apart is its exclusive Parrott Button, which can be easily customized on the go to perform a range of functions.\n“We’re excited to be a part of the Pepcom Holiday Spectacular! this year,” said Mike Ferguson, president and CEO of VXi. “With 300-400 journalists and analysts expected to attend, it’s a great opportunity for us to spread the word about how effectively our products perform, and how much better they sound than anything else on the market.”\nAbout VXi Corporation\nVXi provides the best-performing headsets, telecommunications and speech recognition solutions for the benefit of mobile professionals, small and large businesses, and contact centers around the world.
