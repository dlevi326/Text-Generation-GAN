The updated report comes four years after the Energy Department's original Quadrennial Technology Review, issued in 2011 . \n\" The last four years have been defined by dramatic change in the nation’s energy landscape. \" Huge growth in domestic production of oil and natural gas has made the U.S. the world leader in combined oil and natural gas production for the last three consecutive years. Wind energy capacity has increased by 65 percent and wind energy generation has nearly doubled; solar capacity has increased 9 fold and solar photovoltaic generation over tenfold; old, inefficient power plants are being replaced by cleaner, more efficient ones; transportation efficiencies continue to improve. \n's view of \"the most promising research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RDD&D) opportunities across energy technologies to effectively address the nation's energy needs. Specifically, this analysis identifies the important technology RDD&D opportunities across energy supply and end use in working toward a clean energy economy in the United States.\" Individual chapters focus on specific technology types, including grid modernization, clean power, buildings, manufacturing, fuels, and transportation. ’s energy needs is increasing, creating a more dependable and flexible energy system for consumers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T23:56:26.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
