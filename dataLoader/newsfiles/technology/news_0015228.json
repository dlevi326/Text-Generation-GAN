One of this company's direct competitors, AppMachine, was just valued at $40 Million and purchased by HostGator (2015); however, this company beats AppMachine in virtually every metric across the board. The company has also integrated an AdNetwork into the system, which helps provide a healthy bottom line to the owners. This innovative tech company has created a massive Internet following since 2012 and is accelerating at an impressive growth rate. The core competency for the business is a proprietary, cloud-based Do It Yourself Mobile Application Builder, primarily targeted to Small and Medium Sized Businesses. Finding widespread acknowledgement from worldwide press in places like Mashable, TechCrunch, GigaOM, SourcingLine and VentureBeat, the company has built over 85,000 mobile apps and attracted over 100,000 registered users in its first year of operations � and those numbers continue to grow rapidly. SMEs find this opportunity particularly attractive to reach out to new customers as well as to engage with existing clientele in a forum other than their branded website. With this business model, no installation or download takes place � users simply drag and drop app pages to create a mobile app online. Once the app is built, the result is an HTML5 hybrid app that works on Android, iPhone, iPad, Windows 8, BlackBerry 10 and Kindle Fire. The company launched out of beta version of its WYSIWYG mobile app creation service in April 2013 with the mission of allowing users with no programming experience the opportunity to quickly build iOS and Android applications. The company also has a marketplace to showcase the apps created using the platform. The company has monetized via a mixed model, including subscription, reseller and custom development.
