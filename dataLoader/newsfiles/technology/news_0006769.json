This is PixCell8’s second mobile device app, joining the company’s previously launched iOS app carried on iTunes. The Android app will broaden the company’s reach in the crowdsourcing stock photo marketplace, particularly in non-United States markets where Android devices have a significantly larger marketshare compared to iOS devices.\n“We are excited to introduce an app that will allow a greater number of mobile photographers around the world the ability to capture interesting images on the go, then quickly upload them to the PixCell8 website”, stated Adam Minic, PixCell8 Partner and the company’s head of technology development. Minic continued, “The efficiency of our Android app streamlines the traditional process of populating images to a central stock photo site by removing the requirement of a personal computer as part of the process.”\nPixCell8 projects the app to increase image uploads by 300% over the past six-month run rate of its iOS app due to the popularity of Android devices. “This is a natural evolutionary step for PixCell8 to venture into the Google Play Store and offer a free product to the mobile photography communities”, remarked PixCell8 Co-Founder, Kris Jonas. “We are forecasting a substantial increase in image uploads over the next few months; and that, of course, will correspondingly increase image sales to buyers of stock photography.”\nAbout PixCell8\nWith the invention of new technologies like smartphone cameras, the world has become increasingly image-driven. This has created a new marketplace where the average individual can sell their photos to professional businesses in need of natural-looking images. PixCell8 is revolutionizing this process by the introduction of a website ( www.PixCell8.com ) and smart phone applications. PixCell8 has created an online marketplace where users can upload images, sell them to any company, and receive a sizable royalty off of their natural-looking stock images. iPhone and Android mobile device users join the site for free and upload images (either through the site or app) for buyers to purchase.\n1. Buyers make a purchase and the selling price is split between PixCell8, the photographer, and a non-profit organization.\n2. The result is discounted, reasonably priced photos and stock photography for small and large business, as well as a fair commission for photographers.\nWho will benefit from PixCell8?\nBusinesses of all sizes looking for natural and copyright free stock images are what drives PixCell8. Copyright infringement of images is an ever-growing problem worldwide, and audiences today are savvy enough to notice an artificial-looking subject or models in stock images purchased from the large commercial stock photography sites. That’s where PixCell8 fills a need. PixCell8 is a great alternative in that the images available reflect realistic-looking subjects, people, etc. in authentic settings at a very low price per image. PixCell8’s website and app is 100% free to use, thus reducing any risk to clients or buyers. Images cost buyers $20, so they get a fair price for stock images with unlimited license use, and the sellers receive almost half of the purchase price. PixCell8 is also unique in that each image sale will generate a $4 donation to a fully vetted non-profit organization listed on the PixCell8 site.\nContact: Chris Barber, Founder | P: 1+323-761-9781 |\nSource: PixCell8 LLC | http://www.PixCell8.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T23:21:05.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
