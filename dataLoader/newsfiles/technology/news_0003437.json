(“MACOM”) (NASDAQ: MTSI), a leading supplier of high-performance analog RF, microwave, millimeterwave and photonic semiconductor products, today announced the new wideband MAOM-003427, a quad channel linear modulator driver with 46 Gbaud capability to support next generation 200G and 400G applications. This latest addition to MACOM’s extensive portfolio of driver solutions for optical infrastructure enables system designers to address higher baud rate applications with lower cost surface mount technology. \nMACOM has been a pioneer of surface mount technology in high-speed optical communications with the introduction of the industry’s first quad-channel surface mount drivers in 2013. To date, surface mount packaging has been used extensively in 100G and 200G systems operating at 32 Gbaud while higher baud rate systems have required more expensive “gold box” style packages. The MAOM-003427 changes that by offering equivalent performance in a surface mount package, enabling lower cost and smaller form factor solutions. \nThe MAOM-003427 is distinguished by its wide bandwidth, low power dissipation and excellent linearity, which support the implementation of higher order modulation schemes at baud rates up to 46 Gbaud. This driver is pin compatible with MACOM’s existing 32Gbaud surface mount solutions (MAOM-003405 and MAOM-003407), offering designers an easy upgrade path. \n“I am very proud to announce another first for MACOM in the optical industry,” said Ray Moroney, Director of Product Marketing, High-Performance Analog, MACOM. “The MAOM-003427 demonstrates MACOM’s commitment to meeting the needs of our customers with truly innovative solutions.” \nMACOM’s MAOM-003427 modulator driver is sampling to customers now. MACOM will be present at ECOC 2015 for meetings with customers, partners, press and analysts in Meeting Room M8 at the Fiera Valencia, in Valencia, Spain, from September 28 th -30 th .
