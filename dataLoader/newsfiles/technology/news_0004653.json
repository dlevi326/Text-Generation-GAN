OnePlus has started rolling out an incremental update for its 2016 flagship-killer smartphone in the form of OxygenOS 2.1.0, which bundles a bunch of fixes and system improvements. It addresses the most frequent issues users have reported, including a problem with third-party apps and support for raw image format. \nEven though raw support is enabled in the update, it might require another update for the image format to work properly with third-party apps. As of now FV-5 2.75 will work but not 2.77. \nDownload the new OxygenOS update on your OnePlus 2 and post feedback in the forum ,as the company says: \"Your feedback is appreciated as always, we may not always respond in the forums but please be assured that we do look over your comments and feedback often. Hope you enjoy!\" \nOfficial changelog Manual mode has been added for all photography enthusiasts. Hope this will give you more control for capturing that perfect moment Raw support is now enabled for 3rd party camera apps that support this format There's a new colour balance slider in Display for adjusting the colour tone of your screen. You can now go warmer or cooler as you please. Added Exchange support. We fixed some issues that were causing problems with popular 3rd party apps. Telephony service improvements so you no longer get the lag when you turn on/off airplane mode. \nThanks to the OnePlus forum members, the OTA as well as the full ROM update file are available, which you can use to perform a manual installation on your OnePus 2. \nDownload: OxygenOS 2.1.0 OTA or OxygenOS 2.1.0 full ROM (forum thread ) \nCopy the downloaded folder to your phone's storage and remember the location. \nStep-1: Download either the OTA or full ROM. The OTA is small but your phone needs to have stock recovery and previous OxygenOS 2.0.2 installed. Also, the bootloader of the phone should be locked. The full ROM, in contrary, is a flashable zip file which can be flashed via custom recovery. Recommended recovery- TWRP \nStep-2: Boot the phone into recovery mode. For this do the following; Switch off the phone and wait for a few seconds until the screen goes off completely Press power and volume buttons together until some text appears on screen Using the volume button, scroll down to the recovery mode option Press the power button to select it. Your phone will now boot into recovery mode \nStep-3: While in recovery mode, use the volume buttons to navigate to \"install update\" and press the power button to select it \nStep-4: Browse to the folder in your phone where you have saved the downloaded Oxygen OS 2.1.0 file, select it and confirm installation \nNote: If the OTA file does not install using the above method, you may use the full ROM. This should install without any problem. \nStep-5: The update should now start installing \nStep-6: Upon completion of the installation you will be back on the recovery screen. Just select \"reboot system now\" to restart the phone \nThat's it. Your OnePlus 2 should now be running the newest OxygenOS version.
