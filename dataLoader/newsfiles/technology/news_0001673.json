This comes in the wake of Base’s remarkable market expansion over the last year. The new funding will allow Base to both keep pace with growing demand and also invest aggressively in expanding the platform’s sales intelligence capabilities. \n“We are focused on building a product that revolutionizes the way companies sell,” said Uzi Shmilovici, CEO of Base. “Our mission is clear -- provide sales teams with an all-in-one platform to dramatically improve productivity through data-driven insights.” \nTenaya Capital led the round with participation from Index Ventures and previous investors. “We believe that Base is the future sales platform for data driven sales teams. Intelligence and usability is becoming a major competitive advantage in enterprise software,” said Stewart Gollmer, Managing Director with Tenaya Capital. “Base has proven itself as a leader in this transition and is rapidly building an impressive list of customers. Tenaya Capital is pleased to be an investor in this exciting company.” \nBase’s revenue has grown exponentially since their last round of funding in 2014. Similarly, Base has doubled its number of employees over the past year to keep up with growing demand. Today, more than 6,500 businesses worldwide run their sales teams on Base. Companies like Dow, Cisco, Jet.com, Sartorius and more are moving away from legacy CRM in favor of a modern, data-driven approach to sales. \nWith over half a million mobile app downloads, Base has solidified its spot as a trailblazer in an outdated and traditional industry. Base’s continued growth and commitment to innovation has also led to recognition by Gartner, who in 2015 selected Base as a promising and powerful vendor in the Sales Force Automation Magic Quadrant. \nWaging a war to overthrow legacy CRM \n“It’s time to give sales teams everything they need in one place. The era of outdated charts, siloed data and stitched together point solutions is over. We’re here to bring new levels of productivity to sales teams while providing them with powerful data-driven insights,” says Base CEO, Uzi Shmilovici. \nTraditional legacy CRMs have continuously failed to meet the evolving needs of their customers, costing businesses millions in lost sales opportunities and expensive implementation costs. Such losses highlight the many shortcomings of legacy CRM in today’s market, and have further fueled the transition into a new age of sales. \nBase provides integrated sales productivity tools that visualize the sales experience. Base also boasts the #1 ranked mobile CRM app available on the market. As the industry’s leading next-generation sales platform, Base is reestablishing the importance of transparency, usability and simplicity in the CRM space. By building a complete platform that marries productivity and intelligence, Base is spearheading the long-awaited transformation of the CRM category. \n“Businesses worldwide are fed up with their legacy CRM vendors from the nineties,” says Base CEO, Uzi Shmilovici. “This frustration is what drives Base to create a revolutionary product that is easy to implement and that guarantees adoption rates otherwise unheard of with legacy vendors.” \nOver the past year, Base has experienced a growing roster of enterprise customers and champions. “Our growth in 2015 is a direct result of our customers’ success,” said Shmilovici. “That’s why we’re committed to building the most powerful, yet easy to use platform on the market. This new round of funding demonstrates how we are changing the face of CRM forever.” \nHelpful Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T15:29:58.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
