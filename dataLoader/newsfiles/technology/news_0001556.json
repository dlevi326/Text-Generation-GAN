As a result of the collaboration, OptioLabs’ PrivateEye will be integrated with the new AMD PRO A-Series processor, offering a mobile secure processor with the ability to control proprietary and regulated information displayed on Windows desktops, laptops, and tablets for enterprise, government and consumer users alike. \n“The reality of today’s mobile world means data is constantly exposed on laptops, tablets, and phones in coffee shops, airports, meeting rooms, client offices, and even inside a company’s own office. This makes computer screens the last truly unprotected frontier in information security,” said CEO of OptioLabs, Gregg Smith. “Collaborating with an innovative powerhouse like AMD affords us the opportunity to demonstrate the ease in which computers can be used to ensure critical information is only being accessed by authorized users. AMD takes secure processing very seriously, and we are proud to work with them in offering a unique security option that doesn’t impede the productivity of the user.” \nPrivateEye will actively work with the new AMD PRO A-Series processor to prevent visual eavesdropping by blurring the computer display whenever an authorized user is not paying attention. PrivateEye also looks for potential visual eavesdroppers nearby, and will warn the user or automatically protect the display whenever one is detected. This feature increases user convenience by automatically recognizing their faces so that they don’t have to type passwords, but it is tough on potential intruders. Additionally, anyone attempting to break into an unattended computer will have their picture taken and recorded in an audit log. For enterprises needing to comply with regulations, this collaboration allows them to be secure and compliant right out of the box, without the need for additional costly and painstakingly complex security solutions. OptioLabs and AMD have recognized the need for embedding this critical security feature straight from the factory. \n\"AMD views security as a top priority and we are excited to work with OptioLabs to bring its innovative PrivateEye Enterprise technology to AMD PRO platforms,\" said Jim Anderson, SVP and GM, Compute and Graphics business unit, AMD. \"OptioLabs PrivateEye Enterprise technology tackles a critical need to secure the last two feet of your network – from screen to the user's eye – without impacting productivity. By collaborating with OptioLabs, AMD customers will be able to protect their in-use data using industry-leading hardware and software.\" \nAMD PRO A-Series mobile processors offer a breakthrough APU architecture with all-day battery life, power and efficiency optimized to meet the evolving needs of enterprise computing and collaboration. The mobile AMD PRO processors are engineered for today’s on-the-go, unplugged workforce with mobile-ready features, built-in security and manageability that drive nonstop productivity and peace of mind. \nAbout AMD \nFor more than 45 years, AMD has driven innovation in high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies ― the building blocks for gaming, immersive platforms, and the datacenter.
