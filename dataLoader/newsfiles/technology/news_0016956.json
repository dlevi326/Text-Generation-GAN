(QCOM) said Monday that it has acquired privately-held medical data management company Capsule Technologie, a move to expand its Qualcomm Life subsidiary.\nTerms of the transaction weren't disclosed.\nThe acquisition of Capsule, based in Andover, Mass., extends Qualcomm Life's connected health offerings into the hospital, Qualcomm said. Capsule delivers clinical data to various in-hospital decision support systems, alarm and notification systems, and asset management tools, which help reduce latency and transcription errors, according to Qualcomm.\nQualcomm, the world's largest maker of chips used in mobile phones, has been under pressure from activist investor Jana Partners LLC. Jana in April took a roughly $2 billion stake in the company and has been pushing Qualcomm to explore a breakup, cut costs, repurchase shares faster and bring new blood to its board.\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n 14, 2015 08:19 ET (12:19 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T03:30:52.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
