Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said the first Model X sport utility vehicles will be delivered Sept. 29.\nThe SUVs will be handed over at the electric-car maker’s Fremont, California, factory, Musk said Wednesday in a Twitter post. The initial vehicles will be Founders Series models, a fully loaded, extremely limited version, Tesla said.\nThe date meets the late September goal Musk stated on last month’s earnings conference call. Tesla this week began letting some early reservations holders of the SUVs begin picking such things as paint colors, wheel size and whether they want the $10,000 “Ludicrous Speed Update.”\nThe Model X was revealed as a concept in February 2012 and had previously been targeted to go on sale in 2013 and then by the end of 2014. The SUV is the second model in Palo Alto, California-based Tesla’s lineup, after the Model S sedan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T01:34:50.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
