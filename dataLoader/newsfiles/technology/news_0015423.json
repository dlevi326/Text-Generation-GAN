Royal fans eagerly awaited the arrival of the second child, who is the fourth in the order of succession to the British throne, as many of them camped outside the Lindo Wing at St. Mary’s Hospital for weeks. \nIn an interview to Sky News in July, Prince William was asked if he and his wife are thinking about having another child. \n“We’ve only just had the second one. You never know what is going to happen in the future,” the Duke said then. Until an official confirmation, the speculation about a possible third pregnancy should be taken with a grain of salt.
