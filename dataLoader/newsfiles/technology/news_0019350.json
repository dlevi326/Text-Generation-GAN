The official purchasing managers' index for China manufacturing activity fell to 49.7 in August from the previous month's reading of 50. A figure below 50 signals a contraction in the sector while a level above that indicates expansion. \nThe Caixin PMI was unexpectedly revised upwards to 47.3 in August from the previous estimate of 47.1 but the figure still revealed a contraction. \n\"Concerns about Chinese growth as well as the prospect of a US rate rise have seen European markets come off their worst monthly performance since 2011, though that does have to be tempered somewhat by last week's strong rebound, as China cut rates further while senior Fed official and new York Fed President Bob Dudley suggested a September rate rise was now 'less compelling' than previously thought,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK . \n\"Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) the Atlanta Fed's Dennis Lockhart softened his earlier rhetoric about a September rate rise hinting he may be having second thoughts given recent market volatility.\" However, over the weekend Deputy Fed Chairman Stanley Fisher indicated that the central bank is looking to increase rates as soon as possible as there is good reason to suggest inflation would rise towards the 2% target. \nOn an upbeat note for the markets, Monday data showed German retail sales rose 3.3% in July compared to a year ago, exceeding expectations for a 1.7% increase. \nEurozone inflation remained unchanged at 0.2% year-on-year growth in August, Eurostat revealed on Monday, compared to forecasts of 0.1% but well below the European Central Bank's target of just below 2%. \nTurning to Tuesday's agenda, UK manufacturing PMI is due at 0930 BST while Eurozone jobs data will be released at 1000 BST. In the US, Markit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) 's final estimate of manufacturing activity is out at 1445 BST, construction spending will be published at 1500 BST and ISM's manufacturing report comes at 1500 BST. \nMeanwhile, oil prices dropped nearly $2 a barrel shortly after Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude jumped more than 8% in the previous session. \nWTI had soared 27.5% by the end of three days of gains on the previous session, the biggest three-day increase in dollar terms since February 2011. The rally came after OPEC said the cartel was willing to talk to other producers to achieve reasonable oil prices. A downward revision of US output data by the US Energy Information Administration also boosted prices. \nAt 0835 BST on Tuesday WTI was down 3% to $47.75 per barrel, while Brent fell 2.2% to $52.96. \nOn the company front, Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) slumped as the company's chief executive vowed to cut $1bn of costs if a deal to buy Baxalta (Berlin: 9BX.BE - news ) goes through. \nAstrazeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) was also lower as the company entered into a collaboration agreement with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (NYSE: VRX - news ) under which it will grant an exclusive licence for Valeant to develop and commercialise psoriasis drug brodalumab. \nBwin.Party Digital Entertainment dropped following reports the gambling group received a revised proposal from 888 Holdings , which it is evaluating along with the offer received from GVC Holdings (Other OTC: GMVHF - news ) and said it intends to consult with its shareholders in the coming days before making a decision. \nRentokil Initial (Other OTC: RKLIF - news ) gained as it reached an agreement to buy US-based The Steritech Group for $425m in cash to accelerate the growth of its pest control business. \nInmarsat (Other OTC: IMASF - news ) surged as the satellite telecoms group confirmed the successful launch into orbit of the I-5 F3 Global Xpress satellite. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,061.18 -1.23% FTSE 100 6,161.33 -1.39% FTSE 250 16,919.62 -1.09% FTSE 100 - Risers Inmarsat (LSE: ISAT.L - news ) (ISAT) 994.50p +1.38% Admiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) (ADM) 1,558.00p +0.52% Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) 'A' (RDSA) 1,701.50p +0.38% TUI AG Reg Shs (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (TUI (LSE: TUI.L - news ) ) 1,160.00p +0.35% Royal Dutch Shell 'B' (RDSB) 1,709.00p +0.15% RSA Insurance Group (RSA) 514.50p +0.10% FTSE 100 - Fallers Shire Plc (SHP) 4,860.00p -3.28% Old Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) (OML) 194.00p -3.10% Persimmon (PSN) 2,043.00p -2.85% GKN (GKN (LSE: GKN.L - news ) ) 283.80p -2.71% Mondi (MNDI) 1,439.00p -2.64% Burberry Group (Other OTC: BBRYF - news ) (BRBY) 1,374.00p -2.62% ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) (ARM) 909.50p -2.57% Dixons Carphone (Other OTC: DSITF - news ) (DC.) 420.50p -2.53% Morrison (Wm) Supermarkets (MRW) 164.50p -2.37% Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) (STAN) 747.40p -2.30% FTSE 250 - Risers St. Modwen Properties (SMP) 458.20p +2.60% Restaurant Group (Other OTC: RSTGY - news ) (RTN) 679.50p +1.95% Cobham (Amsterdam: CH6.AS - news ) (COB) 286.80p +1.85% Nostrum Oil & Gas (Stuttgart: 3NO.SG - news ) (NOG (Taiwan OTC: 5279.TWO - news ) ) 498.80p +1.82% Tullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) (TLW) 226.70p +1.57% Rentokil Initial (RTO) 150.40p +1.42% Redefine International (RDI) 53.50p +1.42% Lookers (LOOK) 164.00p +1.23% Vectura Group (LSE: VEC.L - news ) (VEC) 173.90p +1.10% Ophir Energy (Other OTC: OPGYF - news ) (OPHR) 97.90p +1.08% FTSE 250 - Fallers Rotork (Frankfurt: RO41.F - news ) (ROR) 196.90p -5.83% Henderson Group (LSE: HGG.L - news ) (HGG) 246.00p -5.17% Indivior (Berlin: 2IV.BE - news ) (INDV) 213.20p -4.61% Man Group (LSE: EMG.L - news ) (EMG) 154.30p -4.22% Acacia Mining (LSE: ABG.L - news ) (ACA) 232.00p -3.05% Grainger (Swiss: OXGRIU.SW - news ) (GRI) 228.40p -3.01% Fidessa Group (Other OTC: FDGRF - news ) (FDSA) 1,822.00p -2.98% Virgin Money Holdings (UK) (VM.) 412.20p -2.92% RPC Group (LSE: RPC.L - news ) (RPC (NYSE: RES - news ) ) 637.50p -2.89% FirstGroup (Amsterdam: FI6.AS - news ) (FGP (BSE: FGP.BO - news ) ) 105.90p -2.84% FTSE TechMARK - Risers UCW Limited (UCW) A$0.01 +7.14% Innovation Group (Other OTC: INVGF - news ) (TIG) 39.50p +1.94% Sepura (SEPU) 170.00p +1.19% NCC Group (LSE: NCC.L - news ) (NCC (BSE: NCC6.BO - news ) ) 232.25p +0.76% FTSE TechMARK - Fallers Oxford Biomedica (LSE: OXB.L - news ) (OXB) 7.70p -5.52% Sarossa (SARS) 1.76p -4.09% Skyepharma (SKP) 316.75p -2.61% SDL (SDL (LSE: SDL.L - news ) ) 376.25p -1.70% Oxford Instruments (Other OTC: OXGGY - news ) (OXIG) 826.00p -1.67% E2V Technologies (LSE: E2V.L - news ) (E2V) 226.94p -1.55% Consort Medical (Other OTC: CSRMF - news ) (CSRT) 942.00p -0.69% KCOM Group (LSE: KCOM.L - news ) (KCOM) 93.50p -0.53% Spirent Communications (Other OTC: SPMYY - news ) (SPT (Taiwan OTC: 8431.TWO - news ) ) 78.00p -0.32% IShares Euro Gov Bond 7-10YR UCITS ETF (IEGM) â‚¬ 199.31 -0.31%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:07:22.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
