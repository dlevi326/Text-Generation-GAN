So prioritising them in line with which are the most important to customers would be important. However, the research uncovered another extremely important factor that it said could help a company boost loyalty and advocacy: the digital influencer. “A digital influencer is someone who demonstrates the ability to change opinions and behaviours, and drive measurable outcomes online,” it said. “Effectively harnessing and expanding this segment of the customer base is essential for a brand to improve satisfaction with its digital experience.” The good news is that the influencers seem to be easier to please than the average consumer. “Influencers delivered a significant positive digital experience score of 33 percent across all industries, meaning that there were far more delighted consumers in this category than unsatisfied,” the report said. It concluded: “The message for brands seeking to improve loyalty and advocacy is to harness the power of the digital influencer, while also helping to educate the other consumer groups and bring them along the digital journey from passive through to influencer.” \nPremier Technologies \nPremier Contact Point provides a hosted contact solution that meets the needs of the modern contact centre.
