City Harvest now takes donations from businesses and farmers and delivers it to 500 food banks and soup kitchens.\nVilsack toured the warehouse packed with donated produce like carrots that were too big to sell and called it \"truly inspiring.\"\nHe said the campaign to cut food waste includes educating consumers about how long to keep food before it must be thrown out.\nHe said he recently used the USDA's new mobile FoodKeeper app to determine whether chicken salad in his refrigerator was still good.\nIt was, and he ate it.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:14:00.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
