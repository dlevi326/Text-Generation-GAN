Siffre had retired from the music industry in the 70s, but formally returned to music in 1985, having watched a documentary about South African soldiers firing at black children, and releasing Something Inside So Strong. The song reached number 4 in the UK singles charts.\nSadly, a quarter century after the demise of apartheid, much of the criticism leveled at the nationalist government via the lyrics, can just as well be targeted at the ANC administration.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B-4Lsrx8IA", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B-4Lsrx8IA"], "published": "2015-09-04T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:12:13.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
