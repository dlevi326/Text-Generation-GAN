Map of Japan locating the town of Taiji where daolphins are hunted every year \nSeparately, Japanese fisheries officials have announced they would start an annual coastal whaling hunt with plans to catch 51 minke whales over the next two months, part of what Tokyo says is research but which has attracted strong criticism abroad. \nFour ships will operate within a 50-kilometre (30-mile) radius off Kushiro in Japan's northernmost Hokkaido island, the fisheries agency said. \nTokyo argues that the programme is permitted under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, and is aimed at better understanding whale behaviour. \nBut Japan's whaling programme—including another hunt in the Southern Ocean—has angered Western conservationists and many of its friendly nations, including the United States. \nIn June, Japan's chief whaling negotiator said ships would return to the Antarctic this year, despite a call by global regulators to provide more evidence that the hunt has a scientific purpose. \nDespite international disapproval, Japan has hunted whales in the Southern Ocean under an exemption in the global whaling moratorium that allows for lethal research. \nLast year, the highest court of the United Nations, the International Court of Justice, ruled that the annual Southern Ocean expedition was a commercial hunt masquerading as science to skirt the international moratorium.
