As incandescent lamps have been made largely obsolete, given the U.S. governmentâ€™s mandate to save energy, they have frequently been replaced by LEDs due to their long life (typically 25,000 hrs.) and the ease of adapting them to many different socket and shape requirements. However, LED lighting control presents a few problems not encountered with incandescent lamps. For example, with much less current from the LED load, normal types of triacs may be challenged in terms of latching and holding current characteristics. \nLearn more about Littelfuse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T23:04:58.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
