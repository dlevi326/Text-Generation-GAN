Neonicotinoids are suspected of being among several factors that have contributed to the collapse of honey bee colonies throughout the U.S. \nBees, especially honeybees, are needed to pollinate crops, and they are considered essential to the U.S. food supply. \nBut a disorder has caused as much as one-third of the nation's bees to disappear each winter since 2006. A 2013 report issued by the EPA and U.S. Department of Agriculture cited a parasitic mite, multiple viruses, bacteria, poor nutrition, genetics, habitat loss and pesticides as factors for the bees' disappearance. \n\"We're certainly extremely happy,\" said Greg Loarie, an attorney with the group Earthjustice, which challenged the EPA's approval of sulfoxaflor on behalf of groups in the beekeeping industry. \"It means that sulfoxaflor comes off the market while the EPA does the work it should have done a long time ago.\" \nLoarie said the pesticide was used on cotton in southern states, but it had only been approved on an emergency basis for one crop in California. \nThe 9th Circuit overturned the EPA's unconditional registration of sulfoxaflor and ordered it to get additional studies and data about the pesticide's effect on bees. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
