Pioneer will also give back to the communities by making a cash contribution to the participating schools. Check presentations will take place at varsity home games during the fall football season/winter basketball season. For more information about Pioneer’s Safe & Sound Tour and for a list of participating high schools and retailers, visit pioneerelectronics.com/safeandsound. \nIn an online survey conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Pioneer Electronics in May 2015, among 1,801 vehicle owners, 44 percent of smartphone owners admitted they text and drive. What’s more, 86 percent of survey participants have witnessed other drivers texting behind the wheel. These stats highlight the need for education about the choices and options available to consumers to make safe driving choices. \nPartnering with the Mobile Electronics Specialist of America (M.E.S.A.) retailer group, Pioneer will showcase its Networked Entertainment eXperience (NEX) in-dash multimedia receivers to 50 high schools across the nation. The latest NEX models, the AVIC-8100NEX, AVIC-7100NEX and AVH-4100NEX, complement today’s connected lifestyle and feature both Android™ Auto and Apple CarPlay™ connectivity, allowing drivers to connect their compatible smartphones to their vehicles in the smartest and safest way possible. \nRetailers will also showcase Pioneer’s audio products that bring high-quality sound and entertainment to the driving experience. Pioneer’s TS-D component speakers, shallow subwoofer and new 5-channel amplifier will be on display as solutions for improving a vehicle’s sound quality and audio capabilities. \n“Designing products that encourage safe and attentive driving habits is important to who we are and what we do,” said Ted Cardenas, vice president of marketing for the Car Electronics Division at Pioneer. “With school in full swing, we wanted to show teens and parents that there are intelligent ways to stay connected while on the road. Pioneer’s products make it easy for drivers to update their existing vehicles, particularly teens driving older vehicles, with the latest connectivity options and better audio too.” \nFor more information follow us on:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:06:06.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
