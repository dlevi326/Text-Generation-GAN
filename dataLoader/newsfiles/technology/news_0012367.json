The instructor simply opens a Web site and then \"pushes\" it to all his or her Google Classroom students, so that the page opens immediately on their devices. \nGoogle Docs, which includes word processing (\"Docs\"), spreadsheet (\"Sheets\") and presentation (\"Slides\") capabilities, now includes the following new features: A \"history of changes\" feature allows user to see a revision history of a changed file and to open up earlier versions to find out who in a group of users has made what changes. The three programs now have pre-made templates that can set files up in a specific format. For example, Sheets can be set up as a calendar form, team roster or gradebook, among other looks. Slides templates include lesson plans, book reports, science projects and student certificates. A new \"explore\" option in Sheets provides a way for users to create charts and drill down into data, a function that the company said could be used to find data patterns. A research tool in Docs for Android allows users to do Google searches without leaving Docs. They can then copy text or images to the document by tapping the “Insert” button. A voice feature is now part of the Tools menu in Docs for Chrome . When that's turned on, the user can record ideas or compose text without using the keyboard.
