There were some facts that were glossed over.\nThe train left Johannesburg at 12h30 on Sunday and eventually arrived at Cape Town Station Tuesday at 07h30. It was 16 hours late. The train was eventually stuck in the Karoo, with no access to food or water, for 14 hours.\nAt about 3pm, the seated passengers in the back of the train started protesting in the dining car. They were refused food, bottled water or anything else to drink because the stock on the train had run low, and they couldn't pay for the items. Instead of alleviating the situation by offering then something to drink, the train manager and security argued with these people.\nThese passengers had not planned to spend 43 hours on a train. The kitchen had closed down after breakfast. Passengers then appealed to the staff to simply send around something to drink.\nMy children, and 73 year old mother, had no meal to eat until 10 hours later. I was one of the very lucky ones though, because I had packed snacks and water, but others were not as fortunate.\nWhen we asked the train manager whether there were emergency medical or security plans in place, we were told that he was sure there was. He didn't actually know what they were, but if something happened he would phone his superiors and ask them what to do.\nI became progressively more nervous as people became angrier. Eventually staff relented and everyone got one cup of tea at around 5pm, with food finally arriving at 7.45pm. We reached Beaufort West at 9pm, there we were offered the option of getting on busses to Cape Town. They approximated another 8 - 10 hours on the bus.\nSeveral families with large amounts of luggage, children, or older family members chose to stay on the train. Coping with such a long bus ride in a very confined space with angry, hungry, people did not seem like an ideal option. People had been stuck on that train for 33 hours.\nLesedi Mapheto notes that they couldn't predict that this would happen, but the lines had been down in that area since the previous night. They were fully aware of the situation. Yet they still allowed a train filled with hundreds of people to come to a stand still in the middle of a dessert for 13 hours. When I asked the train manager why they had not halted the train at a nearby station, where there would be access to facilities like toilets, food, and some kind of medical facilities - he simply shrugged.\nWe understand that issues come up, but PRASA did not manage this situation, passengers did.\nIt is a blessing that people managed to remain calm, and that no serious damage was done. But it could have turned out very differently.\nIn the heat, on a train track littered with human faeces from the toilet facilities that washes straight onto the railway line, PRASA offered no help whatsoever.\nTheir staff were as helplessly stranded as the passengers, and completely under-equipped to deal with the situation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:02:53.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
