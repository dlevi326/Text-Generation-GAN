The first cohort begins January 2016. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150916/267333-INFO \nThe program is designed for individuals who have accumulated two years of college level credits, stepped away from their education for personal or professional reasons, and are now interested in completing a bachelor's degree. \n\"This degree can open doors that currently are not open to some adults,\" says Bentley's Dean of Business Chip Wiggins. \"It's an opportunity for someone looking to advance in their career or increase their earning potential, a parent who stepped away from their education but is ready to return, veterans and active members of the military transitioning into the civilian work force or someone with an associate's degree interested in pursuing the next level of education.\" \nThere are compelling reasons to complete your bachelor's degree -- according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics individuals with a bachelor's degree have a lower unemployment rate and earn more than those with a high school diploma. In fact, they will earn about one million dollars more in a lifetime. \nThe goal of the program is to make Bentley's strong business curriculum available to those who want to finish their degree in a format that's flexible and works with their current lifestyle. All courses are taught by accomplished and renowned Bentley faculty committed to providing the best possible online course experience - one that is both interesting and collaborative. \"We've been successfully educating business students in an ethical and socially engaging environment for almost one hundred years ,\" adds Wiggins. \"It makes sense to take our academic curriculum and tailor it for this adult audience. And while we are making it more accessible by offering the program online, it's very important that these students feel they are truly part of the Bentley community and Bentley legacy.\" \nBentley's Online Degree Completion Program is offered part-time and requires students to take 16 courses. Students focus on one 8-week course at a time and benefit from having a cohort of peers who move through the program with them. Candidates who pursue the program without taking any breaks can expect to graduate in just over three years. Other program highlights: -- Courses are offered asynchronously, meaning students work at their own pace and access assignments and lectures when it's convenient for them. -- Virtual office hours and synchronized lectures are integrated into the course curriculum as an additional mode of communication with faculty members. -- The cohort nature of the program, allows students to move through the program as a group. This creates networking opportunities, builds strong relationships, and fosters camaraderie. -- Annual on-campus two day residencies are built into the program and attendance is strongly encouraged. These residencies provide students the opportunity to collaborate with faculty, administrators and other students, while enjoying the amenities of the Bentley campus. \nBentley is currently accepting applications for the January 2016 entry term. The priority application deadline is Sept. 30(th) with a final deadline of Nov. 15(th).
