Fortinet claimed in its press statement that Fortinet’s \"FortiAP-S series\" wireless LAN (WLAN) APs are the most secure cloud-managed enterprise Wi-Fi products on the market so far. They feature Fortinet’s cybersecurity technology running directly on the AP and the latest security updates from Fortinet’s industry-leading FortiGuard Labs Threat Intelligence team. Fortinet’s new FortiAP-S series of wireless access points empower organizations to forego separate WLAN controllers without exposing the network to cyber-threats, the statement said. Every FortiAP-S series access point is centrally managed through the cloud-based FortiCloud management system, enabling effortless Wi-Fi network deployment and management, increasing security, visibility and control, and reducing overall infrastructure complexity. This makes it easy for organizations to implement and manage a secure Wi-Fi network, while the scalability of cloud management makes the solution ideal for distributed enterprises that may have thousands of sites, the statement said. The FortiAP-S series APs are loaded with advanced security features like intrusion prevention, web filtering, rouge AP detection, antivirus security protection, granular application controls and more, all running directly on the access point. These features are all backed by FortiGuard Labs’ industry-leading threat intelligence to ensure each FortiAP-S is protected against the very latest advanced threats, in real-time. This sophisticated level of hardware and software integration is only made possible by Fortinet’s expertise and dedication to high-performance security engineering and research. \"Fortinet’s new FortiAP-S series combines the flexibility of cloud management, the latest generation of wireless access point technology and the proven security of FortiGuard, all forming a secure wireless architecture for enterprise access networks,\" said John Maddison, vice president of marketing at Fortinet. \"We can now apply mobile-specific security policies and updates such as application control and virus scanning directly to the wireless access points, giving the customer a layer of perimeter defense for BYOD devices.\" The FortiAP-S series of wireless access points and FortiCloud wireless security enhancements are available now.
