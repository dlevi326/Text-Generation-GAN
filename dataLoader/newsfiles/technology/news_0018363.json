The Remote Finder enables an individual to easily locate lost items such as keys or a remote control. In doing so, it eliminates the need to replace lost items. As a result, it helps to reduce frustrations. The invention features a convenient design that is easy to use and it helps to save time. Additionally, the Remote Finder is producible in design variations.\nThe inventor described the invention design. “My design makes it easy to locate lost times.”\nThe original design was submitted to the Des Moines office of InventHelp. It is licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers. For more information, write Dept. 13-DEG-178, InventHelp, 217 Ninth Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15222, or call (412) 288-1300 ext. 1368.
