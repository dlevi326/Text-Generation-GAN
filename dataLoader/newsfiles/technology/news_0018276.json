A plant physiologist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, he planted seedlings of 10 tropical tree species in small, geodesic greenhouses. Some he allowed to grow in the kind of environment they were used to out in the forest, around 79 degrees Fahrenheit. Others, he subjected to uncomfortably high temperatures. Still others, unbearably high temperatures—up to a daily average temperature of 95 degrees and a peak of 102 degrees. That’s about as hot as Earth has ever been.\nIt’s also the kind of environment tropical trees have a good chance of living in by the end of this century, thanks to climate change. Winter wanted to see how they would do.\nThe answer came as a surprise to those accustomed to dire warnings that climate change will turn the Amazon into a desert. The vast majority of Winter’s seedlings didn’t die. In fact, most thrived at significantly warmer temperatures than they experience today, growing faster and larger. Just two species succumbed to the heat, and only at the very highest temperatures. The trees’ success echoes paleontological data , which hints that warmer temperatures can be a boon for tropical forests. After all, the last time Earth experienced average temperatures of 95 degrees, there were rainforests in Michigan and palm trees in the Arctic.", "external_links": ["http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6006/957", "http://www.stri.si.edu/english/scientific_staff/staff_scientist/scientist.php?id=37", "http://www.stri.si.edu/sites/publications/PDFs/STRI-W_Cheesman_and_Winter_art_JExp_Bot2013.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-03T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T03:06:14.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
