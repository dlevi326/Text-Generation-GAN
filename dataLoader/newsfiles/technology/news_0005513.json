GTL Point #1: The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) decisions are final. Securus Correction #1: Securus will appeal the PTAB decisions - so they are not final. GTL Point #2: GTL invalidated the \"crown jewel\" of Securus' patent portfolio. Securus Correction #2: Securus does not have a \"crown jewel.\" We have almost 4X as many patents as GTL - and they are all very valuable. GTL Point #3: GTL invalidated Securus' call processing patents. Securus Correction #3: Securus has over 234 patents - and most deal with call processing in many forms so GTL has not invalidated all of our call processing patents. GTL Point #4: Securus imposed a \"tollbooth\" on our industry. Securus Correction #4: Securus received approval from the United States Patent Office on all of its patents - the same as thousands of other companies like Microsoft, Apple, General Electric and Dell. The law requires companies to safeguard their patent investments - and that is exactly what Securus does because we develop key technologies for proprietary use by corrections and law enforcement. GTL Point #5: The PTAB recognized that Securus' patents did not cover any genuine invention. Securus Correction #5: GTL itself never even argued that Securus' invention was not novel and the PTAB did not rule otherwise. The PTAB has ruled on less than 1% of Securus' patent portfolio - which includes innovation and a numerically significant advantage over and above GTL's much smaller patent portfolio. Securus has a much higher number of issued and pending patents because we have more significant development activity versus GTL. GTL Point #6: Securus made incorrect statements to patent officials. Securus Correction #6: GTL is not telling the whole story and all the facts undermine GTL's statement. GTL's suggestion that patent examiners were confused into allowing Securus patent by incorrect statements is dead wrong. The full written record with the patent examiners shows in black and white that the patent office understood the prior art and Securus innovation and determined it was patent worthy. GTL Point #7: Securus is a patent predator, not an innovator. They filed patents on material that others had invented. Securus Correction #7: Any suggestion that Securus patented what others were doing is wrong. GTL effectively admitted Securus' patents were new and novel and the PTAB did not undermine this. Securus has been filing patents for over 20 years, has the largest patent portfolio in the industry, and has challenged GTL to a \"technology bake off\" on multiple occasions. GTL has not agreed to that challenge - they have shied away from that - for good reason. GTL has a smaller number of patents, Securus has invested more in technology than GTL in a material way, and has more development personnel - Securus is a large development house that benefits corrections and law enforcement. GTL Point #8: Securus has not filed a single new patent case against another industry competitor in the last two (2) years. Securus Correction #8: Securus has settled patent cases with three (3) industry competitors in the last two (2) years - again proving the value of the innovation that Securus routinely provides. GTL Point #8 is clearly an error - but excusable because they are relatively new to filing patents and embracing the concept of a single state-of-the-art platform for all of their customers that comes with new patentable technologies and products. \n\"It comes as no surprise that GTL has mischaracterized the nature of the recent Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruling,\" said Richard A. (\"Rick\") Smith, Chief Executive Officer of Securus Technologies. \"GTL has attempted to use what I would call a trivial expected short term win before the PTAB to suggest that we don't have much technology, we don't have much software development, we don't have a much larger patent portfolio, and we don't have a much better 'win percentage' versus them - none of this is true. There is a reason why GTL has not accepted my technology challenge - and it is because we would most likely prevail soundly. \n\"We file patents for the same reason that GTL and others file patents - because we have developed proprietary technology and have spent over $800 million building software and products that aid the work of the corrections and law enforcement sectors. We protect that with US patents - that have been approved by the United States Patent Office - for GTL to suggest that we should not protect our work is truly incredulous,\" said Smith. \n\"With a poor history of issuing factually accurate patent related press releases - it is not surprising to me that GTL gets wrong what they put in press releases,\" said Smith. \n\"GTL gives the carriers in our industry a black eye because of their behavior - I am disgusted with their child-like antics. GTL signed license agreements with Securus over the last ten (10) years - so they agreed in writing to using our patents - and suddenly now, they are disregarding their long history with us. \n\"Our customers including prisons, jails, inmates, friends and family, and all of society can count on Securus to develop and implement solutions to their problems - and do the right thing. We always have and always will.\" \nABOUT SECURUS TECHNOLOGIES Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and serving more than 2,600 public safety, law enforcement and corrections agencies and over 1,000,000 inmates across North America, Securus Technologies is committed to serve and connect by providing emergency response, incident management, public information, investigation, biometric analysis, communication, information management, inmate self-service, and monitoring products and services in order to make our world a safer place to live.
