Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer announced on Tuesday that she is expecting identical twin girls later this year. “I plan to approach the pregnancy and delivery as I did with my son three years ago, taking limited time away and working throughout,\" Mayer said in a blog, referring to the child she had just three months into her job at Yahoo.

The company's stock continues to track that of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba , which it continues to hold a significant stake in but plans to spin off in the fourth quarter — around the same time that Mayer is expecting. Yahoo shares (NASDAQ:YHOO) are down about 39 percent from their high of last November. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is down about 45 percent, pulled down by the weakening Chinese economy. On the official company blog, this statement was added to a re-posting of Mayer's personal blog about her pregnancy, \"At the company, we are extremely happy for her and supportive of her plans and approach. Yahoo, as well as Marissa and her family, thank you for respecting their privacy during this happy, special time.\" Soon after Mayer's first child, Yahoo extended its paid parental leave to 16 weeks for mothers and eight weeks for fathers. The company also gives new parents $500 for child-related expenses. Mayer, 40, said the twins part of her pregnancy was a surprise. \"I have no family history of twins or any other predisposing factors,\" she wrote in her blog. \"However, as I’ve now learned, identical twins occur by random chance in roughly 1 out of approximately every 300 pregnancies. Zack and I have embraced the surprise and are very excited about these new additions to our family.\" \nGet Silicon Valley  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:49:36.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
