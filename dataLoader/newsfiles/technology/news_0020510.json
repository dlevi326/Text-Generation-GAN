That will take some doing.\nIf the articles of News24 in future are not fair,with depth and with background and facts,in other words quality journalism,i predict the end of News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:03:47.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
