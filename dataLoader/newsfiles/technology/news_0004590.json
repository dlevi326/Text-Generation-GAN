This is impacting on trade flows to and from the Island.\nUnder the contract, Royal HaskoningDHV is required to update the Port Masterplan of Port Louis and the Port Masterplan of Port Mathurin. The work involves identifying new business opportunities for Mauritius ports and forecasting cargo and traffic flows.\nIt includes the assessment of needs for extending and upgrading port infrastructure, and developing a land use plan for the next 25 years.\nMichiel de Jong, Director of Maritime and Waterways at Royal HaskoningDHV, said: “The project win is a direct result our vast experience in port planning, waterfront and marina development, and shipping economics.”\nThe studies, to be completed by August 2016, will examine the challenges associated with future development of the ports, including exploring the potential of Port Louis for container transhipment, increasing performance of the Mauritius Container Terminal, and maintaining and improving market share in a competitive market.\nThe studies will also include assessment for unlocking land outside the port boundaries for port expansion, and related challenges in terms of interactions between the port, city and land owners.\nFact File: Royal HaskoningDHV is an independent, international engineering and project management consultancy with more than 130 years of experience in aviation, buildings, energy, industry, infrastructure, maritime, mining, rural and urban areas, and water.
