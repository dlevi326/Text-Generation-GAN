The service is available in Apple Pay compliant markets, namely the US and UK. Emirates will offer Apple Pay via its app, available for download at the App Store. \"We're proud to be the first global airline to introduce Apple Pay for ticket purchases and we hope this will contribute towards a more seamless customer experience which begins even before they board our flights,\" said Thierry Antinori, Emirates chief commercial officer. Apple Pay uses Touch ID authorisation and is compatible with newer Apple devices iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3. Customer credit card information is stored separately and each transaction generates a one-time unique security code which cannot be traced back to the cardholder's personal card data. New York airline JetBlue was the first to fly with Apple Pay acceptance back in February, but is currently only available when paying for in-flight services such as food and seat upgrades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T02:05:41.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
