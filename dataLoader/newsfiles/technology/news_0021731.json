Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said Germany is a key market for his product, because of the country’s advanced consumer solar power market.\nLater, Panasonic will move on to France, the U.K. and other markets, Laurent Abadie, chief executive officer of Panasonic Europe, said in an interview from the IFA electronics show in Berlin Wednesday.\nIn Japan, where the batteries are already available, they can help households replace as much as 70 percent of energy usage by storing what’s generated from solar panels, Abadie said. The company’s goal is to replace 100 percent of energy taken from the electricity grid eventually, he said.\nThe batteries can be used to store electricity during peak production and dispense it later, when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing.\n“We are not far from achieving 100 percent in the future,” he said. The time it’ll take to reach that goal “depends on the region. If you are in the Nordics, you need a lot of energy in the winter, you don’t get any light.”\nPanasonic has said that the home-energy storage industry could generate 10 billion yen ($83 million) in revenue outside of its domestic Japanese market by fiscal year 2018. The Osaka-based company will start selling the systems in Australia in October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:21:17.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
