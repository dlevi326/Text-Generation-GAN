In this process of expansion they are bound to face several operational challenges like knowing the exact requirements of the businesses of the other countries that they intend to serve. The IT & Telecom businesses across the globe are known to be the front-runners in terms of adoption of new technologies. In order to survive the tough competition, many of these companies are bound to remain up-to-date in terms of technology. Also, most of these companies are either large enterprise level businesses that require greater co-ordination with their customers. This has resulted in information technology companies seeking those technology solutions that simply work.\nWith increasing customer base, many of IT & Telecom companies are worried about the amounts of data that is being generated. Retaining all those data generated is not a smart option due to large investments towards storage. Discarding that data is also not a smart move as that data would provide them insights for better decision making. So, most of the IT & Telecom companies are adopting Natural Language Processing solutions which not only provide a proper structure to the data, but also help in better behavioral analysis of the messages. This enables the IT & Telecom companies to improve their business strategies and would help them in better decision making. NLP solutions like Interactive Voice Response (IVR) are being mainly adopted in IT & Telecom industry as they are vital in the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) operations.\nThe IT & Telecom companies in both developing and developed countries have been using NLP solutions. NLP solution providers have already captured most of the North America markets and the new market that they now intend to concentrate on, has been the Europe and the Asia-Pacific market.
