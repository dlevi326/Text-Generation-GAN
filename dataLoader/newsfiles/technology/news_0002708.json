Isolated Magnetic Dipole (IMD) technology enables high performance and isolation characteristics. \nOptimized for MIMO configuration, this antenna meets an important LTE requirement. Thisocta-band antenna additionally supports fallback for 2G and 3G networks, providing ubiquitous coverage for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. IMD antenna technology additionally provides superior RF field containment, resulting in less interaction with surrounding components, lower program development risk and yielding a quicker time-to-market. \nUtilizing a cost-competitive PCB antenna design, this antenna is easy to surface mount on a device’s board. The easy-to-integrate antenna’s small profile and low-height consumes less board space than other antennas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T01:01:37.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
