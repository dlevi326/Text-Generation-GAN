Image caption The National Crime Agency website was offline for a brief period but appeared to be back up and running by midday on Tuesday. \n\"It isn't a security breach, and it doesn't affect our operational capability. \n\"At worst, it is a temporary inconvenience to users of our website.\" XBox and PlayStation attacks \nLizard Stresser is a tool which allows people to pay a fee to nominate a website they would like to be targeted by a DDoS attack. \nIt became popular after Lizard Squad took responsibility for several high profile attacks. \nThe group claimed to have taken XBox and PlayStation gaming networks offline last Christmas. \nNone of the teenagers in these recent arrests are accused of involvement in those attacks or believed to be members of Lizard Squad. \nThe National Crime Agency said they are suspected of deploying Lizard Stresser, having bought it using services such as Bitcoin in an attempt to stay anonymous. \nThe targets have not been named and it has not been confirmed whether the attempted DDoS attacks were successful. \nAs part of the same operation, officers are visiting around 50 addresses linked to people who are registered on the Lizard Stresser website - but who are not suspected of involvement in attacks. \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:24:47.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
