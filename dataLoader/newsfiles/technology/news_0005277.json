This acquisition will significantly expand Proto Labs’ additive manufacturing capabilities in Europe by adding selective laser sintering, direct metal laser sintering and additional stereolithography capabilities. The acquisition also includes the injection moulding service currently offered by Alphaform Claho, in Eschenlohe, Germany. MediMet Precision Casting and Implants Technology GmbH, a 100% subsidiary of Alphaform AG is not part of the transaction. \n“We are pleased to announce this strategic acquisition which will accelerate the growth of our Additive Manufacturing services in Europe and complement our current Injection Melding and CNC Machining services,” Vicki Holt, President and CEO at Proto Labs, explained. “With those three complementary offerings, we’re uniquely positioned to help designers and engineers take a product from the initial stages of prototyping through low-volume production.” × Expand \nProto Labs now offers AM services. \nProto Labs recently announced the launch of its advanced additive manufacturing service offering stereolithography services for custom prototyping and low-volume production. The company plans to expand this further with the introduction of selective laser sintering and direct metal laser sintering processes in 2016. Both technologies have already been successfully established at Proto labs’ locations in the US. \nProto Labs will exhibit at TCT Show + Personalize on 30 th September – 1 st October 2015 at the NEC, Birmingham.
