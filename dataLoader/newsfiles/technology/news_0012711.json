Transparent TV\nA concept by Michael Friebe, the invisible TV is truly a futuristic design. The frameless glass surface of the television keeps the room in its “visually unaltered” state.\n2. The transformer home\nSuch innovations truly make one believe that the future is indeed now. MIT has designed a micro-apartment called CityHome that can transform a 15-by-15 space into an exercise area, lounge, study, kitchen, and sleeping area.\n3. Facebook Coffee Table\nSlated as an instant photo album, the Facebook coffee table uses real-time speech analysis to pick up keywords from your conversation to pull up relevant Facebook feed photos.\n4. Goji Smart Lock\nThe gadget allows a resident to operate the door lock with a smartphone.\n5. Self-sanitizing door handle\nDoor handles are probably the dirtiest things that you have to touch in public, and you just can’t avoid them, of course. PullClean, however, is a self-sanitizing door handle that dispenses hand sanitizer liquid.\n6. Document Extractor\nByeong Min Choe has conceptualised a document extractor that combines the function of a monitor and a printer. It would save a lot of time as it intuitively prints out just the necessary section instead of printing out the whole page.\n7. The rainbow wall\nThis looks like an LED or something digital, but surprisingly it’s not. It’s actually made of turning triangles with different colors on them.\n8. WAT Lamp\nThe WAT lamp has the interesting ability to generate light if you fuel it with water. Yeah, it sounds outrageously futuristic, but the system is actually not that strange. The water combines with a hydroelectric battery to generate an electrochemical reaction that lights it up.\n9. Amazon Trash can\nNow this is truly futuristic! The Amazon Trash can has a tiny camera and a bar code scanner that records everything you throw away — from household cleaning supplies to milk cartons — and sends the information to Amazon.com, where it is immediately reordered and shipped to you. No more grocery lists\n10.
