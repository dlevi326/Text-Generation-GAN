Internal auditors at Volkswagen found the letter, according to the German newspaper.\nSpokesmen for Bosch and Volkswagen declined to comment on the report.\nVolkswagen installed in some 11 million vehicles engine-management software that made bench-test emissions appear lower than they were on the road. The German car maker replaced its chief executive this week after the manipulation was discovered.\nWrite to Friedrich Geiger at friedrich.geiger@wsj.com\n 27, 2015 09:05 ET (13:05 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T17:17:30.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
