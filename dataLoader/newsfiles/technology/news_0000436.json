Prime Minister David Cameron speaking at Tech City in East London Tweet \nThe introduction of computer programming to the school curriculum, East London's booming Tech City and the \"Dragons' Den effect\" has helped to boost the industry, a researcher behind the World Economic Forum's new Global Competitiveness Study added. \nMeasures reflecting the advances and world-class competitiveness in the UK technology and start-ups industry include ranking fifth in the world for the availability of latest technologies, eighth for cluster development and 10th for capacity for innovation, the report found. \nThe UK also came second worldwide for the quality of its scientific institutions, fourth for its university and industry collaboration in research and development and fourth for its capacity to attract skilled workers. \nThe 2015-2016 report, an annual assessment of the factors driving productivity and prosperity in 140 countries, placed the UK 10th overall for competitiveness, dropping one place since last year to return to its position of 2013. \nDr Robyn Klingler-Vidra, an international political economy lecturer and senior researcher at LSE Enterprise who worked on the study, said: \"We have seen an advance in technology prowess in the UK and this is certainly down to things such as Tech City and the change in national curriculum in 2014. \n\"The global competitiveness of the tech sector in the UK is growing and an area to be really excited about. \n\"Scientific research and universities is also certainly an area of strength. I think it's a combination of outstanding universities and the ideas that are coming out of them combined with what is happening in Tech City that is driving this advance in competitiveness in the tech sector. \n\"Start-ups are something the UK is really encouraging, it's the Dragons' Den effect and it's having an impact. \n\"That gap that exists between scientists in white coats and the business impact of what they are doing - how you connect science with business - is closing.\" \nHowever, the report gives warning signs that the UK is falling short in the needs of its macroeconomic environment, where Government debt and the budget deficit conspire to place it 108th out of 140 countries. \nThe report said: \"The UK has created a good set of conditions for its vibrant service sector to develop and for London to become the epicentre of the European tech and start-up scene. \n\"Although still recovering from the global financial crisis, the UK financial market remains one of world's best developed, able to provide venture capital and equity financing to start-ups and entrepreneurs. \n\"In the long run, the country will have to continue efforts to improve its macroeconomic environment (108th); the Government deficit is still very high (5.7% of GDP, ranked 118th) and its public debt has doubled since 2007, now accounting for almost 90% of GDP (123nd).\" \nGlobally the report found worrying signs that a \"new normal\"' of suppressed economic and productivity growth and persistently high unemployment is damaging resilience and leaving the world vulnerable to another protracted slump, WEF said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:22:37.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
