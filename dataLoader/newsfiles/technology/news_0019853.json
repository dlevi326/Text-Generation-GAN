ThreatSTOP’s cybersecurity services leverage the domain name service (DNS) to provide broad protection at the gateway and in the DNS from malware attacks across the entire network and endpoints, such as servers, laptops and mobile devices. Cybercrime is a growing problem in Japan. According to NHK World News, “In fiscal 2013 alone, more than five million cases were reported in Japan. That's nearly a fivefold increase from a year earlier.” In June it was reported that about 1.25 million personal records were leaked after a cyberattack on the management system of Japan’s pension service.\nThreatSTOP has partnered with Network Value Components, or NVC, a leading distributor for cybersecurity products and services in the region. NVC is credited with successfully introducing best-in-breed vendors to the Japanese market including FireEye, Cisco and Fortinet. ThreatSTOP’s relationship with NVC includes recruiting and managing resellers in Japan, as well as providing sales training and technical support to joint customers.\n“NVC has a history of working with best-in-breed security vendors,” said Susumu Watanabe, founder, chairman and president of Network Value Components. “We entered into a partnership with ThreatSTOP because the service quickly provides value in terms of effectively stopping both inbound and outbound security attacks. We have been very pleased with ThreatSTOP’s performance with key customers in Japan.”\nThreatSTOP delivers a highly scalable defense against advanced attacks by leveraging the power of DNS to protect against any malware type for every device across a network. The ThreatSTOP service resides at the gateway or DNS server to deflect inbound attacks, and prevent existing malware from communicating with threat actors to exfiltrate data.\n“Leveraging world-class partners in region, ThreatSTOP has committed to extending the reach of our security services to companies in Asia Pacific,” said Tom Byrnes, chief executive officer, ThreatSTOP. “Cyberattacks are a global problem, with far reaching effects as witnessed by recent attacks. ThreatSTOP provides a service that helps organizations of all sizes in all regions with an effective defense against the loss of valuable data and theft of resources.”\nAbout ThreatSTOP\nThreatSTOP is a network security company offering a cloud-based threat protection service that protects every device on a network from cyberattacks and data theft.
