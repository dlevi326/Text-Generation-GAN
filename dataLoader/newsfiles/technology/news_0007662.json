Sold to Oceanics plc in 1982, a strategy change saw Valeport put up for sale in 1985, and it was acquired in a management buy out by Charles Quartley, Technical Director of Oceonics. Since then, Valeport has expanded its product range, and developed a strong reputation within the industry for high quality, reliable instrumentation. In 2003, the company outgrew the factory in which it had been based since 1969, and acquired a site a few miles up the river Dart in the historic town of Totnes. The new site met all requirements, and contains all the facilities necessary for the development, production, calibration and testing of all its products.\nIn 2005, Charles stood aside as Managing Director to be replaced by his son Matthew, who has been with Valeport since graduating in 1994. A new investment of $3.6m in a 3.5 story facility was added in 2013 to more than double the workspace to 28,000 sq. ft. and houses the entire production facility with a fully equipped CNC workshop, state of the art calibration laboratory and two floors of ESD protected assembly workshop. The business now employs around 81 staff, and continues to invest heavily both in new product development, and also in all the facilities necessary to manufacture and supply the quality products for which Valeport is known.\nProducts include: Sound Velocity Probes / Sensors, Altimeters, Bathypacks, Depth and Pressure sensors, Radar Level Sensor, Current Meters, Tide Gauges, Wave Recorders, CTD's, Multi-Parameter CTD's, new Fluorometer and optical sensor range, plus a GPS Echo Sounder.\nThe MTR100 is Marine Technology Reporter's Annual report on 100 leading companies in the subsea industry, published in the July/August 2015 edition of MTR - http://www.marinetechnologynews.com/Magazine", "external_links": ["http://www.marinetechnologynews.com/Magazine"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T22:08:57.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
