The Influenza A virus, by contrast, has eight genes. \nIn 2004, US scientists resurrected the notorious \"Spanish flu\" virus, which killed tens of millions of people, in order to understand how the pathogen was extraordinarily so virulent. \nUS researchers flew to Alaska to take frozen lung tissues from a woman who was buried in permafrost. \nBy teasing genetic scraps out of these precious samples and from autopsy tissues stored in formalin, the team painstakingly reconstructed the code for the virus ' eight genes. \nThe work was done in a top-security lab at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T19:42:20.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
