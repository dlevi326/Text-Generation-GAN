The 53-year-old economist also served as labor minister in the previous Syriza-led government, before a reshuffle in July. He has been a party member for decades and has been close to Mr Tsipras.\nGeorge Stathakis, an academic and one of the most market-friendly Syriza members, is expected to return to the economy ministry. The 61-year-old vice-rector of the University of Crete took part in the latest round of tough negotiations with the country's international creditors.\nYannis Dragasakis is expected to retain his position as deputy prime minister, a role he served in the previous term of the left-wing government. The 68-year-old Syriza heavyweight was one of the most moderate figures in the government's previous term, but was also criticised by party officials for his reluctance to be more active in important decisions.\nOther key ministers expected to keep their positions are the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nikos Kotzias, and Defence Minister Panos Kammenos, leader of the government's junior coalition partner: Independent Greeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:12:30.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
