The robust, fully enclosed HDJ-700 is fine-tuned to reproduce rich, clear mid-to-low frequencies for monitoring dance music, and has a simple, sleek design with color options to suit every style. \nThis latest addition takes inspiration from Pioneer DJ’s top-flight headphones – the rotating ear cup with rubber grips enables easy one-ear monitoring, while the replaceable cable prolongs the life of the headphones. With soft, snug-fitting ear pads, and a sturdy, lightweight headband, DJs receive a comfortable fit as well as peace of mind that their headphones will stay in place. \nAvailable in four designs – matte black, matte black with a gold or red stripe, and cool white – the HDJ-700 has a distinctive style of its own.

Fine-tuned for clear mid-to-low frequencies and accurate monitoring \nThe HDJ-700’s audio circuitry is optimized for monitoring dance music. Narrow ear pads and 40 mm driver units with rare earth magnets ensure a powerful bass sound, while a thicker than usual (19 micrometer) diaphragm and a copper-clad aluminium wire (CCAW) voice coil accurately reproduce kicks and snares. \n2. Tough, durable build and replaceable cables \nThe HDJ-700 inherits a rugged, stainless steel headband from the HDJ-1500 to ensure a long life of service. The headphones come with two interchangeable side-mount cords: a 1.2m coiled cord – which extends to around 3m – and a 1m straight cord. \n3. Soft ear cups for a snug, comfortable fit \nSoft, textured polyurethane ear cups fit the ear snugly and ensure the DJ’s comfort over long periods of use. \n4. Design and rotatable ear cups inspired by the top-flight HDJ-2000MK2 \nSpin-finished aluminium hinges, a lightweight build and the sleek, stylish design are all inspired by Pioneer DJ’s ever-popular flagship headphones. Plus, the HDJ-700’s right earpiece can be rotated forwards or backwards by up to 60 degrees to enable one-ear monitoring, while the handy rubber grip makes it quick and easy to put the cup back in position. \nMAIN SPECIFICATIONS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:50:09.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
