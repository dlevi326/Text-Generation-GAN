The company will unveil “Dexter,” HD’s open-source haptic robot, at both MakerCon and Maker Faire, September 26-27. \nDexter, powered by advanced supercomputing technology, was created by Haddington Dynamics co-founder Kent Gilson, prolific inventor, serial entrepreneur and global pioneer in FPGA-based reconfigurable computing. A winner of multiple high-profile technology innovation awards, Gilson launched seven entrepreneurial ventures before joining Haddington Dynamics. \n\"Kent was the number one expert in reconfigurable computing that I've known,” said Lloyd Reshard, CEO of Cognitive Big Data Systems and former Branch Chief at the Air Force Research Laboratory. “We are excited to partner with Haddington Dynamics to provide an intelligent vision system, enabling Dexter to easily recognize objects for pick-and-place tasks and to identify defects through quality inspections.” \nGilson is joined on the Haddington Dynamics leadership team by two highly-respected, seasoned professionals. President and CEO Richard Fu is a prominent leader in global investment banking and financial services throughout North America and the Asia Pacific Rim. COO Todd Enerson is a multifaceted leader with a strong scientific background, and exceptional success in high-level professional recruitment, sales, marketing and strategic partnerships. \n“I could not be happier for the opportunity to work with Richard and Todd to bring truly transformational technology to market,” said Gilson. “ We are building this company to have real and enduring impact through the creation of robots that enable people to expand their capacity to develop whatever they want to bring into being.” \nHaddington Dynamics leadership envisions that Dexter will develop into an open-source, collaborative global resource that radically bends cost curves for high-performance robotics. \n“We can foresee a time when robots will be as much a part of the societal landscape as tablets and smartphones are now,” said Fu. “We are excited for the opportunity for Haddington Dynamics and Dexter to be part of this extraordinary time of growth for robotics.” \n“The maturation of Dexter is extremely promising and encouraging,” said Enerson. “As the platform progresses, we look forward to establishing productive strategic development partnerships worldwide.“ \nMakers and other interested individuals are invited to visit the Haddington Dynamics booth at MakerCon and Maker Faire. \nAbout Haddington Dynamics \nHaddington Dynamics ( www.hdrobotic.com ), launched in 2015, is the creator of Dexter, a high-precision, high-performance 3D-printed robotics platform powered by advanced supercomputing technology.
