MacGregor receives $21m order for optimized cargo handling systems The engineering solutions and services provider for the offshore and marine industries received a $21 million order for optimized cargo handling systems on five 10,500-TEU containerships currently under construction for ocean carrier Hapag-Lloyd. By Hailey Desormeaux | Tuesday, September 22, 2015 MacGregor, part of cargo handling solutions provider Cargotec, received a $21 million order for optimized cargo handling systems on five 10,500-TEU containerships. The optimized cargo handling systems will include hatch covers, lashing bridges, a loose lashing system and container fittings, along with related software and a lifecycle support package, MacGregor said in a statement. The containerships, which are currently under construction at the South Korean shipyard Hyundai Sambo Heavy Industries for German ocean carrier Hapag-Lloyd, will primarily be deployed on South American routes. With 2,100 reefer plugs, the containerships will be suitable for the transport of fruits, vegetables, meat, fish and pharmaceutical products, Hapag-Lloyd said. In addition, the containerships will be equipped with a highly efficient main engine, an optimized hull shape and an innovative lashing and loading system for greater loading flexibility. The vessels are scheduled to be delivered between Oct. 2016 and May 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:09:40.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
