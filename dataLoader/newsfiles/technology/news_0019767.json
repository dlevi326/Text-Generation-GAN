The next closest deal was the 2010 pact to buy QNX for $200-million, the connected car platform that then became the core of the BB10 operating system. BNN Video Sep. 04 2015, 12:28 PM EDT Video: Why BlackBerry bought Good \nMr. Chen has been telling investors the company was still shopping for security-focused companies to add to his stable, and with this move he also manages to take out a competitor. \nBoth companies provide mobile-device-management software that provides security for enterprise, business and government entities. In recent years, Good has found success in wooing customers who lean toward Apple’s iOS devices, and as Mr. Chen acknowledges, Good has done better than BlackBerry in signing up defence and aerospace contracts. In some cases, that business was signed away from BlackBerry. \nMr. Chen claims that Good has annual revenue in the $200-million range, and that BlackBerry will realize close to $160-million GAAP revenue from Good in the first year, assuming the deal passes muster with regulatory bodies in Canada and the U.S. \nThat would go a long way to earning BlackBerry $500-million a year in software, something Mr. Chen has been touting as a goal of his turnaround plan. Earlier acquisitions in Mr. Chen’s tenure have had the same goal: Secusmart, WatchDox, Movirtu and AtHoc (that last purchase has yet to close). \n“We secure voice, we secure file sharing, secure alert messaging” says Mr. Chen. “You could see we have a very secure mobile communication platforms. We look at this as end-point connectivity… [the devices] could be ours, or anyone’s.” \nRelations between BlackBerry and Good have been tense at times. In January, 2015, after Good announced a new system that would make it possible to measure a smartphone user’s personal and business data usage, BlackBerry posted a version of Good’s release that it had annotated with red ink, questioning its novelty and promoting its own, competing service. \n“We are in an incredibly competitive market and speak to many of the same customers. What has been clear throughout has been that Good and BlackBerry share similar philosophies,” said Good chief executive officer Christy Wyatt in an interview posted on BlackBerry’s news site on Friday. \nWith files from Reuters Follow Shane Dingman on Twitter: @shanedingman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:50:42.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
