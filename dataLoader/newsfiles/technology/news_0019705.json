Parties have 15 days to respond. \nThe report was released Monday, a day before a new law took effect barring Texas cities and towns from banning hydraulic fracturing , or fracking, and limiting local authority to restrict other oil and gas operations. \nReno Mayor Lynda Stokes, whose city passed an ordinance banning injection wells , said she wasn't surprised by the commission's findings and wasn't sure what legal recourse was available. \n\"They've pretty much given industry free reign to roll over us,\" she told The Associated Press. \nThe study published by Southern Methodist University geologists in April pinned the earthquakes to an XTO well and a well operated by Houston-based Enervest. \nThe study concluded that the quakes were triggered by rumblings in the shallow Ellenburger formation that migrated down the fault into the deepest layer of rock. The companies denied any connection.

Oklahoma geology group links earthquakes to oil waste wells April 21, 2015 \nThe Oklahoma Geological Survey said Tuesday it is \"very likely\" that most of the state's recent earthquakes were triggered by the subsurface injection of wastewater from oil and natural gas drilling operations.
