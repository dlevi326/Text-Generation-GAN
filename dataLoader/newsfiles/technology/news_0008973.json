License-free operation: retailers do not have to pay for regulatory licenses or administrative fees. Ease of use: the radios are designed for easy operation, and feature voice prompts and intuitive navigation menus. Extreme range: the radios deliver clear communications indoors or outdoors, covering up to 300,000 square feet/20 floors. Enhanced audio clarity: the radios operate in the 900 MHz ISM, which allow retail staff to experience crystal clear, static-free communication across extended ranges. Enhance security & asset management: staff can quickly communicate security issues or shoplifting incidents. Lightweight design: retail staff can conveniently wear the radios on their belt, or carry it in their pocket. Private communications: the radios use hopping technology to continually change frequencies, thus making it virtually impossible for unauthorized parties to listen in. Furthermore, since the radios are digital, there is no risk of having communications overheard by unauthorized parties who are on over-subscribed analog channels. Durable, rugged design: the radios are designed to withstand rigorous use, unlike smartphones that can scratch and break with relative ease. Long battery life: the radios feature 14-hour battery life and easy recharging in their individual charging units. Multi-unit chargers that charge up to 12 radios at a time are also available. Other special features of the new DLR Digital two-way radios include: private reply, direct call, call all available, instant mute, talk permit tones, home channel, advanced configuration menus, and antimicrobial protection that inhibit the growth of bacteria and mold on radio surfaces.\nMore information on the groundbreaking new DLR Digital two-way radios can be found on the 2Way Supply website: http://2waysupply.com\nAbout 2Way Supply\n2Way Supply is an authorized Motorola dealer specializing in Motorola 2Way radios, parts and accessories.
