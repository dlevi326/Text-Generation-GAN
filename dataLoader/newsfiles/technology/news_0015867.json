By Neal Colgrass   28, 2015 4:00 PM CDT COMMENTS (8) (Newser) – If you're using iOS 9 and your data rates are reaching new highs, watch out for an otherwise-useful feature called \"Wi-Fi Assist.\" It automatically allows your phone to download data via your cellular plan when Wi-Fi coverage isn't great, ZDNet explains, which is fine—but can lead to high bills if, say, your office Wi-Fi is poor. You can turn it off at Settings > Cellular (called Mobile Data in certain areas) by scrolling to the bottom of the page for the toggle. You can also go to Settings > Cellular to see how much data you've already consumed this month, Quartz notes. Some users have already found surprises there: I usually use 1-2GB of mobile data a month, this month I’m up to 7. I suspect iOS 9 wifi assist, anybody else?— Jim Ray (@jimray) September 24, 2015 Pretty certain ios9's \"wifi assist\" is responsible for my last huge 4g data bill. http://t.co/NNFRkX7kgn — Dan Walsh (@travors) September 24, 2015 Customers try out a new Apple iPhone 6S at an Apple store on Chicago's Magnificent Mile, Friday, Sept. 25, 2015, in Chicago.
