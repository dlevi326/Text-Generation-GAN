The case was later transferred to the Northern District of California. The ‘928 patent, entitled, “system for viewing content over a network and method therefor,\" covers a method of browsing the Internet idea in which users obtain an animated icon and then obtain enhancements such as clothing or hats at other websites. Segan accused Zynga of infringing with its FarmVille game, in which users interact with other \"farmers\" on Facebook by buying and selling virtual livestock or crops. \nAt an April, 2015, summary judgment and claim construction hearing, Judge Chhabria stated that, under his interpretation of the patent, Zynga’s games do not infringe the ‘928 patent. The next week, the Court entered judgment in favor of Zynga. Zynga then asked the court to sanction Segan and its counsel and order them to pay Zynga its attorneys’ fees and costs, saying that “no reasonable litigant” could believe it could prevail on Segan’s claim construction positions, which “stretched well beyond reasonable.” \nJudge Chhabria awarded all of the fees and costs sought by Zynga, calling them not only reasonable but \"on the low side for a case like this, particularly considering the high quality of the representation Zynga received.\" The Court sanctioned Segan’s outside counsel, finding the pre-filing investigation was inadequate, finding “this was not a case in which attorneys investigated a potential claim on behalf of their client and concluded it had merit based on partial information, only later to learn that their information was wrong.” \nSegan LLC v. Zynga, Inc., Case Number 3:14-cv-01315, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:41:02.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
