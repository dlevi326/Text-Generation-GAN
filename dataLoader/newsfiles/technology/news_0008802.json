Major changes come in the midst of strong industry growth, increasing interest from investor communities, and intense merger and acquisition activity. \n“Trimble maintained its number one position thanks to its geographical footprint, wide range of product features, technology versatility through an increasing number of subsidiaries, and growing market share driven by PeopleNet’s acquisition of Cadec in the private trucking market and organic growth in the field services market,” comments VP and GM Dominique Bonte. \nTelogis kept its second rank with combined innovation excellence and healthy subscriber growth through a flexible platform approach which enables key partnerships with commercial vehicle OEMs and mobile players such as Apple. \nOmnitracs moved up from last year’s seventh place, re-entering the top three through product improvements and solid subscriber growth fueled by acquisitions like XRS and a clear vision for sustainable growth. \nIn terms of technological innovations, vendors are vying for leadership in software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud platforms, OBD plug-and-play hardware, convergence (smartphone and tablet adoption), OEM implementations, and open platforms kick-starting fledgling application marketplaces. \nThese findings are part of ABI Research’s Commercial Vehicle Telematics Market Research ( https://www.abiresearch.com/market-research/service/commercial-vehicle-telematics/ ). \nABI Research provides technology market research and technology intelligence for industry innovators.
