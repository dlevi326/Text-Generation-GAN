There had to be a better model, and we decided to invent something completely new,” said GRELIS founder Tom Rapko .\nBy transforming the traditional pay-per-click internet keyword ad model into a rental agreement, GRELIS offers advertisers the ability to still target certain keywords, but also the commitment of top placement with unlimited click-throughs for their ads.\n“As the top global real estate search engine, GRELIS wants to team-up with travel resorts, airlines, and leading mortgage companies, amongst other key team members, to make the user experience phenomenal. The keyword rental program is a huge factor in making that happen; GRELIS can now offer both the most relevant property listings and ancillary services at the same time,” Rapko added.\nRapko pointed out that there are already three ads running; one for a scuba diving operation in Indonesia , another for a travel agency in Colorado, and another for a real estate development firm in Baja, Mexico.\nGRELIS is a timely search engine given that many Americans are still reeling from the 2008-2009 recession coupled with nearly two decades of wage stagnation. Realizing that the American Dream may now mean living overseas, GRELIS offers the opportunity to locate “that perfect home” anywhere in the world. The platform boasts over 30 million keyword search results with listings that fit neatly into every budget, from extravagant to “dirt cheap.”\nAbout GRELIS: Founded in 2015 with a logo literally made from baby blocks, GRELIS was designed as a real estate search engine to find cool scuba diving locations; it has morphed into one of the largest server-busting real estate platforms on the internet with over 30,000,000 keyword search results supporting over 1,000,000 unique property listings worldwide.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12966480.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.grelis.com/Search/Sale/fiji", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12966480.htm", "http://www.grelis.com/Search/Sale/baja", "http://www.twitter.com/tomrapko", "http://www.grelis.com/Search/Sale/indonesia"], "published": "2015-09-20T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T17:12:16.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
