It helps us put into perspective just how wrong it was to accuse this bright, innocent boy of something so sinister.\nA video posted to YouTube skewers the issue spectacularly. Titled “Ahmed has a clock!”, the parody shows a small boy tinkering with the family clock in his bedroom when his uncle walks in.\n“Hey there, bud. What are you doin’?” he asks the boy.\n“The clock isn’t working.” he responds.\nHis uncle turns and dials 911, where he speaks with a dispatcher who, after being told a child is playing with a clock, begins to panic.\n“What’s your emergency,” the dispatcher asks.\n“My nephew is playing with a clock. His name is Ahmed.”\nThe dispatcher removes his headphones and tells his colleagues, who also freak out, tossing papers in the air.\nWhen the uncle tells the operator the boy is asking for batteries, he is told: “He is trying to arm the bomb”.\n“He’s got double-As, he’s got double-As,” the dispatcher repeats.\nAhmed’s story made international headlines after the teen, who loves tinkering with electronics, took his invention into class at MacArthur High School in Texas. When it began ticking, his English teacher called the principal.\nAhmed smiling and happy. Picture: LM Otero Ahmed confused upon being arrested. Picture: Eyman Mohamed The boy was interviewed by police, placed in handcuffs and had his belongings raided.\nThe arrest sparked outrage and led to numerous offers of support from as high up as the oval office.\nPresident Obama tweeted: “Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House?”\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg tweeted: “Having the skill and ambition to build something cool should lead to applause, not arrest. The future belongs to people like Ahmed.\n“Ahmed, if you ever want to come by Facebook, I’d love to meet you. Keep building.”\nOn Wednesday, Police Chief Larry Boyd said Ahmed would not be charged with possessing a hoax bomb because there was no evidence he meant to cause alarm at his school.\nBoyd said that although the clock looked “suspicious in nature,” he considered the case closed. “We live in an age where you can’t take things like that to school,” he said.\nAsked if Ahmed’s religious background factored into his arrest, Boyd said the response “would have been the same” under any circumstances.\nOnline, #IStandWithAhmed is trending. Rightfully so.\n ‘He is trying to arm the bomb’", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IStandWithAhmed&src=tyah", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/20Zzyf67e7Q", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/parody-of-ahmed-mohamed-debacle-appears-on-youtube-as-istandwithahmed-trends/story-fnda1lbo-1227533067836?sv=f4f8154f2fa6b3b3c841c846b8736eb8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0c837fa4918e7bb5cff4c8d9549db3de", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cc4604e2d465f1d960b0bcf0fa1257ff", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/barack-obama-praises-muslim-boy-arrested-for-bringing-homemade-clock-to-school/story-fngqim8m-1227530988060", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9b0c6fc39a127a4d7ba7692c13e0a359?width=316&api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/80756c0de7b02dcbd641af0629e54f44", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4e4e53675f59402b1db85076e2dcd78b", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1c14ce3ac6209d496d427ed073ef696d?width=316&api_key=zw4msefggf9wdvqswdfuqnr5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3f0a5f26e5edfe36278e9132cea27bf8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ebd9875e3eb5b5be42bc0260b8e1a14a"], "published": "2015-09-18T10:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T00:23:17.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
