The company has made generally available two product enhancements, namely its drop points and scheduled return features. \nWith drop points, Luxe says that it’s responding to inquiries from customers asking about the best places to drop-off and pick-up their cars. Now you need only open up the iOS or Android app, type in the address where you’re going, and it will display on the map blue points nearest that location where you can drop-off or pick-up your car. Unfortunately this feature, while open to the public, is available in the Financial District and South of Market neighborhoods of San Francisco. Other cities are being planned in the future. \nTo encourage customers to use these designated locations, Luxe says it’s going to be “offering Drop Point locations at better prices than the surrounding neighborhood, during rush hour times when things are busiest and most frantic, and where we do see some of the biggest of demand-based pricing.” \nProviding lower fares to customers in Drop Point locations is similar to many other on-demand services, specifically with Uber and Lyft. The former is testing so-called “smart routes” with its UberPool service that lets you pay less money just by walking a little bit further to meet your driver. The latter has had HotSpots for its Lyft Line offering that also offered you savings just by going to a designated location. \nIn July, Luxe revealed that it was testing out a new feature that let you schedule when you’d want your car returned. The idea is that if customers have a specific schedule they’re keeping to, they can let the system know when and where to drop off the vehicle. Today, scheduled returns is now available to all Luxe customers in all cities. \nPhil Farhi, Luxe’s VP of product management, shared in a blog post: “Scheduled Returns is all about giving you greater convenience, flexibility and the ability to plan ahead so you don’t need to stress or waste time by waiting for your vehicle.” \nThese updates are all believed to further Luxe’s goal of helping make it less stressful to park a car in a city, at least if you’re in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Boston, and soon New York City, Washington, DC, Austin, and Philadelphia. \nTo access these features, just update your Luxe app in the App Store and/or Google Play.
