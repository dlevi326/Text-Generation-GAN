Although we had a lot of 3D printed components the 3D printing of tooling was more critical.” \nA specific example of this is the car’s dive planes on the very front of the car, their design hugely effects the aerodynamics and therefore performance of the car. \n“The profile of those is very sensitive to the performance of the car so we had lots of iterations, all of the tooling was done using 3D printing. This meant that we could get iteration in a matter of days whereas a traditional lead time for a carbon composite part like that is 6-7 weeks.” \nThat time compression is hugely beneficial to any race team, 3D printing gave Strakka’s engineers more freedom to create parts that were lightweight and aerodynamic. The time also came in handy when the team ran into some regulatory problems. \n“The FIA took issue with our door system,” details Walmsley. “Very late in the day we had to develop a new system, 3D printing the jigs and fixtures meant we were able to have a totally new and compliant system within days.” \nThe Strakka racecar can be seen at the entrance of TCT Show + Personalize over the course of the next two days and the team will be hanging out on the Stratasys booth should you have any pressing questions.
