Around five lakh people will join us when the march reaches Surat,\" he said.\nHe claimed that around 15 lakh people from the Patel community will join the reverse march when it will reach Ahmedabad.\nHardik said Patel leaders in villages en route to this march are given the task of strengthening the organisation over the issue. \"Entire India will have a close watch over the reverse Dandi march,\" he said.\nThe 22-year-old Hardik has been hogging the national limelight after his aggressive speech at August 25 mega-rally of Patels at GMDC ground here. His detention had set off massive violence, claiming 10 lives and imposition of curfew in many parts of the state.\nThe Dandi March led by Mahatma Gandhi in 1930 was an important part of the Independence movement and Hardik's move to choose that location for strengthening his agitation is viewed as a message to various stake-holders.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T00:06:27.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
