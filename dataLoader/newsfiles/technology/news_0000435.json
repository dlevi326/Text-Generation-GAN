As a battery occupies the maximum space in a mobile device, central processor unit, graphics processing unit, memory, as well as other sub-processors are integrated onto a single chipset, referred to as SoC. The ARM provides the architecture for the mobile application processor, and manufacturers use the architecture as the base for developing chipsets. Companies such as Qualcomm and Apple license the instruction set from ARM and develop their own processor based on ARM guidelines. However, some companies like Samsung license ARM's application processor design and use it directly.
