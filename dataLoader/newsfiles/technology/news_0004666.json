\nChina's economy expanded 7.3 percent last year, the weakest pace since 1990, and slowed further to 7.0 percent in each of the first two quarters this year. \nThe government has cut interest rates five times since November as part of efforts to shore up growth. \nIt also lowered the Chinese currency's central rate against the US dollar by nearly five percent in a week, which should make Chinese goods cheaper overseas. \nThe finance ministry earlier this month also vowed to adopt \"stronger\" fiscal policies. \nBut authorities' aggressive intervention to try to shore up share prices as a bubble burst on China's own stock exchanges has raised questions over their economic management and commitment to market reforms. \nCapital Economics analyst Julian Evans-Pritchard said current pessimism about China was \"overdone\". \nThe country still faces \"structural drags\" on growth including a continued slowdown in property construction, he said. \nBut key leading indicators such as fiscal spending and credit growth were showing positive signs. \n\"We continue to expect a cyclical recovery in economic activity over the coming quarters,\" he wrote in a note. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T17:47:48.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
