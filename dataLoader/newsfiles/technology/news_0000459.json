Otto is HashiCorp's eighth open source project, and builds on the success of Vagrant, the company's first open source tool. \n\"We've put tremendous trust in the full suite of HashiCorp tools to be the foundation of our infrastructure at Conde Nast Commerce. The simplicity that Otto brings will now make our lives as developers and operators easier, save us time, and improve our productivity,\" said Ben McRae, Head of Technical Operations at Conde Nast Commerce. \"The industry has needed this kind of abstraction in ops for a long time, and it's finally here with Otto.\" \nVagrant was created in 2010 by Mitchell Hashimoto to solve the problem of managing local development environments. While Vagrant excels at development, Otto takes a leap forward and brings the same clean user experience to both development and deployment. Just as the command `vagrant up` brought simplicity to development, `otto deploy` brings a new generation of simplicity and power to complete application delivery. \n\"Otto is the successor to Vagrant and completes the HashiCorp vision for application delivery, building upon Vagrant, Packer, Terraform, Serf, Consul, Vault, and Nomad. Otto presents an efficient simple developer and operator experience and Atlas is the powerful management and collaboration counterpart,\" said Mitchell Hashimoto, co-founder and CEO of HashiCorp. \"Otto builds upon five years of Vagrant success, active development, and user feedback to deliver on the promise of simple, reliable, and secure application delivery.\" \nThe DevOps movement reaches a broad audience with the promise of faster, safer application and infrastructure management. But the learning curve and operational complexity for achieving these promises imposes a significant barrier to entry. Otto addresses this hurdle as a single, elegant tool for configuring scalable, secure, and resilient microservice-based applications. To collaborate on Otto's configuration file, securely store credentials, save configurations, and enforce access control policies, Otto requires HashiCorp's commercial product Atlas. Atlas is the management hub for the HashiCorp ecosystem of tools. The relationship between Otto and Atlas is similar to the relationship between Git and GitHub. \n\"The lack of parity between development and production environments is a huge issue for enterprises today, both modern and traditional,\" said Donnie Berkholz, research director at 451 Research. \"HashiCorp is targeting this problem with its open-source release of Otto in an effort to move beyond Vagrant to a tool that supports both development as well as deployment.\" \nDevelopment, operations, and security teams collaborate on the design of applications and infrastructure through Otto's codified Appfile. Appfiles are a simple high-level specification that declare complex, multi-tier applications which can be deployed to multiple infrastructure providers as VMs or containers. \nFor experienced users, Otto's Appfile specification still generates the configuration files for HashiCorp's seven open source tools for service configuration, service deployment, environment provisioning, service discovery, and security policy. This means an application architecture can be fine-tuned to match the exact needs of the business. \nManaging the entire application delivery stack from development to production with HashiCorp tools presents significant advantages. Application code can be packaged as a VM or container with Packer, deployed with Nomad into an environment provisioned by Terraform, maintained by Consul, and secured by Vault. Otto takes this complexity and abstracts it away into one configuration to manage local environments with Vagrant or manage test, staging, and production environments with Atlas for AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, OpenStack, and more. Atlas runs these processes, so teams can ensure that all changes are versioned, auditable, collaborative, and policy-enforced. With these tools, HashiCorp powers application delivery done right. \nAlso today HashiCorp released Nomad, a scheduler which complete HashiCorp's functional suite of open source projects for application delivery done right: http://www2.marketwire.com/mw/release_html_b1?release_id=1219542 . \nAvailability Otto is free and open source, and available to download today at https://ottoproject.io . Atlas is available today -- go to https://atlas.hashicorp.com to sign up for a free Atlas account or request information on private deployments. Atlas pricing is $40/node/month with the first 10 nodes free. Development features are also free, which include Vagrant box hosting, Packer builds, and artifact storage. \nAbout HashiCorp HashiCorp is a leader in DevOps solutions for the modern datacenter.
