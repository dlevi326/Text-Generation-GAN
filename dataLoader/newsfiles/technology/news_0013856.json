Imagine being surrounded by dolphins, hearing their clicks and squeaks. The Dolphin Swim Club allows users to dive into the world of wild dolphins through a unique experience in virtual reality. They will produce a series of five virtual reality movies with the most stunning encounters with wild dolphins in the great open oceans. It will be a series that users can download on their mobile smartphone and that they can experience through The Dolphin Swim Club customized virtual reality goggles or any other VR goggles.\nFor every swimmer, each movie is a different experience every time they look at it, as they can see it in any number of ways. For The Dolphin Swim Club, it’s not only about sharing the joy, playful spirit and beauty of the dolphins, but it is also about education. Everyone, especially children, should be able to experience dolphins in their natural habitat. However, before everyone can enjoy virtually swimming with dolphins, the Dolphin Swim Club needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise €67,500 by November 3, 2015.\nTo help bring this virtual reality experience to life, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered by December 2015.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help The Dolphin Swim Club reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: Marijke Sjollema\nTitle: Founder of the Dolphin Swim Club\nPhone: +31.6.23169603\nemail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
