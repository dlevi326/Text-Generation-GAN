For that, they tend to be laminar and usually thin. No definitions of electronics and electrical sectors are fully watertight but it is convenient to consider stretchable electronics as a part of printed electronics, a term taken to include printed and potentially printed (e.g., thin film) electronics and electrics. This is because the cost, space and weight reduction sought in most cases is best achieved by printing and printing-like technologies. \nMain areas the report covers: \nThe report examines how stretchable technology fits into the electronics and end user markets, the materials and applications that look most promising, and the lessons of success and failure. Profiles of 56 organizations that have made significant advances are provided. \nForecasts: \nAt this early stage forecasting is difficult but we give some indications for the next ten years and reveal many key trends. We provide forecasts for allied sectors such as printed and flexible electronics which interrelate to stretchable electronics. \nKey Topics Covered: \n1. Executive Summary and Conclusions \n2.
