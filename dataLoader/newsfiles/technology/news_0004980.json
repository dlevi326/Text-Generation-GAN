Sounds a bit pricey, except the Craigslist ad says it comes with tickets to see Pope Francis. Same with the $10 train passes marked up to $85 in another listing.\nWith the wildly popular pontiff's US tour shifting to New York on Thursday night and Philadelphia for the weekend, ticket scalpers are getting creative to make sure their listings don't get deleted or lost among dozens of ticket offers pouring in daily.\nThe same tickets that papal visit organisers doled out free of charge through parishes and online giveaways weeks ago are available on the online gray market with hefty price tags.\nWant a chance to see Pope Francis roll through New York's Central Park on Friday? That'll be $100. Or maybe you want to see him on stage alongside Mark Wahlberg, Aretha Franklin and Sister Sledge. Tickets to the Festival of Families in Philadelphia on Saturday are going for as low as $25.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T16:16:16.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
