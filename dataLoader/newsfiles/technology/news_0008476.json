The first in-Hadoop document database will allow developers to quickly deliver scalable applications that also leverage continuous analytics on real-time data. \nWith these major enhancements, developers benefit from the advantages of a document database combined with the scale, reliability and integrated analytics of enterprise-grade Hadoop and Spark. These capabilities will enhance an organization’s ability to improve a range of use cases -- from personalizing and delivering the best online shopping experience, to reducing risk and preventing fraud in real-time, to improving manufacturing efficiencies and lowering costs. To help developers experiment and experience MapR-DB, a developer preview with sample code is available for download . \nThe MapR Distribution including Hadoop is uniquely architected to serve as a single platform for running analytics and operational applications. MapR-DB enables continuous analytics on real-time data, while reducing cluster sprawl, eliminating data silos, and lowering the TCO of data management. The native JSON support in MapR-DB also enables faster time-to-value by letting developers quickly stand up more business applications on more data types and sources. MapR-DB supports the Open JSON Application Interface (OJAI TM ), which is designed to be a general purpose JSON access layer across databases, file systems, and message streams, enabling a flexible and unified interface to work with big data. \n“MapR continues to build on the innovative data platform at the core of its Hadoop distribution,” said Nik Rouda, senior analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group. “The addition of a document database capability (JSON) neatly extends the powerful NoSQL MapR-DB to seamlessly cover more types of unstructured business data. This makes it faster and easier to build big data applications, without the burden of shuffling data around first.” \n“MapR enables enterprise developers to create new value-added applications which they have only dreamed about so far,” said Anil Gadre, senior vice president, product management, MapR Technologies. “By deeply integrating a NoSQL document database deep into our platform, developers can quickly build new applications which demand ultra-low latency and huge flexibility in supporting different types of data all in one cluster.” \nWith these new capabilities, developers can: Build and deploy scalable JSON-based applications – shorten application development cycles and avoid complex persistence methods while having the power to handle production workloads and global deployments Run continuous analytics – develop rich applications that leverage large scale, real-time analytics Gain faster time-to-value – quickly stand up more business applications on more data types and sources using familiar JSON patterns \n“Cisco and MapR have a strong relationship working together and driving joint innovations. We see this trend continuing with the addition of native JSON capabilities into the MapR-DB in-Hadoop NoSQL database,” said Raghunath Nambiar, distinguished engineer and chief architect for big data solutions engineering for Cisco. “This new release with the OJAI interface enables organizations to capture and analyze complex data types generated by the Internet of Things and the new generation of big data applications. Combining MapR-DB with Cisco UCS® provides a new level of continuous, large-scale analytics and faster time-to value to our customers.” \nSoftware partner Visual Action has already begun integrating its Flaremap visualization software with the new JSON capabilities in MapR-DB and Apache Spark. “We’re excited to be one of the first partners to work with the new document database capabilities in MapR-DB,” said Jim Bartoo, CEO, Visual Action. “Complex and extremely large JSON documents, like those generated by oil and gas applications, need a fast, scalable and reliable platform. By combining MapR-DB with our front-end Flaremap visualization software, our joint customers will be able to immediately analyze and chart huge volumes of JSON operational data and quickly make decisions that can positively impact operations.” \nAvailability \nA developer preview package of MapR-DB with native JSON support is available immediately and can be downloaded here . General availability of these new capabilities in MapR-DB will be next quarter. \nMapR will showcase its in-Hadoop document database at Strata Conference + Hadoop World, New York, in Booth #519. \nTo see an interactive demo application of the new MapR-DB JSON capabilities with Visual Action’s visualization software visit here . \nTweet this: MapR introduces industry’s first in-Hadoop document database http://bit.ly/1gyR1BP \nAbout MapR Technologies MapR provides the industry's only big data platform that combines the processing power of the top-ranked Hadoop with web-scale enterprise storage and real-time database capabilities, enabling customers to harness the enormous power of their data.
