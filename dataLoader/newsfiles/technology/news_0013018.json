This news follows a recent announcement that it had also slashed a service on the Far East Asia-Europe service with 2M partner MSC. \nMaersk said: \"The closure of the ME5 will result in a capacity reduction corresponding to approximately 16% of our dedicated West Central Asia-Europe service capacity.”\nNils Anderson, CEO of Maersk, said: \"We look at our capacity all the time, but we did not expect Asia-Europe volumes to decline one year ago when we planned our capacity; we overestimated growth. This is a slow growth market.”\nMaersk Line expects demand for seaborne container forecasts to grow by between 2-4%, which is slightly lower than its previous prediction of between 3-5%.\nThe company has recently acted on its decision to acquire 11 container terminals from terminal operator Grup TCB under its port arm, APMT. \nThe move was made to bolster its presence in Latin American markets, where the growth rate is perceived to be high.\nNils concluded that due to its strong financial position, the group are in a good position to invest in new growth opportunities.\nFor all the latest on Maersk, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T18:34:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
