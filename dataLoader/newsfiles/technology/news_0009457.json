Programs work identically no matter where in the world programmers are located and clients receive consistent performance of their output. Global Feasibility and Investigator Grant Assessment Capabilities : Also in March 2015, to increase the accuracy and efficiency of site selection and feasibility analysis, SynteractHCR incorporated the use of IMS Health Tool.
