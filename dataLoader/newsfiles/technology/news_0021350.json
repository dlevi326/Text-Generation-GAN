There were no device-related infections or chronic electrical failure.\nAmong the five device dislodgements observed, device embolization to the lung occurred in three subjects and migration to the right femoral vein in two subjects.\nA sub-analysis looking at complications and operator experience suggests the SADE rate \"would be expected to improve with increased operator experience,\" noted Dr. Reddy.\n\"With the exception of one operator, none of the other operators in this trial had any prior clinical experience with implantation of the device.\"\nWhen cases were stratified according to the first 10 devices implanted versus subsequent implants by the same operator, the procedural SADE, device dislodgement, and cardiac perforation rates changed from 6.8% to 3.6% (P=0.6), 1.3% to 0.0% (P=0.9), and 1.5% to 1.8% (P=0.6), respectively.\n\"These multicenter data represent the largest population of patients to receive a leadless pacemaker system and as such provide unique insight into their efficacy and safety,\" concluded Dr. Reddy.\n\"When interpreted in the context of limited prior experience of the majority of operators with this new technology, these results provide support for the applicability of this technology in routine clinical practice.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T11:44:38.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
