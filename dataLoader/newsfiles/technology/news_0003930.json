Aside from raising expectations for portable gaming, that extra power will make the new systems the first notebooks that fully support the Oculus Rift VR headset . \nThe big news here is that Nvidia has managed to squeeze a desktop grade GeForce GTX 980 graphics card into a portable machine. Existing laptop GPUs can offer some serious performance, but putting a high-end desktop card into a portable machine could allow for truly uncompromised portable gaming. \nNot only will the Maxwell-based, 2,048 core GPUs allow notebook gamers to run titles like Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and The Witcher III: Wild Hunt at top settings, but it also brings laptop gaming up to the recommended specs for the consumer release of the Oculus Rift. Being able to run the headset, which is set to go sale in Q1 2016 , on a notebook could add a touch of convenience and portability to PC-based VR gaming. \nAside from high-end graphics, the laptops will include fast 7 Gbps memory, 4-8 phase power supplies, and Nvidia's G-SYNC technology , which tackles screen tearing by levelling the refresh rate of the display to match GPU output. The systems will also be built with overclocking in mind, offering full fan control and extreme cooling solutions. \nSo far, six systems have been confirmed that will carry the tech: the Aorus X7 DT, Clevo P870DM and P775DM, MSI GT72 and GT80 and the Asus GX700VO. The last of those systems is perhaps the most interesting, with a water-cooling dock that provides a performance boost when you're at your desk. \nThere's no word yet on pricing or availability for the new systems, but you should be prepared to pay a pretty penny.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T19:53:30.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
