A debris flow touched off by an unstable rock glacier swept down the slope, crushing snow equipment.\nIn another part of the southeast French region, pylons for a ski lift had to be re-planted because the foundation grounds were melting. Elsewhere, retreating glaciers have exposed climbers to new, untested and potentially risky routes, he said.\n\"The rising temperatures in the mountains strongly modify the way people approach the high altitudes,\" Bodin said.\nIn a study released this year in the Journal of Alpine Research, researchers documented 350 rock falls from 2007 to 2014 compared with almost none from 1855 to 1936. They found that of 1,769 pieces of infrastructure - including huts, ski lifts and pipelines - about 10 percent were at high risk of rock fall damage, including Mont Blanc's popular Aiguille du Midi cable car.\nValls is visiting the region to highlight France's role as host in the global summit on climate change at the end of this year.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:08:42.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
