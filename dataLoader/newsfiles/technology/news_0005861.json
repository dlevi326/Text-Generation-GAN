Congress set a deadline of Dec. 31 for freight and commuter rail companies to install the technology, which is known as positive train control , after a California passenger train accident in 2008 killed 25 people. But the new report by the Government Accountability Office , the investigative arm of Congress, found that the vast majority of railroads will not meet that deadline. Amtrak has said it will be able to install and activate the safety systems in the busy Northeast Corridor — which extends from Washington to Boston — by that date, but the new report says that is not the case because parts of that line are owned and operated by different entities. The report said a number of issues had contributed to delays installing the system, including that the technology is new and that there are a limited number of suppliers. The report said the government had also contributed to delays in installation. For example, railroads had to stop construction along tracks on radio poles — which make the GPS technology work — because they had not gone through an environmental evaluation process. The report also found that the Federal Railroad Administration had not provided adequate oversight; it took the agency seven months to review the first safety plan it received from a railroad. Railroads across the country that have not installed and activated the necessary equipment could face federal fines and other mandates if they continue operating without it past Dec. 31, according to the Federal Railroad Administration. The Government Accountability Office report bolsters assertions by some lawmakers that an extension is needed. A Senate bill that was passed in July would push the deadline to 2018. The bill would add money to the Department of Transportation’s budget to help the industry with installation of the technology because the equipment is expensive and time-consuming to install across thousands of miles of track. “Passenger and freight railroads need time beyond the current deadline to finish implementation of a complex system that relies on new technology,” said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. “Failure to extend this legal deadline would create significant hardships for customers and passengers who rely on railroads.” But advocates of greater safety measures for trains said the railroads had been under orders to upgrade their safety systems for years and should have been able to meet the 2015 deadline. The new report echoes findings by the Federal Railroad Administration. A report by the agency last month said that just 29 percent of commuter railroads were expected to complete installation of the safety equipment by the end of 2015. Full implementation of the technology for all commuter lines was projected to be completed by 2020, five years after the deadline, according to the railroad administration.
