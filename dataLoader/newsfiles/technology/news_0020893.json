Dominion’s Democracy Suite elections technology platform will be implemented in Puerto Rico’s elections in 2016.\nSan Juan, Puerto Rico (PRWEB) August 31, 2015\nDominion Voting is pleased to announce that, following a competitive RFP process, it has been selected as the voting system vendor of choice for Puerto Rico. On Monday August 31, 2015, Dominion Voting and the Puerto Rico State Elections Commission (CEE) entered into a contract agreement for the provision, delivery, installation, support and maintenance of Dominion’s Democracy Suite® voting system. Democracy Suite® is the leading secure, transparent, accessible and efficient elections technology platform, certified by the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission to 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines.\nThis comprehensive Democracy Suite® system offers several unique features to enhance the voting experience and process in Puerto Rico. Transparency will be improved through the use of AuditMark®, an exclusive patented Dominion technology which provides a clear ballot-level audit trail, without compromising the confidentiality of the voter’s ballot. This feature not only ensures that voter intent is accurately captured, but also provides a platform for ballot adjudication and review should it be necessary.\nThe Democracy Suite® system, used widely across the United States and Canada, will also allow the CEE to rapidly report unofficial results at the end of Election Day, thanks to the use of secure, encrypted results transmission from the polls to the central CEE office.\nThe Democracy Suite® system purchased by the CEE includes 6,075 ImageCast® Precinct tabulators, the world’s most widely deployed and reliable optical scan tabulator. The ImageCast® Precinct tabulator, which has been used in harsh environments including high humidity tropical areas and mountainous deserts, is a lightweight, compact and robust optical scan tabulator which will serve the needs of Puerto Rican voters for many years to come. In addition to the industry-leading technology described above, Dominion will also provide expert project management and professional support services to ensure a smooth and efficient transition to the new system.\nUpon contract signing, John Poulos, President & CEO of Dominion Voting said “We are greatly honored that the CEE selected Dominion Voting as their partner of choice for elections in Puerto Rico, and we look forward to working closely together in the years to come.” Liza García Rivera, President of the CEE, declared that “Election modernization is an important and complex task, which is why the CEE is very pleased to enter in a contract with Dominion Voting. Their state-of-the-art elections technology and excellent track record as a reliable and professional vendor will help enhance the voting experience and the overall electoral process in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.”\nAbout Dominion Voting\nIn today’s election market, Dominion Voting Systems sets itself apart with a commitment to customer service and a superior use of technology to provide our customers with the best tools possible to solve their election challenges.
