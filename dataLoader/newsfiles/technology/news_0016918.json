Organizations need to take a new, data-centric approach to protecting sensitive information. Central to this is easy and transparent encryption, verifiable identification and policy controls. A data centric approach must remove the burden of security from the business, make it intrinsic to the way organizations operate and subsequently enhance productivity. Businesses must have the tools to operate securely especially when virtually every employee and business partner can land in an attacker’s sight. In this session, Telford will discuss how to deploy a new data centric approach to cyber security and the positive impact it can have on an organization’s productivity and protection. \nAdditional Details: www.cybersummitUSA.com \nAbout Covata \nCovata enables true ownership and control over your data in the cloud and over mobile services.
