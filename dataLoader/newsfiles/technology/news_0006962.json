The Company first became aware of these emails on or about August 31, 2015 when notified by OTC Markets. These were clearly “spam” communications and promotional efforts that had not been authorized or condoned in any manner whatsoever by the company or any of its representatives. We do not know the origin or motive for these promotional efforts and deplore that they have occurred. \nWe recognize that these unauthorized promotional activities are intended to have an effect on the trading activity of the Company’s securities. No officer, director or controlling shareholder of the Company was involved, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever in the creation or distribution of any promotional activities including these email newsletters. No officer, director or controlling shareholder of the Company has engaged in any purchases or sales of the Company’s securities in the immediately preceding six month period. These forms of promotional activities are harmful to the Company, its shareholders and the investment community at large. \nWe do not engage in these forms of investor communications. In the event we have news to impart to our shareholders, investors and other interested parties, we will do so in an appropriate manner in compliance with applicable federal and state rules and regulations governing the form, content and timing of such communications. In the past, the Company has issued convertible securities which contain conversion features allowing conversion into the Company’s common stock at prices that constitute a discount to the current market price at the time of issuance. The existence of these convertible securities may create an incentive for a holder to engage in unauthorized promotional activities of the kind represented by email newsletters. However, none of the Company’s convertible securities are held by an officer, director or controlling shareholder of the Company. \nAbout NanoTech Entertainment, Inc. \nHeadquartered in San Jose, CA, the heart of Silicon Valley, NanoTech Entertainment is a technology company that focuses on all aspects of the entertainment industry.
