Reuters by Paresh Dave\nThe youngest billionaire in the world is Snapchat's 25-year-old chief executive, Evan Spiegel, at $US2.1 billion ($3 billion), Forbes has announced.\nSpiegel and his fellow Snapchat co-founder, Bobby Murphy, both made the Forbes 400 for the first time this year, among 25 new entrants.\nThe financial magazine's listing of the wealthiest Americans stretches from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, at $US76 billion, to Richard Yuengling, president of beer maker D.G. Yuengling & Sons, at $US1.7 billion. With the economy humming along well, the minimum wealth needed to make the cut set a record, Forbes said.\nSpiegel came in at No. 327. Raised in Los Angeles, Spiegel attended Stanford University to study engineering product design but dropped out in his senior year to work full time on what has become one of the most popular apps in the world. Murphy, Snapchat's chief technology officer, was No. 375 at $US1.8 billion.\nHundreds of millions of people, mostly teens and young adults, use Snapchat to keep up with friends, read the news and watch a mix of professionally created and amateur videos. Investors worldwide have put more than $US1 billion into the startup, valuing the company at about $US15 billion. Snapchat celebrated its fourth birthday last Friday with a party that included a cake decorated with smiling versions of its ghost mascot.\nSpiegel has cashed out some of his holdings in the company, but much of his wealth is likely tied up in shares that could fetch big prices if Snapchat goes public in the coming years as he has said it hopes to do. Forbes estimates he controls 13 per cent of Snapchat, and Murphy 11 per cent.\nSpiegel, for one, has stayed in rich company. Paparazzi recently have photographed him with Miranda Kerr, one of the world's wealthiest models, on his arm.\n Other young technology executives dot the 400 list, like ride-hailing app Uber's chief executive, Travis Kalanick. His wealth doubled to $US6 billion in the past year, making him the top gainer, per centage-wise, on the list, Forbes said.\nOracle founder Larry Ellison and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg came in at No. 3 and No. 7, respectively. Ellison's wealth was listed as $US47.5 billion, and Zuckerberg's $US40.3 billion.\nNotably missing from last year's list is Alan Auerbach, chief executive of Los Angeles biopharmaceutical company Puma Biotechnology. His net worth fell from $US1.55 billion to $US590 million as poor trial results have sunk the company's share price about 70 per cent to $US72.32 in the last six months.\nLos Angeles Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:19:38.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
