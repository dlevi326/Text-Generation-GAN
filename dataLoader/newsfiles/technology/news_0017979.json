We have launched devices in India immediately post global launches to offer the best products in the Indian market.

We believe consumers are our inspiration and believe that true innovation transforms technology into important aspect of everyday life”.\nAn elegant full metal uni-body:\nOPPO R7 Plus has a uni-body design; the Smartphone’s dimensions sit at 158 x 82.3 x 7.75mm, whilst weighing 192g. The OPPO R7 Plus aircraft grade magnesium-aluminum alloy uni-body along with 48 polishing processes using anodizing technology. Painted with fine particles of zircon sand, the phone’s smooth metallic surface gives out a premium feel. The unique external antenna design also enables the metallic body to act as the antenna for the entire phone, as 91 per cent of the device is pure metal.\nFor the first time, OPPO has decided to use 2.5D Arc-Edge screen, which adds a seamless finish by enabling slightly rounded glass edges and makes sliding finger much more natural than compared with using a flat plane.\n“Violin arc” rear design for a superior in-hand operation:\nThe rear of OPPO R7 Plus features the first “violin arc” design, while the entire phone embodies OPPO’s dual line philosophy, delivering minimalism in appearance and natural comfort in the hand.\nThe “violin arc “refers to the neck of a violin which has been perfected over many years of refinement to facilitate smooth and accurate motions for complete command of the violin fingerboard, i.e. the curved handle of the violin.\nNever miss a moment with New Flash Shot Technology:\nThe OPPO R7 Plus is equipped with a 13-megapixel rear camera based on Sony IMX278 sensor with RGBW technology, laser focused technology and an 8-megapixel Golden Angle front camera with 80 degree angle. The device’s Schneider-Kreuznach certified lens is said to offer the quality of German craftsmanship.\nThe New Flash Shot Technology, used exclusively for the OPPO R7 Plus, features the standard Contrast Detection Autofocus (AF) and Laser Focus. With the combination of “fast launch, fast focus and stable imaging” clear photos can be taken quickly. The device’s laser autofocus system targets and focuses precisely on a subject in under 0.3 seconds.\nMoreover, the OPPO R7 Plus camera is backed by OPPO’s unique anti-shake optimization algorithm and can take multiple photos in the matter of seconds before and after the pressing of the shutter and choose the clearest one, thus substantially enhancing the clearness of photos.\nOPPO also integrated the “Colorful Night” plug-in, a major attraction of the Pure Image 2.0+ processor, into the basic camera functions of the R7 Plus, so that the camera can automatically detect the scene without any additional plug-in or the night mode enabled and produce high-quality photos under low-light conditions quickly and hassle-free. The device is backed by an exclusive anti-shake optimization algorithm to make photos as clear as possible.\nR7 Lite is integrated with the New Flash Shot featuring the new dual-drive hybrid focus system. This includes the anti-shake optimization, Contrast Detection Autofocus (AF) and the new Phase Detection Auto Focus (PDAF).\nVOOC Flash Charge Technology:\nThe OPPO R7 Plus is backed by a 4100mAh inbuilt lithium-polymer battery. Moreover, it is supported by OPPO’s VOOC rapid charging solution. The VOOC Flash Charger charges amazingly fast, delivering two hours of talk time in five minutes of charging, which makes it perfectly feasible to charge up the R7 Plus in fragmentary time. These features make the R7 Plus perfect for people on the go, as even the shortest charging time can result in extensive phone use.\nFast, Fun and Intelligent:\nWith a Qualcomm MSM8939 1.5GHz Octa-Core processor, OPPO R7 Plus promises to offer strong performance while eating up minimal power. The phone is also the first in the segment to offer 3GB of RAM. It is further equipped with a 32GB ROM, giving 24GB of remaining storage space to the user and also the microSD, enabling extensive support of up to 128GB. The OPPO R7 Plus features a touch-type fingerprint sensor on its back with a higher recognition rate than traditional slide-based fingerprint sensors.\nThe OPPO R7 Lite is powered by an Octa-Core processor (SD615) with a speed of 1.3 GHz. The smartphone is dual-SIM compatible, contains 2GB RAM and 16GB storage, which is expandable up to 128GB using TF Card.\nColorOS 2.1based on Android 5.1 Lollipop:\nBesides an improved operating system and appearance, ColorOS 2.1 comes with a few more added features. The smartphone’s system can be automatically cleared when in sleep mode, while expanded gesture features make using the phone faster and more convenient. The ColorOS features an efficient three-in-one main screen management feature which enables automatic sorting with a shake, quick page shift and group arrangement of icons, to make main screen management easy and hassle free.\nBoth R7 Plus and R7 Lite have Beautify 3.0 which is a customized and specialized effect that matches gender, age, and much more for beauty options. It has 8-skin tone in Beautify 3.0 and 11 different filters in various filter modes.\nOPPO R7 Plus is priced at Rs 29,990 and R7 Lite at Rs 17,990.
