Health and authenticity is important, and the more natural ingredients, the better,” says Essegian. What we’re also seeing in our rankings is the strong growth potential for food and beverages that can be made at home. With time-pressed lifestyles, convenience is extremely important and consumers would be willing to pay more for higher quality foods and drinks that can still give the same core convenience benefit. You have to understand the difference between what they do and what they want. Highly processed or items containing artificial ingredients are not what these consumers want. Quick, convenient prep married to higher quality and authenticity is the solution.” \nWhich food and beverage categories didn’t make the Growth Point top 10? You can see the full list by visiting our web site at www.tnsgrowthpoint.com \nAbout Growth Point \nGrowth Point generates its rankings from TNS’s Consumption Universe, which consists of more than 19,000 consumer interviews and covers 250 food and beverage products in the United States. The analysis combines the degree of unmet consumer needs with the degree of momentum that each product area has — momentum meaning consumers are moving into that product segment rather than moving out of it. Where there is both unmet needs and positive momentum, you have significant growth potential. \nAbout TNS \nTNS advises clients on specific growth strategies around new market entry, innovation, brand switching and customer strategies, based on long-established expertise and market-leading solutions.
