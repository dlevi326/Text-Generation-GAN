They are developed for various fields of testing and measurement in vehicle air conditioning such as comprehensive compressor tests, process visualizations, and component validations (VDA validation tests).\nThese test benches are typically able to undertake performance and efficiency tests of electrical and mechanical compressors and the related acquisition of all relevant physical values like temperature, pressure, speed, torque, voltage, and power.\nFurthermore, they can be used for oil management analysis, fast motion endurance and fatigue testing, NVH measurement, as well as COP determination. Quick compressor exchange along with integrated refrigerant recycling enables quicker test cycles. Additionally, user-defined settings, automated test sequences, and thermodynamic load profiles can be created and executed.\nTwo different versions of IPEcomp are available (for the R134a/HFO-1234yf refrigerants as well as for the R744 refrigerant), but can also be ordered in bespoke versions to fulfill customer specific requirements.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/web-2_-IPEload-03_Panel.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T17:45:41.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
