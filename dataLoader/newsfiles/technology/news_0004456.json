Apple said last week that watchOS 2 would be available on Sept. 16. \nApple limited the availability of the Apple Watch earlier this year after a component supplied by a Chinese company was found to be defective, the Wall Street Journal reported in April. \nThe company also had issues this year with a bug that could cause iPhones to crash when a message containing a specific string of text was received. \nLast year, a bug in Apple's HealthKit health and fitness application platform prevented its release along with the iOS 8 operating system for iPhones and iPads.
