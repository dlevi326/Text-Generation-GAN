The government’s electronic service delivery reform agency, Service NSW, has started work on the preliminary stages of the project.\nIf it succeeds, NSW drivers would be given the option to replace their plastic licence with a digital version that can be stored on and read from their smartphone.\nHowever, speaking at a meeting of the Trans-Tasman Business Circle in Sydney last week, Mr King conceded that getting digital drivers licences up would require a multi-jurisdictional approach and may not even be feasible.\nThe main challenge, Mr King said, was ensuring all state and territory law enforcement bodies — and other organisations that rely on licences for identity checks — could verify that those stored on smartphones were valid.\n“If you take for example the Victorian police, they’re looking for the card. And while we want to enable this from a technology perspective in NSW in terms of both having it on the device (and) also the checking device the Victorian police may not.\n“These are the types of things that we’re working through at the moment. So then the question will be (that) it may be too difficult to do and that could be true,” Mr King said.\nMr King quickly added that, “the good thing about licences is that there are so many of them”.\n“What we’re looking at is starting with some of the easier ones first and use those as a proof of concept before we get to the more complex ones because there are some more complex than others,” he said.\nThe project is part of a wider push to strip tens of millions of dollars in costs associated with printing the 2.8 million plastic licences NSW issues each year.\nThe government’s confidence in announcing the project underscores its early success delivering electronic service reforms. Until 2013 when Service NSW launched, only about 25 per cent of the 40 million transactions the state processes each year could be achieved digitally.\nMr King said that Service NSW had increased that proportion to 37 per cent and that it is set to process its 20 millionth transaction this week.\nMr King said that Service NSW was co-operating with other states and territories to share its experience digitising government services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T07:32:22.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
