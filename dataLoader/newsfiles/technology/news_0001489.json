From the late 1950s to 1985, about 30,000 people worldwide, mostly children, received injections of human growth hormone to treat their short stature. This hormone had been extracted from thousands of human pituitary glands taken from cadavers. Unfortunately some extracts contained prions, abnormal infectious proteins. A small percentage of these patients—up to 6.3%, in one national sample—eventually went on to develop Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a neurological disorder. \nAt the Medical Research Council’s Prion Unit, which opened in London in 1998, Sebastian Brandner conducts post-mortem examinations of people who have died from prion diseases. During an autopsy of several patients who died from CJD acquired through injections of human growth hormone, he noticed something so surprising that he called his colleague, John Collinge, a professor of neurology at University College London, to take a look. What he found were substantial deposits of the amyloid beta protein, one of the two key proteins that Alzheimer discovered in Mrs Deter that are tied to the development of this disease. After conducting eight autopsies, only one patient was found to be entirely free of the protein. \nWhat makes this discovery particularly unusual is that Alzheimer’s is rare in people below the age of 60 and all the patients examined were between 36 and 51 years old. Moreover, the sort of brain pathology the researchers observed is not found in patients who have died from CJD that was inherited or acquired spontaneously. Dr Brandner and Dr Collinge are therefore proposing that when these patients were injected with human growth hormone, it was contaminated not only with prions but also small fragments, or seeds, of the amyloid beta protein—which then spread, rather like CJD, through their brains. Folding wrongly \nAn observational study such as this cannot prove that deposits of amyloid beta were caused by seeds of the protein in contaminated hormone injections. Nonetheless, it is by no means an outlandish theory. In recent years it has become apparent that degenerative brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and motor neurone disease, like prion disease, result from the spread of misfolded proteins. \nProteins are made up of chains of molecules, and to do their job as part of the body’s metabolism they must fold into a precise shape. But sometimes a protein misfolds. Usually misfolded proteins will simply fail to work; occasionally they will work, but wrongly. In CJD, prions misfold and are able to transmit their conformation to other properly folded proteins. In Alzheimer’s it is becoming clear that amyloid beta deposition can also be induced through a prion-like means: misfolded proteins beget more misfolded proteins. \nFor the thousands of people who received injections of human growth hormone prior to its replacement with a synthetic alternative in 1985, this raises the possibility that as they age they may develop Alzheimer’s. At present this is no more than a theoretical possibility, as the autopsied patients with amyloid beta deposits might not have gone on to develop Alzheimer’s. Another possibility that the study cannot rule out, but that the authors think unlikely, is that one type of rogue protein could predispose or even seed the accumulation of another. Thus the injected prion protein might have been the precursor to the amyloid beta. \nDoug Brown, director of the Alzheimer’s Society, says there are too many unknowns in this small study to draw any conclusions about whether the disease could be transmitted. Yet it would be unwise to dismiss the troubling possibility that Alzheimer’s seed proteins, whatever their clinical significance, can be transmitted via certain medical procedures. The authors of the Nature paper say their findings should prompt an investigation into whether other known medical routes of prion transmission—such as contaminated surgical instruments, tissue transplantation and blood transfusion—are relevant to the transmission of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. \nAlthough it is known that amyloid brain deposits can be transmitted between mice via injection of seeds into their abdomens, Dr Collinge points out that epidemiological studies have found no connection between blood transfusions and Alzheimer’s. Animal experiments, however, point to the possibility that seeds of amyloid beta may be transmissible through surgical instruments as, like prions, they stick to metal and are difficult to remove with standard techniques for sterilising instruments. Dr Collinge says that a combination of enzymes and detergents can remove prions from surgical instruments, so it may be possible to do the same with other sticky proteins such as amyloid beta. \nDoubtless there will be much further study on whether some medical procedures could contribute to the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime experts are urging a cautious interpretation of the paper. David Allsop, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Lancaster, says there is no evidence that Alzheimer’s disease can be transmitted from one person to another, or through use of contaminated surgical instruments. Even if amyloid beta seeds are transferable during certain procedures, it is only one of two changes to proteins that are seen in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s. \nAlzheimer’s, as the most common neurodegenerative disorder, demands not only greater understanding of the ways in which seeds of amyloid beta proteins can be transmitted, but also what this actually means when it happens. The abnormalities in Mrs Deter’s brain have been known about for more than 100 years. Yet science is still struggling to understand how the disease actually develops, let alone how it might be stopped.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T23:33:13.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
