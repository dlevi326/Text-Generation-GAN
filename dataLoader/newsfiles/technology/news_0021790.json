Chief Executive Marissa Mayer is expecting twins, Mayer announced via her blog Tuesday.\n\"Since my pregnancy has been healthy and uncomplicated and since this is a unique time in Yahoo's transformation,\" Ms. Mayer wrote, \"I plan to approach the pregnancy and delivery as I did with my son three years ago, taking limited time away and working throughout.\"\nMs. Mayer added that her twin girls are likely to arrive in December.\nIn October 2012, Ms. Mayer had her first child, a son—three months after she assumed the top spot at Yahoo.\nThe chief executive took criticism for her short maternity leave and stirred up a discussion about the potential impact on working moms.\nWithin a year of delivering her son, Ms. Mayer extended Yahoo's parental leave policy to 16 weeks of paid leave for mothers and eight weeks for fathers. In addition, Yahoo gives new parents $500 to spend on expenses such as laundry, housecleaning, food or child care.\nRecently, companies including Netflix Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have announced new maternity and paternity leave policies, with Netflix now offering up to a year of paid leave—generous even by the high standards of Silicon Valley and a move that may pressure other technology employers to improve their baby benefits as they vie for talent.\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com\nSeptember 01, 2015 08:05 ET (12:05 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:53:58.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
