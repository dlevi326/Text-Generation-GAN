It allows them to install or even uninstall different apps as and when the need arises or when budget allows,\" Jacyn adds. \nAs well as having developed many apps in-house, the AppStore is also connected to hundreds of popular web services retailers are already using, made possible through partnerships with the likes of Sage, Paymentsense, MailChimp and Nettl. \nThe Nettl app, for example, allows retailers to design and build a new website and webshop to their specification. Nettl also provides Click & Collect functionality – previously out of reach for small businesses – to Epos Now's customers. \nNettl's ready-to-go integration with Epos Now means retailers can connect their web shop to their physical shop and start selling online. \nWayne Taylor, Chief Technology Officer, outlines further possibilities the AppStore allows: \"While we have over 80 integrations available, if you need a custom app, people can even develop their own. The Epos Now API can be used to integrate your Epos Now system with anything, anywhere.\" \nWhile the AppStore officially launched this month, Epos Now has been building apps for the new platform since October 2014 and undergoing customer trials since January 2015. \nSo far, having seen in excess of 2,000 visitors a day and 1,000 installations per month, the new development looks set to change the face of POS technology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:03:39.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
