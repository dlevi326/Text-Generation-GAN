The software quality and test management event runs September 13-18 at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina. Mobile has taken center stage in our daily lives. The world has become increasingly connected as we promote and permit, knowingly or not, via social networking – all made possible because of the now global prevalence of the smartphone. When current mobile devices become obsolete in less than a year and OS's continually add new functions and features with each release, it becomes even more critical to understand not only current trends but also what will be coming tomorrow. Philip Lew’s keynote address, Software Testing and QA in a Mobile Dominated World, will explore the implications of current and emerging mobile trends for software testers and quality engineers, including questions of design, test cases, mobile applications, and how to adapt in order to stay ahead of the competition.\nSQTM focuses on advancing the test management and quality management professions by providing practical methods based on best practices.
