Founded by mobile pioneers Scott Swanson (Opera Mediaworks, Opera-acquired Mobile Theory, Glam Media and Oracle-acquired Vitrue) and Alvaro Bravo (Opera Mediaworks, Mobile Theory and Greystripe), the new mobile data management platform unlocks mobile advertising ROI by connecting marketers to consumers during the moments they are most receptive to advertising. “Mobile marketers have explored many different approaches to targeting—demographic, location, behavioral, etc.—yet they continue struggle with context,” said Scott Swanson. “We launched Aki because, despite great innovations in technology and data, brands are still missing a critical piece of the mobile puzzle. We believe that missing piece—the understanding of a mobile consumer’s mindset during a given moment—is the key to unlocking the potential of mobile advertising.”\nAt the heart of Aki’s offering is the Mobile Moment Index™, a comprehensive analysis of billions of mobile activity data points that assesses a consumer’s ad receptivity at a given time. With Aki’s Mobile Moment Index, advertisers can target consumers when they are more likely to engage with an ad and, further, deliver the ad format that best aligns with their level of receptivity at that moment.\n“Not all mobile moments are created equally. Without visibility into a mobile consumer’s mindset, brands are wasting impressions on moments of low receptivity and alienating the very audience they need to engage,” said Swanson. “At Aki, we work closely with brands to identify the mobile moments that best align with their product, message, campaign goals, and even ad format. So in addition to eliminating inefficient ad spend, we’re also ensuring optimal ad performance.”\nAmong the early adopters of Aki Technologies is digital agency Zig Marketing. “The advertising industry struggles with mobile because it is a complex, diffused marketplace with plenty of opportunity to waste clients’ money,” said Howard Zoss, President of Zig Marketing. “Aki is a key mobile partner for Zig because their mobile moment technology effectively connects brands to users when they are in the best mindset for advertising. As a result, Aki campaigns perform better than anyone in key performance metrics (engagement, acquisition) as well as brand safety. Their service is excellent and they do it all with transparency. Most of all, I trust them and that’s hard to find in the wild, wild West we call mobile marketing.\"\nUnlike other platforms that are dependent on a single data set or methodology, Aki leverages the complete range of mobile data signals to decipher a consumer’s state of mind, allowing creative to be customized and catered to that mindset. “Aki” translates to “bright and clear” in Japanese, reflecting the company’s mission to bring clarity to the various states of mind mobile users experience throughout the day. That mission is further supported by Aki’s Mobile Moment Performance Insights™, an in-depth, moment-by-moment campaign analysis that gives advertisers a better understanding of their audience with which to optimize current and future campaigns.\n“For all the change that mobile devices have brought upon us, the old marketing adage remains true: to succeed, you need to know your customers,” said Swanson. “Our goal is to take that a step further by helping brands understand the current psychological state of those customers, even as that state varies greatly throughout the day. By providing deep insight into the mindset of mobile audiences, Aki gives brands a revolutionary new way to engage with consumers.”\nRead full coverage of this announcement in Mediapost .\nAbout Aki Technologies\nAki Technologies unlocks the potential of advertising on mobile devices.
