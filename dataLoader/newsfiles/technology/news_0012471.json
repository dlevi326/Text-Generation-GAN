The recent hashtag #overheadbin has given a small insight into what the cabin crew get up to once all the passengers have left. The craze has emerged on Instagram and shows a number of air stewards climbing into the overhead bins. Images include individual shots as well as groups of colleagues cramming themselves in to the compact places. One flight attendant even commented that it is a rite of passage for a flight attendant to complete this challenge.The heart-rendering images and stories of refugees have prompted a huge outpouring of outrage and shock across media platforms and as a consequence many have sprung to action to help out as much as possible. In one such case, InflightFeed has proposed its 'Help the Refugees' campaign which aims to charter an aircraft from London to Kos on 27 September 2015, taking 130 people and as many useful aid items with them including blankets, toothbrushes, pillow etc. to distribute when they land. They now require volunteers, aid items and an aircraft to make this fantastic idea possible.
