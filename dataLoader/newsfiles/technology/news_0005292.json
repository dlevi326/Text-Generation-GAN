OVH Group is one of the largest cloud computing and hosting providers in the world and the largest hosting provider in Europe. In its booth, Cavium will be demonstrating popular cloud workloads running on ThunderX(®) based servers deployed in RunAbove(TM) Cloud, the OVH Group's site devoted to labs and trying new technologies. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20120604/LA18845LOGO \nAt the Summit developers and customers will be able to login into ARM(®) based multi-tenant environments demonstrating popular cloud workloads including NGINX, Cassandra, MemcacheD and MySQL. This provides developers the opportunity to experience the advantages of RunAbove's ARM based cloud offerings and to speak directly with our technical experts. \nARMv8 based Cloud platforms powered by ThunderX processors provide fine-grained control of a large number of cores, integrated standard low latency Ethernet fabric, 10/40/100 GbE networking, end-to-end virtualization enabled through virtSoC(TM) technology, and powerful integrated accelerators for packet processing, security, deep packet inspection and virtualization. Deploying ThunderX based platforms for these targeted workloads provides tremendous cost benefits for both public and private clouds. \n\"ThunderX based ARM server platforms provide benefits and flexibility of end to end virtualization along with scalability to manage dynamically changing workloads. Exceptional processing performance is enhanced with the integration of a large amount of high speed IO along with targeted compute, storage, networking and security workload accelerators. The result is a power, space and cost-optimized solution delivering lowest cost and lowest power per VM,\" said Gopal Hegde, VP/GM, Data Center Processor Group, at Cavium Inc. \nAbout Cavium \nCavium is a leading provider of highly integrated semiconductor products that enable intelligent processing in enterprise, data center, cloud and wired and wireless service provider applications.
