Next week, Beijing has planned a tech forum in Seattle between China’s Internet czar, Lu Wei, and tech companies including Apple , Facebook, IBM, Google and Uber, in a show of how it can get some of the world’s leading tech players to meet even as President Obama has suggested that U.S. companies are being hurt by anticompetitive Chinese practices. The forum is timed to coincide with President Xi Jinping ‘s first state visit to the United States.\nThe situation is tricky for U.S. tech companies. Many are eager to take advantage of business opportunities in China before rivals there sew up the market. But they have to tread carefully because of the Chinese government’s sensitivity on issues including censorship and security. Facebook and Google are among those blocked by China’s Web filters from offering their core services in the country, which is the world’s biggest Internet market.\nIt is not clear whether any of the companies invited to the Seattle tech forum have been asked to make the pledge. The document was sent by the China Internet Security Certification Center , most likely under pressure from China’s main Internet regulator, according to one of the people with knowledge of the letter.\nIt is also unclear when Chinese officials want a response from the companies on the pledge, but they may be hoping for some sign during next week’s forum, or at a conference hosted by China’s Internet regulators later in the year, these people said.\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to a faxed request for comment on the pledge.\nUber, Apple, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe pledge contains language similar to that in a recently distributed Chinese national security law. The document begins with the statement: “Our company agrees to strictly adhere to the two key principles” and names them as “not harming national security and not harming consumer rights.” It also asks the company to make six additional promises — some seemingly innocuous, like guaranteeing product safety, and others less so, like volunteering to check that products are “secure and controllable.” That could imply an agreement to cater products to Chinese surveillance.\nOver the past year, Chinese officials have sought to persuade U.S. companies to support declarations of differing types. In a conference hosted by China’s Internet regulator last year, attendees were given little time to provide feedback on a declaration that said countries should have the right to make their own Internet laws, even if those laws mandate censorship and surveillance. The declaration was ultimately abandoned because of objections.\nSigning the new pledge could set a precedent of U.S. tech firms openly cooperating with Beijing and enabling snooping on users. Conversely, a refusal could bring fresh restrictions or penalties for companies in China’s enormous market.\nFor the most part, U.S. firms have sought to follow Beijing’s wishes in China, while lobbying at home for more pushback against Chinese laws that they say restrict market access and force technology transfers.\nTo protect their businesses in China, some have transferred intellectual property and cooperated with would-be Chinese competitors. Some have promised huge new investments and used jargon favored by the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party .", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-18T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T01:59:07.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
