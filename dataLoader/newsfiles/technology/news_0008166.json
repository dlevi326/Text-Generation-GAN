Through this agreement, SYC will integrate and offer the capabilities of SAP HANAÂ® Cloud Platform with the SearchYourCloud Server, which returns more accurate and specific results in current workflows, from the desktop to the cloud, with a single search query. The complexities of searching encrypted data combined with the overhead of an instant-access index can be onerous. SearchYourCloud Server runs on SAP HANA Cloud Platform, which enables businesses to increase productivity flows through indexed search capabilities and mitigate impact on operational speed or lag in providing the results or files that have been requested by the user. The SAP HANA database serves back the requests instantly, enabling the SYC software to run at its optimum and respond to requests quickly and expediently.\nThe SYC Server allows users to drop and share files into the cloud store of their choice directly from their devices, while its patented federated search allows users to perform a single search across all of their internal and external file storage and applications, including Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft Box, Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft Exchange. Using enabled document-level encryption on all files, SYC Server provides a completely secure, at-rest security layer, complementing the existing firewalls and mobile device management solutions that are already in place.\nSAP HANA Cloud Platform allows partners to build and extend applications in the cloud using the in-memory technology and process acceleration provided by the SAP HANA platform, which enables businesses to make smarter decisions faster through real-time analysis and reporting.\n\"This agreement is a great step for everyone involved.

Working on SAP HANA Cloud Platform has enabled us to provide this functionality without disruption to the SharePoint online functionality.\"\nHe continued, \"As a member of the SAP Startup Focus program, we are able to grow our consumer demand and focus our capabilities on what our enterprise, integrator and reseller customers need to secure access to their business-critical applications and data in the cloud.\"\nThe SAP Startup Focus program supports startups in developing new applications on SAP HANA, SAP's real-time database platform that streamlines analytics, planning, and predictive and sentiment assessments to allow business to operate in real time.
