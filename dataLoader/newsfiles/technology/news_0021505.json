Our aim is to be around for another 150 years.\" \nGeneral Mills chairman and CEO Ken Powell said: \"For 150 years, General Mills has served the world by making food people love. Our aim is to be around for another 150 years. \n\"We recognise that we must do our part to protect and conserve natural resources. Our business depends on it, and so does the planet.\" \nGeneral Mills is planning to enhance its efforts in direct operations through investing $100m in energy efficiency and clean energy. \nIn addition, it will collaborate with suppliers to accelerate the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices that build climate-resilient, healthy soils. \nThe company will also support consumers in the reduction of their carbon footprint through products and packaging with smaller footprints, and will help the climate resiliency of farmers in the company's supply chain. \nGeneral Mills formally started efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emission in 2005, and has reduced absolute emissions within its operations by 13% over the last ten years. \nThis milestone was achieved by using energy more efficiently across its facilities, and by converting to less greenhouse gas-intensive forms of energy, the company stated.
