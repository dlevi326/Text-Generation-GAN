The growing demand for electronic adhesives in the Asia-Pacific region is the major driving factor of the market.Asia-Pacific has the largest market for Acrylic Adhesives, followed by North America and Europe. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to continue its leading position and dominate the market by 2020, with advanced technological developments in the electronic adhesives market for end-users. Among these regions, the growth of the Acrylic Adhesives market will be phenomenal in Asia Pacific. The growth of the market in Asia Pacific will mainly be concentrated in China, India, Japan, and South Korea.The electronic adhesives market is anticipated to show high growth rate in the coming years. The market is technology-driven and there will be investments for the development of new technology and products. The electronic adhesives market is a part of electronic chemicals and materials industry, which is moving towards consolidation as the major electronic chemicals and materials companies are acquiring other local and foreign players.The UV-curing adhesives are expected to experience the fastest growth in the coming years. However, electrically conductive and thermal conductive adhesives are the leaders and act as an alternative to tin-lead solders. The longstanding trend toward miniaturization of electronics components has resulted in more use of adhesives for fastening. In addition, as the use of electronics grows in the automotive sector, the demand for adhesives in automotive electronics is also growing. Overall, advances in technology and implementation of tighter safety standards are expected to grow the electronic adhesives market.Companies profiled in the Acrylic Adhesives market report include 3M Corporation, American Chemical Inc., Ashland Inc., Avery Dennison Corporation, Beardow & Adams (Adhesives) Ltd., Bostik Inc., Dow Corning Corporation, Nordson, H.B. Fuller, Henkel AG, Huntsman Corporation, Jowat AG, Sika AG, among others. Drivers In future, as less of the driver's attention is required to steer the vehicle, the operator will be able to pursue other tasks or interests. Interiors will be designed to enable occupants to engage in work or leisure activities, which suggests the addition of even more electronics in the interior. Adhesives that improve screen clarity, reduce glare, or help electronics survive the harsh automotive environment will be in demand as these worlds collide. Challenges Volatility in feed stock price, and government regulations about limiting VOC emissions are projected to poise a great threat to global Acrylic Adhesives market in the near future. Primary materials used in manufacturing of Acrylic Adhesives such as polyurethane are mainly petroleum based and hence are very sensitive to prices fluctuations of crude oil.
