It’ll also come with a 6-inch display and a 21-mega pixel camera. \nOther details are pretty thin with no detail on which processor is going into the device, other than it’ll be a MediaTek chip, and no word on when it’ll launch and how much for. \nOther than a handful of tablets designed specifically for gaming, I believe the Acer Predator 6 is the first smartphone designed with gamers in mind. We’ll definitely be keeping tabs on this one, and will be poking Acer for some more details.
