The platform also features a responsive, interactive 3D viewer so users can preview their creation before it’s printed. \nStaples has offered 3D printing as a service in its retail locations and through its Copy & Print sales teams, but the new service offering makes 3D printing even easier for businesses. \n“This is a great addition for our business customers that are looking for an easy way to prototype with quick turnaround time, and at an affordable price,” said Behzad Soltani, vice president of services, e-commerce for Staples, Inc. “The platform allows beginners to get a taste and try 3D printing by selecting one of our existing models and making it their own through our customization options.” \nThe platform is powered by Sculpteo , an online 3D printing service that offers on-demand 3D printing of individual products as well as short-run manufacturing. \n“We are thrilled to support Staples through our 3D Printing Cloud Engine.

The company has since rolled out 3D printing hardware and accessories in a limited number of stores, and expanded its overall product selection to include printers by MakerBot .
