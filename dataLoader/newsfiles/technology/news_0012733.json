But the government-funded Institute of Environmental Science and Research says the pigs were sedated and treated humanely. The scientists say their analysis is important in understanding human shooting deaths. The study was published in July in the International Journal of Legal Medicine. It describes how five pigs were shot from close range with a Glock semi-automatic handgun to record the back-spatter of blood, bone and brain material.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T08:45:45.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
