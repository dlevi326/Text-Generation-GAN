(Photo: Lenovo)\n10 CONNECT 25 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Given all the costs associated with returning to school – especially when we’re talking college – you might’ve put off buying a new computer.\nNow that you’re a couple of weeks in, perhaps you came to the realization your aging PC or Mac just isn’t cutting it.\nHere’s the good news: those back-to-school deals are still around.\nNow you must decide what kind of computer you need. Should you go with a straightforward laptop or one of those fancy 2-in-1s that are both a laptop and tablet in one? Or maybe a desktop is still the way to go for the added screen size and ability to add components over time? What about a tablet?\nTo help offer some guidance, here we look at the pros and cons of the main kinds of computer form factors.\nLaptops\nThe most popular form factor, laptops are ideal for students because of its portability, wireless connectivity, and -- unlike tablets -- a physical keyboard and trackpad.\nCompared to tablets, a laptop also gives you more screen real estate to work with your programs and multitasking between them. Most laptops are 14 or 15 inches, which is much bigger than a 7- to 10-inch tablet.\nA few other considerations in favor of laptops over tablets: They tend to have 10 times the storage (at least 320GB hard drive compared with an average of 32GB of Flash memory); laptops have USB and SD card ports to easily get files on and off the computer (only a couple of tablets do, by comparison); and a laptop's clamshell design helps protect the screen when not in use.\nAs for price, laptops typically start at $279 for a Windows 10 machine (or Windows 8.1, but upgradeable to Windows 10 for free) – but don’t expect decent power until you pay at least $449 to start – while a MacBook Air starts at $899 for an 11-inch model (or starting at $1,299 for the latest MacBook). A beefier MacBook Pro will set you back at least $1,099 for a 13-inch model.\nThose on a tight budget might also consider a Chromebook, as these Google-powered laptops start at just $149, but most tasks require an online connection and they have limited local storage.\n2-In-1s\nThe Asus Transformer Book T100. (Photo: Asus)\nIf you can’t decide between a laptop and a tablet, there is another option. Usually referred to as “2-in-1s,” this emerging breed of Intel-powered Windows computers blurs the lines between the two popular form factors.\nAs the name suggests, 2-in-1s are a “best of both worlds” approach; these devices include (or support) a keyboard and trackpad for when you need to get work done, such as typing up a school report, but they also let you use your fingertip to tap, swipe and flick on a multi-touch display.\nAnd when you no longer have a need for the keyboard, a 2-in-1's screen can flip around, fold down or detach altogether — depending on the specific model\n2-in-1s also benefit from other tablet advantages: a thin and light form factor; instant-on access; an all battery; an easy to use app store; full-size USB ports and SD card slot; and they’re more conducive for reading ebooks compared to a clamshell laptop.\nThe affordable ASUS Transformer Book T100 (about $249), for example, lets you pull off the screen when you no longer need the keyboard and trackpad, while the Lenovo Flex 3 ($329) has a screen that bends back 360 degrees, so you can use it like a tablet with the keyboard tucked underneath.\nThese bendable 2-in-1s can also be used in “display” mode (with the keyboard tucked underneath like a stand, and therefore out of your way) or in “tent” mode to place in areas with limited space, such as a countertop, yet you can still watch a movie or engage in a video call.\nSome are sold as tablets, like Microsoft’s Surface 3 (from $499), but work with optional (and colorful) Type Cover keyboards ($129) that magnetically attach to the base of the screen for when you need to type.\nAs for shortcomings, keep in mind some of the entry-level 2-in-1s, such as the ASUS and Lenovo PCs, have smaller screens (10- to 11-inches) and limited storage (starting at 32GB for the ASUS model).\nDesktops\nThe Acer All-In-One desktop computer. (Photo: Acer)\nWhile not as popular as they once were, desktop computers are still around – and they do offer some advantages to laptops and tablets.\nSince they’re designed for stationary use – that is, staying in one spot in the home or office -- desktops are less prone to damage. After all, they aren’t being dropped or banged in a backpack or large purse like a laptop or tablet would. They’re also less likely to be stolen as they’re always in one place.\nDesktop computers have larger screens than a laptop or tablet – up to 34 inches in some cases – therefore better for entertainment lovers (movies, computer games) and more ideal for multitasking as you can have multiple windows open at the same time. Or you can easily add a second monitor. Perhaps influenced from the tablet craze, many desktops (and laptops) today offer a touchscreen display, along with a keyboard and mouse (trackpad on a laptop).\nComputer users who like to tinker also prefer a desktop as they’re more “modular” – they’re much easier to upgrade components on a tower-based desktop than a laptop, such as a video card, hard drive or solid state drive (SSD) and system memory (RAM). Note: many “all in one” desktops, however, aren’t that easy to change components as they’re packed in behind the monitor.\nParents with young kids also might consider a desktop in a central location in the home -- such as a kitchen, family room or any other highly-trafficked area – so mom and dad can keep an eye on where they’re going online and with whom they’re communicating with.\nWindows-based desktops typically start at $169 for an entry-level machine, or about $299 for a desktop with monitor. Most prices hover between $499 and $799, but you could spend many thousands on a high-end gaming rig. An “all in one” iMac starts at $1,099 for a 21.5-inch model.\nFollow Marc on Twitter: @marc_saltzman .
