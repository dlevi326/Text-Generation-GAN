From watches to glasses, to chips and sensors built into clothing and accessories, wearable technology seems to have reached every corner of our wardrobe, while mobile apps that measure, collect and analyze everything from steps to sleep patterns dominate our smartphones. \nWhile some apps and devices, such as the Fitbit or Google Glass, are marketed to consumers for use in their “off-duty” life, employers are eager to apply these apps and devices to optimize their workforce as well. Moreover, a host of apps and devices are designed specifically for employees to augment or optimize tasks in the course of their job. And with a myriad of abilities, from tracking a heart rate to sharing a GPS location, it is no surprise that these devices are poised to become ubiquitous in companies hoping to increase their ability to measure workflow and productivity.
