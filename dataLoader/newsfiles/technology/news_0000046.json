(NASDAQ: CDRB), an enterprise software development firm that licenses its proprietary software solution to enable simplified secure access and communications between PC and Mac environments on virtually any computer, tablet, or smartphone, today released commentary from its President on ThinOps 2015 business and demand for remote access and cloud based services. \n\"Despite this year's lower than usual commodity prices which directly affect our customer's businesses, ThinOps has seen continued demand for the deployment and integration of remote access and cloud-based solutions from customers and other solution providers. More and more multinational corporations and providers with large presence spread across the nation are coming to realize the cost and productivity benefits associated with these solutions. We are not only on track to hit our 2014 sales number and goal, but also anticipate a strong remainder of 2015 which could bring us ahead of our goal,\" commented Code Rebel President, Tom Moreno. \nHe continued, \"Given what we've successfully completed this year and what we see ahead, it remains clear that the deployment and integration of remote access and cloud-based solutions is a current and growing priority for customers -- and should be communicated to the public accordingly. Moving forward, we plan to announce project completions as we are able to and keep shareholders apprised of the status and growth of our business. We look forward to announcing these developments and to having a successful and productive remainder of 2015.\" \nLeading Code Rebel customers, including Fortune 500 companies such as AT&T, Microsoft, Cisco and Bloomberg, use iRAPP to enhance enterprise collaboration, employee productivity and services.
