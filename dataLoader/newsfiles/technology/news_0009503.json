The split is scheduled to be completed by the end of next month. \nHP Enterprises is trimming its payroll as part of an effort to reduce its expenses by $2 billion annually. \nEven before the spinoff, HP has been jettisoning tens of thousands of employees during the past few years to help boost its declining profits as a technological shift from personal computers to smartphones and smartphones reduced demand for many of its products. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
