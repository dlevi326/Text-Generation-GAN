The i-PRO Preferred Program provides a five-year warranty, expedited service via Priority Advance Exchange and is also being marketing with an Unlimited Video Insight license. \nUpon registration, new and current owners of select Panasonic i-PRO cameras with a manufacturing date after October 2014 are eligible for a five-year warranty — this represents a two-year extension to the standard three-year factory warranty. In the rare instance of a technical issue relating to the camera’s hardware or software, iPRO preferred status, which includes Priority Advance Exchange, ensures that your replacement unit is shipped the same day with overnight delivery. The i-PRO Preferred program is also being presented an Unlimited Video Insight camera license. While competitive manufacturers charge an annual camera license fee for each camera connected to their VMS, owners of eligible Panasonic cameras enjoy an unlimited Video Insight camera license — offering end users a compelling value proposition and lower total cost of ownership. \n“Panasonic’s industry-leading i-PRO cameras are renowned for their unmatched image quality and reliability. With the addition of our new i-PRO Preferred Program, we’re adding an unparalleled level of service too,” said Charlie Hare, Panasonic’s National Category Manager, Security and Mobile Video Solutions. \nFor more information and to register for the i-PRO Preferred Program, visit www.us.panasonic.com/ipropreferred . \nFor more information about Panasonic’s full line of surveillance solutions please visit www.us.panasonic.com/security . \nPanasonic Solutions for Business \nPanasonic delivers game-changing technology solutions that deliver a customized experience to drive better outcomes—for our customers and our customers’ customers.
