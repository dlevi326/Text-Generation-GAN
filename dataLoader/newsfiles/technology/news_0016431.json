The first was the Tesla Roadster , an electric sports car based on a Lotus Elise launched in 2007.\nThe popular Model S saloon car , on which the Model X is based, was launched in 2012 and had sold 75,000 vehicles by June this year.\nThe Model X was originally unveiled in 2012, but engineering delays forced the car’s initial 2014 launch plan back to this year.\nCars ordered now will still take 8 to 12 months to deliver to customers in the US. A European launch is anticipated at a later date.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elon Musk claims that the Model X’s air filtration system is capable of keeping occupants safe from biological weapons with a new “bioweapon defence mode”.

The SUV and crossover market is expanding, with models such as the Nissan Qashqai placed fifth in the UK with around 40,000 new registrations in 2015 already, according to data from Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.\nThe Model X costs $130,000 in the US – the Model S starts at just under £50,000 in the UK – but Musk says that Tesla hopes to launch its Model 3 “electric car for the people” costing $35,000 in 2017.\nTesla Model S car review", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8dfc888bd0b0fbbf8ea18cba9135eadede3c51f/0_189_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=2cda6ec8d533f1b8fc2a3b0b76c6aa02", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Tesla+Model+X%3A+Elon+Musk+launches+first+all-electric+SUV&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cpny%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b115a849e60b0b464306633cea1f155b6ca1b9fd/0_113_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=711c5634e842f2dd9048bcd32c81df81", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cpny%2Fsfb%23img-1&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cpny&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Fb115a849e60b0b464306633cea1f155b6ca1b9fd%2F0_113_3500_2102%2F3500.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b115a849e60b0b464306633cea1f155b6ca1b9fd/0_113_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=9b41c5ae92f601398f9b94cecdd8fab5", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Tesla+Model+X%3A+Elon+Musk+launches+first+all-electric+SUV&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2Fsep%2F30%2Ftesla-model-x-elon-musk-electric-suv&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Fb115a849e60b0b464306633cea1f155b6ca1b9fd%2F0_113_3500_2102%2F3500.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b115a849e60b0b464306633cea1f155b6ca1b9fd/0_113_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=a30f30ccdec53b18102ec00af799dabf", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8dfc888bd0b0fbbf8ea18cba9135eadede3c51f/0_189_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=83fdb761edca649a225d82cf493f7063", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Tesla+Model+X%3A+Elon+Musk+launches+first+all-electric+SUV&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cpny%2Fstw%23img-1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8dfc888bd0b0fbbf8ea18cba9135eadede3c51f/0_189_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=da7e7bbe0f34930ab8e2db862a9ff66d", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b115a849e60b0b464306633cea1f155b6ca1b9fd/0_113_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=2206d49f73e01bca2c0fa812fe795315", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8dfc888bd0b0fbbf8ea18cba9135eadede3c51f/0_189_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=1308d7d9ea90b1ce02ef714ae1cf593f", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Tesla+Model+X%3A+Elon+Musk+launches+first+all-electric+SUV&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2Fsep%2F30%2Ftesla-model-x-elon-musk-electric-suv&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Fc8dfc888bd0b0fbbf8ea18cba9135eadede3c51f%2F0_189_3500_2102%2F3500.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cpny%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cpny&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Fc8dfc888bd0b0fbbf8ea18cba9135eadede3c51f%2F0_189_3500_2102%2F3500.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:38:15.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
