As the fall season comes around, inevitably, busy holidays and events will be taking over. That means fleet drivers are going to be on the roads with a lot of rushing people. US Fleet Tracking Presents a few powerful ways that GPS trackers help fleets reduce pollution. Reducing speed and cutting down idling are two of the best ways to ensure harmful emissions are decreased by fleet drivers. 1.) Reducing Driver Speed: Busy or not, speeding is not a great idea not only on account of possible tickets or accidents, but because it is harmful to the environment. Environmental studies have showed that when driving faster higher emissions are produced. GPS trackers can help by automatically detecting rates of speed. The data can then be sent from the GPS trackers to managers in charge. It's quite simple to set-up and receive reports on this data so that fleet business owners or managers can do their part in making sure drivers are compliant. If managers want to be certain that their drivers obey the posted speed limits, GPS trackers can help them achieve this goal while also helping to reduce pollution.\n2.) Cutting Down On Idling: Aside from speeding being a problem this fall, fleet drivers might be tempted to leave their trucks idling to \"warm up.\" Just like speeding, idling has negative affects on the atmosphere. Idling causes engines to operate inefficiently spewing out soot from the tailpipes. These vehicle emissions are hazardous and are produced more by a degraded engine that got that way from idling. Contrary to popular belief, it's actually been shown through studies that driving vehicles actually warms the engine up faster than letting the engine run. GPS trackers can help by automatically identifying when excessive idling takes place. Just like with the speeding reports, an idling report can be generated from the GPS trackers.\nMany fleet managers may have already thought about what they can do to be more \"green' and promote a positive image of their fleet company. The truth is that businesses don't have to be big environmentalists to run a \"green\" fleet. GPS trackers make it easy for small, medium or large fleet businesses to do their part in helping the environment. Using GPS trackers managers can start making simple changes like making sure that drivers are reducing their speed and cutting down on idling. In this way GPS trackers can help fleets reduce pollution.\nTo view US Fleet Tracking's GPS tracker selection, please click here .", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy51c2ZsZWV0dHJhY2tpbmcuY29tL2dwcy10cmFja2luZy1wcm9kdWN0cw==", "http://www.usfleettracking.com/gps-tracking-products"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T16:18:20.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
