How many of them have used a forced perspective to make it look like they were holding up the tower at Pisa?\nDo you ever feel like you're trapped in an echo chamber of trite travel photography?\nWell, a new project by Philipp Schmitt is aiming to change the way we think about taking pictures—specifically, where we take them.\nHis Camera Restricta is a play on the Camera Obscura, the device that paved the way for all modern cameras. But what exactly is so restricta about it?\nThe camera uses GPS data cross-referenced with online metadata to determine how many photos on the internet have taken and geotagged in your location. If too many people have snapped shots where you're standing, you'd better find a different camera—or a different place to shoot.\nREVIEWED.COM CAMERAS\nWe Tried Out the $75 Selfie Stick So You Don't Have To\nThe camera makes a noise not unlike a Geiger counter to indicate how many pictures have been taken in your general vicinity. Ostensibly, you can be the first person to photograph an area—and the last.\nIt's not everyday you see a camera with an antenna. (Photo: Philipp Schmitt)\nYou might be asking yourself: Why on earth would I want to restrict myself so much? Well, why do we limit ourselves to 140 characters per tweet, or six seconds per Vine? Because inspiration can be born out of restrictions, whether they're logistical or philosophical.\nCamera Restricta comes from a long line of so-called \"lateral thinking\" tools designed to solve problems in an unconventional way. In this case, the problem is cliché, and the solution is a deactivated shutter button.\nThe 3D-printed camera is still in the prototype phase. (Photo: Philipp Schmitt)\nAlthough the camera is still in the prototype stage, Schmitt says that he's in the process of outfitting the 3D-printed body with the hardware needed to actually take pictures. Until then, enjoy the most picturesque parts of the world while you still can.\n2 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1KDqZIA TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://philippschmitt.com/projects/camera-restricta", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d25acc26105469fb17189c809b99054b640a8f4/c=0-43-649-531&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787992629101581-camera-restricta-front.jpg", "http://cameras.reviewed.com/features/we-tried-out-the-75-selfie-stick-so-you-dont-have-to", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1b0291df4b231ad4b0ef16714db7f848827b2084/c=148-0-813-500&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787991445989997-Camera-Restricta-Hero.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KDqZIA&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787991445989997-Camera-Restricta-Hero.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b84b4197b8931ac2336513f9ef91e59c4806e376/r=500x250/local/-/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787991445989997-Camera-Restricta-Hero.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1KDqZIA", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e9b11c182cdf444d09b552a6180fb12b05d51a2c/r=300/https/reviewed-production.s3.amazonaws.com/1419270136000/hero.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0c8422d473ace29683ff59656b5b59e9485e6b39/c=34-0-914-662&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787993415658623-camera-restricta-hardware.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upPiJ9vOYiY", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KDqZIA&text=No%20way%2C%20cliche%3A%20This%20camera%20won%27t%20work%20in%20tourist%20traps&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-09-27T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T16:57:45.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
