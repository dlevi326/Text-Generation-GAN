Our graphs show you your smoking trends by day week month or year so you can see how much progress you're making.” \nNot only can you track and monitor how much you smoke but in the app you can adjust the amount of vapor you get with each puff. You can also view your battery life atomizer resistance voltage and wattage. Simply open the app on your iPhone or Android device and the power is at your fingertips. Want to cut back? The app can help you control the amount of puffs you take by locking you out of your device once you reach a planned limit (if desired you can unlock it within the app). \nFor this Indiegogo campaign Illest Vapes is launching two new electronic cigarette models: Torpedo and #smokebomb \n“The app is currently available in the Apple Store and in Google Play for Android devices. We have gone through rigorous product testing and development over the last year to ensure our product is ready for market” says the team “We have already invested a substantial amount of money to get us this far and now we need your help to finish. We want to upgrade our #smokebomb unit to 30 watts instead of 15 watts and go into mass production on both items and we can't do it without you.” \nIn exchange for pledging to the project backers can gain access to a variety of rewards including an illestvapes.com sticker for 10 an early bird Torpedo for 45 or an early bird #smokebomb for 60. Vapor retailers can also pledge 425 for 10 Torpedoes at a discounted price 575 for 10 #smokebombs at a discounted price and more! \nFor more information please visit the Indiegogo page here or contact the creator below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:09:16.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
