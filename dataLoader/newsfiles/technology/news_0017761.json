The award of this Task Order was completed in conjunction with RES Software and several other vendors responsible for improving network resiliency and Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) compliance across the entire government. \n“In today’s Federal IT environment, government agencies are demanding a digital workspace that better empowers their workers – who now have much more agile and mobile workstyles – while reducing the risks of data security breaches,” said Gene Bonacci, General Manager and Vice President of the Americas at RES. “With RES ONE Workspace the Federal government has a better way to govern which technology services its workers can and can’t use, while minimizing the daily IT administration of that environment through automation.” \nThe Task Order award under Phase 1 of the CDM program provides support for four functional areas: Hardware Asset Management, Software Asset Management, Configuration Management and Vulnerability Management. The single-award Task Order – made under the $6 billion General Services Administration's Continuous Monitoring as a Service (CMaaS) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) – provides tools, sensors and CMaaS integration support services to 63 organizations within Federal departments and agencies. These include: Department of Energy, Department of Interior, Department of Transportation, Department of Agriculture, Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of Personnel Management. \nToday, government agencies face the growing challenge of creating a secure and compliant digital workplace that still allows workers to be empowered and productive. This is primarily being driven by the introduction of new technologies, consumer devices used for work, and a tech-savvy workforce. Managing IT in the same way organizations did just five years ago is not effective in today’s environment. \nAs users continue to accelerate the trend toward consumerization, CIOs and CISOs must implement solutions that address the variety of devices, apps and operating systems that make up the IT infrastructure, while meeting the anytime, anywhere access capabilities imposed by today’s flexible work styles. This convergence of disruptive enterprise technology and working trends presents IT with new challenges, often leading to more time spent on manual processes and higher costs to meet more demanding needs from users. \nAbout RES Software \nRES Software, the leader in digital workspace technology, helps organizations achieve better business results with reduced security and compliance risks — while making enterprise technology easier and less disruptive for the worker to access. RES takes a people-centric approach to making technology access secure, even in complex multiple device/multiple location scenarios.
