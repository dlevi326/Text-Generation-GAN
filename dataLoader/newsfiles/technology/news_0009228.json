The bigger picture is increasingly becoming clearer to us and we are hoping that in a few months, we will be able to solve a large part of the pain points that users as well as business face in the industry.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/zomato-release-white-label-apps-to-help-restaurants-further-digital-identity/story-fn5lic6c-1227517504054?sv=f3b638f017ad5eb0e89876f5b74d6cae", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/zomato-release-white-label-apps-to-help-restaurants-further-digital-identity/story-fn5lic6c-1227517504054?sv=f3b638f017ad5eb0e89876f5b74d6cae&title=Dining+out+just+got+more+interactive", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/zomato-release-white-label-apps-to-help-restaurants-further-digital-identity/story-fn5lic6c-1227517504054?sv=f3b638f017ad5eb0e89876f5b74d6cae", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Dining+out+just+got+more+interactive&c=WHEN+Zomato+and+UrbanSpoon+joined+forces+back+in+June%2C+they+promised+big+changes+to+the+way+we+dine.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/zomato-release-white-label-apps-to-help-restaurants-further-digital-identity/story-fn5lic6c-1227517504054?sv=f3b638f017ad5eb0e89876f5b74d6cae", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/zomato-release-white-label-apps-to-help-restaurants-further-digital-identity/story-fn5lic6c-1227517504054?sv=f3b638f017ad5eb0e89876f5b74d6cae&title=Dining+out+just+got+more+interactive", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/zomato-release-white-label-apps-to-help-restaurants-further-digital-identity/story-fn5lic6c-1227517504054?sv=f3b638f017ad5eb0e89876f5b74d6cae&h=Dining+out+just+got+more+interactive"], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:29:07.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
