The report revealed that healthcare is highly-targeted and increasingly vulnerable as the next wave of connected devices hits an already complex technology environment. \n\n\"The rapid digitization of the healthcare industry, when combined with the value of the data at hand, has led to a massive increase in the number of targeted attacks against the sector,\" said Carl Leonard, Raytheon|Websense principal security analyst. \"While the finance and retail sectors have long honed their cyber defenses, our research illustrates that healthcare organizations must quickly advance their security posture to meet the challenges inherent in the digital economy - before it becomes the primary source of stolen personal information.\" \n\nIn 2014, Websense identified a 600 percent increase in cyber-attacks against hospitals within a 10-month period. As a follow up to this discovery, Raytheon|Websense Security Labs recently examined the real-world attack telemetry against healthcare, uncovering new intelligence about the most prolific and effective cyber-attack tools, techniques and security trends impacting the industry. \n\nTop findings from the Raytheon|Websense Security Labs 2015 Healthcare Drill-Down said that the healthcare industry sees 340 percent more security incidents and attacks than the average industry and, as a result, is more likely to be impacted by data theft. Medical information is 10 times more valuable on the black market making healthcare a major target for cybercriminals. The proliferation of electronic health records creates a data-heavy environment, while networks comprising thousands of providers present an enormous attack surface. \n\nThe findings said that one in every 600 attacks in the healthcare sector involves advanced malware. In fact, the healthcare sector is four times more likely to be impacted by advanced malware than any other industry. \"With many organizations lacking budget and the administrative, technical or organizational skills necessary to detect, mitigate and prevent cyber-attacks, advanced malware presents a significant threat to healthcare infrastructure,\" a news release by the lab said.
