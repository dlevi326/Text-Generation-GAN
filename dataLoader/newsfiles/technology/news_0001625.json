The eye-catching projection mappings were planned and executed by Christie's rental staging partner Hexogon Solution Pte Ltd, which were responsible for lighting up iconic structures and historical buildings around the five-kilometer nighttime city street circuit. The 46 Christie Boxer 4K30 projectors displayed bright and colorful images on the iconic Merlion statue at Merlion Park, and on the floor of the Marina Bay Floating Platform, enhancing the scale and significance of one of the most thrilling events on the motor racing calendar. The projections were clearly seen from live aerial shots and watched by millions of viewers around the world. This is the first time Christie Boxer 4K30 projectors were used for an international event held in Singapore. \"The annual Formula One night race is one of the most anticipated international sports events to be staged in Singapore and we are committed to deliver memorable digital projections that showcase Singapore as a beautiful and vibrant city to audiences across the globe,\" commented Adrian Goh, managing director, Hexogon Solution. \"This is why we have chosen the Christie Boxer 4K30 projector for an event of this scale. It offers stable performance, is easier to monitor, delivers excellent brightness, and has a small footprint. We are now able to do more with fewer projectors and achieve better resolution.\" The task of installing and setting up the Christie Boxers, along with all other architectural lighting fixtures, took the Hexogon Solution team slightly more than a month to complete. The projectors and architectural lightings were deployed at 16 locations around the racetrack, including the National Gallery of Singapore, Victoria Theatre, Civilian War Memorial, Gardens By The Bay, Esplanade Theatre and Singapore Flyer. The Hexogon team also put together stunning content that was shown on the Merlion statue and Marina Bay Floating Platform, which included visuals of the Singapore flag when the National Anthem was played. Elaborating on the significance of this project, Goh said, \"All our installations had been designed for maximum TV exposure to highlight stunning views of the city state from helicopters featuring the central business district skyline, so every second of TV exposure counts. We had to ensure that the lighting and projection systems were stable and performing at their best when the TV camera panned across the entire area to capture panoramic views. I'm glad that everything went well and the race organizers are happy with the results at the various venues.\" The event was one of the most successful Formula 1 races Singapore has hosted, recording the third-highest attendance in the event's history with international media calling the backdrop of the city street circuit a 'stunning visual success on television.' \"It is a real pleasure to see the Christie Boxer 4K30s in action again in Singapore after the unforgettable projection mappings delivered by our valued partner Hexogon Solution during the country's 50th National Day celebrations last month,\" said Lin Yu, vice president, Christie Asia Pacific. \"The Formula 1 Grand Prix is a wonderful occasion to showcase to an international audience bright and dynamic projection mapping using the Christie Boxer. I congratulate Adrian and his team for delivering yet another superb show, and thank them for having the faith and confidence to deploy the Boxer 4K30 extensively for this highly popular international event.\" # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T10:04:53.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
