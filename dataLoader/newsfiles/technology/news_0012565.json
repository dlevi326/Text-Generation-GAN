(CBC) Microbial auras \nEveryone is surrounded by their own personal microbial cloud. \nThis airborne collection is full of bacteria, fungi and skin cells, and now a team of researchers from the University of Oregon is the first to characterize its significance . They found that you shed up to a million cells per hour into the air around you and that everyone's microbiome is unique. \nThat uniqueness has inspired researchers to determine whether the microbial cloud can act as an airborne fingerprint in forensics. Just when you left no evidence behind, it's the bacteria that have your story to tell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T01:46:07.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
