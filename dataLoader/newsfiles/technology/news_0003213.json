China, however, had only one entry on the list in Tsinghua University, ranked 72nd.\nPolicymakers and corporations alike rely on universities to convert publicly funded science into knowledge and ultimately new products that drive economic growth. But while academic innovation is lauded around the world, it is not easy to measure.\nThe new Reuters league table aims to produce the most comprehensive and systematic ranking to date by analyzing 10 different measures, based on the volume and impact of scientific research, the volume and success of patent filings and the use of cited discoveries in the academic and corporate worlds.\nFor full details of the survey, see www.reuters.com/most-innovative-universities.\nLarge, populous countries inevitably score highly, so it is also instructive to look at relative performance. Tiny Switzerland, with a population of eight million people and two of the world's top drug companies, stands out with three schools on the list, giving it more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country.\n(Editing by David Goodman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T07:17:01.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
