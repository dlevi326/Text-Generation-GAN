Every standard deviation increase in total ceramide levels was associated with over a 92 percent lower risk of having migraines. The group of lipids tested help regulate inflammation in the brain. \nThe findings were published online Sept. 9 in the journal Neurology. \n“While more research is needed to confirm these initial findings, the possibility of discovering a new biomarker for migraine is exciting,” said study author B. Lee Peterlin, DO, Johns Hopkins. Read More: A New Way to Think About Migraines \nStudy participants gave blood samples, underwent a neurological exam and had their body mass (BMI) measured. The study looked at 36 women who did not have headaches, and 52 women with episodic migraines, which is defined as having less than 15 headaches per month. On average the women with migraines had 5.6 headaches per month. \nBlood tests showed women without headaches had approximately 10,500 nanograms per milliliter of total ceramides in their blood, compared to women with migraine who had about 6,000 nanograms per milliliter. \nTwo other types of lipids, called sphingomyelin were also tested and every standard deviation increase in their levels was associated with a 2.5 times greater risk of migraine. \nTesting the blood of a random small sample of 14 participants, researchers were able to accurately identify migraine suffers or controls without headaches based on these blood lipid levels. \nThere are limitations in the study, such as chronic migraines not being included, and that an unusually large number of participants had migraine with aura (a perceptual disturbance that sometimes precedes migraines). \nFunding for the study came from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Landenberger Foundation.
