That’s why more than two dozen companies, including Apple Inc. and AT&T Inc., are siding with Microsoft by filing documents supporting its position.\nThe three judges on the appeals panel in Manhattan are all appointees of President Barack Obama, with U.S. District Judge Victor Bolden having worked for the American Civil Liberties Union for four years and U.S. Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch having argued cases in cooperation with the ACLU. The ACLU also filed papers in the appeal supporting Microsoft’s position.\n“At the core of this case is the protection of personal communications and the reach of U.S. law,” Craig Newman, head of the privacy and data security practice at New York’s Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP, said in an interview before Wednesday’s arguments.\nMicrosoft is asking the judges to overturn a 2014 ruling that the company must hand over e-mails of a suspected drug trafficker. The company claims\nif the U.S. government were successful, it would open the door to foreign countries seeking to seize evidence stored in the U.S.\n‘Go Crazy’ “We would go crazy if China did it to us,” Joshua Rosenkranz, Microsoft’s lawyer, said at the start of the hearing. “This is a matter of national sovereignty.”\nThe company argues investigators must go through Irish authorities to obtain data located in that country. The U.S. counters that the process for requesting evidence through foreign governments can be difficult and time-consuming and that U.S. law permits them to get it directly from the U.S. companies that choose to store it offshore.\nIf investigators can’t obtain data stored offshore, that would create a loophole in U.S. law to be exploited by fraudsters, hackers and drug traffickers, the government claims.\nThe third judge on the appeals panel is Susan Carney, a former lawyer for the Peace Corps and Yale University.\nU.S. District Judge Loretta Preska last year rejected Microsoft’s arguments that it doesn’t have to comply with a warrant requiring it to provide investigators with the contents of a customer’s MSN.com Web-based e-mail account. The name of the customer and the nation in which the customer lives haven’t been disclosed publicly.\nThe case is In the Matter of a Warrant to Search a Certain E-Mail Account Controlled and Maintained by Microsoft Corp., 14-02985, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T18:43:16.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
