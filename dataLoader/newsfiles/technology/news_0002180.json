But that's what happened with high-definition camera maker GoPro, and its stock is taking a beating. Let's look at tech stocks to watch Tuesday.\nGoPro . Shares plunged more than 3% Tuesday following an article from Barron's suggesting the camera maker's stock price could fall as low as $25. The article puts GoPro in its group of \"one-product wonders\" including BlackBerry with smartphones and Palm with digital organizers. On Monday, shares of GoPro closed down 8%.\nMicrosoft . The tech giant launched the Office 2016 software suite on Tuesday, part of its larger roll out of Windows 10. The latest version of Office includes real-time co-authoring for Word documents, a business-friendly version of Skype and multi-factor authentication aimed at businesses.\nApple . The verdicts are in on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, as reviews pour out on the tech giant's latest smartphones. USA TODAY columnist Ed Baig says the combination of 3D Touch and an improved camera present a tempting upgrade.\nGoogle . A new version of the company's Wallet app is now available for iOS devices, reports The Verge , allowing users to make direct payments to others using only an email address. The company also recently rolled out its mobile payments service Android Pay.\nBlackBerry . The smartphone maker reports second quarter earnings before the markets open Friday. Earlier this month, the company announced it acquired security firm Good Technology for $425 million.\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1FcXHl9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/22/9368387/google-wallet-ios-update-payments-relaunch", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/363d7d9b62691694d8308dfc65e908739402b5ad/r=500x348/local/-/media/2015/07/17/USATODAY/USATODAY/635727368619642298-GTY-461091508-69815362.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FcXHl9&text=Tech%20Five%3A%20Shares%20of%20GoPro%20diving&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1FcXHl9", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/07/17/USATODAY/USATODAY/635727368619642298-GTY-461091508-69815362.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FcXHl9&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/47e1cd7d38c25539c94bc6b62b2206e9a462e882/c=111-0-2888-2088&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/07/17/USATODAY/USATODAY/635727368619642298-GTY-461091508-69815362.JPG", "http://twitter.com/brettmolina23", "http://www.barrons.com/articles/gopro-investing-as-an-extreme-sport-1442637822"], "published": "2015-09-22T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T17:02:06.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
