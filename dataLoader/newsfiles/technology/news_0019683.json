Even a reticulation built at Ntwane ward 10 a cost of more than R 10 million by the Mpumalanga Government never became operational as bulk water supply to the plant was conspicuously absent in the planning of the project. And now all the equipment used in the construction of the facility has been vandalized and is of no use to address the dire need that exists.\nAnd now an in-depth study has been conducted to address the supply of fresh drinkable water to residents and all on the surface appears well, but once the water and for that matter bulk water is supplied to the area, the lack of infrastructure reticulation of the water, would only contribute further to the access being a major stumbling block.\nThe Executive Mayor in her annual address to the residents of the area, clearly set out a goal to provide residents with clean, drinkable, piped water within 200mm of their residence has boiled down to nothing, as there is no visible plans in place to alleviate the problem as a matter of urgency.\nWater, Aqua, Meetse, H2O …… not something that the residents of Moutse can consider their basic right to have no matter what!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:08:07.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
