Parkmobile is making this easier than ever by allowing students around the country to worry about one less thing: parking. No longer will students have to dig for change, run back to a meter to add time, or worry about getting a ticket because they can’t leave a class to extend their parking session.\nParkmobile currently offers its mobile payments program at 38 colleges and universities spanning more than 75,000 parking spaces around the country. Recently the company added 6 new universities to its continuously growing list of campuses including University of South Florida, Iowa State, Chaffey College, University Wisconsin Milwaukee, University of Virginia and University of Massachusetts Amherst. Parkmobile has been at the forefront of offering its solutions to universities since the launch of its first location at University of Arkansas in 2011. As more and more students adopt mobile payment solutions they are helping revolutionize how they, along with faculty, staff and visitors pay for parking on campuses throughout the US.\n“Parkmobile has been eager and excited to partner with universities that are not only forward thinking, but progressive in offering mobile payments on campuses, said Jon Ziglar, CEO of Parkmobile. “The increased presence and utility of the smartphone has accelerated the growth of the Parkmobile member base. Our customers value the service, and we want to enhance their parking experience by eliminating the need to swipe a card or feed coins to a meter.”\nTo use the Parkmobile system, customers register for free on the mobile application or at www.parkmobile.com . Once registered, they can quickly and easily pay for parking via Parkmobile’s mobile apps for iPhone, Android, Windows, Amazon, and Blackberry phones, on the internet, or through a toll free telephone number. Enforcement officers are able to see that a motorist has paid with Parkmobile using a wireless handheld device, so customers should not worry if the meter does not change. Mobile app users may also choose to receive alerts and reminders 15 minutes prior to expiration of their parking session, and if needed, they can extend the parking session in a matter of seconds using Parkmobile. Time limits on meters still apply and the app will not allow users to purchase more time than allotted by the meters.\nAbout Parkmobile\nParkmobile, LLC is the leading provider of on-demand and prepaid mobile payments, including reservations and bookings, for on- and off-street parking.
