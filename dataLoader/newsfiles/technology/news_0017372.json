Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150902/263323 The patent for invention number 9,100,291 is used to create a behavioral model of application to database traffic. The models produced from the extracted structured application data are used to immediately identify database infrastructure anomalies, performance issues, and security threats. Previously these critical database infrastructure issues were opaque to network and security operations personnel. \"We are pleased to be awarded this patent from the USPTO, as validation of the technology and platform we are delivering to our partners, governments, and customers, including the world's largest financial service companies,\" explained DB Networks' Chairman and CEO Brett Helm . \"Presently we're able to extract 23 different layer 7 characteristics in the data tier based on the innovation covered in this patent. This is truly changing the database cybersecurity landscape.\" Today's information security environment demands real-time detection of advanced threats, including the illusive insider threat. Customers gain new insights into their database infrastructure communications, including identifying external database attacks, insider threats, undocumented databases, and data segmentation violations. The potential insights using this technology will also include APT's, malware, and other zero-day attacks against the database infrastructure. About DB Networks ® DB Networks ® innovates database cybersecurity products. Our customers include the world's largest financial institutions, healthcare providers, manufacturers, and governments. DB Networks' unique approach to database security utilizes deep protocol analysis, machine learning, and behavioral analysis to automatically learn each application proper interactions and then applies those learnings to accurately and immediately identify attacks in the core network. With no signature files to deal with or endless false positives to chase down, operational support becomes trivial. DB Networks is a privately held company headquartered in San Diego, California .
