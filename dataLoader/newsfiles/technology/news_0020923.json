Finds Small Businesses Prioritizing Office Supplies To Finish The Year Strong \nBOCA RATON, FLA.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \nOffice Depot, Inc. (NASDAQ: ODP), a leading global provider of office products, services and solutions and parent company of Office Depot and OfficeMax, found that small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) cite office supplies as their top investment for the second half of 2015. SMB owners believe office supplies fuel business operations and produce feelings of productivity and control, helping them “gear up for great.” This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150909005045/en/ \nAccording to Office Depot’s Small Business Index, the top three SMB investments for the second half of 2015 are: Office gear (31%), Payroll and salaries (25%), and Advertising and marketing (22%). \n“At Office Depot, we realize it’s important for SMBs to make the right investments to stay nimble and lean,” said Steve Calkins, executive vice president, business solutions division for Office Depot, Inc. “Whether it’s paper and pens or computers, we make it easy to equip SMBs with tools that maximize efficiency and help them achieve success.” \nBeyond fueling business operations, the survey found that office gear makes SMB owners feel: Productive – computers (52%), ink and toner (46%), and printers and fax machines (45%); Creative – markers (30%); and In control – highlighters (14%) and envelopes (11%). \nPatrick Whalen, an SMB owner in Charlotte, North Carolina, understands the value of being equipped with the right office gear, and he underscores the contributions these items make to his daily routine. “They enable you to do your job,” Whalen asserted. “Have you ever tried to live a day without a stapler? It’s impossible.” \nDespite technology’s prevalence in the work place, 42% of SMBs say that paper is their favorite office gear, while another 26% say pens are their front runner. However, technology earns a nod, with 39% preferring ink and toner and 20% listing computers (desktops and laptops) as their fourth most desired supply. \nTo keep business running smoothly, SMBs also turn to office gear to get organized. Supplies like office essentials (51%), sticky notes (50%), legal pads (41%) and labels (40%) are popular among SMBs for organization, yet the majority (65%) say file folders are their favorite. While they may stock up on different gear to get organized, most SMB owners (60%) agree – they experience a sense of accomplishment when purchasing office supplies. \nFor more small business resources, success stories and tips, visit Office Depot’s Business Solutions Center at solutions.officedepot.com . \nSurvey Methodology/Sample Qualifications \nFrom June 11-23, 2015, Office Depot conducted interviews via the Internet among a nationally representative sample of 964 small- and medium-sized businesses. \nAbout Office Depot, Inc. \nOffice Depot, Inc. is a leading global provider of products, services, and solutions for every workplace – whether your workplace is an office, home, school or car. \nOffice Depot, Inc. is a resource and a catalyst to help customers work better.
