I must say though, that my absolute favourite, is “I don't have time”. You don't have time? The go-to-excuse whenever the reason is actually “I don't want to”. And here is why I say that.\nThis has simply become a socially acceptable excuse for anything. And more often than not, a long list follows this statement. All the things that still need to be done. This, and that, and then this, and then I still have to do that... Firstly, why do you think anybody cares? Why is it that we are so obsessed with letting everyone around us know how “busy” we are? Do you expect sympathy? Is this a competition? To see who is the most important with the most things to do? To make ourselves feel better and more relevant?\nThe worst of all of this is that I hear children use this excuse now. “Why didn't you put your clothes away?” “Because there was no time”. For something that doesn't even take 30 seconds to do, you can't seem to find time. How on earth do you manage with anything else? And somehow this is also very acceptable. Since when? It's not because they are too busy, it's because they hear it from someone... Someone who says it all the time. So it becomes normal. Normal to lie like that.\nI'll tell you what the problem is, it's got absolutely nothing to do with time. It's about priorities. Duh. Very often these same people who keep pointing out how busy their lives are, somehow manage to find an open space to upload all their fun-going-out photos onto Facebook. Why? Because spending time with family and friends are important to them. Which is absolutely fine, but it's not because you have more hours for family, it's because if something is important to you, you will make the time. To a lot of people exercise and following a healthy lifestyle is very important and that is why they are at the gym, at the track, on their bikes, not even a set time every day, but whenever they can. And most of these people all have jobs, they have family, they also put weekend fun pictures on Instagram, they just get it done because it's important. And if it's not important, you will find an excuse.\nThis is why I say “I don't have time” is just simply a blatant lie. Because you do have time. Everybody has got time, in fact everybody in the whole world has the same 24 hours as you. Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein had the same 24 hours as you. You just don't care enough to do it. You just don't want to.\nAnd that is also fine. But I don't want to hear it. “Lee I really need help, I really need to lose weight, get fit an be healthy” . “Well then you need to start by doing the following...” “Oh no, I don't have time for that.” It's when people want to sign up for an exercise and lifestyle program but don't really want to commit. So when it fails it's not their fault. It's keeping the back door open because deep down, it's not that important. “I can't carry on training because I just don't have the time”. They don't want to take responsibility for their own lives. It's “Time's” fault. Because you are the only person ever who doesn't have any.\nAm I the only one who finds this insanely ridiculous?\nBy Lee Niemandt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:24:43.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
