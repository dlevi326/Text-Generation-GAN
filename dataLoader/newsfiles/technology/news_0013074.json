Developed by a team of experienced technology entrepreneurs with many years of experience in wireless communications, the full duplex wireless communications system uses one 360 antenna, is a 100% hardware solution and can offer greater data throughput providing wireless coverage up to 25 miles (32 km) for a total circular coverage area of 1,250 square miles or 3,200 square km from a low cost base station. The system, a world-wide breakthrough, now allows a wireless service provider to offer telephone, internet and broadcast services in any area but can focus on rural and remote areas that, up to now, using current systems, have been economically unfeasible. 5by5 Wireless uses the UHF 470-860 MHz frequency spectrum. Using just the 48 MHz of downstream bandwidth will provide data operating speed of 218 Mbps for downloading, and 24 MHz of upstream bandwidth will provide 32 Mbps for uploading – this offers service to unlimited users for television, thousands of users for phone service, and thousands of internet users from one small base station.\nThe 5by5 Wireless circuit also can provide full duplex over all spectrum to all wireless communications devices and is platform agnostic. Mr. Waite said, “One advantage of the invention is that it also doubles the value of spectrum, and this is important since there is only a finite amount of spectrum and since half duplex is the norm in the industry for wireless communications, which is really a one-lane road, we can offer a two-lane highway - which is what we get with full duplex and 5by5 Wireless.”\nMr. Waite stated that only 42% of the world has internet and for the Caribbean’s 41,873,409 inhabitants it is running at about 41%. “We have a an economical solution that would allow every resident in the Caribbean to have a high quality internet solution at a very low cost meaning everyone could afford to be on the internet and In many cases the Caribbean and other Island geographies have a fiber back bone and towers are already in place, 5by5 Wireless just layers on nicely with a very low incremental cost on these costly existing assets.\"\nMr. Waite commented that the biggest advantage of 5by5 Wireless is the low cost of setting up the infrastructure in a remote or rural area; the solution is capable of achieving a full duplex broadband system with one omni-directional antenna and can use existing towers, standard routers and existing technology as it is built on a scalable hardware circuit. Installations are inexpensive and users can receive internet within 25 miles of a base station by using a simple, low cost antenna. Mr. Waite stated InventionShare is open for licensing and distribution discussions with regional and global telecommunications companies, tower providers, cable and internet service providers.\nAbout InventionShare\nInventionShare provides inventors with funding, talent, expert processes to accelerate innovation, patent creation and monetization.
