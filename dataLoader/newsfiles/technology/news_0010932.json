Plug it into any modern TV and you can use it as a computer. Aside from Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4, 2GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage, it sports the latest Intel Cherry Trail chip, two USB ports and an audio jack.\nThe VivoStick will be available for $129 when it hit stores.\n____\nWEIGHTS FOR IT\nHuawei launched its Mate S, billed as the Chinese smartphone maker's first top-range handset with prices starting at $650 - though initially not available in the United States.\nAlong with some impressive specs comes an unusual feature: Huawei says the phone can be used as a scale to weigh objects.\nThis is made possible by the phone's Force Touch capability, something Apple is expected to put in its next iPhone.\n____\nMODULAR COMPUTING\nAcer is taking the traditional PC apart so users can put it back together again.\nThe Taiwanese manufacturer launched Revo Build, a module computer starting at under $200 and shipping this quarter.\nUsers can add to the black base unit by attaching a dedicated graphics card, a sound block, a portable hard drive and even a power bank to wirelessly charge certain smartphones.\nAcer manager Sherlock Cheng says the idea is to provide a \"mini-PC on demand.\"\n____\nSONY'S FLAGSHIP\nJapanese electronics giant Sony has updated its much-lauded Xperia Z line with three new models: standard, compact and premium. The latter features what Sony says is the world's first 4K display.\nAll Z5 models have an impressive 23 megapixel camera with a 0.03 second autofocus so users will hardly ever miss a shot. The camera also has better low-light settings and algorithms which allow users to zoom in without losing too much picture quality.\nLike the iPhone and Samsung's latest Galaxy S handsets, the Z5 will feature a fingerprint sensor.\n____\nINSTANT PHOTOS\nPolaroid is going back to basic with its latest instant camera.\nBy stripping away the LCD screen found in the previous models and halving the price to $99, Polaroid hopes to boost sales of its new Snap camera in time for the holiday season.\nEach click will instantly print a photo, with 50 sheets of special paper costing under $30.\n____\nTURNTABLE TEASER\nWhen Panasonic ditched the Technics brand in 2010, disk jockeys were aghast. Technics turntables, particularly the MK2 launched in 1979, had long been a favorite among professional DJs for their reliability and speed control.\nA petition prompted Panasonic to announce last year that it would revive the brand.\nAt the IFA fair Panasonic teased the motor for a new Technics turntable in Berlin, but the needle is still being developed and the final product won't be ready till next year.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:50:47.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
