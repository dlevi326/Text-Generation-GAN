Despite the union's battlefield successes, the Islamists have retained their military capacity and recently carried out large-scale attacks on union bases.\nAnalysts said the union's troops lack sufficient intelligence gathering and organization with some of the contingents reporting to their national armies instead of the African Union command.\nThe joint forces of the African Union and the Somali army also have no air power to provide cover for troops and to destroy al-Shabaab bases. \"We need to fight the militants from the air,\" Somali commander Abdirahman Mohamed Osman Tima'adde said.\nAnother problems is the poor perception by the public. \"People do not trust our peacekeepers because they know al-Shabaab will come back if we leave them behind,\" a senior official with the African Union forces said from the central region of Hiiraan on the condition of anonymity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:05:36.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
