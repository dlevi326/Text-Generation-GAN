The VPG Profile 3 specification enables guaranteed sustained capture of video streams at up to 130 MB/s for professional video capture. VPG Profile 3 is a successor of VPG profile 1 and 2 that goes beyond command definitions and simple speed requirements. VPG profiles specify the characteristics of a video stream to ensure compliant cameras and CFast cards work together to meet the sophisticated requirements of professional video capture. This includes guaranteed video capture over multiple capture files and across file system updates without dropping frames, enabling high quality 4K RAW capture at high frame rates. The new VPG Profile specification is available for immediate download from the CompactFlash Association website: http://www.compactflash.org . Video cameras that support the VPG Profile 3 specification will be shipped, as well as compliant CFast cards from multiple vendors. Look for the VPG Profile 3 Logo to identify compliant CFast Cards. Test equipment to validate VPG Profile 3 compliance in CFast cards is also available. Contact the CompactFlash office for more details. Mr. Tsutomu Ando of Canon, chairman of the board, CFA said, \"I'm excited to see CFast cards continue to drive image capture innovation and they are becoming an accepted format within professional video applications. VPG profiles are just the latest advancement in CFast allowing for a broader use in professional recording with highest quality.\" CFast cards are currently available up to 256GB with sustained data rate.
