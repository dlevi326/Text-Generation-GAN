The very weak argument thatNews24 is following the lead of other major online news publishers holds as little water in my opinion as a warn out pair of old tennis shoes.\nWe are different. Our history is unique. We are a people that can debate, argue and come to peaceful and constructive resolutions - yes, not always, but even if only seldom it remains a wonderful thing that should be protected and encouraged. We try to understand each other, and sometimes succeed. We do not need to follow anyone's lead - we need to lead the way!\nWe are able to self regulate, something that has been apparent to me in many reams of user comments. Unfortunately, as the original article about the closure of comments truthfully points out, often the most meaningful contributions are drowned out by short, reckless spats of vile venom, or completely irrelevant mindless trash talk.\nIt is also such a complete and utter thankless response, for someone to post a irrelevant, sarcastic one liner to an article the author spent hours to research and properly compose into well constructed sentences and a coherent hole.\nSo how do you get rid of nonconstructive critisism and other marauding fellows? Employ the crowd. Develop powerful means for the constructive members of the community to counter and down rate poor submissions. Stack Exchange have done that, and it works.\nAs with anything else, quality is easy to spot, and people should be given the means to quantitatively rate what others wrote. Just having the ability to counter comment is not enough, and only results in a nauseating long dribble of comment ping-pong. No, quality should be determined democratically and poor contributions should drop off the page, or at least be hidden, and only accessible on request. Reputation points could be employed, again like Stack Exchange, to only allow counter comments if the submitter has the right credentials and her past submissions have been proven to be of a high quality.\nI really hope that something better will emerge out of all of this. I for one would really not mind if people for the most part could employ more thought before posting something, but at the same time we cannot completely silence the masses.\nGive it more thought, and come up with something better - I have no doubt you are able to!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T12:06:03.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
