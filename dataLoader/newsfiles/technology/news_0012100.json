The company's mobile apps have been used by leaders in multifamily property management, student housing, vacation rentals, and national hotel & restaurant brands to manage more than 1.2 million inspections. The company headquarters recently moved to 1000 Van Ness Avenue, a historic building that has become a hub for technology innovation in the Bay Area. \n\"We are solving a fundamental problem across all facets of real estate from residential to commercial to retail and hospitality,\" says CEO Jindou Lee. \"Inspections have traditionally relied on paper-based processes that are inefficient, time-consuming, and often ineffective at recording important information. By letting property managers use tablets and mobile phones to check properties, and to automatically include photos in their reports, HappyCo is revolutionizing an outmoded approach to inspections. And our amazing 'super hero' team here is leading the way in innovation every day.\" \nNew executive hires include a number of multifamily industry veterans Chief Revenue Officer Sukhi Singh, founder of OpsTechnology; former RealPage technologist Pedro Peres; former RealPage engineer Bogdan Gapinski; and James Michels, who has developed technologies in the multifamily industry for more than a decade. \nHappyCo Inspector offers a broad spectrum of in-app features designed to take the headache out of performing multiple field inspections that traditionally generate mountains of time-sapping paperwork. In addition to being customized to completely align with a company's existing processes, the app boasts company branding across all HappyCo emails and reports, embedded digital photo documentation technology, the ability to transmit reports instantly to any stakeholder (agents, maintenance departments, accounting clerks, etc.), search functionality, and a built-in notes section that can alert inspectors about details or warnings regarding a property. \nAbout HappyCo \nHappyCo ( www.happyco.com ) is a San Francisco-based technology company that develops mobile tools for the real estate rental industry.
