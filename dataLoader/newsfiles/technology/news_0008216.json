Many industries have taken advantage of the power of the crowd to come up with revolutionary ideas and technologies which have improved efficacy,\" Chad Lieberman began. He was speaking at a convention organized in New York City to discuss the impact of futuristic technologies on various field of life. The acclaimed marketer, entrepreneur and technology lover led a session discussing Crowdsourcing in the future. \"Not much about crowdsourcing will change in the future, but we're looking at more sophisticated ideas and capabilities being developed as a result of constitution of smarter crowds. These will affect development of movies, advertising campaigns, video games and translation services among other fields.\" The above mentioned fields, he stated, are areas where smarter crowdsourcing is already being applied on a large scale, to take advantage of thousands of free man-hours being provided as a result of crowdsourcing efforts. \"We know how crowdsourcing has been used for everything from equity market flow prediction to building up entire encyclopedia, but only if the crowds work. In future, we're looking at crowds constituted from the best of what markets and experts have to give,\" continued Mr. Chad Ian Lieberman. He explained that it would offer a better chance at understanding and preparing for the future than any single group on its own. Markets at their best are able to process large amounts of diverse information such as what is during election periods. Experts at their best are able to identify the most knowledgeable within the system. These together can give the best of both worlds resulting in ideas that will revolutionize whatever field to which they are applied gainfully. He explained that smart crowdsourcing would only be useful in areas where a large body of information exists in the public domain, and a certain field wants to make sense of it. For fields where information is limited to a few people on the inside, the power of a crowd would be of no use. \"Crowdsourcing only works if it's understood that it is a model, no different from Saabs or outsourcing. Find the ones that do the best and use them for good,\" he concluded.About Chad Lieberman 6WSEO Chad Lieberman 6WSEO boasts a cumulative experience in easy and cost effective search engine marketing services, including search engine optimization, affiliate marketing, online reputation management, linking and PPC management to help businesses of all kinds remain competitive and increase their visibility on the major portals and search engines.
