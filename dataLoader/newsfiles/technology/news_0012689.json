Team Depot, the company's associate-led volunteer force, will focus on projects related to two themes: senior veterans, who need modifications to their homes to safely age in place, and veterans with service-connected disabilities. To kick off Celebration of Service, 1,000 Team Depot volunteers will be deployed in more than 30 cities including Anchorage, Atlanta, Dallas, Grand Rapids, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Staten Island, today through Sunday, Sept. 13, to help improve the safety and accessibility of the homes of more than 100 veterans. \nMore than 8.4 million veterans will be 65 or older by 2020 and more than four million veterans are living with service-related disabilities. That's why since 2011, The Home Depot Foundation has invested more than $105 million in veteran-related efforts and, together with Team Depot, has transformed more than 22,000 veteran homes. \n\"Safety and accessibility challenges can make it difficult for seniors and people living with disabilities to move around their homes,\" said Craig Menear, chairman, CEO and president of The Home Depot. \"During Celebration of Service, our associates will roll up their sleeves to restore veterans' independence – something they very much deserve after the service they have provided to our country.\" \n\"The Home Depot is a tremendous partner in creating housing solutions for disabled American Veterans of all generations,\" said Dale Beatty, retired Staff Sergeant, Purple Heart recipient and co-founder of Purple Heart Homes. \"As a combat-wounded Veteran myself, I can attest to the impact that regaining independence can have on a person. It restores your dignity and spirit. Team Depot's passion for serving veterans gives us confidence that we truly can help to restore independence for Veterans nationwide.\" \nNew Social Media Challenge To Raise $1 Million Throughout Celebration of Service, Team Depot is inviting customers to 'celebrate service' on social media, helping to raise awareness for veterans causes. The Home Depot Foundation will donate up to $1 million, with each social media action equaling $1toward that goal, to organizations that help senior veterans and veterans with service-connected disabilities including: Gary Sinise Foundation, Housing Assistance Council, Jared Allen's Homes for Wounded Warriors, Meals on Wheels America, Operation Finally Home, Operation Homefront, Purple Heart Homes, Semper Fi Fund and the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation. Here is how to make a difference: \nOn Twitter and Instagram People can celebrate service by sharing a photo giving back in their community or honoring a service member on Twitter and Instagram using the hashtag #ServiceSelfie. For each #ServiceSelfie shared during Celebration of Service, The Home Depot Foundation will donate $1 toward the $1 million goal. \nOn Facebook The Team Depot Facebook page will highlight one of its nonprofit partners each Monday during Celebration of Service. Likes, comments and shares of these spotlight posts will also equal $1 toward the $1 million goal. \nStories of Restoring Independence From Sept. 10 through Veterans Day on Nov. 11, Team Depot will partner with hundreds of nonprofits across the country to restore independence for veterans in every state. \nThe projects completed throughout the two-month period will address safety and accessibility needs for veterans including: \nDavid, a U.S. Army veteran who served during the first Gulf War. He earned a Triple Bronze Star and a S.W. Asia medal for his service. While overseas, he was caught in a grenade explosion and was exposed to various poisonous gases. Today, he lives with his wife and service dog Caleb. He volunteers for organizations that help other veterans living with injury and PTSD including Soldier's Best Friend, Healing Memories and The Mission Continues. Team Depot volunteers will make accessibility modifications to his bathroom and flooring, making it easier for him to maneuver the home with his scooter, and will make several other minor repairs to their home to give David and his wife peace of mind. \nPaul, a 92-year-old WWII veteran who served in the U.S. Army and fought on D-Day in Normandy, helped to liberate Paris and was in Berlin when Germany surrendered. He has struggled to care for himself, and the home he and his wife purchased right before he went overseas, since she passed away three years ago. Team Depot volunteers will work to make his bathroom accessible, among other modifications, to restore his independence. \nAbout Giving Back at The Home Depot Since the first Home Depot store opened in 1979, giving back has been a core value for the company and a passion for its associates. Today, The Home Depot, in partnership with The Home Depot Foundation, focuses its philanthropic efforts on improving the homes and lives of U.S. military veterans and their families and aiding communities affected by natural disasters. Through Team Depot, the company's associate-led volunteer force, thousands of associates dedicate their time and talents to these efforts in the communities where they live and work. \nSince 2011, The Home Depot Foundation has invested more than $105 million to provide safe housing to veterans, and along with the help of Team Depot volunteers, has transformed more than 22,000 homes for veterans.
