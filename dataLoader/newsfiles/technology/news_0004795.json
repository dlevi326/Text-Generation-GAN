More Apple to debut new iPhone \nThe company said chief executive Elizabeth Buse was stepping down and reported a pre-tax loss of £227m for the year to June 30, up from £63m a year earlier. Revenues fell 6 per cent to £88m, from £95m last year. \nMs Buse had taken sole charge of the company in March, after Alastair Lukies , founder and then co-chief executive, left his position following a strategic review. The company said the decision was made “due to her desire for personal reasons to return to the United States”. \nLee Cameron, deputy chief executive and chief commercial officer, has been appointed chief executive, effective immediately. \nOnce thought of as a high flyer in the UK technology scene, the company’s revenues have fallen as it tried to change its business model. It has issued four revenue warnings since the start of last year and its share price has fallen 88 per cent in the past 12 months. Monitise announces the departure of chief executive Elizabeth Buse \nThe company said its financial performance had been “disappointing” over the past year, because the transformation of its business was “slower and more challenging” than expected. \n“I believe that the company is in a much stronger place,” said Ms Buse. “I believe that the changes we have made to our balance sheet reflects much more strongly the business we will be than the business we were.” \nAnthony Miller, an analyst at TechMarketView, said he could not see how Monitise could pull out of its downward “spiral”. \n“I don’t agree with Ms Buse’s view that they’re on the right strategic path,” he said. “There’s no doubt there’s great technology there, but I just do not see how Monitise will be able to exploit it in the market and have the focus to do so.” \nThe company is switching to a subscription-based model, targeting resources on a single mobile money platform that all banks could use instead of relying on licence fees won by providing customised services to financial institutions. \nBecause of these changes the company insists that it should instead be judged by its performance next year, consistently issuing guidance that it is on course to make a profit by 2016. \nIt reiterated this guidance on Wednesday, but said it no longer expected revenue growth in 2016 and instead would cut operating costs. \nEarlier this year, the company unveiled the results of a strategic review, saying it had rejected several takeover approaches and would begin to implement a series of cost-cutting measures.
