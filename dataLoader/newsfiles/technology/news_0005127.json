Interrupting Cruz repeatedly, Colbert confronted him over his opposition to gay marriage, his selective adulation of Ronald Reagan, and his uncompromising political style. By the end of the appearance, the host had to step in to stop his studio audience from jeering the Republican presidential hopeful. “Now guys, guys, however you feel, he’s my guest, so please don’t boo him,” Colbert pleaded as Cruz began to give a boilerplate response on gay marriage.
