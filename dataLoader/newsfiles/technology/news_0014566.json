That being said, I’ve also engaged in a number of meaningful debates over the comments section with intriguing people I’ve never met – and yes, sometimes my opinion has been modified or even changed after that exchange.\nJournalism is largely the unbiased reporting of facts – without open debate to encourage perspectives we are indeed at risk of losing our opinion and in many cases our sole form of catharsis to purge ourselves of boiling anger by having a quick rant.\nA cornerstone of any educated society is the ability to provide narrative to topical issues, to openly debate and to challenge perspectives. Without this, the news becomes just the banal reporting of verifiable facts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:04:51.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
