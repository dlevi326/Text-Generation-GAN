Email address 1: Follow @annairrera 24 September 2015 Steven Maijoor has been appointed for a second term at the helm of Europe’s top securities watchdog, as the region’s capital markets industry awaits a final verdict on how a key post-crisis reform will be implemented. \nThe board of supervisors of the European Securities and Markets Authority on Thursday decided to extend the terms of both Maijoor and executive director Verena Ross for another five years. The decision to give Maijoor a second term, which was based on a performance review of the past five years, is subject to confirmation by the European Parliament . \nIn his role, Maijoor will continue to lead the work of the Esma board, a body made up of 28 senior regulators from across the European Union , the watchdog said. Ross will remain in charge of the day-to-day management and Esma’s annual programme. \nMaijoor became Esma’s first chair in 2011, having joined from the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets , where he had been managing director since its early days. \nRoss, who started her career at the Bank of England as an economist and spent 13 years at the UK Financial Services Authority , became Esma’s first executive director the same year. \nSince then the Paris-based agency, which has a headcount of around 186, has shouldered most of the responsibility for the G20-led reforms to Europe’s financial markets. \nIn line with its mandate to help national regulators apply European law consistently, Esma has the cumbersome task of translating the raft of new European Union financial legislation into practical rules. \nThe appointment comes as Esma’s board meets to approve the final technical standards on the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, a sweeping reform of Europe’s capital markets. The final verdict follows months of fierce industry debate on issues ranging from dealing commissions to stricter transparency requirements for bonds.

He warned, however, that the decision was ultimately up to the board. \nBorn in Hong Kong , Maijoor began his career in academia, having completed his PhD in business economics at Maastricht University in 1991, where he became a full professor. \nDuring the past five years, Esma has also overseen the registration of information warehouses known as trade repositories, which collect data on derivatives trades, and tackled the topic of financial sector pay. \nGiven Esma’s vast workload, Maijoor has relentlessly called for an increase in the share of funding the watchdog receives from the entities it supervises, along with more resources from the European Commission . Its budget for 2015, prepared by the European Commission, is €33.6 million, compared to the UK Financial Conduct Authority's budget of €622.7 million for the coming year. \nCommenting on the appointment, Maijoor said he looks forward to discussing \"Esma's strategy, including its role in the Capital Markets Union, with the European Parliament.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T22:02:09.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
