E-cigarettes are Li-ion battery powered devices filled with e-liquid, and consists of an e-vaping device, a personal vaporizer, or an e-nicotine delivery system. The battery is used to heat the e-liquid through atomizer which creates a vapor that is then inhaled. This is called vaping. The batteries used in e-cigarettes are batteries are box MODs of typically 18,650 series. \nSecondhand smoke causes some severe health concerns such as premature death, lung cancer, and heart disease among non-smokers, which has raised the concerns across the country. It is estimated that even brief exposure to secondhand smoke can cause harmful changes in the cardiovascular system, which raises the risk of a heart attack. \nAccording to the report, E-cigarettes offer one of many advantages in that the e-smoker has access to a wide range of e-liquid flavors or juices, which means the product is gaining popularity among end-users. E-cigarettes are less costly and potentially less harmful than tobacco cigarettes. \nFurther, the report states that Li-ion batteries contain a flammable electrolyte, which needs special attention for keeping it under pressure. There are serious safety concerns for Li-ion batteries as they are vulnerable to short-circuiting, overcharging, or high pressure. When Li-ion batteries undergo short-circuiting, high electricity flows are created, raising the temperature within a fraction of a second. \nThe Li-ion Battery market for e-cigarette in the US has been segmented on the basis of: \n- Demand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T20:58:06.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
