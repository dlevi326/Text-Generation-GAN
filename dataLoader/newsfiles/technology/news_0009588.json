This prompted U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this year to accuse Europe of taking a protectionist stance.\nIn the 46-page questionnaire the Commission asks both individuals and companies whether they think platforms are transparent enough in the way they collect and use data.\nIt also asks app developers, businesses or rights holders if platforms include certain clauses such as \"parity clauses\" in their contracts with them. Parity clauses require the platform to be offered terms at least as good as those of its competitors.\nIn June, the Commission opened an antitrust investigation into Amazon's e-book business over allegedly anticompetitive clauses in its contracts with publishers.\nBut the inquiry launched on Wednesday is not an antitrust probe, meaning it will not result in fines.\nAs part of the consultation, the Commission is also looking at services such as Google's YouTube by asking holders of the rights to copyrighted works if \"an online platform such as a video sharing website or a content aggregator refuses to enter into or negotiate licensing agreements with me.\"\nThe industry itself is wary of moves towards regulating the web.\n\"If there are problems someone will need to be more precise about what exactly they are and why they can't be dealt with under existing law such as competition, consumer and privacy law,\" said James Waterworth, Europe Vice President of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents companies such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft .\nSeparately, the Commission on Wednesday launched an inquiry into so-called \"geo-blocking\", the practice whereby businesses restrict access to websites based on location or re-route customers to their local website, which may have different prices.\nIt aims to come out with a law ending unjustified geo-blocking by mid-2016.
