The shares had rallied, as investors and brokers applauded the move. However, such momentum was short-lived as concern over slower demand growth in China resurfaced. \nDavid Butler, of Barclays, said: “The company might have to take further action, but even then it doesn’t automatically go sub-investment grade, nor is it the end of the marketing business if it does.” \nThe bank reckons the speed with which Glencore has moved from buying back stock - its programme finished in March - to issuing equity has surprised investors. \nMr Butler added: “We believe the key trigger was not just the large falls in the equity and commodity prices, but also perceptions around counterparty risk impacting the marketing business.” \nHowever, Barclays noted Glencore has tailored its balance sheet to withstand “a harsher commodity winter”, matching copper supply more closely to demand. \nSeparately, Katanga Mining (Toronto: KAT.TO - news ) announced the suspension of copper and cobalt processing operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo site for 18 months, and confirmed the continuation of the planned investment of $880m into ongoing plant upgrades at the project, in which Glencore owns a 74pc stake. \nJefferies also lowered Glencore’s target price lower to 140p, sending the miner’s shares 5.9p lower to 127.9p. \n* Glencore first out of the traps with plan to counter ‘doomsday’ scenario Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) also slipped into the red, down 0.2pc to 716.9p, despite a rating upgrade from RBC Capital Markets following its recent success in disposing of its Anglo Norte and Rustenburg platinum mines. However, the broker highlighted that challenges still face the miner, including corporate restructuring, a soft diamond market, volatile labour in South Africa and a perceived threat to the 2015 final dividend. \nDes Kilalea, of RBC Capital Markets, said: “We believe a cut in the final dividend is very likely.” Meanwhile, analysts at Credit Suisse (Other OTC: CDSSF - news ) reckon a dividend suspension is possible for Anglo if prices weaken further. \nMining stocks spent Monday’s trading session divided between the top FTSE laggards and leaders, as rating revisions and hopes of further stimulus from the Chinese government weighed on industry shares. Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGF - news ) closed 2.5pc lower at 592.5p, after Jefferies downgraded the stock to “hold”, while BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) climbed 1pc to £10.69 and Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) inched 0.6pc higher to £23.98. \nDavid Madden, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , warned: “The collapse in commodity markets has the macro-economic environment looking dreary, and investors can’t help but feel cagey. Mining and energy companies are keeping the FTSE 100 under the cosh, and given the deceleration of the mineral-hungry economies, it is a theme that will be around for a while.” \nDespite opening in positive territory , Britain’s benchmark index fell in afternoon trade, as investors grew anxious ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Thursday. The FTSE 100 closed down 33.17 points, or 0.54pc, to 6,084.59. \nWm Morrison continued its losing streak on Monday, slipping 7.4p, or 4.5pc, to 157.8p. HSBC became the latest bank to target the supermarket, after it reported a near-50pc slump in half-year profits and announced the closure of 11 stores, putting 900 jobs at risk. The bank note was motivated by comments made by chief executive David Potts that the company’s turnaround will take “years, not months”. \nAnalysts at the bank said the grocer needs “much more investment”, as it faces additional headwinds such as the living wage, auto enrolment for pensions and business rates review. \nWith Tesco repositioning itself and discount retailers expanding, Morrisons faces a difficult future, the bank said. David McCarthy, of HSBC, said: “There needs to be a step change in sales growth.” \nDespite cutting infrastructure and fixed costs, Mr Carthy warned Morrisons cannot “shrink its way to success”. \nRival J Sainsbury fell 3.8p to 229.6p, Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) slid 2.9p to 178.5p and Marks & Spencer (Other OTC: MAKSF - news ) was 12.2p lower at 492.8p. \nElsewhere, an Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) -fuelled rally helped ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) claim the FTSE top spot. Shares in the chip designer, whose products are used in iPhones, leapt 14p to 948p after Barron’s tipped Apple’s shares to rally by as much as 50pc. Mike van Dulken, of Accendo Markets, said ARM’s upward climb could also be attributed to some “digesting of the announcement earlier in the month of ARM’s partnership with chip-rival IBM (NYSE: IBM - news ) to strengthen each other’s Internet of Things businesses”. * iPhone 6s Plus sells out online as orders exceed Apple's expectations Meanwhile, a strong third-quarter for European carriers prompted Credit Suisse to raise the target price of International Airlines Group , from 750p to 852p. The shares rose 7p to 590.5p. \nFinally, Exane BNP Paribas targeted asset managers, given the recent stock market sell-off. The bank believes Man Group (LSE: EMG.L - news ) ’s shares do not reflect upside risks from a windfall of inflows from its AHL fund, while it reckons Henderson is positioned well on European equities. Man Group edged 1.6pc higher to 164p, while Henderson rose 1.9pc to 264.3p. * Aberdeen leads revival of the blue-chip asset managers (Other OTC: UBGXF - news )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T22:18:41.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
