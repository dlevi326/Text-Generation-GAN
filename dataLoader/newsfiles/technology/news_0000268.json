Yong, Trio-Tech's CEO, said, \"Consistent success in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry requires the discipline to respond with alacrity to the frequent and sometimes dramatic changes in business conditions that have always characterized our industry. Over the years we have built Trio-Tech with this requirement in mind, allowing us to offer a unique combination of state-of-the-art testing services and testing equipment, delivered to some of the world's leading technology companies through our scalable facilities in the industry's primary manufacturing centers. \n\"We worked hard this past year to improve operating efficiency and keep a tight lid on operating costs, even as we continued to provide the high quality products and services our customers expect. The result was improved profitability for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015, compared to the same periods of the prior year, despite higher taxes and a decrease in revenue from product sales that were offset by higher gross margin. Cash provided by operating activities also increased for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. We believe our improved bottom-line performance for fiscal 2015 versus prior year shows that our efforts to deliver value for our shareholders are meeting with success. \n\"We are alert to the potential impact of the slowdown in the Chinese economy and enter the new fiscal year with caution. We believe in the good relationship we have with our customers and that our wide range of products and services which is well-attuned to our customers’ needs. We look forward to a positive outlook for Trio-Tech.\" \nFourth Quarter Results \nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 ended June 30, 2015, revenue from semiconductor testing services was $4,191,000 compared to $4,773,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
