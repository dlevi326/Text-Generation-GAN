(NYSE Amex: UUU) today reported results for its first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015. \nUniversal reported sales of $2,936,490 for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 versus $2,514,385 for the comparable period of last year. While operating losses decreased from $737,967 in the 2014 quarter to $481,662 in the 2015 quarter on improved margins, the Company reported a net loss of $777,077, or $0.34 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $742,849 or $0.32 per basic and diluted share, for the same period last year. \n\"The Company received two additional approvals for its sealed smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarm products to complete its line of ionization smoke alarms and will start to deliver these two models in the quarter ending September 30, 2015. The primary reason for the increase in sales and higher gross margins during the current quarter was due to the delivery of our new sealed products and we expect this trend to continue. Our Joint Venture continues to experience diminished gross profit margins due to higher labor and material costs. We anticipate that the Joint Venture will be able to improve its gross profit margins later this fiscal year,\" said Harvey Grossblatt, Universal CEO. \nUNIVERSAL SECURITY INSTRUMENTS, INC. is a U.S.-based manufacturer (through its Hong Kong Joint Venture) and distributor of safety and security devices.
