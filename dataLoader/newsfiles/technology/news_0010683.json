The newest addition to the ProMetric® I-Series, the I29 complements the I2, I8, and I16 models, providing a higher resolution option for inspection applications that call for high resolution while meeting short cycle time requirements. The high spatial resolution of the I29 makes it capable of detecting very small flaws that are easily missed by human inspectors. Mura, particles, scratches, and other defects in flat panel displays can be identified and quantified using Radiant’s TrueTest™ Automated Visual Inspection software to provide objective and repeatable pass/fail criteria. “The I29 enables inspection of very fine detail, even in large and very high-resolution displays,” states Doug Kreysar, Chief Solutions Officer for Radiant Vision Systems. “It is also advantageous in ‘multi-channel’ configurations, where multiple devices are tested in a single cycle.” “Additionally,” continues Kreysar, “the I29 has been engineered for optimal measurement speed, which means the shortest possible takt times are achieved. This is critical to large volume manufacturers.”\nRadiant’s ProMetric® I Series colorimeters are built around scientific-grade, cooled interline CCD sensors, ranging in resolution from 2 to 29MP. Specially constructed to replicate human spatial perception of brightness and color, they bring the benefits of automation – speed, flexibility, and repeatability – and the accuracy of human vision to production inspection applications. Each model is available with a variety of interchangeable lenses, enabling optimized measurements over a wide range of working distances and viewing angles. ProMetric® I supports high-speed USB and Ethernet communications, providing reliable operation over long distances. Smart Technology™ features, including electronic lens control and onboard touchscreen, simplify setup and improve measurement accuracy. ProMetric® I can be paired to Radiant Vision Systems’ TrueTest™ software to provide a complete, turnkey solution for testing displays, keyboards, housings, and other products.\nAbout Radiant Vision Systems\nRadiant Vision Systems’ worldwide installed base has a proven track record that dates back more than 20 years.
