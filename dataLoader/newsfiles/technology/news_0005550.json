We have been observing a very positive trend in the IT industry. Rather than our professionals going abroad in search of attractive jobs, IT companies are opening their centres in Poland, including Krakow. The city has gained another employer in the high-tech sector, and this will create new, exciting job opportunities for Małopolska residents. Skilled and highly-paid young workers will now come to Krakow to find employment at Guidewire. The macro-scale effect is also noteworthy, as each new IT company operating in the region helps create a better environment for subsequent ventures. This is clearly a very positive and desirable development, both for Krakow and for the entire region,” said the Mayor of Krakow, Professor Jacek Majchrowski. \n“IT is one of the fastest growing industries in Poland. The availability of a highly skilled workforce is the main factor driving foreign investment in this sector. Polish IT professionals are highly regarded around the world for their knowledge and competence. Each year about 15,000 students graduate in Computer Science in Poland. Young Polish IT specialists, especially developers, rank with the best in the world. Guidewire Software is sure to find top class professionals in Małopolska,” said Tomasz Latocha, vice president of Małopolska Agencja Rozwoju Regionalnego S.A. (MARR). \n“The choice of Małopolska for the new development centre is a very positive sign from Guidewire Software. It demonstrates the high potential of the region. Krakow, and the entire area of southern Poland, is a major IT industry centre. 33 universities and almost 190,000 students are a real magnet for investment in the IT and R&D sectors. Over 16,000 people have already found jobs at more than 160 companies. We are particularly happy that Guidewire Software is another technology company to bring its advanced knowledge, know-how and capital to the region,” added Latocha. \n“Building on the success of our Dublin Development Centre, our investment in Krakow will allow us to increase European recruitment and to undertake full life-cycle product development that will benefit the Guidewire customer community,” said Dan Lonborg, senior director, software engineering, content, Guidewire Software. \nGuidewire Software, founded in 2001, is a provider of software products that help the general insurance industry transform their operations and respond to rapidly changing business needs.
