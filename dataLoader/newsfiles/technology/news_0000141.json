The company had not asked Way for permission, and she was not aware that Crocs had used the photo until a reporter contacted her on Instagram. \n“No one reached out to me,” said Way, 37, of Pearl River, N.Y. “I feel a little weirded out.” \nMuch later, Crocs sought her permission. \nInstagram and other social sites like Pinterest and Twitter have long been sources of selfies and candid shots that retailers and other companies mine for “consumer engagement,” an industry term that can mean anything from Facebook likes to hashtags for brands. \nBut as the practice of promoting user-generated content has intensified, the intersection between brands trying to capitalize on social media activity and people’s expectations of some privacy (even as they post personal photos on public platforms like Instagram) has grown far more murky. \nNo one, it seems, wants to actively police traditional rights issues like those presented in Way’s situation. Using photos like her daughter’s generally requires getting the consent of the person who posted the original content before it can be reused elsewhere. \n“This is a new area, and we want to make sure our customers are dotting the ‘Is’ and crossing the ‘Ts,’” said Sharad Verma, CEO and co-founder of Piqora, which helps brands curate user-generated content from sites like Instagram. “It’s important for brands to be very upfront and transparent about how the photos are being used.” \nFor its part, Instagram, which has about 300 million users, says it is responsible only for how brands use consumers’ photos posted on its site. \nThe Federal Trade Commission, which polices unfair or deceptive practices, could step in if Instagram violated its own privacy policy or promises made to consumers in its terms of service. But consumers have little recourse on their own, other than pursuing costly legal action. \nThe lack of oversight comes at a time when brands and social media sites are strengthening their relationships in efforts to generate ad revenue and lock in loyal consumers. Instagram, in particular, has been working to open its photo feed to all advertisers, big and small, across the globe. \nIn many cases, getting consent from a user can be as casual as a comment underneath the photo itself. \n“We love your pic!” the Crocs Instagram account writes on many of the user-generated snapshots featured on its website, followed by a request to feature the photo elsewhere. \nTo agree, users just have to reply with “#CrocsOk,” and many do. \nIn the case of Way and her daughter, however, Crocs did not comment on the photo to ask for permission until after posting it on its website. Way has not responded and says she does not intend to. \nIn a statement, Crocs said it believed it was “acting consistently with social media marketing best practices.” \n“We are continually evaluating our practices and welcome consumer feedback,” the company said. “It’s our policy to get permission before making any other use of photos consumers have tagged us in.” \nClothing and retail brands say that featuring user-generated photos on their websites and in their Instagram feeds is an effective way to connect with consumers, who are increasingly skipping commercials, blocking online ads and generally ignoring anything that resembles traditional advertising. Taking photos from social media accounts is also often cheaper and faster than creating a traditional marketing campaign. \nThe tactic is particularly popular among apparel companies, as they rethink how to maintain customer loyalty in the digital age. \n“There’s a significant risk of us losing that relationship with the customer and that bond you get from the experience in the store,” said Joe Megibow, the chief digital officer at American Eagle, which has galleries of consumers’ photos on its website. \nEric Goldman, a lawyer who specializes in intellectual property, said: “One of the questions that we run into online is, ‘What is the line between advertising and editorial content?’ If the brand is publishing the content online, odds are that it’s going to be considered an advertisement.” \nBrands may argue the opposite. Social media sites themselves may also give brands some troubling wiggle room, according to Silverberg. \nInstagram outlines some of the ways it may share content in its privacy policy and user agreement, but does not place enough restrictions on how other companies may use that content, Silverberg said. \n“For rights owners, there is an extremely uncomfortable ambiguity in what the ramifications are for the terms of use,” Silverberg said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T23:52:15.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
