Everything is on the table.”\nMr Roy talked up the government’s policy hackathon, an event aimed at “disrupting Canberra bureaucracy”, and said Malcolm Turnbull was “right behind” the event. He said the government was looking into a secondment-style arrangement with the private sector, pointing to the US where they have a “digital service” program as something that could be implemented locally.\nAustralia’s “tall poppy syndrome” also came under fire, something Mr Roy said must be “completely turned around” and replaced with a bold entrepreneurial spirit and an acceptance of risk. “The key performance indicator in achieving this will be when the next generation of Australians, instead of choosing the mines, will take a bit of risk and start their own business,” he said.\n“We need a culture change.”\nHe said the government must achieve strong co-operation between the government, higher education, science, research and private sectors, and that Australia had “seriously failed to crack the commercialisation nut.”\nAustralia had too much research for the sake of research, rather than “ideas that can actually can actually change the world and that have a real outcome.”\nLabor’s Clare O’Neil, speaking with Mr Roy during a panel session, called for a broadening of the innovation discussion to ­include issues such as broadband and education.\n“Take the National Broadband Network, we’re 44th in the world for internet speeds and need to fix this,” she said. “We need it in order to have a high-skilled, high-wage economy. And if you look at the relative performance of our education system, we’re ranked 19th in the world, and the top seven performers are Asian countries.”\nMr Roy, the youngest MP ever elected to parliament at age 20, said the government must ­encourage Australian investors and entrepreneurs alike to keep their money and talent down under.\nHe said last year Australians spent $200m betting on the ­Melbourne Cup, but just invested $100m through venture capital in start-ups.\n“We have incredible entrepreneurs,” Mr Roy said. “And if we can attract them back home, to invest in our start-ups, we’re in a very strong place.”\nHe said that the government must be prepared to experiment with different policies, which he admitted would be difficult in an environment he described as hyper-partisan.\n“The reality is, the ideas I put forward might or might not work,” he said. “But we need the political capital to experiment and try new things. So if we can achieve some level of bipartisanship that will give us the opportunity. You need political opponents giving you enough room to breathe.”\nMr Roy said Australia had almost $1 trillion sitting in superannuation, with some of this should be unlocked for innovation. But added he was nervous about the government picking winners.\nHe added it was “incredibly important” for Australia to remain a low-taxing economy.\n“I would want to see our company tax rate as low as possible and I also think some of the state taxes are massive business disincentives,” he said. “To me, all taxes fit in the pantheon of evils, it’s just a matter of where you rank them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:19:37.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
