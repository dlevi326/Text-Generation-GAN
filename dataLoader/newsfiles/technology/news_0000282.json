MedZed uses a combination of in-home caregivers and technology to connect high-risk patients to their medical team. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150909/264839LOGO \nMedZed began conducting home-based care in Atlanta in 2014 and expanded to New York this past summer. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the company is launching a program with a large healthcare delivery system in Southern California. \n\"This round of funding puts us in a strong cash position to enhance our technology, communications platform, and grow our management and clinical teams,\" said Scott Schnell, MedZed co-founder and chief executive officer. \"Our prior experiences of building large scale service companies and demonstrated success using caregivers and technology in the Atlanta market enabled us to raise the capital necessary to expand. We believe our services offers an improved patient experience while reducing costs for risk-bearing organizations.\" \nThe company continues to strengthen the team by naming Neil A. Solomon, MD as Co-founder, Chief Strategist & Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Solomon said, \"Today's healthcare system demands high standards of quality outcomes, patient satisfaction, and affordability. We developed a new model of telemedicine to bring the delivery system to patients and avoid costly acute care. We are providing a service to the very patients that our healthcare system is failing. These are also the patients who cost the most to programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\" \nAs hospital systems, insurers and Accountable Care Organizations embrace value-based payment models, MedZed is well positioned to serve frail, high-risk and post discharge patients in their homes. \nAbout MedZed \nMedZed partners with providers and insurers to \"re-imagine the house call.\" The company connects high-risk patients with their medical team in the comfort of the patient's home. Using telemedicine communications, proprietary technology and remote medical devices, the MedZed caregiver is able to assist physicians with real-time examinations and treatments. This combination of service and technology keeps patients healthier, improves the patient experience, and lowers healthcare costs by reducing expensive and unnecessary hospital utilization. \nMore information at: mymedzed.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:05:25.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
