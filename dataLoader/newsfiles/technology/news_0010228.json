The press and general public have gone crazy over this story with multiple view points, and now Rebtel ( www . Rebtel .com ), has tactfully danced its way in to the eye of the storm. Last night Rebtel pulled off a well-crafted move that had Times Square roaring, and a slew of cameras snapping. The flash event featured a handful of gorgeous nude Bollywood dancers clad i n only body paint styled in the design of green and gold half Sarees . The women hit Times square at 9:45PM and were filmed dancing to the popular Indian song, Chammak Challo , at the Pedestrian Plaza in Times Square ( https://youtu.be/orZ5z_Y_ cKU ) . A fast crowd gathered to watch and hopped in for free photo ops following the flash event, including the current controversial times square Desnudas . Combining eyebrow raising female nudity, the use of body paint in Times Square, eductive Bollywood moves, and the daring choice of an incredibly risqu stunt for a generally conservative culture, Rebtel now stands alone among competitors such as Skype and Reliance, not only for their extremely affordable Unlimited Calling Plan to India, for just $8 a month with the first month free( www.rebtel.com/indiaunlimited ), but also for their eagerness to ignore boundaries and become the latest topic in the already heated debate over such displays; all in the name of creating conversation within the Indian community.

We are proud that Rebtel represents a new generation of free thinkers. \nRebtels racy flash event and video of the event is already shaking up the Indian consumer market, addressing the disparity between conservative Indian culture, and the exhibitions of nudity that are currently raising questions about womens rights to freedom over their bodies.
