In both India and China, Uber is heavily subsidizing rides, trying to become the dominant player in markets where local rivals already have a head start. \nDidi, meanwhile, is using partnerships and investment dollars to fight Uber across the region. \nIn China, Didi is backed by Alibaba ( BABA , Tech30 ) and Tencent ( TCEHY ) , the country's top two Internet firms. \nAnd just last week, the company announced an agreement with LinkedIn ( LNKD , Tech30 ) . LinkedIn will help Didi recruit employees, while users of the social network can tap into the taxi app. Earlier this year, Didi made investments in GrabTaxi, a taxi service in Southeast Asia, and Lyft in the U.S. \nRelated: Ola: India's upstart start-up puts Uber in the shade \nUber, for its part, announced a $1 billion investment in the India market in July. \nUber also has some tie-ups in Asia, notably with Baidu ( BIDU , Tech30 ) , giving it access to China's most popular search engine and mapping application. And it launched a new carpool service in China last week. \nBut Uber has a long way to go in emerging markets like India and China -- Didi is in 360 cities in China, serving 200 million people with 7 million completed rides a day. \nOla has plans to add another 10,000 drivers to its network, and claims 750,000 rides a day in India.
