The excitement has been amplified by the appointment of Assistant Minister for Innovation Wyatt Roy, who will be to Innovation Minister Christopher Pyne what Robin was to Batman.\nRoy nobly declared he wants the Australian innovators, affectionately known as the Aussie mafia, in Silicon Valley to come home. The stage after having a great idea is attracting customers – it is at this stage that start-ups become businesses and need to leave the country. The mafia are running businesses in the valley, not starting them. They are feeding their potential unicorns, not trying to create new ones.\nIncubation platforms are expensive and highly competitive; aggregation platforms are relatively cheap and can be profitable. For the country to profit from technological innovation we do not need to generate the best ideas in the world. We need only to attract the proven ideas. Let's move from low-percentage unicorn incubators to high-value unicorn agistment. To bring the mafia home the ministers need to focus creating start-up \"feed lots\" rather than start-up humidicribs. We need fattening operations as good as the technology feed lots available overseas, so that we can keep our talent at home and bring in new technological wealth generation.\nClayton White\nSouth Granville, NSW\nCompany tax rate irrelevant on shore In \" Look again at the poor in GST models \" (Letters, AFR, September 16) Greg Angelo seeks to perpetuate one of the enduring myths regarding Australia's dividend imputation system by arguing that \"the proposal for a reduction in the company tax rate to 25 per cent will affect the value of all superannuation savings by a reduction in the dividend imputation rate\". I have seen this argument made several times recently and it is surely nonsense.\n Currently, a $70 franked dividend attracts a $30 imputation credit. At a 25 per cent rate of company tax, a $75 franked dividend with its attached $25 imputation credit would leave both the company and a resident shareholder in the same position as now – the company's retained earnings would still be $100 lower and the shareholder would still pay tax on $100 at their marginal rate. In fact, the shareholder would actually be slightly better off because they would have had an extra $5 in their bank account for longer.\nIf, despite the lower company tax rate, the company chose instead to maintain the dividend at the current $70, the imputation credit would be $23.33 and the balance of $6.67 would remain in the company's retained earnings and be reflected in the share price. Again, since capital gains are taxed concessionally, the shareholder would be no worse off, and may well be better off. The bottom line is that the company tax rate is irrelevant to a resident shareholder.\nJohn Lavery\nToowong, Qld\nAttacking retirees not the way to go Once again we see an attack on self-funded retirees, the very people that worked and saved hard to provide for their own retirement and not to burden the welfare system. This time it is about taxation on the earnings of funds that are now in the pension phase forgetting however that these same people funded that benefit by paying a contribution tax and surcharge tax in the accumulation phase.\nThis occurred by the Keating government bringing forward the lump sum tax on superannuation funds and replacing with an upfront contribution tax. All a bit topical at the moment as indeed there is no growth or income for most retirees and in most cases their monthly drawdown would most likely be capital and not interest or income. For those in the accumulation phase hoping to be self sufficient in the future the higher-income earners with the dubious honour of paying more tax at a progressive rate are accused of receiving a more favourable benefit for deductions, whether super or otherwise, when I am sure they would be happy to pay a flat rate of income tax and have the same deductibility as everyone else.\nPeter Hawks.\nAlbert Park, Vic\nExecutive pay a guessing game Until there is broad acceptance that investors (and others) cannot predict company performance, and are even less able to precisely assess an executive's contribution to that performance, retrospective dissatisfaction with executive remuneration arrangements that have previously been approved by investors will remain (\" Strikes threaten over executive pay \", AFR September 22).\nPseudo scientific approaches to assessing executive performance as a proportional derivative of corporate performance will usually ensure luck is the prime determinant of quantum received. The prevailing mood at vesting time will determine how the news is received.\nAmanda Wilson\nRegnan - Governance Research & Engagement\nSydney, NSW\nRetirees don't want to sell home Laura Tingle's article \" ScoMo searches for meaning in tax debate \" (AFR, September 24) suggests that Scott Morrison thinks (quite rightly from an economist's point of view) that our current tax and social security arrangements conspicuously lead us to lock up too much of our capital in our family homes where it cannot contribute to the investment and transformation needs of the economy.\nMany professional economists of Mr Morrison's age group fail to grasp the fact that after making many house moves over their working lives, made necessary by the increased mobility of today's employment opportunities, many, perhaps most, people upon reaching retirement age have had enough of moving house and just want to stay put, regardless of any financial incentives to move.\nMr Morrison and other economists of working age need to spend some time researching retired members of the community to see just how people's mindset changes as they age, and often causes older people to decide that the only way they will leave the home they have at retirement is to be carried out in a box.\nIn addition to Mr Morrison trying to change the rules so that people who downsize their houses won't lose their pension benefits, he might have even better results by continuing to encourage people to maximise contributions to superannuation during their working lives rather then putting their savings into more expensive homes during those years.\nMichael Palmer\nNedlands, WA\nTime to attack trust loophole It was great to read \" Eslake takes aim at tax lurks \" (AFR September 23). Up until now the unfairness of the wealthy using family trusts has been left out of the debate on tax reform. The NSW body the Independent Commission Against Corruption found that family trusts are being used to give loans which are never paid back. This happens because the system is not policed. This loophole has to be closed by preventing family trusts making loans.\nOnly when the tax system is made fairer will the \"age of entitlement\" be over.\nAdam Mikka\nCaves Beach, NSW\nRoyalties are not taxes The managing director of Rio Tinto trots out the standard deception of counting resource royalties paid for a public asset in with its \" taxes paid \" (AFR, September 23), and perhaps he can be excused for trying it on.\nAnd his claim that \"everything needs to be in the mix\" was a superb use of irony, considering the shrill response of the resources sector and the Business Council of Australia to any suggestion they might be asked to contribute to the society in which they operate.\nGeoff Davidson\nOurimbah, NSW\nIt's about the customers I don't agree with Martin Reeves, from the Boston Consulting Group, in his assessment that businesses must grapple now with five models for strategy development (\" Crisis looms for duo in strategy development \", AFR September 23.)\nI think only one model is proven and sustainable and that's to deliver the outcomes that your customers want better than anyone else. Building a culture that prioritises understanding, listening to, and always seeking to improve how you serve your customers is the best way to ensure that other people do your marketing for you and that you become the kind of place that innovators and high performers seek out for work.\nIn contrast, many of the \"transformational\" strategies I come across, usually after they've failed, are internally focused, poorly communicated and justified by cost savings such as outsourcing customer interaction and complaints to third parties, who have no ability to influence the things that really matter.\nThe way I see it, many start-up companies are picking the eyes out of industry sectors by addressing service gaps incumbent companies should have known about, or acted on, already.\nAnne Wickham\nBoxing Clever Pty Ltd\nManly, NSW", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:19:33.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
