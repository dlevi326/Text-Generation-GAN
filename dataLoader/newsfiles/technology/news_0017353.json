FSS provides valuable source information to national intelligence and security organizations to fight crime and terrorism. The satellites used for FSS generally have a low power output and require large dish-style antennas for reception. They have less power than direct broadcasting satellites. An FSS works on three bands: C-band, Ku-band, and Ka-band. Currently, the Ka-band is used predominantly in North America to serve the growing needs of the government, media, and network users. It provides high bandwidth and frequency compared to the other bands. Technavio's analysts forecast the global fixed satellite service market to grow at a CAGR of 5.15% during 2014-2019.
