Along with that, current uncertainty on Capitol Hill over continuing budget issues and tensions in the Middle East ripple across the Pentagon’s acquisition landscape. “In 2013, we took a hit and we still haven’t recovered,” Kendall said. “It could take a few more years.” \nWith the swirl of circumstances, Kendall said DOD is working on a variety of efforts to make its acquisition processes more approachable, less cumbersome and a little more robust. \nPartnering with Silicon Valley to get innovative ideas, practices and products is an important avenue, but it’s only one part of the plan. “Innovation isn’t a panacea, but it can contribute,” he said. \nDefense Secretary Ashton Carter traveled to Silicon Valley in late August as part of an evolving strategy to keep lines of communication open with the center of the U.S. technology industry. The visit, said Kendall, showed the department “was open for business” and was still filling some staff positions there. \nKendall also emphasized that recent tweaks to Better Buying Power 3.0, the latest round of Pentagon acquisition guidance that increases DOD officials' oversight of certain research and development efforts conducted by contractors, were meant to help both the Pentagon and contractors. \nThe change to the Better Buying Power 3.0 initiative requires require contractors to brief DOD before and after they conduct Pentagon-backed independent research and development projects. \nThose briefing, he said, “enhance communications between industry and the government. They’re beneficial without being a burden.” About the Author \nMark Rockwell is a staff writer covering acquisition, procurement and homeland security.
