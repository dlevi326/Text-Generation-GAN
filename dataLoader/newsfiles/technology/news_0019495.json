(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, Pool) Will #AshCarter's social media push work? More \nDefense Secretary Ash Carter's push to connect with troops on social media is a good way to reach service members who already spend a lot of time online, but likely won't give troops a venue to raise serious concerns, analysts say. \nScott Talan, a communications professor at American University, said the lack of anonymity on social media could make service members unwilling to bring up substantial concerns in that kind of forum. \n\"For any real criticism or something serious, it's unlikely they're going to post this on a public platform,\" he said. \"I doubt they'll get anything serious or critical, because it's not anonymous. People will fear repercussions.\" \nDuring a town hall question and answer session on Tuesday where Carter took questions submitted via social media with the hashtag #AskSecDef, he mostly fielded inquiries on topics he frequently speaks about, including women in combat, closing Guantanamo Bay, retirement and benefits reform and the strategy against the Islamic State. More from the Washington Examiner â€¢ 09/02/15 11:49 AM \nStill, Talan said using more social media is a necessary transition as the military tries to better connect with troops of all ages. \n\"The military presents vastly different security concerns and methods of command and communication. Unlike most workplaces, you can literally tell someone in the military exactly what you want and be confident it will be done. They may have felt like they didn't need other avenues,\" he said. \"It maybe could've been done sooner, but better late than never.\" \nIn May, Carter became the first defense secretary to have his own Facebook page, with the Pentagon saying that the social media platform will allow him to connect with troops and their families \"in a way that hasn't been possible before.\" \n\"Joining Facebook is just one more way as secretary of defense he can better communicate with service members and their families and help the Pentagon think 'outside the five sided box' to drive change,\" the statement said. \nUsing social media to communicate with troops gives the perception of access and also allows Carter to reach young troops who are increasingly using mobile devices and social media to get their news, said Karen Riggs, a social media expert and professor at Ohio University. Also from the Washington Examiner Is Bobby Jindal a growth stock in Iowa? \nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is currently in 14th place of the 15 Republican candidates in the RealClearPolitics average of presidential polls. He wasn't in the Fox News primetime debate on August 6, and he's a lock not to make the CNN primetime debate on September 16. \nBut something could be happening for Jindal in the first-voting state of Iowa. A new poll by the Des Moines Register has him at two percent -- nothing special there, although that is technically tied for seventh in the big field. Still, Jindal's favorable ratings are up dramatically, indicating he could be starting to move.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:01:38.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
