Based on the true story and best selling book by ‘The Blind Side’ writer Michael Lewis, the film stars Christian Bale, Brad Pitt, Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling.\nThe film tells the story of four outsiders and their prediction about the global collapse of the economy, which the big banks, media and government refuse to acknowledge. Right after their prediction, these four outisiders come up with an amazing idea; The Big Short. After predicting the economy crisis, they bet against the banks.\nThe film’s trailer is packed up with great ideas, hilarious financial jokes and of course, big star cast. Not only is the film releasing this year (earlier the film was set to release in 2016) but it is also being positioned as one of Paramount’s contenders for the coming Oscar race.\nBefore releasing nationwide on December 23, the film will be premiered as the closing night selection at the AFI Fest 2015 on November 12.\n‘The Big Short’ marks director Adam Mckay’s, who has given us comedy films like 'Step Brothers' and 'The Other Guys', first drama film.\nWatch the film’s official trailer below:\n Hollywood entertainment Brad Pitt Christian Bale Ryan Gosling Steve Carell The Big Short trailer Also Read Reshoots and lots of fun Watch: Ranbir, Arjun and Jacqueline groove to 'Matlabi' from 'Roy' Split is not a publicity stunt: Katie Price First Look: ‘Tu Hi Toh Hai’ song from 'Holiday'", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/big%20short_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/big%20short_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150923/entertainment-hollywood/article/watch-christian-bale-brad-pitt-ryan-gosling-and-steve-carell-", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-09-24T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:26:30.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
