An image made available by NASA on September 27, 2015, shows dark, narrow, 100 meter-long streaks called recurring slope lineae flowing downhill on Mars, inferred to have been formed by contemporary flowing water \n\"We have the capability to go there, ask these questions of life on Mars and answer it,\" said Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary science. \"Not an abstract question but a concrete one.\" \nEven before Monday's announcement, scientists believed chances were great that microbial life forms exist below the Martian surface, possibly in subterranean aquifers. \n\"To me the existence of microbial life in the subsurface of Mars has been very high,\" said Alfred McEwan, a University of Arizona researcher who is the principal investigator for the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRise), the powerful camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. \nLife forms probably could only survive below ground because the surface of Mars is so inhospitable, bombarded as it is by ultraviolet rays from the sun that would destroy all life as we know it, say experts, who note that Mars' thin atmosphere would offer little protection. \nMichael Myer, the lead scientist for NASA's Mars exploration program, emphasized that the source of the water that apparently caused the streaks on Mars's surface is not known. \nThe streaks appear during periods that are less cold and then disappear again when temperatures plunge, a phenomenon that was first observed in 2011. \nGrowing plants \nThe water could come from below the surface, so it is \"imperative\" to find other, more accessible places on the planet where the same phenomenon occurs and to look there for subterranean sources of water, Myer said. \n\"We only suspect those places exist and we have some kind of scientific evidence that they do,\" Grunsfeld said. \"That is going to be a very exciting area of exploration in the future.\" Summary of the main points announced about the discovery of water on Mars \nIf there is water on Mars in sufficient quantity then it would be possible to grow plants in inflatable greenhouses, he predicted. \nSince plants take in carbon dioxide, which is plentiful in Mars, and put out oxygen, they could serve to produce food while at the same time creating breathable environments, he said. \nNASA officials are confident that over the next five years they can unlock some of the planet's secrets and thereby help to set the stage for future manned missions to Mars. \nIn March 2016, NASA will launch a Mars lander called InSight, which for the first time will be able to peer below the Martian surface. \nThe European Space Agency, as part of its ExoMars program, plans to launch a Mars orbiter in 2016, followed by a robot and exploration platform on the planet's surface two years later, in collaboration with Russia. \nThe objective of these missions is to detect methane and other signs of biological activity. \nFinally, in 2020, the United States will send a new robotic rover similar to but more sophisticated than Curiosity to take Martian soil samples and bring them back to Earth. \nThe US space agency envisages its first manned mission to Mars in the 2030s, if not sooner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T23:23:11.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
