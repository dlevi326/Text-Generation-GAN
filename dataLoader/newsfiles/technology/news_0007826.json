Something’s I read in the bible contradicts what I see in real life, my mentality was nothing on earth has given evidence of this being that exists, I found the preachers greedy men, thinking they are holier than everyone praying over people in church and in the week they committed greed and vanity, the bible though is maybe some piece of evidence God does exist, but it has been rewritten by men, for a long time I judged the medofiles, lairs and greedy pastors of the church, I put them in the same category that God was.\nMy dreams, if I can describe to you how many dreams a night I have of a being looking at me and I do not feel scared, rather full of joy! It took me a while to separate God from the people who supposedly spread his word, the bible though evidence, I do not fully understand what earth was or time rather or God was before it? I bet many of you are asking the same question or have at one point or another.\nI guess we will never have the answer to any of it as long as we are here on earth and breathing.\nBut I do believe God exists and I will tell you how I know, God lives in every one of us, good or evil, Gods knowledge is taken from every one of us, we are all connect by spirit, human and animal, we are here to live a full life of love and joy, we have one life to live, just one let that sink in for a minute, and yet we live a life of hate Doesn’t matter if you black or white, you shouldn’t hate one another based on being a different colour, we all different and we all have a right to be on this planet, animals get abused and murdered as if they are nothing? What compassion do we have if we treat another living being with such disrespect? What hope is there for us? If we had hearts like animals this world would be a much kinder place to be.\nI am not trying to tell you what to believe, look at everything around you, earth, ocean, sky and space and most of all look at the people you hate and try and look deeper you might be surprised to find yourself there.\nHave a splendid and joyful day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:17:41.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
