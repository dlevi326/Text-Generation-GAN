In this segment Mr Seroka articulates the ways in which the Port of Los Angeles collaborates with partners, stakeholders and nodes across the supply chain to create the dialogue that nurtures the solutions the industry needs. \nAs CEO of the busiest port in the US the challenges Mr Seroka faces are unique, yet by collaborating with neighbour the Port of Long Beach , the second busiest port in the US in the form of a supply chain optimisation group, he strives to bring greater visibility across the chain. \nOther areas Mr Seroka highlights that bring greater visibility include dialogue with rail and truck services, as well as the practice of ‘block stowage’, which is greater organisation when a ship is primarily loaded. \nTaking into account all the players and nodes across the supply chain, Mr Seroka outlines how his port aims to be the “entity that brings folks together” to create solutions that benefit everybody.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T14:35:47.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
