She also notes that the dramatic growth in the MEMS market alone should reach nearly 25 billion units annually by 2019, according to the market research firm IHS. \"And if we add a selection of sensors — magnetic sensors, light sensors and emerging sensors for consumer applications, such as fingerprint sensors — we are looking at an additional 5-plus billion units by that time. That's a massive number of MEMS/sensors adding product-differentiating value to commercial applications just four years from today.\" \nTo dig deeper into this phenomenon, the conference will offer keynotes by Steve Nasiri, of Nasiri Ventures, and Wouter Leibbrandt, senior director of systems and applications, NXP, as well as sessions with such speakers as Alissa Fitzgerald, founder & managing member of AM Fitzgerald & Associates; Jack McCauley, president, R0R3 Devices; Jérémie Bouchaud, director & senior principal analyst, IHS; David Horsley, CTO, Chirp Microsystems; K.G. Ganapathi, executive director, general manager of the MEMS Sensors Business Unit, Lenovo; Dan Armbrust, CEO and co-founder, Silicon Catalyst; Josh Knauer, CEO, Rhiza; and Jeff Owens, CTO, Delphi.
