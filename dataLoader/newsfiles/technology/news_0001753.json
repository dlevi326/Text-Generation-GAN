(“UPSI”), based in Castroville, California, by Fujifilm’s electronic materials manufacturing and marketing subsidiary, FUJIFILM Electronic Materials U.S.A., Inc. (“FEUS”). Upon completion of the acquisition, UPSI, a manufacturer of high-purity solvents used in semiconductor-related manufacturing processes will become a subsidiary of FEUS, to be known as FUJIFILM Ultra Pure Solutions, Inc. The acquisition, which is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed this year. \n“This acquisition will further reinforce Fujifilm’s global leadership and commitment to the semiconductor industry,\" said Dr. Brian O’Donnelly, President & CEO, FUJIFILM Electronic Materials U.S.A., Inc. \"Fujifilm’s market and manufacturing leadership will be strengthened by adding Ultra Pure Solutions’ high-purity product line, manufacturing infrastructure and supply chain to our existing competencies in providing our customers with advanced semiconductor materials technology solutions and delivery equipment.” \n“This is an exciting new chapter for us,” said Christopher Fitzjohn, President and founder, Ultra Pure Solutions, Inc. “With the combined strength and capability of FUJIFILM Electronic Materials and Ultra Pure Solutions, I have no doubt that together, we will be able to expand the business and provide solutions for a variety of customers worldwide.” \nSolvents are used widely in semiconductor-related manufacturing processes, such as cleaning and rinsing silicon wafers carrying electronic circuits as well as producing and processing photoresists used in semiconductor manufacturing. In these semiconductor-related manufacturing processes, the presence of impurities in solvents, such as metal ions and ultra-small foreign particles, can reduce the yield rate of semiconductor products. With semiconductors’ electronic circuits becoming smaller and finer, solvents must have even greater purity. \nUPSI has facilities in Castroville, California and Carrollton, Texas capable of producing select high-purity solvents meeting demanding customer requirements. UPSI also has a broad product lineup catering to other diverse customer needs. Currently, it is one of the main suppliers of these select high-purity solvents in the U.S., with a customer base including major semiconductor manufacturers and chemical manufacturers throughout the country. \nFujifilm, while focusing on the development, production and sale of photoresists, developers, cleaners, CMP slurries and other enabling chemistries for use in semiconductor fabrication, also manufactures and sells high purity solvents. Upon completion, this latest acquisition is a good example of Fujifilm’s efforts to focus on developing the company’s highly functional materials business, and will reinforce Fujifilm’s current strategy of broadening its product offerings to further expand its electronic materials business. \nAbout FUJIFILM Electronic Materials U.S.A., Inc. \nFUJIFILM Electronic Materials U.S.A., Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FUJIFILM Corporation. Together with its global affiliates, it has offices in Japan, the United States and Belgium, and manufacturing and R&D facilities located worldwide.
