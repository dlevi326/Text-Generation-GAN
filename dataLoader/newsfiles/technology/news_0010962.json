If successful, that would make China only the third country after the United States and Russia to have carried out such a maneuver. \nChina's lunar exploration program, named Chang'e after a mythical goddess, has already launched a pair of orbiting lunar probes, and in 2013 landed a craft on the moon with a rover onboard. \nChina has also hinted at a possible crewed mission to the moon. \nChina sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 and has powered ahead with a series of methodically timed steps, including the deploying of an experimental space station.
