Cameron Keady Good News Associate Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 09/29/2015 09:22 AM EDT ADVERTISEMENT \nAn innovative teen has helped a woman enjoy a simple joy of being a mother. \nAlden Kane, a Detroit high school student, created a custom adaptable stroller that will allow new mother Sharina Jones -- who uses a wheelchair -- to take her baby for a walk, Fox 2 reported. The device was a research project of Kane’s, and was presented to Jones as a prototype. \n\"The biggest priority is to make it safe for baby, of course,\" Kane told the news outlet. \"And then, also you really want to make it independent for the mother.\" \nThe 16-year-old is a senior at the University of Detroit Jesuit High School and began developing the apparatus in his STEM class in the spring, after receiving an assignment to create a device that would let a mother in a wheelchair easily carry her baby, according to a news release from the university . Jones was to be the recipient of the prototype. \n\"A lot of my friends have babies and they are out, running with their babies in the stroller and I thought, 'What am I going to do?'\" she told FOX 2 . \nKane consulted Jones during the design process, using her July due date as the motivating force to efficiently complete the project. \n“It was great to meet her and talk to her about what she wants and doesn’t want,” he explained to The Michigan Catholic . “Talking to her was a big help, figuring out the workability of the device, where to put a diaper bag, whether or not she could unhook the stroller and how she can move around in the chair.” \nFor the final product, Kane used lightweight metal tubing that easily clips onto the wheelchair and safely holds the weight of a baby in a car seat. After seeing the new mother and her baby happy with his invention, Kane hopes to make the device accessible to more people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:39:54.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
