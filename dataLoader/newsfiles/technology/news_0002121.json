This latest development builds on Prodways investment in SLS including the acquisition of Norge Systems earlier this year. \nCombining both Prodways and Farsoon’s R&D resources will create a strong research facility to rapidly develop SLS printers using plastic and metal powders. These will be marketed by Prodways worldwide under the “Prodways powered by Farsoon” brand and a dedicated assembly line for these new machines will be installed in Les Mureaux (Prodways’ site). \nProdways will exhibit at TCT Show + Personalize on 30th September - 1st October, 2015 at the NEC, Birmingham and at this year's formnext powered by tct event in Frankfurt on 17-20th November 2015.
