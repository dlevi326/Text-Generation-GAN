This feasibility study aims to answer whether abzymes can fulfil their clinical promise given the novel techniques now available in antibody research. This 12 month project will be supervised by Professor Nigel Scrutton (Director of the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology) and will involve working with collaborators at the biopharmaceutical company UCB. You will join an established lab of over 30 researchers specialising in the catalytic power of enzymes. \nYou will hold a PhD (or equivalent) in biotechnology, molecular biology or enzymology (or a related subject area), and have technical skills in recombinant DNA techniques and bioscreening. \nThe University of Manchester values a diverse workforce and welcomes applications from all sections of the community. \nEnquiries about the vacancy, shortlisting and interviews:Dr Louise Barnes, Research Development Manager", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T05:27:42.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
