Mining could be one. Technology another one. And if you look at the future, Mr Turnbull is already advancing the right sorts of policies.\n“He knows exactly what needs to be done — to start laying the building blocks of innovation. Having an educated workforce, making STEM a priority in terms of investments in science, ­technology, engineering and mathematics.’’\nMr Kundra, now executive vice-president of emerging ­markets for global cloud software firm Salesforce, was an adviser to Mr Turnbull on the government’s Digital Transformation Office, one of the PM’s pet projects that aims to shift all public services to be “digital by default”.\n“It was fun working with him,” Mr Kundra said. “He understands that when you look at the likes of Uber and Airbnb, the disruption is coming from the outside now. Uber is driving down the cost of transportation where it will soon be cheaper than buses. So from a public policy perspective, what ­becomes the role of government? Is it to regulate the algorithm? Is it to rethink your investments?\n“What was really impressive in the discussion was he had actually been to a lot of these places personally. He’s been to the US, the UK, Japan; he had first-hand knowledge of everything that’s going on with technology disruption, which I was blown away by.\n“Turnbull had a very strong point of view on how central technology is to his own agenda. So when we launched the (DTO) together it was about what’s working, what’s not working, and how do you take these best practices and apply them to Australia.”\nThe DTO has already kicked into gear under new chief executive Paul Shetler, a former director of Britain’s Government Digital Service, and has been allocated a budget of $95.4 million over the next four years in the 2015-16 budget.\nMr Turnbull and Mr Kundra wrote a joint opinion piece for The Australian in March, in which they argued for government to take an ambitious leadership role in the digital economy. “Continuing with the status quo isn’t good enough,” they wrote. “Government needs to embrace digital and design services that are simpler and more convenient to use. The first and most important step towards success is to put citizens at the heart of government operation.”\nMr Obama last week announced $US160m in grants to accelerate a smart cities initiative across the country, and Mr Kundra expressed optimism that Australia’s cities would not be left behind. “These are investments that already starting to happen in Australia,” he said.\nDavid Swan travelled to San Francisco as a guest of Salesforce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T00:59:08.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
