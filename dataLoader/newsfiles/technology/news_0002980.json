He also said China's economy faces downward pressure but is still operating within a proper range, adding exchange rate reform will continue and there was no basis for sustained depreciation in the yuan. \nWhile in Seattle on Tuesday and Wednesday, Xi and top leaders from China's Internet regulator and tech firms are expected to meet leaders from Microsoft, Apple Inc, Amazon.com and other tech companies seeking to expand access to the Chinese consumer market. \nEven if no formal agreements are reached, the presidential blessing \"sends an important message to Chinese leadership\" to help them, said Ed Lazowska, Bill and Melinda Gates Chair of computer science at the University of Washington. \nFor Boeing, the visit could bring a formal announcement of plans for an aircraft finishing plant in China. The plant would help Boeing's Chinese sales, analysts say, and help counter a threat from Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd , which is developing a single-aisle aircraft to challenge the top-selling Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 planes. \nXi and Ray Conner, Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive, are due on Wednesday to tour the Everett, Washington, factory where Boeing makes widebody planes such as the 777 and 787 Dreamliner. Airbus opened an assembly line in China in 2008 and recently won a landmark, $11 billion order from China. \nXi is due to make a policy speech on Tuesday night in Seattle. But prospects for broad policy changes appear limited. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce expressed disappointment on Monday at the failure to narrow disagreement on a bilateral investment treaty that would open more Chinese business sectors to U.S. investment. The U.S. also wants to build on climate change commitments and agree on new rules to cut the risk of confrontation in the Asia-Pacific region, U.S. and Chinese sources have said. \nChina's slowing economic growth has raised questions about Xi's economic stewardship and puts him in a more difficult position than when he previously met with Obama last November in Beijing. \"He comes into the summit on his back foot,\" a former senior administration official said. \nWashington has threatened sanctions against Chinese individuals and companies that have been accused of hacking U.S. corporate databases. \nOn the eve of Xi's visit, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew urged China to reaffirm its commitment to moving toward a market-oriented, consumer-driven economy. \nIn an article in the Wall Street Journal, Lew said questions remain about the business climate in China because of Beijing's restrictions on the purchase of foreign technology and its review process for foreign investment. He also cited concerns about China's currency valuation policies. \nOn Monday, Washington state announced four cooperation agreements would be signed with entities from China, including plans to promote trade, investment and clean energy research.
