Its fleet is comprised of a group of more than 100 vessels, organised into three divisions: operating, newbuild and managed. With over 3000 employees, the company oversee and manage every aspect of the process from ship to shore. A conservative, strategic approach allows for measured and consistent growth, while a strong set of values govern the integrity of our everyday decisions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T12:44:07.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
