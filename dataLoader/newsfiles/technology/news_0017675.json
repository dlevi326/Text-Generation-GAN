This product will be available in March 2016. \nThe new product supports Main 4:2:2 10 profile, which is the high quality video standard for professional use in HEVC, and allows high-quality real time distribution of 4K UHD video. The built-in high quality HEVC single chip LSI capable of taking full advantage of the HEVC compression performance has enabled downsizing and low power consumption, which have been difficult to achieve with conventional high-performance general-purpose processors and other devices. It also supports the HD video format, which is the mainstream broadcasting format at present, making it possible to distribute HD video as well as 4K video. \nThis product will be exhibited at IBC2015 (at the NTT Group booth located at C58 in Hall 2), which is Europe’s largest broadcast equipment/broadcast technology exhibition to be held in Amsterdam during September 11-15. At IBC2015, NTT Electronics will demonstrate 4K video distribution jointly with NTT Media Intelligence Laboratories. \nFeatures of HHC11000 Equipped high quality HEVC single chip LSI Equipped with hardware algorithm for enhancing HEVC video quality For 4K/HD/SD, supports HEVC Main/Main 10/Main 4:2:2 10 profiles Space-saving 1U rack-mount size Supports highly versatile output interfaces DVB-ASI x 2 TS over IP x 2 Redundant Power Supply Supports IP extension function In order to meet the demand to reduce video transmission costs by utilizing IP networks, the next version is planned to support FireFort®-LDGM FEC 2 , which is a high-performance packet transmission error correction technology developed by NTT Network Innovation Laboratories. \nSales price", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:31:52.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
