Director Ridley Scott knew about the discovery of water on Mars two months before it was announced. Picture: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP The British moviemaker revealed he knew about NASA‚Äôs big news two months before it was announced and was shown photographs obtained by the space agency, but he was unable to use the information to change a key plot point of his new movie.\nIn the film, Matt Damon plays an astronaut left to fend for himself on Mars, and his character uses special equipment to manufacture his own water.\nScott, who has already screened the film for NASA staff, admitted the agency‚Äôs latest discovery would have changed the film if it had come earlier.\nHe told the New York Times: ‚Äú(Damon‚Äôs character) would‚Äôve gone and dug in ... He‚Äôd have found the edge of a glacier, definitely. It would be fascinating. But then I would‚Äôve lost a great sequence. He has to make water, and the steaming device, and put up the plastic tents, which creates the humidity, which grows the plants, which is the most basic form of irrigation. They still do it in Spain that way.‚Äù\nMan on Mars - Mission to the Red Planet 49:47 Getting to the red planet would involve a three year trek.
