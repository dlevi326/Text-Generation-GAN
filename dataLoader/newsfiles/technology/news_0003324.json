His announcement marks the first time that any state is attempting to set the minimum wage at this rate—while the city of Seattle passed an ordinance for $15 minimum wage by 2021, the District of Columbia currently leads the way with a statewide minimum wage of $10.50.\nThe minimum wage increase would be phased in for all employees by 2018 in New York City, and 2021 statewide. It starts now for fast-food workers, however:\nWage order designating $15/hour for fast food workers is signed today by Acting Labor Commissioner Musolino. pic.twitter.com/Dap76RpUYD\n— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) September 10, 2015 “If you work full time, you shouldn’t have to live in poverty—plain and simple,” said Cuomo at a rally at Javits Center . He was joined by Vice President Joe Biden. “Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour will add fairness to our economy and bring dignity and respect to 2.2 million people, many of whom have been forced to live in poverty for too long.”", "external_links": ["http://t.co/Dap76RpUYD", "https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-joined-vice-president-biden-announces-push-raise-new-yorks-minimum-wage-15-hour", "https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/642057272403824641"], "published": "2015-09-11T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:59:56.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
