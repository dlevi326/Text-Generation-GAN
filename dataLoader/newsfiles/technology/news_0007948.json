The company is set to open an African base by 2016 and has ambitions to build a next-generation platform for its expanding African operations. \nTo make sure all pay-TV operations are up and running before then, it has expanded its business relationship with content security firm Conax. \nThe latter will provide StarTimes with its Trusted Link security client, security expertise and the technical blueprint for designing and deploying a complete, secure multi-room service. The so-called 'Whole Home' solution is designed to provide a service for African households, making it easier to share live TV and PVR within the home without needing an Internet connection. Delivery is planned for Q4 2015. \nThe media gateway solution will be based on a master PVR developed by StarTimes, and supplemented by tablets, smartphones and a low-cost Android set-top-box . The new service will enable all live content from the master PVR, plus PVR recordings, streamed to supplementary in-home devices. Consumers can also programme and steer the PVR from the in-home devices. \n\"StarTimes is the fastest-growing digital TV operator in Africa with an ambition to ensure our brands are perceived as highly reliable operators offering a colourful bouquet of services and the highest quality customer service, at competitive rates,\" said group chairman and president, Pang Xinxing. \"As we plan our advanced platform, the new solution with Conax provides an extremely attractive service offering as well as the opportunity for StarTimes Africa operators to introduce multi-room and multiscreen features without adding additional hardware.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T09:53:45.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
