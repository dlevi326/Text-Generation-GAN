Command will then be passed to NASA's Scott Kelly , who along with Mikhail Kornienko of Russia is spending a full year on the station to study the effects of long space travel in preparation for a possible future trip to Mars.\nRussian Mission Control said the Soyuz, which blasted off on Wednesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, docked on time at 10:42 a.m. Moscow time (0742GMT) on Friday.\nFor the past two years, the crews have taken a more direct, six-hour flight, but this time the Russian Federal Space Agency decided to revert to the traditional route, citing security concerns after the International Space Station had to adjust its orbit to dodge space junk.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/54/00/8568888/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/56/72/8580748/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/56/72/8580749/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/54/00/8568887/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/56/72/8580749/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/56/72/8580748/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/54/00/8568887/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/54/00/8568888/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-04T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:52:51.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
