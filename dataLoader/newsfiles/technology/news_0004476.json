If not addressed effectively, these conflicts leave organizations vulnerable to serious errors and increase the potential of network downtime. CABLExpress has released a white paper that outlines these standards conflicts and how to avoid them. \nThe white paper, \" Conflicts in Data Center Fiber Structured Cabling Standards ,\" discusses: -- Trends in layer one Fibre Channel and Ethernet communications and how to design a flexible, standards-compliant infrastructure that is adaptable to these trends -- The impact of standards documents, including ANSI/TIA-568-C, ANSI/TIA-942-A, BICSI 002, and IEEE -- The conflicts that exist in the standards and the keys to avoiding these conflicts -- Real-world examples and best practices on achieving proper fiber optic infrastructure specifications \n\"Data center standards are imperative to the successful design of fiber optic structured cabling systems, and are necessary to facilitate proper planning and growth,\" said Rick Dallmann, senior data center infrastructure architect at CABLExpress. \"The speed at which new technologies are being adopted has left gaps in the standards. By understanding these gaps and the conflicts they create, you can implement systems that perform more efficiently and reliably.\" \nTo download this free white paper, visit www.cablexpress.com/conflicts . \nThe AFCOM Data Center World Conference is taking place at the Gaylord National Resort in National Harbor from September 20-23. Rick Dallmann will be speaking on the topic of conflicts in the standards on Monday, September 21 at 10:20 a.m. Experts will also be available at CABLExpress booth 605 on the exhibit floor to discuss data center trends and layer one infrastructure solutions. \nAbout CABLExpress(® ) CABLExpress, a division of CXtec, has manufactured high-performance cabling and data center infrastructure products and structured cabling solutions for more than three decades.
