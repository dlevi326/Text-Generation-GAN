His first brush with the euphoria sports offers had come when the team he adopted two hours earlier won a playoff game that seemed like it’d never end, the final Christmas gift he unwrapped that year.\nThat was good, but what came next year — a Super Bowl championship — was very good.\nA frustrated Dolphins fan yells after a Patriots touchdown in their game on Nov. 6, 2005. (Staff photo by Richard Graulich/The Palm Beach Post) And what was unfolding now — back-to-back Super Bowl titles — that was, well, the kind of thing that happens all the time.\nStill too young to drive, he bummed a ride to Little Havana, the car snaking through the bedlam of Southwest Eighth Street. The Steelers could have their terrible towels. Fans here celebrated touchdowns with a shimmering sea of waved white handkerchiefs. This occasion called for something bigger. Amid the honking horns and pots clanged together, the locals filtered out onto their balconies, waving white sheets they’d yanked off their beds.\nYears later, the boy would regret not recognizing, in those moments, he was witnessing Miami more delirious, more united, than he ever would again.\nFair weather Dolphin fans leave the stadium in the third quarter missing out on the comeback. The Dolphins won 24-23 as they scored three touchdowns in the fourth quarter on Dec. 4, 2005 (Staff Photo by Allen Eyestone/The Palm Beach Post) Euphoria remained at a fever pitch the next day, when everybody reconvened at Miami International Airport for a welcoming ceremony.\n“We’ll do it one more time,” somebody yelled into the microphone, “in Super Bowl nine!”\nWhat happened?\nCut to today, when that boy finds himself covering the Miami Dolphins on a daily basis, required by professional objectivity to maintain a safe following distance, and grateful for the shelter it offers.\nNo, the Dolphins do not make me cry.\nFifty years of the Miami Dolphins, my editor said. Wrap that up in a column, he said. A month later — heck, a couple of days after deadline — he asked what the heck I was planning to write. I still fumbled for an answer. Then I realized I was searching for something that did not exist.\nDoes anybody really know what to make of the Miami Dolphins?\nAt training camp, I quizzed those in the know about what defines this franchise, what makes it unique. The inquiry stopped people cold. Sure, 1972 was on tongues, but few wanted to say it. That’s not a lack of respect for 17-0. It’s a gnawing feeling, knowing that kids like me in Little Havana that day have had kids, and their kids have had kids, since. Things happen in 42 years — 43 if you prefer first championship — but one thing that can’t ever seem to happen is the one thing Dolphins fans want most.\nDec. 16, 2007. If you want to tie a bow on what defines this franchise, refer to that date. The Dolphins honored the 35th anniversary of the ’72 team that afternoon. They also won, defeating the Baltimore Ravens in overtime. It was the only thing standing between them and 0-16 that year.\nThis is the franchise of Don Shula and Dan Marino.\nThis is the franchise of Richie Incognito and Jonathan Martin.\nThis is the franchise that lured Bill Parcells and Nick Saban and Jimmy Johnson.\nYet won more with Dave Wannstedt.\nThis is the franchise that bagged free agents Keith Jackson, Mike Wallace, Branden Albert and, now, Ndamukong Suh.\nBut whiffed mightily on Jim Harbaugh and Jeff Fisher.\nCam Cameron over Mike Tomlin? Jamar Fletcher over Drew Brees? Eric Kumerow over anybody not named Eric Kumerow? Check, check, dreck.\nFans have grown numb\nWe’ve become accustomed to mediocrity. No, that’s not right. We’ve become numb to it, numbed by a franchise that reached the mountaintop, then slipped into a never-ending funk. It’s a script copied when the Marlins won two championships right off the bat, and the Panthers nearly won one, before turning off the mainstream audiences they had so magically turned on.\nIn this market, only the Heat stands like a beacon of what franchises ought to be. LeBron James is gone, but does anyone expect the Heat to become irrelevant under Micky Arison, Pat Riley and Erik Spoelstra?\nCold truth: Outside of our South Florida bubble, the Dolphins are irrelevant. Proof: From 1970 through the Marino years, they were on in prime time an average of 2.8 times per season. For much of that era, prime time meant Monday Night Football or nothing; watered-down prime-time games featuring every team came later. To make this an apples-to-apples comparison, post-Marino, the Dolphins have been on the marquee game of the week, whether it be Monday or Sunday night, an average of only 0.7 times per season. In fact, since Sunday Night Football became the game of the week in 2006, NBC has selected Miami only twice.\nJust as fears were raised that the Dolphins were wasting the Marino years, with no defense and no running game, the same could be said of the Jason Taylor/Zach Thomas years. Today, we wonder about the Cameron Wake/Suh years. Will the Dolphins forever be the Chicago Cubs of the NFL?\nMediocrity also masks how far the Dolphins have been from sniffing a championship. The last time they reached even the final four was the 1992 season. The only other teams that can say that: the Lions, resurrected Browns and expansion Texans. One missing piece away? The Dolphins can’t rightly claim they’ve been that. The Jaguars can.\nDespite all the Dolphins’ faults, to suggest the franchise can’t do anything right would be a mistake, too. Yes, Stephen Ross was blinded by that orange carpet in the beginning, but his checkbook was and is wide open. That’s why Suh is here and why Ryan Tannehill isn’t going anywhere.\nGood luck quantifying the payoff from Ross’ analytics and unique front-office power structure, but at least he’s not content to simply live off the cash-cow of shared league revenue. Plus, he’s pouring $400 million into Joe Robbie Stadium (yes, I called it that). Ross of course wants the occasional Super Bowl here, but most of the comfort will be enjoyed by you, annually.\nThe jury has barely begun deliberating on Joe Philbin, and not a down has been played in 2015-16, but given the messes the rest of the AFC East teams find themselves in, and that the Dolphins may have a roster with more potential than any since this playoff drought started in 2009, fans should tread into this season with hope.\nAt least today, there is that.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/29/73/6d/PHi_j0218_22.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/29/25/dc/PHi_j0128_14.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-09T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T14:11:09.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
