RELATED NEW DELHI: In line with previous rumours, it looks like Apple is all set to announce its much anticipated, 12.9-inch display equipped tablet, iPad Pro during its September 9 special event. According to a new report by Apple-focused blog 9to5Mac, the production of the new iPad Pro is running behind schedule. While Apple will announce it during this week's event, pre-orders will be opened in October, and the device will start shipping in November. The report suggests that iPad Pro will experience initial supply constraints even though it will carry a high price tag of around $1000. The report also mentions that the base model of the iPad Pro will come with 64GB storage and even a 128GB version will be available. It will run iOS 9.1, the first update to iOS 9 that will offer special features for big screens such as optimized versions of split-screen apps, Picture-in-Picture video and others. The report cites sources to suggest that the 12.9-inch display of the iPad Pro will let users run two full-sized portrait iPad apps in landscape split-screen mode. The iPad Pro will be available in gold, silver and space gray colours. The iPad Pro will come in LTE versions and the pricing of the cellular capability-equipped versions will be closer to that of Apple's new MacBooks, the report claims. It will be powered by an A9X chip, which is reportedly much more powerful than iPad Air 2's A8X chip. The iPad Pro will feature four stereo speakers and a single Lightning connector port at the bottom. The report also states that Apple will not bundle the iPad Pro with a Force Touch-integrated iPad stylus or keyboard but will sell these accessories separately. Another report by the same website had hinted that iPad Pro would include a Force Touch based screen, similar to the one expected to be featured on the new iPhones, in addition to a stylus accessory. It had suggested earlier that Apple would bundle the stylus with the iPad Pro in box and that the stylus would support enhanced drawing and design apps and would leverage the Force Touch screen. Apple is expected to launch two new iPhone models and an Apple TV model during the September 9 event. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=iPad Pro features,iPad Pro,iPad,Apple Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:12:48.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
