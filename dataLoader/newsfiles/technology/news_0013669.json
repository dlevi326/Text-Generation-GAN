Four others charged by U.S. prosecutors previously pleaded guilty.\nFishenko's lawyer, Richard Levitt, declined comment.\nThe prosecutor's spokeswoman said Fishenko's plea to charges including acting as an unregistered agent of the Russian government and conspiring to export controlled microelectronics to Russia came without any agreement to cooperate with investigators.\nSentencing was scheduled for Jan. 14, and prosecutors estimate that under U.S. sentencing guidelines, he faces up to 15-2/3 years in prison, the spokeswoman said.\nProsecutors said that from 2008 to 2012, Fishenko oversaw a scheme to obtain advanced, technologically cutting-edge U.S.-made microelectronics in order to export them to Russia while evading the U.S. government's export licensing system.\nProsecutors said Fishenko used a Houston-based company he founded called Arc Electronics to acquire the electronic components for Russian agencies, including the Russian armed forces and Russia's principal domestic intelligence agency.\nThe components included microcontrollers, microprocessors, static random access memory chips and analog-to-digital converters, items prosecutors said could be used for radar and surveillance systems, missile guidance systems and detonation triggers.\nU.S. authorities said a subsequent probe uncovered a letter by an electronics laboratory operated by Russia's Federal Security Service, its domestic intelligence agency, to an affiliate of a Moscow-based procurement firm at which Fishenko was an executive.\nThe letter to the Apex System LLC affiliate contended that microchips obtained by Arc Electronics had been faulty and demanded that replacement parts be supplied, prosecutors said.\nThe case is U.S. v. Fishenko, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 12-00626.
