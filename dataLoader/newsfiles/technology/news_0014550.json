Friday's launch, at 0208 GMT, takes the number of satellites sent up to 10 out of a planned total of 30.\n\"The day of Galileo's full operational capability is approaching,\" Jan Woerner, Director General of ESA, said in a statement on Friday. \"It will be a great day for Europe.\"\nThe Galileo project suffered a setback last year after two satellites were set in an incorrect orbit. They were later nudged into a more viable position.\nThe satellites were sent up Friday on board a Russian Soyuz launcher and reached their target orbit almost four hours after lift-off.\nESA plans to launch two further Galileo satellites this year.\nFrom next year, Galileo satellites will take off on board a European Ariane rocket launcher that can send up four, rather than two, satellites with a single launch.
