The Chinese information-telecommunications giant has spent more than 10 percent of revenue on R&D and ramped up its global market share with low and mid-end smartphones. Now it is challenging bigger rivals with new premium products.\nOn September 3, 2015, Huawei unveiled its new strategic smartphone named MateS in Berlin, Germany, along with a high-end premium smartwatch whose price hits €699 ($777). The company showed off its technology might by applying the same display as Samsung Electronics and adopted a function for Apple’s iPhone 6S earlier than others, local media reported in Europe.\nRichard Yu, head of Huawei’s consumer business division, told reporters in a press conference held in the city that the MateS features a full HD display with a full metal body design. “Our smartphone is now comparable with any other premium products,” Yu stressed.\nHuawei seems to be benchmarking with Samsung Electronics in its marketing strategy. The Chinese company is trying to create a high-end brand image with premium gadgets after raising its brand awareness in the market.\nThe company also plans to develop an edge-type smartphone like Samsung’s. Samsung Display is reportedly in talks to provide Huawei with flexible displays used in the Galaxy S6 Edge. The key to its global rise lies in robust investment in R&D. The company has splurged 190 billion yuan on its R&D in the decade.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T13:35:50.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
