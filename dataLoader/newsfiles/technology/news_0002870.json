It said it was cutting up to 260 jobs, or about 39 per cent of the total work force.\n“It is certain that a leaner and more agile Rovio is absolutely necessary to move forward,” CEO Pekka Rantala said.\nThe company said the planned reductions would apply to the whole organization, excluding those working on the movie in the United States and Canada, and most of the cuts will hit its operations in Finland. Rovio cut 110 jobs in 2014.\nThe announcement follows similar steps from other gaming companies such as Farmville creator Zynga Inc., which in May said it was looking to eliminate 364 jobs.\nAnalyst Steve Bailey from IHS Technology said Rovio’s downfall showed how quickly things can turn sour in the fast-paced gaming industry.\n“It acknowledges their [Rovio’s] failures … It is a gloomy near future for the company, but restructuring makes them more agile and could provide new success stories.”\nIn July, Rovio launched Angry Birds 2, which has been downloaded almost 50 million times. But Mr. Bailey said it takes a longer time to see how a new game can engage players and trigger in-game purchases.\nLast year, Rovio’s total revenue fell 9 per cent to €158-million ($239-million), while operating profit plummeted 73 per cent to €10-million.\n Angry Birds’ new chief bets on Hollywood to boost flagging sales\nMcGill graduate searches for magic formula of mobile gaming industry\nCanadian game developers strut their stuff at E3\nTopics: Technology United States of America Singapore Finland China Canada Comments A A", "external_links": ["http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/2be/incoming/article10086017.ece/ALTERNATES/w140/Screen+Shot+2013-03-21+at+4.36.49+PM.png", "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/944/report-on-business/article4507667.ece/ALTERNATES/w140/angry-birds.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-26T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T06:08:16.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
