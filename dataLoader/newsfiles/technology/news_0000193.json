The Global Communications Network, a platform leveraging Vidyo’s software-based video conferencing technology, enables high school students to virtually enroll in Advanced Placement (AP), honors and credit recovery classes and connects teachers and administrators across the school system for real-time face-to-face meetings, trainings and office hours. The Global Communications Network is a part of CCS’ broader initiative, Quest for Student Success.\nWith Vidyo’s software-based HD video collaboration technology, CCS can leverage existing equipment and networks to collaborate at scale efficiently and cost effectively. More than 200 high school students in 15 Cumberland County high schools use Vidyo to enroll and participate in classes offered through the Global Communications Network.\n“One of our primary goals in implementing the distance learning model was to ensure students across the system had the equal opportunity to access the best curriculum available and to create a consistent learning experience at every school,” said Kevin Coleman, Executive Director of Technology, Cumberland County Schools. “The ability to scale without blowing the budget with Vidyo’s technology is key to our ability to expand deployment of the Global Communications Network to include middle schools, virtual visits from international faculty and other distance learning applications.”\nCCS faculty and administrators also utilize the Global Communications Network to connect with peers across the school system. Video conferencing technology is used for teacher training, consultations with education specialists and leadership meetings in which principals from Cumberland’s 85 schools can be seen at one time using a VidyoPanorama™ room system.\n“Vidyo’s technology is driving a shift within education systems which are recognizing the value of video collaboration through its ability to enhance curriculums and expand access to resources, benefitting both students and educators, ” said Eran Westman, CEO, Vidyo. “The Cumberland County School System is an exceptional model of how educators can leverage video conferencing technology to deploy virtual learning programs in the K-12 setting and Vidyo is thrilled to be a leading enabler of virtual learning capabilities to North Carolina.”", "external_links": ["http://www.vidyo.com/solutions/distance-learning/"], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T01:31:08.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
