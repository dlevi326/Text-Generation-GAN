Addressing this topic, Apcera today announced a presentation at the inaugural 2015 Software Circus titled, \"Trust on the Tightrope: Taking Containers to Production\", which will take place from 16:15-17:00pm on Friday, September 11 in Amsterdam. In this session, Dean Sheehan, Apcera director of customer solutions for EMEA, will discuss how policy, security architecture and new technologies effectively bridge this development-production gap, and deliver security and trust for multi-cloud environments. \n\"As enterprise developers increasingly consider containers for use in production environments, concern from ITOps about workload security from development to production also grows,\" said Sheehan. \"With containers promising faster, more agile app development, organizations must place security, policy and enforcement as a priority for their modern infrastructure so safety isn't compromised for the sake of agility.\" \nAt Software Circus, Apcera will also showcase its trusted cloud platform. The company will provide demonstrations of the Apcera platform, which ties security, policy and enforcement together so that ITOps has transparent visibility and control via a single fabric that overlays the complexity of containers all while giving developers the flexibility they need. \n\"For containers to move out of the experimental phase and into production environments a fundamental shift needs to occur -- one that promotes a balance between DevOps' demand for freedom and agility, and ITOps' need for safety and trust. There also needs to be assurance that their infrastructure is secure from potential vulnerabilities,\" said Apcera founder and CEO Derek Collison. \"To see the full value of containers in the enterprise, trust is of the highest importance and meeting all requirements around compliance and security is imperative.\" \nApcera's trusted cloud platform is unique in that it provides the best of both worlds for ITOps and developers alike, with a workflow that's policy-based, meeting enterprise requirements like compliance and security in Docker production environments without fail. Apcera takes a workload security approach that encompasses the ability to define and enforce security policies; control and secure workloads; orchestrate and scale workloads across hybrid clouds; and monitor specific Docker workload permissions while maintaining an audit trail. With policy and trust at the core, ITOps can confidently provide developers with permission to continuously innovate and use any modern, cloud-native tool they choose. \nAbout Apcera Apcera delivers seamless workload mobility and pervasive policy and governance, across any cloud, public or private.
