It is now seeking views from the local community to help shape its final proposal before submitting it to the Civil Aviation Authority for approval.\n\"We feel the noise and environmental benefits from this project are considerable and urge our local communities to look at the achievements and facts provided in the consultation materials and make their responses accordingly.\"\nâ€“ Keith Artus - Software Technologies Applications and Conference Centre (STACC) Luton Airport has also just started trialling the technology.
