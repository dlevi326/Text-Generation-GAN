The Company also renewed its commitment to energy management and conservation as it continues to explore new and improved ways of lessening its impact on the environment. \nEnergy Campaign Produces Results In 2009, JCPenney established a large-scale conservation strategy to reduce energy consumption. After five years of aggressive energy management by associates, various building upgrades across the chain, and watchful remote monitoring of HVAC and lighting systems, JCPenney reduced total Company energy usage by 19 percent - a cost avoidance of nearly $100M and a significant reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. \nAn achievement of this scale required strong associate participation, especially amid major renovations within hundreds of stores during the course of the campaign. It is estimated that nearly 46% of energy saved came from conservation and operational improvements. The energy-intensive construction associated with the modernization of millions of square feet of selling space in the Men's, Women's, Kid's and Home departments made electricity conservation particularly challenging. In fact, it is estimated that without the conservation efforts of JCPenney associates and strategic capital investment by the Company during the five-year campaign, base energy consumption would have increased nearly 2.0 percent. \n\"JCPenney has been environmentally-minded for decades, and the results of our long-term energy initiative demonstrate how seriously we take conservation,\" said Katheryn Burchett, senior vice president of corporate services and real estate. \"We owe a great deal of the success to our dedicated associates, who were mindful of their energy decisions over the course of the campaign.\" \nJCPenney plans to continue its legacy of conservation well into the future, and will unveil a new energy initiative in late 2015. \nGreener Stores and Buildings JCPenney continues a successful affiliation with the U.S. Department of Energy's ENERGY STAR program, having received ENERGY STAR's Partner of the Year, Sustained Excellence designation for the ninth consecutive year in 2015. Also, during 2014, JCPenney received ENERGY STAR certification at 100 additional locations. Today, the Company proudly displays the ENERGY STAR logo in 616 stores, one distribution center and the home office in Plano, Texas. \nConserving to Compete JCPenney has participated in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Building Competition for three years in a row. The competition pits more than 5,500 buildings from all 50 states and two U.S. territories against each other in a tournament for the highest energy savings within one calendar year. Three JCPenney stores were recognized for reducing energy consumption over 20 percent in 2014, including locations in Bishop, Calif.; Gretna, La.; and Sarasota, Fla. The Sarasota store achieved a reduction of 27.5%, which translates to an estimated energy cost savings of over $50,000. \nAbout JCPenney J. C.
