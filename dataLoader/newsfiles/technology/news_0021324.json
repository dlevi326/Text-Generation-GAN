Effissimo declined to provide immediate comment.\nEffissimo is closely watched in Japan because of its passing connection with Murakami, the country's most famous activist investor. News of its investments is often followed by a rise in the targeted firms' shares due to expectations for change.\nMurakami led the so-called Murakami fund until he was convicted of insider trading in 2007. He resurfaced this year, and last month was voted down by shareholders of Kuroda Electric Co over his proposal to change the board of directors.\nActivist investors are rare in Japan, where the government has lately urged companies to engage more with shareholders and improve corporate governance to attract foreign investors.\nEarlier this year, industrial robot maker Fanuc Corp said it would to return more cash to shareholders, following pressure from U.S. activist investor Daniel Loeb.\nEffissimo's other investments include care provider Nichii Gakkan Co and a majority stake in electronics retailer Yamada Denki Co Ltd. Effissimo is also the second-biggest shareholder of auto parts makers Nissan Shatai Co Ltd and Futaba Industrial Co Ltd.
