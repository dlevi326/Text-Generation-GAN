Deezer is seeking funds from investors in a transaction that could value the music service at about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), people familiar with the matter said last month.\nStarted in 2007, Deezer has 6 million paying subscribers, according to the company’s website . That compares with more than 20 million subscribers for Spotify, the Swedish rival that was said to be valued at $8.5 billion in its most recent financing round. Competition has intensified after Apple introduced its music-streaming offering in June. Deezer also competes with Pandora Media Inc.\n“The IPO will allow Deezer to consolidate our position as a leading global, independent audio streaming service and expand our offering to music lovers around the world,” Chief Executive Officer Hans-Holger Albrecht said in the statement. “The music streaming market is young and growing fast as it becomes the primary distribution channel for music.”\nFor years, Deezer has avoided head-to-head competition with Spotify by holding off in the U.S. and focusing instead on expanding in Europe and emerging markets like Africa. The company has teamed up with phone companies to sell its premium subscriptions coupled with mobile-phone packages and, when it did launch in the U.S. about a year ago, it partnered with speaker-maker Sonos Inc. and later with Bose Corp.", "external_links": ["http://www.deezer.com/company\\"], "published": "2015-09-22T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T08:52:33.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
