The airport is where government troops and civilians fled after the Taliban overran the city. The Afghan government has sent reinforcements to Kunduz, the capital of the province of the same name. A NATO spokesman said special forces from the military alliance were on the ground in Kunduz, advising their Afghan counterparts. Agence France-Presse reported the forces were from the U.S., Britain, and Germany.\nThe New York Times Quote: d Afghan government officials as saying U.S. special forces “headed out toward the city with Afghan commandos.” Their role there wasn’t clear, but the Times added: “[A]t least one American operation in the city of Kunduz failed. An Afghan security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that American forces had sought to resupply a group of beleaguered Afghan soldiers trapped in an ancient fortress north of the city.”", "external_links": ["http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/nato-forces-bolster-afghan-troops-battle-kunduz-150930054802878.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/world/asia/kunduz-afghanistan-taliban-fight.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=photo-spot-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news"], "published": "2015-09-30T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:17:27.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
