Now that production has started it is a clear signal to other potential customers around the world that Saab is ready to deliver to them as well.\" \nWith its multi-mission portal, the vessel will be able to launch and retrieve diverse mission payloads, such as manned and unmanned vehicles. \nPowered by conventional diesel-electric propulsion machinery, A26 will also feature the Kockums Stirlingair-independent propulsion (AIP) system, which allows the submarine to be stealthy and difficult to detect. \"Now that production has started it is a clear signal to other potential customers around the world that Saab is ready to deliver.\" \nIn June, Saab signed contracts worth Skr7.6bn ($919.01m) with the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration to deliver two new Type A26 submarines. \nThe delivery of the new submarines is expected to commence in 2022 and will be completed in 2024. \nIn addition, Saab secured a contract to perform a mid-life upgrade on two of Sweden's existing Gotland-class submarines, including an overhaul and upgrade of the combat system to a total order value of Skr2.1bn ($252.23m). \nThe delivery of the upgraded submarines is scheduled for in late 2018 and late 2019, respectively. \nImage: The A26 steel-cutting ceremony held at Saab Kockums shipyard in Karlskrona, Sweden.
