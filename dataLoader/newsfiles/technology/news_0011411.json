On the contrary, it says the economic value of the operational support provided by India's IT firms to over 90% of Fortune 500 firms and thousands of other American businesses \"make them more innovative, competitive, primed for new market opportunities, and ea ger to expand jobs.\" \"Leveraging Indian talent, American firms have been able to bring cost-competitive solutions that have helped improve their global market share and bring products with shorter production cycles,\" Sitharaman said, adding that the report \"focuses on that part of the India-US bilateral equation, illuminating many of the benefits that Indian IT organizations bring to the US in period covered by the study.\" \n\nAccording to the report, two-way trade between US and India topped $580 billion over the last seven years, including $103 billion in 2014. In the same timeframe, India's foreign direct investment in the US has doubled, touching $7.1 billion. US FDI in India during this period was $24.1 billion. While the numbers are chump change compared to US-China trade, the report emphasized that the Indian tech industry through their US operations supports 156,000 direct jobs and 255,000 indirect jobs. \n\n\"The two-way flow of investments and intellectual talent is central to the growing commercial and strategic relationships between India and the US,\" said Nasscom President R Chandrashekhar, noting that the organization has been advocating more open markets for US companies in India, as well as for US policies that permit temporary high-skilled workers from India to support their hundreds of American customers. \n\nIn fact, the report threw up a little known aspect of India's high-skilled workers underwriting the healthcare costs of first responders to the 911 disaster. Under a little known US law passed in 2010, the H-1B and L-1 Visa fee per application of $2,000 and $2,250 respectively, amounting to $70 million annually , is applied to provide healthcare and financial compensation to the first responders. In other words, the Indian IT industry has paid more than $350 million to take care of 911 first responders including firefighters. \n\nThe Nasscom report also challenged the perception of Indian IT industry paying cutrate slave wages to workers, a charge that was renewed in a new survey that rated Indian IT companies one of the worst paymasters in the world (at least in India). The report asserted that in the US, while American nationals were paid an average $81,447 per year, US visa holders (guest workers) were paid $81,022, while incurring an addition cost of $15,000 towards visa processing and other expenses. \n\nThe report also asserted that while overall unemployment in the US was 6.2%, it was only 2.7% in tech sector, belying the impression that foreign guest workers were adding to the US unemployment situation. \"The two-way flow of investments and intellectual talent is central to the growing commercial and strategic relationships between India and the US. It's not about one nation taking unfair advantage of the other; it is about moving forward together to improve the economies, opportunities, and quality of life for citizens of both nations,\" the report said.
