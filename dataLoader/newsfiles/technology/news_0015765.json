Joshua Rosenkranz argued Wednesday before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City.\nHe asked the panel to overturn a lower court judge ruling that the Redmond, Washington-based company must turn over a customer's email account that it stores in Dublin for a narcotics probe.\nCircuit Judge Gerard Lynch seemed unfazed by Rosenkranz's predictions of \"global chaos\" if the United States' actions caused other countries to seek information stored in the U.S.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Justin Anderson says the U.S. properly followed the law.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
