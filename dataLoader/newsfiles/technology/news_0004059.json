She negates all the evidence, both anecdotal and from numerous formal studies, and supposes that she is the star employee.\nWell, three years ago, I quit the fags. I know there's nothing worse than an ex-smoker, but I feel it does qualify me to comment, having been in both camps.\nFirstly, and I do not care what anybody says, smoking is bad for your health. When you're in your 20s, your body deals with the toxins fairly happily, and life goes on. As you get older, it may take you longer to recover from a respiratory tract infection, or to get going in the mornings. By the 50s and 60s, there is no doubt that smoking will have caused you certain condition(s) that are potentially life-threatening. And of course, premature death for lifelong smokers is well documented.\nIt follows that your smoking is going to have an adverse effect on your attendance at work, and your general state of being whilst at work, especially as you age.\nSecondly, there are certain measurables that cannot be doubted. Assume you work an eight-hour day, and take a ciggie every hour or so. 08h00 to 16h30, with a half-hour for lunch. For seven of those hours, you will need at least ten minutes per hour to leave the building, light up, choof away, and return to your desk. If your boss is a clock watcher, s/he will soon work out that you're short-changing the company by more than one hour per day. At my previous job, I was on one of the topmost floors, and it was closer to 15 minutes per break.\nGranted, this is a modern era we live in, where we should not be measured by time spent at work, but by what we deliver. Likewise, some will argue that we should all be taking ten minutes every hour, to give the ol' brain a rest.\nBe that as it may, the third issue as it relates to smoking, is the work environment. As a smoker, I had no concept of how badly my clothing and hair stank. I was a compulsive gum chewer, but that did zilch for the rest of me smelling like an ashtray. And I wager that as a smoker, Lynnette, you pong.\nAs a customer or colleague, I do not want to spend any longer than is absolutely necessary, in your space. Because you are malodorous, and because you hoik up a lung-oyster every few minutes. It may not be noticeable to you, but you have a detrimental effect on the office.\nMy advice is two-fold... (1) You are a grown up, if you choose to smoke, so be it. But please don't rant and rave with indignation that your smoking has no impact on your worklife - every study confirms that it does.\n(2) Quit. When you want to, for yourself. Cigarettes are evil, they control your existence, they keep you hooked, they even dictate what you leave the house with. But the day YOU decide to kick them into touch, it will be the easiest thing ever to quit. If you try purely to satisfy somebody else, you will never be successful. What I can guarantee is that it'll be hard. But you will succeed. And when you go from a 25-a-day, R1400-a-month, smelly habit, to running your first half-marathon, and you love your life and your body, what you will experience will be joy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:15:24.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
