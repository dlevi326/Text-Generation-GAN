With a wide range temperature, it has anti-vibration, anti-shock, anti-collision, and anti-corrosion resistance. Its lightweight and compact size allows for flexible mounting. All of the I/O connectors and cables are fully IP65 rated. This next-generation system offering dramatically enhanced processing capability, multiple advanced I/O features in a smaller highly rugged form factor will meet all the expectations.\nWith its fully IP65 rated heavy-duty steel enclosure, FES 9120 provides for complete water proofing and durability yet maintaining its lightweight capability. The fanless feature also contribute to resourcefully dispersing heat while protecting internal components from environmental damage ranging from dust and airborne debris to extreme temperatures, moisture, and vibration. The ability to operate in a wide range temperature from -13°F to 158°F and a storage temperature of -40°F to 185°F adds a complimentary touch to the environmental features. On with the environmental tolerance, it is anti-vibration at 5Hz~500Hz/ 5Grms/ 3 Axis, anti-shock at 50G, 11ms duration, anti-collision with 4-corner bumper protection, and the anti-corrosion is of anodized and deactivated surface coating. These features meet the severe environment operational demands in many industries and are reliable in the multitude of conditions. Weighing at a mere 2.43 pounds with a dimension of 7.81 inch in length, 5.26 inch in width, and 1.59 inch in height, its compact size can be easily wall-mounted or DIN-rail mounted (added option) on locations where space is critical.\nThis full-IP65 embedded computer’s CPU is Intel Atom Dual Core E3826 (1.46GHz), delivering outstanding compute, graphical and media performance while operating in an extended range of thermal conditions and consuming low amount of power. To fulfill immense storage capability, the chipset is of Intel SoC integrated with HD graphics, memory of DDR3L 1066MHz GDB (up to 8GB), and adds a full size mSATA 64 GB SSD. It has one power LED and one HDD LED system indicator. The Ethernet is a Dual Intel I210 GbE controller, BIOS of AMI 16Mbit Flash, and runs on 9~36V DC power input with external power adapter.\nThe front side I/O locates a power button and a reset button. On the back side I/O locates line out audio, RS232, two USB 2.0, VGA output, power input, and RJ45 GbE LAN. As for the cables, it has one for USB, LAN, RS232, VGA, and power. All of the I/O ports and connectors are full IP65 equipped and of M12 standard. The M12 standard is to ensure proper connection to industrial components and to protect the interconnection from foreign particulates, dust, water, and hazardous substances.\nFES9120 : Acnodes Full-IP65 Embedded Computer with Atom Dual Core E3826 1.46GHz Dual Core CPU, fanless industrial design, configurations with up to 8GB DDR3 memory, 64GB mSATA SSD, 1 x Ethernet, 1 x Serial, 2 x USB, VGA video output, 9-36V DC power input.\nA full listing of Fanless Embedded Computers from Acnodes:\n•Fanless Embedded PC– Embedded computer with low power consumption processor within a rugged compact enclosure\n•Mini NUC Embedded PC – Embedded computer utilizes a compact rugged NUC form factor enclosure with high performance processor\n•Embedded PC with Expansion Slots – Embedded computer with PCI/PCIe high-speed expansion slots in a compact enclosure\n•Wide Working Temperature Embedded PC – Embedded computer with aluminum heat sink and heavy duty steel frame allow unit work under a wide range working temperature in a harsh working environment.\nTheir product line’s configurations are located on www.acnodes.com.
