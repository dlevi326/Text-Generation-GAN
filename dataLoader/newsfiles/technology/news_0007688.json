Attendees will receive a special offer to join the Denodo Community and download Denodo Express , the industries only no-cost data virtualization solution for Developers and Data Architects, onsite at booth #209. \nDenodo will also be showcasing the Denodo Platform , the premier data virtualization platform available today. Its advanced capabilities support the integration of any data, in any format or technology, located anywhere - inside the organization or external, in the Cloud or on the Web. The Denodo Platform scales easily from the simplest of departmental projects to the largest and most demanding enterprise wide deployments, whether hosted in a single data center or geographically distributed across the world. It provides advanced performance optimization strategies that ensures organizations can access data when and where it is needed to support today’s complex business intelligence and Big Data analytics needs. \nWhy: Data virtualization is synonymous with information agility - it delivers a simplified, unified, and integrated view of trusted business data in real-time or near real-time as needed by the consuming applications, processes, analytics, or business users. Data virtualization integrates data from disparate sources, locations and formats, without replicating the data, to create a single \"virtual\" data layer that delivers unified data services to support multiple applications and users. The result is faster access to all data, less replication and cost, more agility to change. \nData virtualization performs many of the same transformation and quality functions as traditional data integration such as Extract-Transform-Load (ETL), data replication, data federation, Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), etc. However, it leverages modern technology to deliver real-time data integration at a much lower cost, with more speed and agility. It can replace traditional data integration and reduce the need for replicated data marts and data warehouses in many cases, but not entirely. \nWho and When: Chuck DeVries, Vice President of Architecture and Development at VHA, Inc. will present a Case Study titled \"Role of Data Virtualization in Modern Data Architecture to Spur Business Agility\" on September 22 nd , 2015 from 12:55 pm - 1:25 pm.In this session, Mr. DeVries will discuss the practical application of data virtualization in a real-world business environment and share how data virtualization is providing business-critical capabilities while saving time and money. He will also share details of VHA’s specific use case and how data virtualization is fitting in with their modern data architecture as part of an overall data strategy. \nWhere: Manchester Grand Hyatt San DiegoOne Market PlaceSan Diego, CA 92101 \nAbout Denodo Denodo is the leader in data virtualization – providing unmatched performance, unified access to the broadest range of enterprise, big data, cloud and unstructured sources, and the most agile data services provisioning and governance – at less than half the cost of traditional data integration.
