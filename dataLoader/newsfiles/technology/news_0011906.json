It added that the latest dip in oil prices has driven an annual drop in consumer prices in August and September, which indicates an anticipated stabilisation of prices after a long period of mild disinflation will take longer than previously expected.\nThe country's consumer price index is likely to increase slightly on the year by December, but it should average a 0.5 per cent decrease for the whole of 2015, the central bank said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:06:34.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
