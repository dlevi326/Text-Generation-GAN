We wanted to find a way to assess brain damage that could predict the development of dementia associated with vascular diseases,\" said Daniela Carnevale, the study's senior author, from Sapienza University of Rome, based in Neuromed Institute.\nWhile there has been a lot of research on hypertension-related brain changes in the grey matter, Carnevale proposed that a look into the brain's white matter could tell if high blood pressure was having an effect even earlier than what is known.\nResearchers used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), an enhancement of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to evaluate and compare the structural and functional properties of the main connections between different brain regions.\nFifteen participants were on medication for moderate to severe high blood pressure and 15 participants had normal blood pressure. Participants were also given a cognitive assessment.\nThe brain imaging found that, while none of the participants showed abnormalities on a standard MRI, the more advanced DTI showed that participants with high blood pressure had damage to: brain fibres that affect non-verbal functions; nerve fibres that affect executive functioning and emotional regulation; and limbic system fibres, which are involved in attention tasks.\nIn addition, imaging and laboratory tests indicated damage to the heart and kidneys from high blood pressure.\nResearchers also found those with high blood pressure performed significantly worse on two different assessments of cognitive function and memory.\nHowever, there were no differences in tests evaluating verbal function or ability to perform daily activities.\n\"DTI provides a way to evaluate pre-symptomatic brain damage in people with high blood pressure in order to identify possible therapies to help control brain damage and reduce the eventual development of dementia,\" Carnevale said.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T06:24:54.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
