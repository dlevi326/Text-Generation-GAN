At the same time, it could become a deep-pocketed new buyer of content from Hollywood studios. \nThe source cautioned that it is \"very early days.\" \nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment on the Variety report, which also came with a number of caveats. \"The scale of Apple's ambitions vary depending on whom is asked,\" Variety said. \nApple could just be looking to expand what it's already doing with Apple Music, perhaps by financing music documentaries or concert films. \nBut the Hollywood meetings come at a time of intense competition for audience attention and subscription dollars. \nOther companies' TV shows and movies already light up iPhone and iPad screens all around the world and make the Apple TV box worth buying. \nApple is expected to introduce a new version of Apple TV at a press event on September 9. \nLooking further into the future, the company is interested in selling a cable-like bundle of TV channels via the Internet, but it has run into resistance from some major network owners. \nAnd there are persistent rumors that the company could make its own big-screen TV someday. \nHowever Apple may expand, having TV shows with the Apple stamp -- shows that aren't available anywhere else -- would distinguish the service. \n\"Every service starts on catalog and moves to originals to compete and differentiate,\" Media ReDEFined publisher Jason Hirschorn told CNNMoney. \"Apple is no exception.\" \nHirschorn formerly held senior positions at MySpace, MTV and Sling Media. He floated the idea that an A-list star like Jon Stewart, recently departed from \"The Daily Show,\" could cut an exclusive deal with Apple. \nApple already operates its iTunes Store, which lets users buy movies, individual TV episodes and season passes. If the company doesn't move forward with a full-fledged streaming service, it could seek to add more exclusive content to that store. \nBut it was easy to find skepticism about the Apple talks on Monday night along with serious prognostications and wishful thinking. \n\"You guys,\" media industry consultant Rex Sorgatz tweeted, \"Apple will make a car, a spaceship, and a social network before it makes a TV show.\" \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
