Taco Bell customers in Chicago and San Francisco soon will be able to find out. \nThe chain says it will open a location that serves wine, beer, sangria and frozen mixed drinks in Chicago next week, marking the first time it will serve alcohol in the United States. The new restaurant also will feature trends Taco Bell says it is seeing among millennials: “tapas-style” appetizers, a mural by a local artist and an open kitchen. \n“You will literally be able to see the food” before it’s prepared, said Meredith Sandland, Taco Bell’s chief development officer. “[Customers will be] able to see all the beautiful ingredients.” \nA similar location will open in San Francisco later this month, according to Taco Bell, which is owned by Yum Brands Inc. Aside from the alcohol and appetizers, Taco Bell says the menu will be the same as regular locations. \nTaco Bell isn’t alone in trying alcohol. To try to boost sales later in the day, Starbucks also has been rolling out wine, beer and small dishes at select U.S. locations. Chipotle also serves margaritas and beer, depending on the location.
