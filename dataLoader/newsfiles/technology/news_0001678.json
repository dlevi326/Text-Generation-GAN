(NYSE MKT: GIG ), leading supplier of advanced high speed semiconductor components for use in long-haul, metro, Cloud connectivity, data centers, consumer electronics links and interactive applications, through optical and wireless communications networks, today announced it will showcase a live demo utilizing its 3 rd generation 100Gbps Short Reach Chipset with its new 28Gbps Quad CMOS CDR and II-VI Incorporated’s Vertical-Cavity Surface Emitting Laser solutions (VCSELs). The HXC42400 Quad CMOS CDR is a new addition to the GigOptix Datacom portfolio as a result of the recent Terasquare acquisition, and complements the previously released HXT8204 28Gbps quad channel vertical-cavity-surface-emitting-laser (VCSEL) driver array and HXR8204 28Gbps trans-impedance (TIA) receiver array to provide a complete “one stop shop” chip-set solution offering to enable next generation SR4 (100m) and extended reach SR4 (eSR4 – 300m) module and Active Optical Cable (AOC) applications. \nGigOptix’s new quad channel, HXC42400 25Gbps – 28Gbps CMOS CDR, with its unique architecture enables industry leading low power dissipation and the industry’s first solution with programmable receiver and transmitter bandwidth in a single device to optimize Input Jitter Tolerance (IJT) and Output Jitter for superior link performance. To maintain and optimize Signal Integrity (SI) under adverse Insertion Loss (IL) situations, the HXC42400 includes up to 16dB of programmable Continuous Time Linear Equalization (CTLE) and a 1-Tap Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE) with a 3-Tap programmable De-Emphasis block provides up to 12dB gain for the pre and post taps. It features reference-less operation and many on-chip testability features including Eye-Monitor (iMON TM ), PRBS generator/checker, an arbitrary pattern generator, and a unique Jitter Tolerance (JTOL) test capability. \nThe HXT8204 four channel VCSEL driver supports modulation and average VCSEL currents up to 10mA with a dedicated BURNIN capability up to 15mA average current. The 1MHz I 2 C interface enables full control of all driver functions including input equalization, output peaking and peaking duration, Signal Detect and Squelch, channel polarity inversion, diagnostics such as average current and temperature monitoring as wells as user maskable Interrupts and VCSEL voltage supervisory functions. \nThe HXR8204 four channel receiver with integrated TIA provides 60uA PP input sensitivity at 28Gbps with 10-12 Bit Error Rate (BER), AGC and ATC, and a limiting post amplifier stage. Linear, per channel RSSI outputs are provided to enable active alignment during manufacturing to provide optimum performance and manufacturability. The 1MHz I 2 C interface enables full control of additional functionality such as Signal Detect and Squelch, pre-emphasis, maskable interrupt generation, internal temperature monitor selection, channel polarity inversion, and output voltage swing with enable. \n“GigOptix is very appreciative of our long standing relationship with II-VI and pleased to introduce our latest product offering while showcasing and expanding the interoperability of our two companies’ solutions,” said Tom Kapucija, GigOptix’s Datacom Marketing Director. “Our complete solution now offers leading optical link reach with robust performance and unique on-chip testability features.” \n“As a chip vendor open to the Datacom market, II-VI Laser Enterprise appreciates the flexibility and completeness of the GigOptix offer on the ICs market. We’re now looking forward to reinforcing and consolidating our cooperation, leveraging the success of our new 25Gb/s 850nm VCSEL and new GigOptix 25-28Gb/s driver/TIA chipset,” said Michele Agresti, II-VI Laser Enterprise, Datacom VCSELs Product Line Manager. \nThe HXC42400, HXT8204, and HXR8204 are ideal for optical module, active optical cable, and optical engine applications with their partitioning of the CDR power dissipation from the temperature sensitive, high performance VCSEL, VCSEL driver, Photo Detector, and TIA circuit elements for 100m and extended reach applications. The solution is applicable to 100G Ethernet (QSFP28, CFP2, CFP4), OUT-4, 32Gbps Fibre Channel, and EDR Infiniband. \nThe HXC42400, HXT8204, and HXR8204 will be shown operating with the II-VI VCSELs as part of a live, show floor demo at ECOC2015, Booth #702, September 28 - 30, in Valencia, Spain.
