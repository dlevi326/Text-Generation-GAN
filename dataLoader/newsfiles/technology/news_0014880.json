Because the number of shares tendered at or below the $66.50 purchase price (or by shareholders electing to tender at the ultimate purchase price determined under the tender offer terms) exceeded the amount that Motorola Solutions offered to purchase, the resulting proration factor, after giving effect to the priority for \"odd lots,\" was approximately 95 percent.

Under applicable securities laws, however, Motorola Solutions may not repurchase any shares until Sept. 21, 2015. Whether Motorola Solutions makes additional repurchases in the future will depend on many factors, including but not limited to its business and financial performance, the business and market conditions at the time, including the price of the shares, and other factors Motorola Solutions considers relevant. \nGoldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan are the dealer managers for the tender offer and Alliance Advisors LLC is the information agent. The depositary is Wells Fargo ( News - Alert ) Bank, N.A.
