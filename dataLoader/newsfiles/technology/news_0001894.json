These results were published in Nature after researchers performed autopsies on eight patients who died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).\nThere is no proven treatment for CJD, a rare but fatal neurodegenerative condition, but the eight patients, ranging in ages from 36 to 51, received growth hormones extracted from the pituitary glands of human cadavers. During the autopsy, the researchers found something troubling - six of the eight had early indications of Alzheimers. Before presenting their results, researchers looked for evidence indicating another explanation for the symptoms. They determined that the patients didn't carry genes that would predispose them to Alzhermer's.\nResearchers say this is troubling, because, while there isn't any indication that it can be transmitted through normal contact with patients, it could be passed on through contact with human growth hormones, such as blood transfusions or contaminated surgical instruments - much like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\nScientists are preparing to try to replicate the results independently to verify this find.", "external_links": ["http://www.nature.com/news/autopsies-reveal-signs-of-alzheimer-s-in-growth-hormone-patients-1.18331?"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:11:50.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
