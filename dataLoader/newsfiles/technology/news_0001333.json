Ray Meiring, CEO of Qorus, explains: “We’re big believers that technology should be simple and intuitive. It’s why our software is based on familiar Microsoft Office tools like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and SharePoint. We also know that superb training and support are vital to a successful implementation. But if Netflix and Amazon have taught us anything, it’s that people like to access content on-demand, and in their own time. “A rigid schedule of live training modules may work well for some of our clients, but it won’t suit all of them. We wanted to cover all bases and give our new clients the ability to choose exactly how they want their users to consume the training.”\nClients who select this training option will receive access to their own online training hub, where users can work through role-specific training modules by watching videos, and completing tutorials and worksheets in their own time. These hubs can be custom-branded and can be set up to contain company-specific examples to make the training even more relevant and engaging.\nFor more about Qorus, visit: http://www.qorusdocs.com\nAbout Qorus Software\nQorus Software is a leading global provider of document, pitch, proposal and RFP management solutions for organizations looking to simplify the way they do business.\nIn a world that is increasingly complex, and with clients who continue to demand more for less, we believe that software should be intuitive and easy to use.
