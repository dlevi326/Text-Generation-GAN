It seems I have not taken enough lessons though.\nWhat kind of lesson can prepare you for controversy over the discovery of a millions of years old fossil? Up to now I still do not understand whether Vavi's twitter rant was about religion or about race.\nWhat was Vavi trying to say? That he did not evolve but was created in a week? Well, the opinion that the world was created in six days is held only by about 32% of its inhabitants. It is not substantiated by fact, yet the fossil record supporting the evolution theory is there for anyone who cares to study.\nIs Vavi of the opinion that only blacks could have descended from homo naledi? If so, I am eagerly waiting the publication of his academic paper on the subject. I am sure the rest of the academic world would love to know how he came to that conclusion.\nFor someone in his position, I have always assumed Vavi is a very informed person. I am surprised he is trying to topple the teacup with a gale over evolution.\nThe one lesson that I have learnt, in a very hard way, is that we should never assume the most talkative politicians know exactly what they are doing.\nLook I come from a country where an entire cabinet sat and considered the possibility of meeting the nation's fuel needs with pure diesel (not crude) supposedly flowing freely out of a rocky outcrop.\nSo I would not be surprised if someone is imagining their grandmother could have seen the living being that left behind a millions years old fossil.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T12:07:16.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
