BMW said immediately after the incident that Krueger had been traveling a lot recently and had not been feeling well before the presentation.\nKrueger told Bild newspaper Wednesday that his doctor had told him he’d just had a short fainting spell.\n“I’m doing well again,” he told the newspaper.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
