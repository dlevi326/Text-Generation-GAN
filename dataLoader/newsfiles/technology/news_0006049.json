Credit: NASA/NOAA GOES Project \nPost-Tropical Cyclone Niala faded under a hostile atmospheric environment and an infrared satellite image shows the torn-apart storm's remnants southwest of Hawaii. \nNOAA's Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) issued the final bulletin on Niala at 0300 UTC (11 a.m. EDT on Sept. 28). At that time the center was about 405 miles south of Honolulu, Hawaii and moving to the west-northwest. Niala ceased to qualify as a tropical cyclone. \nNOAA's GOES-West satellite provided an infrared image of the remnant clouds associated with what was once Tropical Cyclone Niala. In the image, the remnants appear as shapeless clouds covering a large area southwest of Hawaii, although an area of thunderstorms persisted around post-tropical/remnant low. The image was taken on September 29, 2015 at 1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT/2 a.m. HST). \nCPHC said that hostile shear environment is expected to prevent re-development in this area for the next few days.

NASA sees wind shear affecting Tropical Storm Jimena September 8, 2015 \nStrong vertical wind shear has been affecting Tropical Storm Jimena in the Central Pacific and pushing the clouds and storms west of the center, as seen in infrared imagery from NASA's Aqua satellite. Satellite spots Jimena's remnants north of Hawaiian Islands September 10, 2015 \nNOAA's GOES-East satellite captured an infrared image of the remnants of what was Tropical Storm Jimena as it continued moving past the northern Hawaiian Islands on September 10. Satellite sees Tropical Storm Malia moving away from Hawaiian Islands September 22, 2015 \nTropical Storm Malia is on a northwesterly track and continued to move away from the Hawaiian Islands on Sept. 22 as NOAA's GOES-West satellite captured an image of the storm. NASA sees wind shear affecting Tropical Storm Niala September 25, 2015 \nNASA's Aqua satellite saw wind shear was affecting newborn Tropical Storm Niala as it continued moving through the Central Atlantic Ocean. RapidScat spots Tropical Storm Niala's waning winds September 28, 2015 \nThe RapidScat instrument saw the strongest winds in the Central Pacific Ocean's Tropical Storm Niala were on the northwestern side, facing the Big Island of Hawaii while the rest of the storm was below tropical-storm strength.
