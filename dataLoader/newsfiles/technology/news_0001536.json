Earlier talks to sell the rights to SL Green were unsuccessful, it said.\nDe Blasio's office and the city's law department had no immediate comment.\nJonathan Rosen, an outside spokesman for SL Green, in a statement said One Vanderbilt has received \"broad\" support because of the project's \"commitment\" to adding office space and improving the commute.\n\"We are already hard at work delivering on those commitments and won't be sidetracked by frivolous litigation,\" he said.\nRezoning the Grand Central area for taller skyscrapers was proposed under the administration of de Blasio's predecessor Michael Bloomberg, an independent. De Blasio is a Democrat.\nGrand Central was the subject of a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the city's landmark preservation law, which permitted the terminal's owner at the time to generate a \"reasonable return\" on its investment.\nPenson's companies said that decision still allowed air rights to be sold to owners of nearby properties.\nThe case is Midtown TDR Ventures LLC et al v. City of New York et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-07647.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Bernard Orr )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T20:52:41.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
