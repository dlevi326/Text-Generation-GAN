An Android version of the product will be available via open-Beta in the coming months. The company has developed a streamlined mobile application that allows users to create, preserve and share personal stories in one place. Accessible from anywhere, everyStory lets users store audio and image files to a private cloud-based system with the option of sharing photos and stories between other everyStory individuals and groups.\n“I created everyStory after being diagnosed with colon cancer and realizing my son may never remember my voice or hear my stories. I am passionate about providing people with an innovative way to preserve and share memories forever in the most interactive way possible,” said Dave Keene, CTO and founder of everyStory. “Now having the app compatible and available for download on all iOS devices, the art of storytelling and preserving memories has never been easier. Users can start creating stories and sharing memories with their loved ones straight from the palm of their hand. We hope to elevate the lost meaning of photos with our unique unlimited audio recording, tagging, sharing and activity tracker features,” said Ed Cox, CEO of everyStory.\nUsers can import photos from a computer, iOS photo album or scan physical photos directly into the app using a device camera. everyStory integrates a social network component by having an activity view functionality and by encouraging users to tag photos with people, and/or by location, subject or date. To create an interactive photo-album, everyStory lets multiple users record an audio message, on the same photos, in a shared album or within a group. Users can simply tap a tagged person’s name to hear the story that is connected to a specific photo or album.\nThe everyStory team has plans to launch a full Android version in the coming months as well as implement new sharing, photo and audio features to the existing functionality. The app is free for users and is currently offering space for 1,000 extra photos as a sign-up bonus through September 2015. Various membership options will be accessible for sign-up no later than early 2016 for users interested in receiving increased storage capabilities.\n###\nTo download and sign up for everyStory on an iOS device, please visit the App Store .
