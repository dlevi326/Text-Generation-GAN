The feature will be immediately available for 60% of Vodafone's customers, including Extra and Total subscribers, and will be ready across the entire network in November. \nThe feature is new for Vodafone's older customers, but it's familiar to those who subscribed to ONO before it was acquired by the British telco. The catch-up tool just needs to be activated by each customer and doesn't incur any extra costs. \nVodafone TV has many interactive functions, thanks to TiVo's set-top boxes, and also as a result of ONO's buy-out. A few days ago, it also announced the first Netflix-telco deal in Spain in Spain , securing the distribution of the US subscription video-on-demand service from October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T11:20:42.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
