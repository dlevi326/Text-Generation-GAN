Cityscape Global the premier real estate exhibition in the Middle East will host its 14th edition from September 8 to 10 at the Dubai World Trade Centre. Cityscape Global is often seen as a market gauge of the state of the Dubai property market. Set to be the largest it has been since six years the event this year boasts a 30 per cent larger exhibition space of more than 40000 square metres. The exhibition will host more than 300 exhibitors from 30 countries globally. In comparison the 2014 edition of the event welcomed 47000 visitors and spanned 31000sqm. The show is however still about 25 per cent smaller than it was during the market peak in 2008. \"We expect a very strong turnout of visitors from all over the world this year as they look to maximise their investment potential in this lucrative market\" Wouter Molman director of Cityscape Group organisers of Cityscape told Khaleej Times. While falling crude prices have caused regional governments to scale down on infrastructure spending and hit real estate demand it has not had a noticeable effect on Cityscape Global. Impact of oil prices \"Given the growth of the event and the increase in pre-registered visitors year to date we can't say the oil price has had an impact on the event this year. Many of our government (owned) clients have increased their stand spaces significantly this year and have already requested to reserve their spaces for 2016 with same or larger sizes. This is a testament to the confidence they have in the real estate market and in Cityscape Global as a platform to support the industry\" said Molman. While participants from the UAE have taken a lion's share of exhibition space at 65 per cent Turkey and the UK will represent the largest international pavilions this year. \"We have exhibitors from across all continents including Asia and Africa. Countries including Egypt Tunisia Morocco India China Hong Kong and Malaysia are represented by exhibitors including IQI Properties Pavilion Architects Taghazuot Bay Tabarak Holding and several others\" he informed. Exhibition spread across nine halls The growth of Cityscape Global this year is down to a combination of both larger stands and new exhibitors. \"We have made some significant improvements to the exhibition this year which has been reconfigured now taking place in nine exhibition halls. It facilitates a more convenient layout as two sections of exhibition halls will be located in parallel connected by a central concourse with several amenities such as F&B outlets meetings rooms VIP lounges etc. \"All exhibitors are now within a few minutes' walk from each other which will be a benefit to visitors as they navigate through the exhibition halls\" said Wouter Molman director of Cityscape Group. While Dubai's leading developers including Emaar Dubai Properties Nakheel Damac Meydan Deyaar Union Properties have returned Abu Dhabi will be represented by under 20 exhibitors this year including developers architects consultants banks and facilities management companies. Cityscape Abu Dhabi held in April each year welcomed over 130 exhibitors covering over 18000 square metres of exhibition space this year. Project launches During the heydays of the Dubai property market in 2008 Cityscape was a launchpad for several ambitious projects and also witnessed launch of direct sales by developers at the event itself. \"Several exhibitors are working hard behind the scenes to prepare for some announcements and launches to coincide with Cityscape Global this year. Property transactions are however not permitted at Cityscape Global. Investors and end-users can express interest in different projects at the show but any official documents or financial transfers have to be completed at the developers' or brokers' sales centres\" Molman clarified. For investors worried about the credentials of participating exhibitors rest assured. Any exhibitor planning to promote real estate projects at Cityscape Global requires a licence issued by the Dubai Land Department (DLD). \"We are applying for these licences on behalf of our exhibitors a process that includes collecting several details about the companies which are shared with DLD several weeks before the exhibition to ensure all of our exhibitors are bona fide companies\" Molman said. Meanwhile the Cityscape Global Conference which normally runs simultaneously with Cityscape Global has been moved ahead and will be held on September 7 at the Conrad Hotel Dubai. Convenience \"As it will take place a day before the exhibition visitors will no longer need to choose between spending their time on the exhibition floor or at the conference. Short targeted and free-to-attend (but by invitation only) conferences will ensure higher and quality attendance. We are already seeing the positive impact of this change as many hundreds of selected delegates have already confirmed their attendance\" said Molman. The morning session of the Conference will focus on the opportunities and challenges of affordable and middle income housing. During the afternoon the programme will split into two parallel sessions focusing on facilities management and real estate brokerages. -", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:09:27.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
