This has consequences for the brand, as well as the bottom line.\"\nMr Dickinson said collaboration between rivals in the sector on non-competitive issues within the supply chain would allow each to derive some kind of financial benefit.\n\"In the First World FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) market, companies in the US grocery business, for example, are connected in one network. They can streamline aspects in the supply chain. They have invested a lot of money and their forecasting accuracy is about 70% or more,\" said Mr Dickson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:30:52.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
