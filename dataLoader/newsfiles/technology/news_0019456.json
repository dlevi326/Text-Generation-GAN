In September 2014, they were warning that the short term overhang of certificates under the Renewable Energy Target meant that certificate prices were “too low” (so projects would not get built) and this would quickly drive prices “too high” (to penalty levels at $93 per MWh).\nWe called their bluff at that time ( http://bit.ly/1uhiKdW ) and certificates are now trading (“just right”) at prices consistent with the signals required to meet the target.\nThe truth was that – at that time – certificate prices were low (about $30) because the Australian energy cartel was still in the hunt to neuter the RET, in order to preserve their capacity to (1) extract greater revenue for energy created by fossil fuel in which they are heavily invested and (2) maintain their market power at the retail level.\nAfter years of bickering, we now have commitment to the (watered down) RET scheme across all Governments and all parties. Not everyone is happy, but a deal's a deal.\nNow the cartel is claiming that the RET won’t work because projects are not being built in spite of higher certificate prices (now close to $60) and that this is due to the uncertainty associated with the “oversupply” of existing fossil fuel plants. The cartel is hanging out for what they call an “orderly exit” of coal plants from this market – i.e. to be paid a bribe to stop polluting. They use the term “orderly exit” as if they are doing the charitable service of ushering a dozen elderly pensioners out of a burning cinema. In reality, it’s more like they lit the fire, and are demanding a fee to open the emergency exit doors. But that’s another story.\nSo should we be concerned that projects aren’t now popping up all over the place? And is this due to some concern about excess thermal generation?\nLet’s just keep things in perspective. Certificate prices have only rallied for a short period. As Meridian Energy Limited Group Chief Executive, Mark Binns, recently noted, “While the dust continues to settle on this new target, it's not surprising that everybody is holding back on making large investment decisions. However, it is clear that retailers will need to acquire a growing supply of renewable energy, and will therefore need to build or contract new projects to do so.”\nAnd let’s remember – as was pointed out by the cartel in 2014 – the market still has a significant overhang of certificates with which to meet short term obligations. Of course, projects are built for the long term, and over the long term they can expect appropriate levels of return as retailers need to acquire certificates in order to meet their obligations.\nAnyone who has an interest in renewable investment knows full well that the price of certificates can be volatile in the short term in response to political commentary, even though over the longer term price will be driven by underlying fundamentals.\nWhat is interesting about the current market for certificates under the RET (see below) is that prices are now less responsive to short term political comments than they were in 2014. This reflects the market’s clarity that the RET will be allowed to operate as intended (albeit to meet a smaller target).\nEven when recent language from Australia’s most senior Government representatives indicated a disdain for renewable energy investment (wind in particular), certificate prices have continued to rally. The RET is here to stay.\nHaving failed in their attempts to destroy the RET by driving down certificate prices, it appears that the new tactic is to create fear of prices being driven up (towards penalty levels) to reopen the debate around the level of the target.\nAs most of the obligations to purchase certificates are borne by cartel members, their claims that projects “will not be built” and that penalty prices are likely, carry some weight. However, it is clear that obtaining and surrendering certificates will be better for their shareholders and customers than retailers paying penalties in large volumes under the RET.\nClearly the market sees through this tactic also. Current prices reflect underlying fundamentals of projects being built and certificates being surrendered, not short term market failure triggered by penalty-level pricing.\nThis is not surprising because cartel members would have to step right outside of the boundaries of responsible corporate citizenship to thwart the agreed objectives of the RET. For companies involved in the provision of an essential service, acting in a way that so directly opposes the social objectives of this policy would surely compromise their social licence.\nThe market is keen and ready to build projects, once short term volatility settles and retailers work through the current overhang of certificates. As our Group CEO Mark Binns also noted recently, “Beyond our existing assets, Meridian continues to pursue further opportunities to invest in Australia’s energy future. Meridian seeks to play an active role in new market developments, while managing the regulatory environment that exists after the protracted RET debate and the Government's conspicuous lack of support for the lowest cost forms of renewable generation.”\nMeridian is not alone. As an active participant in this market, we also know that there are many other players keen to invest and develop renewable energy projects. Eventually the need of cartel members to meet their obligations will intersect with the flow of projects and investment in renewable energy.\nRetailers who do not have vested interests in legacy fossil fuel investments have proved that it is possible to develop projects to meet compliance obligations under the RET. Our Group Chief Executive Mark Binns recently noted “Prior to launching the Powershop retail business in Australia, Meridian invested in enough renewable generation capacity to more than cover our expected RET obligations out to 2020 and beyond. We're doing more than our bit under the law, and we fully expect that the big retailers will meet at least their minimum obligations. While the investment in new generation will reduce the value of the coal fired assets owned by big retailers, the community won't let them evade their duty to help Australia reduce its carbon emissions.”\nBen Burge is chief executive of Meridian Energy Australia and Powershop Australia .", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1uhiKdW"], "published": "2015-09-08T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:56:50.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
