And it was really hard to change professions. Well, we've raised $73 million in the last three years,\" said Leach, who was a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter. \"So it is possible if you have an idea and you're committed to it to go raise enough money to pursue your passion.\"\nIbotta hit the a sweet spot in mobile apps by figuring out how to get consumers to keep using the app. The secret? Pay them. Ibotta works with retailers, manufacturers and grocery stores to offer rebates on items purchased. Leach says that the company, which started in 2011, has had 12 million app downloads and paid out $40 million in rebates.\nAdvertisement Less than two years from its launch, the Ibotta app became the 16th most popular app according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, which asked consumers in 2013 what were their three most frequently used apps.\nIbotta's growth has forced the company to search for a larger office. It began working with Denver city officials last year and has found a \"heart of downtown\" location that is nearly three times larger than its existing LoDo office. Though he declined to divulge the location until the deal is final, Leach said Ibotta is on the verge of signing a seven-year lease for a 38,000-square-foot spot.\nDerek Woodbury, with the Denver Office of Economic Development, said the city approved Ibotta for a $50,000 loan to support relocation, plus an additional $350,000 small business loan. Such loans typically have an interest rate of 4 to 7 percent over a five- to seven-year term. Other tax credits will kick in after property are improvements made.\n\"It's exciting because it's a headquarters and it's remaining in Denver,\" Woodbury said. \"They are one of our signature startups.\"\nIbotta also worked with the state's economic development office. Last year, the state approved Ibotta for $3.3 million in credits after it hires 181 people.\nThe new $40 million investment, which includes existing investor Netscape founder Jim Clark , will be used to expand the entire operation, from the relocation and hiring of 200 to 300 people in three years to adding new subscribers. The company currently employs 105 people, with nearly 100 in Denver.\n\"We're very vocal about being the first huge consumer technology company to come out of Denver. There are a lot of success stories that are B2B, like Datalogix and Zayo. But there really hasn't been a household name on the consumer side that has come out of Denver in 15 years,\" he said. \"We want to be that app on every single person's front screen of their phone and we want people to know it's a Denver company that is doing this.\"\nLeach said he hoped to see attendees of the weeklong event return next year with similar announcements.\nTamara Chuang: tchuang@denverpost.com, 303-954-1209 or @gadgetress", "external_links": ["http://www.denverstartupweek.org/"], "published": "2015-09-28T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T06:17:00.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
