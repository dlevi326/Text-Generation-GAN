Among those in attendance, apart from Microsoft's Satya Nadella, included Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon co-founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos, Cisco's John Chambers, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf, among others. China's Jack Ma of Alibaba, Yang Yuanqing of Lenovo, Zhou Hongyi of Qihoo 360, Pony Ma of Tencent were also present at the event.\n\n\n\nHowever, several top tech executives were missing at the event, most notably Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nGoogle has had a contentious history in China and is currently banned in the country. This may be seen as one reason for the absence of the new Google chief, but a WSJ report citing an anonymous source says that he was not invited to the event.\n\nAccording to a report by The Information earlier this month, Google is trying to make an entry to China by readying a censored version of its Play Store, thus abiding by the government's requirements. However, if China indeed did not extend an invite to Pichai, it would suggest that Google has not made much headway in its talks with the world's fastest growing internet market.\n\nPichai's absence is compounded further by the presence of Zuckerberg, whose company Facebook is also banned in the country. Zuckerberg reportedly conversed with Xi in Mandarin only, which he speaks fluently.\n\nBut Pichai is not the only top tech executive who was missing from the meet, as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Uber chief Travis Kalanick were also not present. While Twitter is banned in China, whereas Chinese taxi app service provider Didi Kuaidi is investing heavily in ramping up the competition for Uber.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai: 7 things to know of 8 Google just announced some huge changes to its executive structure.\n\nLarry Page will run a completely new company called Alphabet, a collection of Google companies including Life Sciences, which manufactures glucose-sensing contact lenses, and Calico.\n\nFormer Chrome and Android head Sundar Pichai will be Google's CEO.Many are still unfamiliar with Google's new CEO. \n\nHere are some little-known facts about the man at the helm. Originally from Tamil Nadu, one of India's 29 states, Pichai studied at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, where he received a Bachelor of Technology. He then received a MS from Stanford and obtained an MBA from Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. At Wharton, Pichai was honored as a Siebel Scholar and a Palmer Scholar. Before his first job at Google, Pichai worked at Applied Materials as an engineer and then at McKinsey & Company in management consulting. In 2004, Pichai joined Google as its vice president of product management, where he led the team working on Google's Chrome browser and operating system.\n\nPichai quickly began to receive more responsibility, however, taking on involvement with various Google search products including Firefox, Google Toolbar, Desktop Search, Gadgets, and Google Gears and Gadgets.
