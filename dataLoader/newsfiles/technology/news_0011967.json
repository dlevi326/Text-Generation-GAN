It's been a nearly complete debacle, leading to the tarnishing of the Patriots' image, a humiliation in federal court for NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, and quite possibly the worst drawing of a human being in history by an unfortunate courtroom sketch artist. Only two groups of people have benefited from this: sports media , who got an endless string of farcical breaking news to drive traffic over the summer, and physicists, who got an unprecedented opportunity to hold forth on the Ideal Gas Law to a rapt audience .This whole weird business seems to be winding down, but not without a few last flurries of interest. One of these is a paper in the September issue of The Physics Teacher called Bouncing Back From \"Deflategate\" , which takes a slightly different angle on the core problem.Most of the coverage of \"Deflategate\" has focused on Patriots quarterback Tom Brady , and speculation that he arranged for the balls to be deflated so as to provide a better grip. The authors of the Physics Teacher paper, Gregory DiLisi and Richard Rarick look at the other end of the problem, where the ball is caught by the receiver, thinking about it in terms of energy, an issue with major implications for the existence of atomic matter.[caption id=\"attachment_45c7341e9e654a8cbb3eb81669377d3e\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski (87) catches a pass over Pittsburgh Steelers safety Robert Golden (21) in the first half of an NFL football game, Thursday, Sept. 10, 2015, in Foxborough, Mass. (AP Photo/Winslow Townson)[/caption]DiLisi and Rarick point out that a softer ball is easier to catch, and perform some simple experiments using video analysis of bouncing footballs to confirm that a smallish change in inflation pressure can make a significant difference in the way a ball bounces. This makes the ball a little more forgiving to a receiver trying to bring a pass in-- a ball hitting a pad or a too-stiff hand won't bounce up as far, giving the receiver a better chance to make the catch.The deep fundamental issue here is a well-known problem in collision physics, namely that it's impossible for two objects to collide and stick together and still conserve both kinetic energy and momentum. The momentum of each of a pair of colliding objects depends on their individual velocities, but their kinetic energy goes like the square of their speed, so a small change in velocity leads to a big change in energy. With only two colliding objects, there's no way for the sum of the velocities and the sum of the squares of the velocities to both remain unchanged. This is why you never see two billiard balls or two fully inflated basketballs collide and stick together.This might seem an insurmountable problem, but there's an easy way out. When you work out the speed of two objects that stick together using only conservation of momentum, you get a very reasonable answer, but find that a large fraction of the kinetic energy has to be lost. If you're dealing with complicated macroscopic objects, though, that's very easy to arrange-- when you look at real-world objects that stick together after a collision, you always find some deformation of the colliding objects. This is most obvious in cases where the collision is violent, such as a bullet fired into a block of wood . Most of the energy of the bullet goes into breaking apart chemical bonds in the process of drilling into the block, and the final speed is just what you expect from the momentum calculation.The collision between a thrown football and an NFL receiver isn't nearly as dramatic as that, of course (though the subsequent collision between the receiver and a defensive back sometimes comes close). But a receiver is a big complicated system with lots of ways to dissipate the necessary energy. A great receiver with \"soft hands\" will gently decelerate the ball by moving his hands backwards, making up the energy difference with chemical energy from his muscles. A ridiculously lucky receiver might, say, pin the ball against his helmet, converting the ball's energy into a slight increase in the temperature of both.[caption id=\"attachment_79374fd892bf4d6f85ca8d01b0bb442b\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] New York Giants David Tyree #85 catches a miracle pass against the New England Patriots Rodney Harrison #37 during the Super Bowl XLII football game at University of Phoenix Stadium on Sunday, Feb. 3, 2008 in Glendale, Ariz.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)[/caption](I'm a Giants fan, I have to find some way to bring up those two Super Bowls whenever I talk about the Patriots...)The interaction between a receiver and a partially deflated football is, in physics terms, less \"elastic,\" meaning that it's farther away from the ideal-world case where both the momentum and the kinetic energy can be conserved in the collision. This means that energy is lost to deformation of the ball, and the receiver doesn't need to do as much to be able to hold onto the ball.What does this have to do with the existence of atoms? Well, it's very easy to find a way to dissipate the necessary energy when you're throwing together macroscopic objects like footballs and human beings, with lots of internal structure and moving parts that can soak up a little energy by re-arranging themselves slightly. The same core issue exists for any set of colliding objects, though, including subatomic particles like electrons and protons that have no internal structure to speak of. But the early universe consisted of vast numbers of free electrons and free protons rattling around in the aftermath of the Big Bang; how, then, did we end up with the hydrogen gas needed to make, well, everything? If you can't run two particles into each other and make them stick, how do you make atoms out of a universe filled with plasma?The answer turns out to be simple: you can't run two particles together and make them stick, but with three , it's perfectly easy. When three particles collide, two of them can lose energy and stick together, while the third flies off at higher speed, carrying away the \"extra\" energy. The process is known as \"three-body recombination,\" and you can find tons of papers in atomic physics, molecular physics, and plasma physics looking at the details. Most of the time, this involves something like two electrons and a proton happening to collide at the same time; this isn't terribly likely, but if you're dealing with large enough numbers of particles in your plasma-- say, an early universe full of them-- it happens often enough to create lots and lots of atoms. Another variant uses a photon as the \"third\" particle, turning the electron and proton into an atom by spontaneous or stimulated emission (the latter is one of the ways people have studied for enhancing the production of antihydrogen).(Running this kind of process in the opposite direction also works, and is behind one of more radical suggestions of 20th century physics, Wolfgang Pauli's proposal of the neutrino. When an atomic nucleus undergoes beta decay, a single neutron is converted into a proton and an electron, and if only those two particles are involved this would have to spit out electrons at a single energy. In reality, though, the electrons from beta decay come out with a wide range of energies. Niels Bohr was ready to discard conservation of energy over this problem, but Pauli pointed out that everything could be explained if there were a third, undetected particle involved that carried away the extra energy; today, we call these \"neutrinos,\" and they're one of the most important tools high-energy physicists have for looking for physics beyond the Standard Model.)So, while in sports terms the \"Deflategate\" scandal is a regrettable farce, for physicists, it's a gift that keeps on giving. It provided lots of us an opportunity to talk about the Ideal Gas Law, it gave DeLisi and Rarick a good hook for a paper on video analysis, and now it's given me an excuse for a blog post about plasma physics. I almost wish that the NFL would pursue an appeal in the courts, so we could see what other physics topics we can drag into this...", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/79374fd892bf4d6f85ca8d01b0bb442b/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/tpt/53/6/10.1119/1.4928347", "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=three-body+recombination&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart&sa=X&ved=0CBsQgQMwAGoVChMIwbWcl_-XyAIVTHY-Ch1EDwKa", "http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2013/08/21/how-deep-does-veritasiums-bullet-go/", "http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/08/13/432064785/tom-bradys-courtroom-sketch-spawns-internet-gold", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/45c7341e9e654a8cbb3eb81669377d3e/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2015/01/23/tom-brady-and-the-ideal-gas-law-physics-of-deflategate/", "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nfl-deflategate-sports-media-roger-goodell-tom-brady-new-england-patriots/"], "published": "2015-09-28T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T23:46:45.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
