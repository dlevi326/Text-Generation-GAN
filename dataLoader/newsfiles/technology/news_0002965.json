This included construction of an outdoor GenFuel hydrogen fuelling infrastructure, installation of four indoor hydrogen-dispensing stations, and deployment of 172 Plug Power GenDrive fuel cells in the centre’s forklift trucks. The package also includes GenCare aftermarket service and support. \n“Moving towards a sustainable and productivity-enhancing operation is a big step for any company,” said Andy Marsh, CEO at Plug Power. “The sustainability-focused facility built by The Home Depot in Ohio bolsters its strategic plans for a successful, environmentally friendly, and revenue-enhancing site. On behalf of Plug Power, I congratulate The Home Depot on its grand opening and on the implementation of its new hydrogen fuel cell-powered lift truck fleet.” \nWith GenKey, The Home Depot has the ability to make a significant impact regarding site greenhouse gas emissions. Plug Power’s GenDrive fuel cells produce zero emissions, as only heat and water are generated as byproducts of the energy creation. The Home Depot’s decision to switch from lead-acid batteries to Plug Power’s hydrogen fuel cells provides a net annual savings of more than 800 tonnes of greenhouse gas CO 2 emissions. These savings could increase to 9,000 tonnes of CO 2 over the life of the project, the equivalent of removing more than 1,800 cars from the road.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T13:33:53.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
