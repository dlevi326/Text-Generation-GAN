This way no in-depth cryptography knowledge is required to integrate encryption into enterprise applications or software products. The enterprise license allows unlimited distribution by the licensing organization which is also one of the most easiest ways of licensing software components.\nInstead of purchasing expert knowledge, CrococryptLib enables Java or JEE developers to directly integrate strong symmetric encryption and password hashing into applications. This saves a huge amount of budget and development time. CrococryptLib uses industry standards and the powerful technology of the Java Cryptography Extension underneath.\nOne of the main features of CrococryptLib is the automatic generation of secure crypto parameters and saving them in a single compact format. There is no additional overhead for your application but one single property. If you do not want to deal with questions like key sizes, salt lengths, block cipher modes, initialization vectors or iteration count then CrococryptLib is exactly what you need for your software project.\nThe defaults automatically used by CrococryptLib are PBKDF2 (PKCS #5) and SHA512 for password hashes and AES 256 Bit in CBC mode for symmetric encryption. Moreover, CrococryptLib integrates various encoding options that you can choose from. You can decide what is best for your application context: binary, Base64, JSON. Moreover, CrococryptLib supports large data streams and files as well.\nThe trial SDK requires no registration and contains running examples which can be used to directly integrate similar components into own software.\nMore information on the product's website: http://www.frankhissen.de/clib\nHissenIT is a small business in Germany focusing on IT security software development and consulting.
