Those named on the parcel were never tracked down or proven to exist.\nMr Marchant was put in charge of forensics on the case and visited the baby in the morgue to take photos and be present for the post mortem.\nHe believed the infant was only a few hours old when it died.\n“It struck me as very odd that someone would go to the trouble of posting a child,” he said.\n“[It appeared] the child has been born, with the umbilical cord still there, taken a few breaths and to circumvent the life process, whoever had the child has knotted the stocking, wrapped it around the neck three or four times and ended the child’s life before posting it from Brunswick to Darwin,” he said.\n“The neck was severely compressed from the stocking … I had a feeling that was done to stifle cries and ensure the child was dead.\n“It was murder … but that’s all conjecture; there was no definite proof.”\nThe images taken by Mr Marchant were sent to lead investigators from Victoria Police, who did not yet respond to questions from news.com.au regarding the case.\nRetired detective Denver Marchant, 74, was a young constable for the Northern Territory police when he worked on the case of the dead baby in the mailbag. Mr Marchant described the case as sickening.\n“A doctor did the post mortem and it really got to him … I’ve been in on over 100 post mortems in my career and that’s the only time I’d seen a doctor physically ill [during the procedure],” he said.\n“He was really crook.”\nMr Marchant said he didn’t recall if or where the baby — which was never given a name — was laid to rest.\n“We just referred to him as ‘the baby in the mailbag’,” he said.\n“This [case] has stuck with me because there are so many unanswered questions and no results.\n“The person who sent the child might have thought the father lived in Darwin; maybe he was a tourist, there are so many variables.”\nStill haunted by the case, Mr Marchant holds onto hope that the mystery may one day be solved.\n“Someone out there is carrying one hell of a burden,” he said.\n“Some people can’t handle that and when they’re getting closer to the end of their life on this earth, some feel they need to cough up what they know about something.\n“I’d urge anyone with information to contact police.”\nMURDERED CHILDREN WHO NOBODY KNOWS\nWhile Mr Marchant believed the “baby in the mailbag” case was “a bizarre one-off”, it has drawn comparisons to the recent discovery of a little girl’s remains in a suitcase by a highway in South Australia , in June this year. Her identity and the circumstances surrounding her death also remain a mystery.\nBelieved to have been born in 2005 or 2006, she still does not have a name. In the words of the detective heading the case, she is “a little girl lost”.\nEarlier this month in the USA, pieces of a little boy aged between two and three were pulled out of a lake in Garfield Park , not far from the centre of Chicago.\nPolice later released a sketch of the unidentified boy in the hope that someone would come forward with information about what happened to him. The case has not yet been solved.\nAnother child, known as Baby Doe, washed up in a plastic bag on Deer Island in Boston Harbour, USA, on June 25 this year. She was wrapped in a zebra-print blanket and dressed in polka dot leggings. She has since been identified as 2-year-old Bella Bond . On Friday, her mother’s boyfriend Michael McCarthy was charged with her murder, and Rachelle Bond was arrested as an accessory.\nAnyone with information on these cases should phone the Police Assistance Line on 131 444.\n Who put baby in the mailbag?", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/the-mystery-of-baby-doe-haunting-picture-of-girl-stuffed-in-rubbish-bag-ricochets-around-the-internet/story-fnu2q5nu-1227435284640", "http://www.news.com.au/national/crime/unidentified-girl-in-suitcase-begs-the-question-how-many-other-girls-have-we-lost/story-fns0kb1g-1227493896617", "http://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/baby-does-mother-arrested-boyfriend-charged-with-murder/story-fnh81jut-1227534523969", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0c837fa4918e7bb5cff4c8d9549db3de", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cc4604e2d465f1d960b0bcf0fa1257ff", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6980d1297a770e17fa4332a9f73a2d29?width=650", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/murdered-children-who-nobody-knows/story-fnq2o7dd-1227535293070?sv=aa459b77c5d79c683853d5e87b173418", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b7c5da005a378da14b6622afe4a9adae?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/80756c0de7b02dcbd641af0629e54f44", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4e4e53675f59402b1db85076e2dcd78b", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "http://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/police-release-sketch-of-unidentified-baby-boy-found-in-lagoon-in-chicago-ask-public-for-assistance/story-fnh81jut-1227523398349", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3f0a5f26e5edfe36278e9132cea27bf8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ebd9875e3eb5b5be42bc0260b8e1a14a"], "published": "2015-09-20T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T00:23:43.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
