One of the first daily news programs on the young medium launched on this date in 1922. It was called \"The Radio Digest,\" and was hosted by George Thompson over WBAY in New York City. At the time, there were just 30 radio stations in the entire U.S., and only 60,000 homes had receivers. Now, radio is part of the everyday routine of most Americans. Across the nation, there are well over 15,000 stations, and the average home has about eight radios. You can find current data on the country's economy by downloading the 'America's Economy' mobile application at www.census.gov/mobile . \nSources: Kane's Famous First Facts, 5705 The Radio Digest: http://www.on-this-day.com/onthisday/thedays/alldays/sep01.htm U.S. stations: http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0708/DOC-334266A1.pdf Radios in homes: http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s1132.pdf \nProfile America is produced by the Center for New Media and Promotions of the U.S. Census Bureau.
