The school is the brainchild of four senior airline pilots along with drone operators Cloud12 and UAViate. \nWill Coldwell, Director & A320 Pilot, said, “The commercial drone industry is very new and growing at a phenomenal rate so there is a real need to provide formal training, by experienced instructors to accepted aviation guidelines. We have set out to do just this with UAV Air and have already seen phenomenal interest in our courses, which begin this month in Berkshire.” \nIt has designed a series of courses which are built on the cornerstones of manned aviation principles. A carefully curated syllabus will equip the new breed of industry entrants eager to qualify in the rapidly expanding drone industry. \nUAV Air will offer a full schedule of autumn courses with accessible three-day fast-track options, all approved by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The first dates will take place in Berkshire, Staffordshire and East Yorkshire throughout September and October 2015. \nCourse content is structured to equip pilots with a strong technical, theoretical and practical understanding. Students are taught the theory and flight assessment standards necessary to fly drones commercially in the UK with development of flight procedures and operations manuals also included for those working towards a PFAW. \nCollectively, the training team has more than 40 years of flying experience, 20,000 commercial flying hours logged and 8 years first-hand experience in the civilian drone industry. This includes hundreds of sub-7kg and sub-20kg drone operations. The chief flight assessor has over 27 years of RC flying experience alone and is qualified to BMFA Club Examiner standard. \nWould-be commercial drone pilots can choose from a total of four UAV Air courses, with a flight assessment and conversion course available for those already in possession of a theoretical qualification. \nFor students wishing to develop a career in the industry, UAV Air’s Ab-Initio course is a structured starting point. Students will learn how to fly the correct way from an experienced drone operator. Emphasis is placed on adopting a best-practise methodology, starting those keen to qualify as a commercial drone pilot with evidence based training. The course brings pilots up to assessment standard, with skills and attitude training included, allowing students wishing to develop marketable skills before entering the competitive drone job market. \nThe Integrated Course is for those with two hours of self-certified flying experience. It takes place over three days and covers all required components for pilots applying for their PFAW. Those completing the course can take the flight assessment at the end of the three-day period to formalise their expertise, understanding of methodology and prove flight capability. \nA Modular Course covers the same training components as the Integrated Course, without the flight assessment. Students still lacking the self-certified two hours fly time or not yet ready to take the flight test can complete the modular elements and then return at a later date to sit the assessment. \nCAA pilot license holders can take the UAV Air Abbreviated Course. This is a two day session with an optional theoretical exam followed by the mandatory flight assessment. All flight assessments are conducted in accordance with the QRH provided by UAVAir and last no more than one hour. \nBen Keene, Head of Flight Assessment said, “One of the things that we were keen to adopt is an open and transparent approach to the Flight Assessment. We firmly believe in de-mystifying it, allowing candidates to determine if they are ready to take the test based on their understanding of it. We developed our unique Skills Test Candidate Guide to facilitate this and offer it to all students at enrolment. We aim to create a relaxed and informed approach, so all candidates can focus on their training, get the most from the course and perform the flight assessment to the best of their abilities.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:11:14.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
