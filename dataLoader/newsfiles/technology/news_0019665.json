Supplied by Tim Dodd United States massive open online course (MOOC) provider edX has brought back a course run earlier in 2015, for which 88 per cent of the feedback said it was either \"eye-opening\" or \"life-changing\".\nThe course, Transforming Business, Society, and Self with U.Lab , from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, invites learners \"on a journey to see the world in new ways and practise a method that allows leaders, entire organisations, and larger social systems to connect with and actualise their highest future possibility\".\nThe U.Lab course teaches Theory U, described as \"an approach to leading profound change that has been developed by action researchers at MIT, and practised by leaders around the world, for over 20 years\".\nOne of the leading instructors in the course, Otto Scharmer, from MIT's Sloan School of Management, wrote that this MOOC would \"prototype a new hybrid online/real-world learning environment, with the goal of sparking a global web of interconnected hubs, inspiring initiatives, and grounding learning locally in places where societal challenges are manifest\".\nHe said he regarded U.Lab as a prototype \"creating a genuine space for self-reflection and for dialogue on what may well be the most important conversation of our time: who we are as human beings, who we want to be, and what future society we want to live in\".\nThe MOOC started on September 10 and runs for eight weeks. It is free and requires three to seven hours a week of study.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.edx.org/course/transforming-business-society-self-u-lab-mitx-15-671x#!", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/otto-scharmer/u-lab-reinventing-the-21s_b_5669425.html?ir=Australia"], "published": "2015-09-11T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T05:22:22.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
