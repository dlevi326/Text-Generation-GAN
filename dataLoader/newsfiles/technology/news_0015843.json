That means customers will be able to order items online, select a time to pick them up, and have an employee deliver the food to their car when they arrive. Wal-Mart is currently offering the service in five other markets, part of a test that first began in 2011.\nThe move puts Wal-Mart in closer competition with companies tackling the online-grocery market, an area seen as an elusive prize ever since the original dot-com boom in the 1990s. Target has said it plans to aggressively go after grocery delivery and announced this month that it would begin testing a same-day grocery delivery service with Instacart Inc. in Minneapolis. Amazon, meanwhile, offers a $299-a-year service called AmazonFresh in certain markets. Google announced plans this month to begin testing a delivery service for groceries and fresh food later this year in San Francisco and one other city.\nNearby Stores Wal-Mart, the largest seller of groceries in the U.S., wants to use its massive brick-and-mortar chain as an advantage. The retailer says 70 percent of Americans live within 5 miles of a Wal-Mart, making the option of store pickup an attractive alternative to delivery.\nThe service lets customers pick up their Wal-Mart orders on the same day they order them, if the transaction is completed by 10 a.m. Wal-Mart also has been testing grocery delivery to customers’ homes, but for now it’s only expanding the pickup option.\nGrocery makes up more than half of Wal-Mart’s revenue, though it’s been struggling to keep the business growing. The retail giant has been losing share to supermarkets that might not always have a lower price but provide a more pleasant shopping experience with better customer service, according to Wayne Hood, a BMO Capital Markets analyst. Wal-Mart’s customers have also complained about the quality and freshness of its food.\nThe latest pickup expansion will add 30 to 35 stores to the program, including locations in Charlotte, North Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; Tucson, Arizona; and Colorado Springs, Colorado. It was previously offered in about 50 or 60 stores, the company said.", "external_links": ["http://blog.walmart.com/innovation/20150929/grocery-shopping-that-works-with-your-schedule\\"], "published": "2015-09-29T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:00:43.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
