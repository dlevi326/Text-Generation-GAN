Dual polarized antennas are often used with MIMO/802.11ac devices to enable multi-stream communication. This allows the device to transmit data on one polarization while simultaneously receiving data on the other. Dual polarized antennas enable multi-stream communication through one antenna instead of using two independent (and opposite polarized) antennas for the same result.\n“This antenna represents a technological breakthrough and delivers industry-leading performance for 802.11ac-based networks,” said Jon Jensen, President and CEO of L-com. “There are only two constants in the wireless industry; the increase in the number connected devices on the network and the growing demand for greater bandwidth. L-com is committed to helping our customers meet both of these rapidly-growing requirements by providing a broad offering of high-performance products like our new 4X4 MIMO Omni directional antenna. It’s a unique product and allows our customers to realize significant performance improvements,” continued Jensen.\nThis technology also supports the attenuation of unwanted signals from adjacent channels and/or co-located equipment, thus improving RF performance and increasing data speed. Supported MIMO types include 2x2 systems (two streams), 3x3 systems (three streams) and 4x4 systems (4 streams).\n“Quad” Omni antennas are actually four antennas in one package. They feature separate horizontal and vertical elements for the 2.4 GHz frequency band and another set of horizontal and vertical elements for the 5 GHz frequency band. The internal elements are accessed via four individual N-female connectors.\n“We are proud to announce these industry-first MIMO antennas. Our patent-pending design allows our customers to realize faster data rates and less RF interference than the other MIMO antennas that are currently available on the market,\" said Patrick Pesa, Director of Product Management. “Additionally, these antennas are backward compatible with 802.11n networks and will support future 802.11ac Wave 2 applications,” said Pesa.\nThe new antennas are available in 6, 9 and 11dBi gain and feature UV resistant PVC radomes that ensure years of reliable operation in all weather conditions. Additionally, the heavy-duty extruded aluminum base allows these antennas to be mounted on masts of up to 3.7 inches in diameter.\nFor more information about this release, please contact:\nPeter McNeil, Marketing Manager\n978-682-6936 x1174, mailto:pmcneil(at)l-com(dot)com\nAbout L-com Global Connectivity\nL-com Global Connectivity, a preferred manufacturer of wired and wireless connectivity products, offers a wide range of solutions and unrivaled customer service for the electronics and data communications industries.
