Musk said the Model 3 will start production in about two years.\nMusk also said deliveries of the Model X SUV - the company's third vehicle - will begin Sept. 29. Tesla wouldn't reveal pricing details.\nMusk said each trim level of the Model X will be around $5,000 more than the equivalent trim level of the Model S because of the SUV's greater size and complexity.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
