Magnus offers the first and only active countermeasure solution at scale, removing bots from the field of battle entirely. This active countermeasure nullifies attackers and stops their attacks. “This is a fundamentally new and superior approach that allows our customers to move beyond current passive defenses, which while necessary, are not sufficient in the face of growing sophisticated attacks,” said David Freese, CEO of Magnus Cloud. “Large financial institutions and cybersecurity experts have been calling for an automated and scalable active defense–a proactive countermeasure–and we believe this is it,” added Freese.\nMagnus’ unique cloud solution is based on a cryptographically strong, deterministic protocol, which is unaffected by extreme polymorphism found in the most aggressive bot attacks. The solution works preauthentication and requires no PII, no access to your private SSL keys, and no proxying. Deployment and integration is straightforward because it is accomplished through the browser itself.\nWith its innovative approach and sophisticated algorithm for bot defense, Magnus represents the first and only scalable active countermeasure for automated web attacks. Solutions include web-based countermeasures that protect customer accounts, transactions, web content, and website fields & forms against fraud, theft, account take-over, web scraping, and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) assaults.\nAbout Magnus\nMagnus Cloud offers technology and services that actively prevent automated cyberattacks from damaging corporate websites and mission critical web applications. Magnus defends against all bot-based exploits and eliminates risk from Layer 7 Denial of Service attacks.
