It was innocent enough until she allegedly tried to use the picture to blackmail the 43-year-old Czech player, who it turned out didn’t care. \nThe Mirror reportsmodel Katerina Provaznikova, 18, tried to extort $2000 from Jagr but the former NY Rangers star doesn’t have a girlfriend and told her to do with the photograph what she pleased. \nThe after-sex selfie was a fail for Provaznikova and fodder for those with the time and creativity to mock the young model online. Katerina Provaznikova took this photograph with Jaromir Jagr and reportedly failed in an attempt at blackmail.
