(AP) - While a New Jersey judge approved the state's $225 million settlement with ExxonMobil, he expressed concern over delayed cleanup at a polluted creek, which a state lawmaker says could open up a route to appeal the decision.\nDemocratic state Sen. Raymond Lesniak said he believes Superior Court Judge Michael Hogan's concerns in the decision released Tuesday could give him an opportunity to appeal the judgment, ultimately with the goal of getting more money for the state but also starting the cleanup of Morses Creek in northern New Jersey. The creek is used in refinery operations to provide cooling water at the Linden, New Jersey, site.\nThe agreement calls for delaying remediation at the site until refinery operations cease, which Lesniak sarcastically said could be as late as the year \"3009.\" The refinery is now owned by Phillips 66.\nLesniak said he believes that deferment violates New Jersey law and is hopeful an appellate court will agree.\n\"The whole kahuna is gonna ride on that,\" he said. \"That's a big kahuna.\"\nHogan said the deferment gave the court pause \"though not fatally.\"\nHe said the deal calls for delaying remediation more specifically until operations no longer require 30 million gallons of water per day to be released into the creek. Technology does not exist that would allow the refinery to operate without using at least 30 million gallons of non-contact cooling water, Hogan said, adding once that technology is developed, either the refinery owner will voluntarily begin using it or the state will cease to issue a permit. At that point, New Jersey would have a right to require ExxonMobil to clean up the site.\nLesniak said he expects to appeal soon. He's expected to be joined by environmental groups, including New Jersey Sierra Club, Clean Water Action and Environment New Jersey, that may file a separate appeal. The environmental groups will first need an appeals court to grant them permission to intervene in the case in an earlier, separate appeal.\nNew Jersey sued ExxonMobil for natural resources damage in 2004. The idea was to hold the company responsible not only for cleaning up polluted areas - which include two oil refineries in Bayonne and Linden and other sites and retail gas stations across New Jersey - but to compensate the public for the alleged harm to groundwater, surface water and other ecological resources.\nThe state had sought $8.9 billion in the case and Hogan was about to rule when the state and ExxonMobil announced the $225 million deal earlier this year.\nGov. Chris Christie, a Republican running for his party's presidential nomination, has hailed the deal as the nation's second-largest of its kind against a corporate polluter.\nEnvironmental groups and Democrats, a majority in the state Legislature, criticized the settlement and said it is just a fraction of the billions of dollars New Jersey should have recovered.\nUnder law, about $50 million of the settlement will go toward site remediation. Another roughly $50 million will go toward the state's private legal costs. The rest is slated to go into the general fund.\nEnvironmentalists and critics of Christie contend the deal was a giveaway for a major company.\nDespite Lesniak's and the groups' expected appeals, Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said the settlement brings the case to a \"fair and reasonable conclusion.\"\n\"Both parties will now have the benefit of the certainty and finality that comes from this settlement,\" he said.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
