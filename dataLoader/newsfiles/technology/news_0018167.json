Musk said the Model 3 will start production in about two years. \nMusk also said deliveries of the Model X SUV -- the company's third vehicle -- will begin Sept. 29. Tesla wouldn't reveal pricing details. \nMusk said each trim level of the Model X will be around $5,000 more than the equivalent trim level of the Model S because of the SUV's greater size and complexity. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
