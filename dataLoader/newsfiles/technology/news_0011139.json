For older kids those basics will become reading, writing, arithmetic, and computers. The book, \"Boolean Logic for Babies,\" is designed to introduce an infant's mind to the underpinning logic of all computer systems. \"Computers are more than a electronics, they're a way of thinking,\" said Eric. \"The future belongs to those with the mental toolkit to navigate this growing world.\"\nFrom smart watches to smart light bulbs, computers are making their way into evermore aspects of our daily lives. No matter what a child chooses to be in life, technology will play a large role.\nThis first book holds an infant’s attention with cute animals and bright colors. Like many baby books it's cloth, non-toxic, machine washable, and has a teething ring. What differentiates this book is it also introduces babies to the higher-level concepts of conjunction, disjunction, negation–or in layman's terms: and, or, not. It's also been thoroughly tested by the most adorable quality assurance team ever assembled.\nThe series was designed by technical author Eric Redmond (Seven Databases in Seven Weeks, Programming Google Glass), who is also a recent father of two, alongside a small team of educators guided by modern childhood development research. It's currently available for order through Kickstarter with plans to introduce two more books for older kids: \"Counting in Binary for Toddlers\" and \"Functions for Tots\". The first batch of books will ship in November 2015 in time for the holiday season.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2NvZGVyb3NoaS5jb20=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2tjay5zdC8xaE5DWEZ4", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2NzZm9yYmFiaWVzLmNvbQ=="], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:08:01.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
