Congratulations, Lucas. Legoland Windsor \nLucas Atkinson will have an amazing story about his birth. And it's all true. \nLucas arrived into the world on August 30 in an unusual place: the parking lot at the Legoland Windsor Resort in the UK. \nJanine Atkinson was on her way to the hospital to give birth, but Lucas wasn't willing to wait. She pulled over at Legoland and her son became the first baby born there. \n\"To celebrate his very special birth place, Lucas has been given the gift of a lifetime worth of visits to the resort! How awesome is that?\" Legoland Windsor posted in a Facebook update along with a photo of the happy family and a glimpse at the baby's birth certificate. \nThe certificate is very specific about the location: \"Legoland Windsor, Winkfield Road, Windsor on the way to Wexham Park Hospital Slough.\" \nLucas can look forward to exploring the Land of the Vikings, Knights Kingdom, Pirate Shores, Lego City and the Kingdom of the Pharaohs as he gets older. He will no doubt enjoy Duplo Valley as soon as he's old enough to walk. His name will also be displayed on a wall of Legoland lifetime pass holders. \nThe pass is quite a coup for a youngster. A regular individual annual pass costs Â£169 (US$260, AU$369). \nIf this story follows through to its Hollywood ending, then Lucas will grow up to be a Lego Master Builder, which isn't much of a stretch considering his birthplace and the fact that his father's occupation on his birth certificate is listed as \"builder.\" The Lego is strong with this one.
