So what’s the story behind it?\nWe spoke to the man behind the meme for the first episode of Updog, a new Guardian podcast about fun things on the internet .\nUpdog Episode I: Duck W GHS: A New Meme If you haven’t seen it yet, here it is, in all its glory:\nSource: Kevin Innes/ViralHog Since it was uploaded by 22-year-old Kevin Innes, it has racked up more than 5 million YouTube views and on Vine it’s getting thousands and thousands of loops.\nInevitably, the remixes came. First, the Adele version:\nSource: stop jake/Vine Then the version combining the duck army with another meme of someone making fun of a police officer’s shoes:\nSource: KARAOKLEE/Vine Then the Taylor Swift edition:\nSource Nick Name/YouTube Then there was the superb “Fall of the duck army”, showing two people kicking the screeching duck toy around what looks like a storage room:\nSource: Estupivideces/YouTube All hail the duck army, our new internet overlords.\nBut when we tracked down he screaming avian online, where curious readers can grab their own for just $15 (though it won’t ship internationally, fellow Europeans), we discovered a horrifying truth – it’s not a duck at all.
