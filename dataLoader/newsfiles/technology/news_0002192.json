You can export those here . \n“Send money to anyone in the U.S. with an email address,” Google said of the new service. “It’s fast, easy, and free to send directly from your debit card, bank account, or Wallet Balance.” From VentureBeat Use psychology to sell?

New Google Wallet for iOS available now on the App Store.

And Google wants to win . \nYou can grab the new iOS update here .
