APT Charities focuses on awarding grants to organizations that have a demonstrated need and specific goal for funds, particularly those who engage in or could benefit from data-driven solutions.\nDC Central Kitchen (DCCK), is a Washington, D.C.-based organization whose mission is to use food as a tool to strengthen bodies, empower minds, and build communities. DC Central Kitchen’s renowned Culinary Job Training program equips unemployed, underemployed, and previously incarcerated persons and homeless adults for careers in the food service industry. The $15,000 grant from APT Charities will support DCCK’s data collection efforts to keep in touch with their culinary graduates and use that data to identify opportunities to make their programs more effective.\n“This grant will be a tremendous aid to our data-driven evaluation activities and a helpful investment to the long-term success of some of our key initiatives,” said Alexander Moore, chief development officer of DC Central Kitchen. “APT Charities’ support will allow us to not only improve our workforce development evaluation efforts, but also help us better leverage and refine our use of a performance management database that helps us capture, track, and analyze short-term outputs and long-term outcomes that ultimately improve the lives of those in our community.”\n“This round of grant applications was very competitive with organizations from across the country showing how their work can benefit from data-driven solutions,” said Julie Ann Halderman, co-chair of the APT Charities Grants Committee. “After a tough week of voting, our members came together and felt that DCCK best fit the mission of our organization.”\nAPT Charities operates on a continuous grant cycle, with the next application being released in the upcoming months. “This cycle showed us the high caliber of projects that could benefit from data-oriented funding. We are excited to be partnering with DC Central Kitchen and are looking forward to those we can reach in our next cycle,” said Corinne Walters, board chair of APT Charities.\nAbout APT Charities\nAPT Charities was founded on the principle that data can help everyone. We believe that decisions should be validated by collecting and analyzing evidence. As an organization, it is our hope to aid those in the non-profit sector by providing grants to collect, organize, and sift through data, as well as make impactful changes based on that evidence. In short, our mission is to give gifts directly to organizations that have a demonstrated need and specific goal for funds, including those who engage in or could benefit from data-driven solutions. APT Charities was initially funded by a donation from Applied Predictive Technologies. Members also contribute and are encouraged to find organizations to apply, as well as vote on the grant recipient.
