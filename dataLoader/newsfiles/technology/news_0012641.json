Hands up or we will shoot! 20 Sep , 2015 Share An asteroid is heading towards our Mother Earth to cause annihilation, but the timely intervention by the hero who is generally a super intelligent scientist saves the world by using some amazing space gun deflecting the asteroid. Reminds you of any sci-fi movie? Well this may become reality very soon. That’s because NASA’s Asteroid Redirect Mission wants to send a robot to an asteroid. NASA wants to retrieve a boulder of appropriate strength from asteroids to study it and take it to the moon. A video release shows how a shotgun attached to the robot would learn about the asteroid by shooting at it. First, the vehicle would survey the surface of the asteroid. Then it would target the shotgun at the asteroid. Once on target, the shotgun will fire a projectile, which could do one of the three things. One is to fire a shell that cracks open when met with certain strength, thereby revealing just how hard the asteroid is. Second is to bounce a ball off the surface of the asteroid, then track its rebound velocity to determine the strength of that asteroid. And the third and last option is to shoot at it and make a crater, and then measure the size of that crater to determine that asteroid’s strength and density. The mission is facing criticism both from inside and outside NASA but reiterating the importance of this mission NASA says: “The robotic mission also will demonstrate planetary defense techniques to deflect dangerous asteroids and protect Earth if needed in the future.” What would become of the mission is still unknown, but anything that tries to deflect hostile asteroids off our backs is welcome!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T09:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T10:35:12.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
