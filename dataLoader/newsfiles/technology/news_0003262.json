They took away my car, said I am a danger on the road. I have to wait for someone to come and fetch me when i want to go shopping. Very few people come, because they think I am a grumpy old man.\nPerhaps I am. Actually I do not think so, I just do not like people because they are false. They bump around and smile in front of me, yet roll their eyes when they think I am not looking. They agree with everything I say, because they want to humour me. Keep me happy till they can leave and get on with their lives.\nI do not want to be humoured, I want to engage their minds in debate, but they do not bother.\nI hate Facebook, because you talk to the same people all the time. So all I have is N24 and the comments.\nI have met delightful people and idiots. I do not know what they look like and they do not care what I look like. Race doesn't matter here. We are only minds and opinions. They are my window to the world.\nWe argue, agree, insult, compliment.\nWe learn from one another and teach one another. These are my true friends, because a true friend doesn't humour you and roll his eyes.\nTomorrow it will end. I will have to read their opinions and have so much to say, yet I will be gagged and isolated in this room.\nIs it because I have not paid N24 money for having these friends? How much would you like me to pay?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:19:25.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
