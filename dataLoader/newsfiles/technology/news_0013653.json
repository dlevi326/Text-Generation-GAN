As of today, LinkedIn Sponsored Updates and Google's AdWords campaigns can be managed through HubSpot to give inbound marketers greater access to insights about their customers' journey, while easily tracking ROI of their ad-fueled content campaigns. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20110817/NE53515LOGO \nProducts like search ads and native social ads have become an important piece of an inbound marketer's search and social media strategies. Ads can play an important role in giving proven content a more prominent stage, whether it's in maximizing reach to an existing audience or launching campaigns in a new market. \n\"We've always been about meaningful content at HubSpot, and ads can accelerate content campaigns in incredible ways,\" said HubSpot CTO and founder Dharmesh Shah. \"Our customers reminded us of a very important point: it's the content that matters, not the format or path to it . When ads equal good content or help people find it, they contribute to a well-rounded Inbound Marketing strategy.\" \nFor its initial advertising integration, HubSpot aligned with two proven leaders of ad solutions: LinkedIn and Google. With HubSpot's Ads Add-on, inbound marketers can now harness the power of ads to: 1. Create campaigns right in HubSpot using a streamlined campaign creation dashboard that features in-product tips for guidance on getting the most out of paid campaigns as well as bidding and payment integration 2. Measure the success of ad campaigns down to the keyword or ad, while viewing the entire journey from click to paying customer 3. Attribute ROI to marketing activities, while segmenting data based on any property and relating it back to revenue \nHubSpot's Ads Add-on not only provides a simple and clear view of how ads perform beyond just clicks - it allows users to glean more data around their buyers to offer a personalized experience. Together with an inbound marketer's go-to tactics - great landing pages, great content, and simple, clear CTAs - search and social ads managed through the HubSpot Ads Add-on will have the added benefit of great performance and a comprehensive picture of ROI. \nLinkedIn Sponsored Updates and HubSpot With more than 380 million members from around the world on its platform, LinkedIn gives B2B marketers access to its network of professionals online. Its Sponsored Updates product provides opportunities for brands looking to build relationships with professional audiences through content. Because Sponsored Updates sit natively in the LinkedIn homepage feed, inbound marketers can reach more prospects through existing content campaigns that can be amplified beyond those actively following their brand. \n\"We know that content is playing a greater role in fostering B2B relationships, and we believe when delivered to the right people, in the right way, it can have significant impact,\" said Russell Glass, Head of Products, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. \"We're excited about integrating Sponsored Updates into HubSpot's Ads Add-On. This integration has the potential to drive even more meaningful results for inbound marketers in their quest to gain better awareness and engagement.\" \nGoogle AdWords and HubSpot Currently in limited beta for HubSpot customers, the Google AdWords campaign and optimization management feature for HubSpot's Ads Add-on leverages the power of Google's popular product, while giving inbound marketers AdWords ad and keyword ROI analysis. \nAbout HubSpot HubSpot (NYSE: HUBS) is the world's leading inbound marketing and sales platform.
