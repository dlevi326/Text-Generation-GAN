That compares to a profit of $138.9 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier. Analysts anticipated a second-quarter profit of $14.8 million, or 2 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\nThe company reported preliminary second-quarter revenue of $711 million, representing a 26% drop from last year's quarter and short of the $721.9 million analysts projected.\nPreliminary second-quarter results may change as a result of the audit committee's investigation.\nThe \"weak near-term results reflect weakness in the [hard disk drive market], though given the aforementioned investigation we don't have confidence in the reported numbers,\" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Chris Caso said in an analyst note.\nGiven the probe and the downturn in China, Mr. Caso said Marvell is now unlikely to divest its money-losing handset businessâ€”a move some analysts have considered key to the company's strategy.\nMarvell specializes in microprocessor architecture and digital-signal processing, and it makes products for the mobile and wireless industries. The company has been struggling amid lower demand in the computer and storage sectors and from a weaker global economy.\nYear-to-date, the stock has erased about 27% and shares closed at $10.55 Thursday.\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com\n 11, 2015 09:15 ET (13:15 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:29:12.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
