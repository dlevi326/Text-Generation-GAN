The two bedroom, two bathroom house will set you back $734 a night .\nIt was designed by architect Tom Pritchard and was then owned by the Mary Poppins actor, who retained the property’s original dance studio and industrial kitchen, while upgrading the master bathroom with a two-person bath tub overlooking the woods. The master also has a fireplace and curved glass floor-to-ceiling windows and a wooden deck.\nOne Airbnb reviewer called his experience at the Rubber House a “mindblowingly pleasant stay”.
