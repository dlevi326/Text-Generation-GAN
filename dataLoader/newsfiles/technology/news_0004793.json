But that creates a challenge: maintaining the growth of the iPhone with dhanges that are less obvious, such as a better camera, fingerprint sensor and improved Wi-Fi connectivity.\nWednesday, Apple offered two new phones--the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus--which are the same sizes as the large-screen phones introduced last year.\n\"While they may look familiar, we have changed everything about these iPhones,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive.\nThe biggest new feature is Apple's \"3-D Touch,\" a new way of manipulating the phone depending on how hard you press. For instance, by pressing down hard on the camera icon on the phone, a user can take a shortcut to take a selfie. The maneuver can also trigger a preview pane, allowing users to glance quickly at the body of an email by pressing lightly on the screen.\nThe feature, while interesting, isn't the type of flashy advance likely to draw customers into Apple stores to get a new iPhone, said Brian Blau, research director at Gartner.\n\"I don't know that these things change the equation for the iPhone,\" he said.\nApple faces a high hurdle to maintain the iPhone's momentum: Revenue from the device grew 59% in its third fiscal quarter, ended June 27, compared with a year earlier.\nMr. Cook has said that only 27% of iPhone users have upgraded to the larger phones, leaving ample opportunity for future growth.\nApple also unveiled a program to finance purchases directly to users and make it easier to get a new iPhone every year, wading into the domain traditionally reserved for mobile carriers.\nUnder the new iPhone Upgrade Program, customers can pay a monthly fee of $32 or $37--depending on the model--at an Apple retail store and get a new phone every year, similar to a car lease. The phones will be unlocked and the customer can choose the carrier.\nApple said customers can order the new phones on Sept. 12 and they will be available on Sept. 25. Prices will start at $649 for the iPhone 6s and $749 for the larger iPhone 6s Plus--keeping the same prices as their predecessors. Apple dropped the price of the current models by $100.\nA larger screen helped to propel iPhone sales and Apple is hoping that the formula will also work with the iPad, sales of which have fallen for six straight quarters.\n\"IPad is the clearest expression of our view of multipurpose computing,\" said Mr. Cook.\nThe larger iPad Pro, measuring 12.9 inches, compared with 9.7 inches for Apple's iPad Air, blurs the lines between tablet and notebook computers. Apple also introduced a \"smart keyboard\" and a pressure-sensitive stylus called Apple Pencil.\nThe larger iPad may find an audience with businesses, which could use the new tablet in lieu of laptops. In recent months, Apple has struck deals with International Business Machines Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc., two of the biggest technology suppliers to businesses.\nApple said the iPad Pro will start at $799 with 32 gigabytes of memory. The keyboard will cost $169 and the Apple Pencil will be $99. All three new products will be available in November. If a consumer were to buy the base iPad Pro with the keyboard and stylus, it would cost $1,067, more than the starting $999 price of Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air.\nDaniel Ives, a senior analyst at FBR Capital Markets said Apple may be more profitable with the iPad Pro and accessories than the low-end Macbook computers. However, the real opportunity for the company is to have a product that can appeal to corporate customers.\n\"It finally has a high-octane product that it can sell to the enterprise that can really be the door opener,\" he said.\nApple has shown a willingness to cannibalize its own products in the past. The iPhone 6 Plus with a 5.5-inch screen encroached on the market for the iPad Mini, a tablet with a 7.9-inch screen. Looking further back, the iPhone marked the beginning of the decline of the iPod.\nApple also offered its first major overhaul for its Apple TV set-top box since its introduction in 2007.\nThe new device can run apps, meaning that third-party developers can create programs for the device. It comes with a new remote with a touchpad that also responds to voice commands with Siri, the digital assistant found in the iPhone. Apple showed off a new search feature that lets users look for a specific program or move across a range of video-streaming options.\nApple TV was a pioneer in providing a set-top box for streaming video via the Internet to the television. However, it has become an increasingly crowded field with the likes of Google Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Sony Corp. and Roku Inc. all jostling to connect TVs with popular streaming-video services like Netflix and Hulu.\nApple is also working on creating its own streaming live-television service, a bundle of channels aimed at replacing the offerings from cable and satellite operators. It has struggled to nail down the content deals necessary to offer the service, and made no mention of it Wednesday.\nApple said the new set-top box will be available starting in late October for $149 for the model with 32 gigabytes of storage and $199 for one with 64 gigabytes of memory.\nWrite to Daisuke Wakabayashi at Daisuke.Wakabayashi@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"Apple, Inc.\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005\n 09, 2015 20:45 ET (00:45 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:58:58.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
