A GoNet Systems eBrief explores the issue and highlights a radiation-reducing solution.\nTel Aviv, Israel, September 03, 2015 --( PR.com )-- There is little hard evidence that Wi-Fi network and other radio wave \"pollution\" is harmful to your health, but a new GoNet Systems eBrief looks at how this pollution can be reduced, to ease consumer concerns.\nTitled \"Are Wi-Fi Networks Harmful to Your Health?\" the eBrief looks at the proliferation of Wi-Fi networks and cellular coverage, and concludes that users and others have a legitimate interest in reducing the volume of radio waves.\nGoNet Systems is a provider of Wi-Fi solutions to cellular operators and wireless service providers for 3G data offload and Wi-Fi access applications. Its Wi-Fi systems use directed beamforming technology, which delivers more efficient coverage and capacity and reduces the amount of radio waves in the coverage area.\n\"Health is going to become a major concern especially as more Wi-Fi networks are installed in schools,\" said Merom Harpaz, head of sales for GoNet Systems. \"Parents may not be worried about their health, but they will likely think twice when it comes to the radio waves their children get exposed to during the school day.\"\nThe eBrief also looks at how beamforming technology limits radio wave exposure. It uses an omnidirectional antenna only briefly, and once it picks up a signal, switches over to directed beams aimed at the user's device. Other approaches rely on radio waves broadcasting in all directions at all times.\nFor service providers, GoNet Systems equipment provides high-quality coverage with less equipment and a lower cost. As David Ackerman, head of business development for North America, pointed out, \"Using the GoBeam Wi-Fi access points family can save up to 70 percent on CAPEX and OPEX.”\nGoNet Systems' GoBeam access points are designed for optimal bandwidth-intensive Wi-Fi access in enterprise networks as well as large-scale 3G/4G data offload deployments. Its dual radio architecture supports beamforming in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.\nThe eBrief is accessible at http://www.gonetworks.com/news/are-wi-fi-networks-harmful-to-your-health/\nAbout GoNet Systems\nGoNet Systems (www.GoNetworks.com) provides carrier-class, outdoor Wi-Fi solutions to cellular operators and wireless service providers for 3G data offload and Wi-Fi access applications.
