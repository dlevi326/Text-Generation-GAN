As the worldâ€™s #1 event in mold making, rapid prototyping, tooling, additive manufacturing and 3D technologies, the 2015's Euromold just came to an end on September 25th. This year's Euromold attracted hundreds of suppliers and tens of thousands of visitors from all over the world.\nAmong various innovative companies and products at the exhibition, a start-up company called Suanier Tech from China stood out. The product they brought to present was Visbody 3D Human Body Scanner. Its unique shape and advance technology drew lots of attention. Their booth had been filled with visitors who wanted to get a personal experience with 3D scanning throughout the whole exhibition.\nSuanier Tech was founded in 2014. They had received investment of 20 million Yuan from venture capital. This year, Suanier made a debut with its Visbody 3D body scanner at Euromold. Visbody 3D body scanner can collect full-body 3D data and color information in 1 second to then build lifelike 3D model based on multi-view fusion technology. Visbody's innovative dome-type structure allows 93 5 mega-pixel cameras to cover a full body without any blind spots. The data integrity of the 3D model generated by Visbody is over 95%. In addition, Visbody is equipped with LED cold lights as light compensation system to minimize the impacts of ambient light while avoiding any damage to human eyes.\nAt the Design + Engineering Forum, an important sector of Euromold, industry experts from Microsoft, GE, and Autodesk, etc. got together to share their newest results and discuss future trends. The 25-year-old CTO and cofounder of Suanier Tech, Mr. Chu Zhiwei, had given a presentation at the Forum with the topic of \"Bringing People from Reality to the Virtual World\". As he said, Suanier wants to make a 3D scanner that can be used in daily life, not just some expensive device that can only be afforded in scientific research, medical diagnosis and treatment, and cutting-edge film production. Although what Suanier Tech bring to Euromold this year is only a prototype, Visbody has already been applied for virtual fitting, body shape tracking as well as generating plastic surgery before and after pictures. Next year, you will be able to buy a more portable version of Visbody on the market.\nSuanier Tech will continue to show its progress at international exhibitions and search for oversea partners.
