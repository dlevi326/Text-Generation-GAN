Publishers will now be able to hand pick which ads will or will not appear on their website by the individual ad. This high level of customization was previously limited to broad ad categories. \nPublishers in the MGID network will now be able to “delete” ads from the native ad widgets directly on their websites. Once deleted, the publisher can then choose to block the ad on the entire domain or for just a specific widget. This level of control on specific ad content will enable publishers to ensure that the content displayed is relevant to their audiences. \n“For native ads to be successful, the content must be relevant to the audience,” said Sergey Denisenko, CEO, MGID. “With these filtering tools, publishers can make sure the only content showing up on their sites is the content they want. The feature will add another important layer of quality control that leads to better content for the publisher, relevant content for the user, and higher performing ads for the advertiser.” \nThe new tool has been rolled out to all of the publishers on the MGID network and is available as part of the standard native ad widgets. For more information about the tool, visit the MGID blog . \nAbout MGID \nMGID, established in 2008, was one of the first native advertising companies worldwide.
