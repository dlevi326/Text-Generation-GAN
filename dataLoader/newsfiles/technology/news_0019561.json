Citizens should speak out to stop this misguided bill that would choke access to public records. \nThe Tennessee Public Records Act gives citizens the right to review the records of state and local governments. There are more than 350 exemptions to the law, but otherwise public records are supposed to be made available for public inspection. \nState law allows government agencies to charge reasonable fees for copying, including the labor costs involved in duplicating documents, but the mere inspection of records is free. That would change under the bill filed in this year's legislative session by state Rep. Steve McDaniel, R-Parkers Crossroads, and state Sen. Jim Tracy, R-Shelbyville. The bill would allow government agencies to charge fees just to look at public documents. \nA similar bill introduced in 2011 would have resulted in citizens shelling out an estimated $1.7 million to agencies to review records they already own as Tennesseans, according to the Legislature's Fiscal Review Committee staff. The committee staff reported that this year's bill, if passed into law, \"will to some degree, discourage requests for open records inspections.\" \nThat is chilling for anyone who believes that democracy demands open and transparent government. \nAfter opposition from the Tennessee Press Association and the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government (the News Sentinel is a member of both organizations), the sponsors sent the bill to \"summer study.\" The Open Records Counsel is handling the public comments on the bill. \nA hearing will be held in Knoxville, 4-6 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 15, at 12 Oaks Executive Park, 5401 Kingston Pike, Building 2, Suite 350. Other hearings will be held in Nashville and Jackson on Sept. 16 and Sept. 17, respectively. \nCitizens and government entities can fill out surveys available at the Office of Open Records Counsel website: http://www.comptroller.tn.gov/openrecords/. \nThe Open Records Counsel is seeking comments particularly on whether charges should be permitted and, if so, how they should be determined and whether any records would be exempt. \nWe urge the public to answer that fees to peruse public records should not be allowed. Period. \nThe citizens of Tennessee, through their tax dollars, pay state agencies to create and maintain public records. The agencies are the custodians of the records, not the owners. The people are the owners, and should not be forced to pay to look at those records. \nNews organizations review public records more than other groups, but by no means would journalists be the only ones affected. Title companies research deeds on a daily basis, attorneys ask for records pertaining to their cases, a neighborhood organization might want to look at documents related to a nearby environmental incident. Building permits, marriage licenses, the minutes of public meetings, records pertaining to public grant recipients and volumes of other records could fall under the bill's shadow. Some are available online, but the vast majority are not. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 15 percent of Tennesseans lived in households without a computer, much less Internet access. \nIn short, this is a bill that would adversely affect every Tennessean in one way or another. The citizens of Tennessee should demand a transparent and responsive government. By speaking out at the Sept. 15 hearing or filing comments online, Tennesseans can assert their ownership rights over public records. \nOnline:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T23:59:22.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
