Rob Homer by Tim Dodd Over 70 per cent of people who complete a massive open online course (MOOC) say it has benefited their career and over 60 per cent say it has helped their education according to a new study.\n\"It appears that MOOCs are tangibly helping people who take the time and effort to complete courses,\" the authors of the study said in an article in Harvard Business Review .\nThe data comes from a survey of over 50,000 people who had completed a course with MOOC provider Coursera, which played a key role in the study.\nExamining the section of respondents who said their primary reason for doing a MOOC was career benefit, the study found that 85 per cent of them had experienced an intangible boost from completing a MOOC (such as enhanced skills or becoming a better candidate for another job). It also found that 33 per cent of them gained a tangible benefit from a MOOC (such as a new job, starting a business, a pay increase or a promotion).\nOf those who said that their primary reason for doing a MOOC was educational benefit, 87 per cent reported an intangible boost (such as gaining knowledge essential in their field or refreshing key concepts) while 18 per cent said there was tangible benefit (such as gaining academic credit or completing course prerequisites).\nThe study also found that people from low socio-economic backgrounds and developing countries, as well as those without a college education from developing countries, were more likely to report tangible career benefits from completing a MOOC.\nThe results help Coursera counter critics who focus on the fact that people who complete MOOCs are overwhelmingly likely to already have a degree, which means that MOOCs are not reaching many of the people who have no easy route into higher education.\nThree of the paper's six authors work at Coursera, including company president Daphne Koller, and two of the others have taught courses on Coursera.\n ", "external_links": ["https://hbr.org/2015/09/whos-benefiting-from-moocs-and-why"], "published": "2015-09-26T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T20:13:57.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
