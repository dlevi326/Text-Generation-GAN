By February 2015, the app which is free with no advertisements or in-app purchases, had been downloaded on more than 197,000 devices in 188 countries. It can be used with any type of toothbrush. \nThe study appeared in the British Dental Journal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:27:16.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
