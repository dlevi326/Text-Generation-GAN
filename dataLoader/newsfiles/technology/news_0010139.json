Bloomberg by Adam Satariano Apple has introduced a new iPhone, the most important product in its business, with a faster processor and new touch capabilities.\nThe new models, called iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which look like their predecessors that debuted last year, add an improved camera, speedier processor and a new feature called 3D Touch that lets users make different commands and reach shortcuts and menus by pressing down harder or softer on the screen. The handsets come in four colours - silver, gray, gold and rose gold.\n\"While they may look familiar, we have changed everything about these new iPhones.\" said chief executive officer Tim Cook, who succeeded Steve Jobs as Apple's CEO in 2011. \"They are the most advanced smartphones in the world.\"\nThe 3D Touch features serves as a shortcut for commonly used applications. Pressing down on the camera icon on the iPhone gives a quick entry point for taking a selfie. Pressing on an email will give a preview of a new message.\nThe iPhone generated $US31.4 billion in sales last quarter, making up 63 per cent of Apple's revenue.\nThe Cupertino, California-based company also unveiled a larger iPad targeted at business customers, updated its Apple Watch, which went on sale in April, and is showed off a revamped Apple TV set-top box. The September event is Apple's most anticipated annual gathering, and highlights the company's gadgets and services ahead of the holiday shopping season.\nThe new Apple TV, the first overhaul of the product since 2012, will cost $US149 and $US199, depending on memory, and will be available in October. In addition to offering a gateway to viewing online videos from services such as Netflix, Hulu and Time Warner's HBO, Apple is stepping up the device's capabilities with its own App Store. Developers will now be able to make games and other content for the set-top box, just as they have with iPhone and iPad. A new remote control for the device has a motion sensor and doubles as a game controller.\nThe new product is part of Cook's push to have a device for almost every moment of a person's digital life. From fitness and health monitoring on the wrist, to communications and productivity via phones, computers and tablets, to entertainment in the living room, Apple has been steadily expanding its lineup as Cook chases new markets for growth.\n As for the new iPad Pro, it is faster than 80 per cent of the personal computers shipped in the past 12 months and has 10 hours of battery life, the company said. The new iPad Pro has many characteristics of Microsoft's Surface tablet, including a case that doubles as a keyboard. Apple also introduced a stylus for the device, called Apple Pencil.\nThe iPad Pro costs $US799 for a 32 gigabytes of memory, $US949 for 64 gigabytes and $US1079 for 128 gigabytes. The Apple Pencil costs $US99, while the keyboard cover will retail for $US169. These products will be available in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:27:05.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
