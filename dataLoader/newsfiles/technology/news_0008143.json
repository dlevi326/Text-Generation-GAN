The Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) is an open source distributed application framework that enables developers and organizations to rapidly build and deploy solutions spanning across Cassandra and Hadoop. \nWith CDAP 3.2, organizations can now easily create both batch and real-time ETL pipelines with Cassandra through CDAP. Using the recently released Cask Hydrator user interface on CDAP, DataStax Enterprise and Cassandra users will be able to quickly and easily create data lakes without writing code. \nMoving forward, the CDAP roadmap will support rapid development of real-time data applications on DataStax Enterprise (DSE), the leading database platform purpose-built for the performance and availability demands for IoT, web and mobile applications. The first phase includes CDAP's direct support for Cassandra Datasets, providing the usability of CDAP Dataset libraries for Cassandra users and the flexibility for CDAP applications to run against both Apache HBase and Apache Cassandra. The second phase includes integration of Cassandra with CDAP's open source transaction engine, Tephra. This will provide scale-out, fault-tolerant, high-throughput transactions on Cassandra and will allow any application developed on CDAP for HBase to be run on Cassandra without changing any code. \n\"As the use cases for big data continue to expand, and the ecosystem continues to grow, the need for higher-level development frameworks is becoming a necessity,\" said Matt Pfeil, Chief Customer Officer and co-founder, DataStax. \"We are looking forward to our users building data applications faster on Cassandra using CDAP.\" \n\"By extending our platform to integrate with Cassandra, we will enable a broader set of use cases and allow our customers to have more choices,\" said Jonathan Gray, CEO and Co-founder of Cask. \"Our solution will also bridge the critical gap of governing and operationalizing data between Cassandra and Hadoop.\" \nAbout Cask Cask ( www.cask.co ) is an open source big data software company focused on developers. Cask's flagship offering, the Cask Data Application Platform, makes it possible to quickly and easily develop and deploy more powerful applications for Cassandra and Hadoop.
