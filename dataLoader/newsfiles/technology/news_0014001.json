For Kinshasa, such was the price to pay for peace.\nMilitary integration for former foes became a recipe for easing tensions in the wake of the Second Congo War (1998-2003), when foreign armies and Congolese rebels battled the regime of ex-rebel Laurent-Desire Kabila, who ousted long-time dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997.", "external_links": ["http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=8133", "http://whoswho.co.za/joseph-kabila-8133"], "published": "2015-09-22T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:18:34.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
