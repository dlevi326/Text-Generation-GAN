Speaking at an event at Facebook's Menlo Park, California , headquarters that was streamed live online, Zuckerberg acknowledged that \"like\" isn't always appropriate for some posts — about a tragic news event, for example — when people might want to express empathy. Zuckerberg said the company, however, has veered away from making a \"dislike\" button, which could be used to vote down other people's posts. He said the new button is ready to be tested soon and could be rolled out broadly depending on how it does. ———", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T03:19:42.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
