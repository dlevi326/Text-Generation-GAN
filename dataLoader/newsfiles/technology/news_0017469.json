I think that's one of the reasons for their success.\" \n'Under-appreciated art form' \nVintage editions still make up only a tiny part of the world videogames market—estimated to be worth more than $90 billion and growing fast—but avid collectors will pay huge sums for specialist items. Customers check used videogame consoles and software, at a shop 'Super Potato' in Tokyo \nPrices for rare classics have soared, with one example of the Nintendo World Championships cartridge selling for around $100,000 last year, according to its eBay listing. \nTheir value depends on rarity, condition and popularity. Experts say fans particularly like games that are part of a series, such as The Legend of Zelda and Japanese role-playing games like Final Fantasy and DragonQuest. \nFor some, they are an artform—even New York's Museum of Modern Art started collecting older video games in 2012 and plans to acquire dozens of titles in the coming years. \nPatrick, a 27-year-old graphic designer from Australia, said he has built up a collection of around 1,000 games. \n\"To me games are an under-appreciated art form,\" he told AFP inside the Super Potato shop. \"With a lot of the old games you have to use your imagination, which I think is really cool.\" \nFor others, they bring back memories of the excitement of playing for the first time. \n\"I remember playing my brother's ZX Spectrum and not even really knowing what it was,\" said Matt, who was around 10 when videogames started becoming popular. \n\"You'd go to your friend's house and play—now people just sit at home on the Internet. It's not the same.\" \nChildhood nostalgia \nClay Routledge, an associate professor at the North Dakota State University and an expert on the psychology of nostalgia, said old videogames can be a particularly potent trigger because they are interactive. Vintage editions still make up only a tiny part of the world videogames market, estimated to be worth more than $90 billion and growing fast, but avid collectors will pay huge sums for specialist items \n\"Often, nostalgia is not about the specific game but about the social experiences involving that game,\" he said. \"The games we played in our youth would likely elicit the greatest amount of nostalgia.\" \nThis has not been lost on videogame makers, who have started offering revamped versions of vintage games in their online stores, such as Nintendo's Super Mario 3: Mario Forever. \nOthers are also including access to older games in new products. At the Tokyo Game Show in September Sony said its new streaming service, PlayStation Now, will allow customers to play games released years ago, such as God of War. \nIn June, Microsoft also announced it would be offering \"backward compatibility\" for hit older titles including Borderlands on its new-generation Xbox One consoles. \nThis cuts the cost of producing new games and reduces the danger no one will buy them, said Lisa Hanson, managing partner of gaming market research firm Niko Partners. For die-hard fans, spending hours investigating obscure old games is part of the fun, but experts warn off anyone who thinks collecting vintage games could be a get-rich-quick strategy \n\"It short-cuts the marketing process and there is a ready group of gamers waiting to play,\" she said. \nFor die-hard fans, spending hours investigating obscure old games is part of the fun, but experts warn off anyone who thinks collecting vintage games could be a get-rich-quick strategy. \n\"You need a lot of knowledge... to make it viable,\" said Jason Moore, whose online store claims to have the largest catalogue in the world with some 40,000 games. \n\"For every rare game , there are thousands which are virtually impossible to sell and knowing small differences like label variations and box types is vital if you're going to do well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:23:00.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
