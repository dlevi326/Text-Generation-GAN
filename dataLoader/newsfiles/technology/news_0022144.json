In fact, the MacBook Air could very well be the most beautiful laptop you can own. On the outside, its aluminum unibody design looks modern and minimalist.

It’s light enough that it’s barely noticeable in your bag -- but it's robust enough that you don’t feel like it’s going to break when you use it. Overall, this laptop sends an unequivocal message: the MacBook Air is an engineering feat – one that cannot be copied nor eclipsed.
