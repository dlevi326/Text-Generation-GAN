All three come with top-shelf specs and powerful new cameras, but have a few tricks up their individual sleeves.\nThe Z5 has a 5.2-inch, 1080p screen and a waterproof body made from aluminum and frosted glass, but the camera is what Sony's most proud of. It's 23 megapixels, with a super-fast new autofocus engine and improved low-light performance.\nThe Z5 Premium comes in shiny chrome. Good luck keeping that smudge-free, though. Sony Mobile If you want to go all out on imagery, though, check out the Z5 Premium . This is the first phone with a full 4K display (that's 806 PPI, for those keeping score) and the ability to shoot 4K video — though you can bet the competition will waste no time catching up. Of course, although 5.5 inches is a lot for a smartphone, it's not much to view such high-resolution content with, so you'll want to connect this thing to a bigger display to get the full effect.\nadvertisement Both phones sound a little big? The Z5 Compact takes the specs of the Z5 and puts it in a petite package. The 4.6-inch, 720p screen won't wow your friends, but it will fit easily in your pocket — a rare feature in these phablet-loving days. No metal construction for the Compact, alas, but it does retain its big brother's waterproofing.\nNo pricing or availability for the Z5 series just yet, but expect more on that front in October.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://nbcnews.to/1JMXchn", "http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/phones/xperia-z5-premium/", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://nbcnews.to/1JMXchn", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1203906/z5family_d4a0ee8eb7ee0adb4e7d8c046ed3a62c.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg", "http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/phones/xperia-z5/", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1203906/z5family_d4a0ee8eb7ee0adb4e7d8c046ed3a62c.nbcnews-ux-600-480.jpg", "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1203911/chrome_f0158c7485655f99b76d4631d7fbbdf9.nbcnews-ux-320-320.jpg", "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1203911/chrome_f0158c7485655f99b76d4631d7fbbdf9.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/phones/xperia-z5-compact/", "http://www.newsvine.com/_api/discuss?u=http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/mobile/sonys-z5-smartphone-series-revamps-cameras-goes-4k-n420496&h=Sony&#x27;s", "http://blogs.sonymobile.com/press_release/sony-unveils-xperia-z5-series/", "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1203911/chrome_f0158c7485655f99b76d4631d7fbbdf9.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1203906/z5family_d4a0ee8eb7ee0adb4e7d8c046ed3a62c.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "http://nbcnews.to/1JMXchn&via=nbcnews", "https://twitter.com/share?text=Sony&#x27;s"], "published": "2015-09-02T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T00:27:05.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
