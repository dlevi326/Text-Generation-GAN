GoPro's stock has dropped 25 percent in the last three months, compared to a 9 percent drop in the S&P 500 in that time. But it is still about 80 percent above its IPO price of $24 last October. Ambarella, which makes semiconductors for wearable, flying and sports cameras, is GoPro's largest supplier, according to FactSet. Ambarella posted better than expected second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, but said that revenue from wearable cameras in the next quarter would be down both sequentially and compared to last year. The company's stock (NASDAQ:AMBA) was down about 14 percent to around $77 in early Wall Street trading on Wednesday. \nGet Silicon Valley  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:18:19.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
