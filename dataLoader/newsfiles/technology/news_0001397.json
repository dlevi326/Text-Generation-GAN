For the first time ever, users will be able to browse and buy tickets to top shows in California’s Bay Area via the TodayTix app. \nSince launching in December 2013 in New York City and expanding to London’s West End in June of this year, TodayTix already accounts for up to 10 percent of ticket sales for many of the hottest shows on Broadway and has saved customers over $6 million on tickets to date. Now, by expanding to the West Coast, users will be able to buy theater tickets on their smartphones to top shows out West, such as “Between Riverside and Crazy” at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. \n“The U.S. theater market is a $12.3 billion dollar industry but despite this, just two years ago, there was simply no way to easily purchase theater tickets on your mobile phone,” said CEO and Co-Founder, Merritt Baer. “What many people don’t realize is that San Francisco is the third-largest theater market in the U.S., and by expanding to the West Coast, TodayTix will further push the digital transformation of the industry to make theater more affordable and accessible to all.” \nIn the theater industry that has been reluctant to adopt mobile technology, TodayTix is revolutionizing the status quo with its streamlined, easy-to-use, curated mobile-only approach to buying tickets. Users can select and purchase theater tickets in just 30 seconds or less, one week to one hour before show time. The company has quickly garnered more than 650,000 users in just two markets and launched the industry’s first mobile lotteries on Broadway and in the West End, offering steep discounts to the hottest shows while handling three to five thousand entries per day. TodayTix has grown over 400% over the same period since last year. \nWith a user base that attends more theater shows annually and is 12 years younger than the average theatergoer, TodayTix has successfully introduced a new, engaged and tech-savvy audience to the theater industry. Paving the way for the modernization of theater ticketing with this audience and industry-first offerings, the company has firmly established itself as the go-to destination for both locals and travelers in the world’s leading iconic theater districts by building strategic partnerships with the most influential theaters and production companies in the industry. \n“The Millennial subset of our population is more tech-focused and mobile-centric than any other age group,” said Co-Founder and Chairman, Brian Fenty. “It’s no surprise that a mobile theater ticketing experience makes it that much easier for Broadway to catch the attention of what is arguably today’s most influential generation.” \nTodayTix will continue its expansion into additional national markets later this fall. Depending on the production, with the TodayTix app users can get their tickets electronically, through box office pick-up or hand-delivered at the theater 30 minutes before show time by a uniformed TodayTix agent. The app is available for download free of charge for iOS and Android devices via the Apple Store and Google Play , as well as via the Amazon Appstore for Amazon Kindle and Fire Phone devices. \nAbout TodayTix \nTodayTix is the first and only free mobile app for iOS and Android that provides access to the best prices on last-minute theater tickets, booked same-day or within a week’s time. Operating in the world’s most iconic theater markets, TodayTix secures the best discounted and full price tickets available for more than 40 Broadway and Off-Broadway shows in New York City and more than 40 of the hottest shows in London’s West End. \nTodayTix aims to make theater a readily-available and exciting option for everyone. Through its personalized, intuitive and easy-to-use service, TodayTix delivers an efficient, affordable and reliable user experience for aspiring theatergoers. \nLife-long friends and former Broadway producers Merritt Baer and Brian Fenty launched TodayTix in New York City in December 2013. The company has partnerships with many New York institutions, including The Public Theater, Roundabout Theatre Company, Blue Man Group, Stomp, St. Ann’s Warehouse, MSG Entertainment, Atlantic Theater Company, and more. The TodayTix app launched in London’s West End in June.
