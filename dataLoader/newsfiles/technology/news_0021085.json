Established in the 1940s to fulfil Ras Tanura refinery's analytical requirements the lab is manned around the clock to provide technical support for other labs. \nThe lab is equipped with all required automated analytical instruments to conduct various analyses related to the oil industry along with global scientific merit and practical experience for its staff. The Ras Tanura lab is a reliable center for quality analysis a training center for other companies a museum for learners and instructors as well as a mirror that reflects the performance of refineries and oil production in the Kingdom. \nThe continued development of the Ras Tanura laboratory staff and its keeping up with modern technologies in automated analysis devices reflects an excellent picture of the performance of production plants in Ras Tanura refinery. \nOn the importance of such lab analysis in the oil industry Khaled Al-Ghamdi a senior lab expert in Ras Tanura said: 'Crude oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbon compounds metals and non-metallic elements. The process of refining crude oil through the use of the distillation tower produces gases such as cooking gas and other derivatives such as naphtha gasoline diesel kerosene and bitumen.' \n'Here lies the importance of analysis of samples as crude oil and its derivatives must be subject to laboratory tests to determine its chemical and physical properties. Depending on these results laboratory engineers can estimate the performance of refineries and estimate the market value of the product' Al-Ghamdi said. \nAl-Ghamdi said: 'Because of its precise analysis the RT lab has obtained global quality accreditations including ISO 17025 for artistic merit in laboratory tests and standards as well as the Occupational Safety & Health Management System Certification (OSHAS18001). In addition the Ras Tanura laboratory has also received many safety awards from the senior management of Saudi Aramco.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:11:06.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
