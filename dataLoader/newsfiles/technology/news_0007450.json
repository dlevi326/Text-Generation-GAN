The LA award reflects T2C’s commitment to mentoring, career opportunity and work-life balance.\n\"This is the second year in a row we have been featured in Modern Healthcare's list of top consulting firms,\" said Gregory Anderson, Senior Partner at T2C. \"This recognition underscores the close personal attention we give all of our clients, our thought leadership in the healthcare industry and the fact that major healthcare organizations trust us to drive positive results and provide new direction as the industry continues its rapid change.\" With this new award, T2C gains recognition that broadens what its existing clients already know about their professionalism, and what the staff has long known about their corporate culture.\n“We have impressive provider contracts, and significant revenue growth measured by Modern Healthcare, and we’re delighted by the award that reflects that growth,” Armstrong said. “But the reason for that success is our people, and the emphasis we place on quality in community.”\nInformation about the Modern Healthcare award is available on the magazine website.\nAbout Top Tier Consulting\nTop Tier Consulting is a premier healthcare management consulting firm that provides world class consulting for major healthcare organizations.
