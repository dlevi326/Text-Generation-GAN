Michael F. Benard/Special to The Plain Dealer CLEVELAND, Ohio â€“ The corrosive properties of road salt are apparent all around us, illustrated by the number of rusty automobiles rumbling by with noisy and leaky exhaust systems.\nLess is known, however, about the harm caused by road salt to the environment and the vulnerable and delicate wildlife that inhabits our surroundings.\nA team of biologists from Case Western Reserve University suspected millions of tons of salt dumped each winter on our roadways couldn't possibly be good for ponds and wetlands, and they launched a research project to find out the extent of the harm.\nTheir test subject was a common amphibian, about two inches long, found throughout woodlands in Northeast Ohio: the wood frog.\nWhat they found surprised them. Salt-and-snow run-off flowing into breeding ponds and wetlands during the spring mating season actually produced larger wood frog tadpoles, and subsequently larger mature frogs, according to the research team's findings.\nBut the wood frogs from salt-contaminated breeding pools had lower survival rates than adult wood frogs produced from non-contaminated wetlands, the researchers found.\n\"This study really shows that you need to look across multiple life stages to get a good look at what environmental pollutants are doing,\" said Kacey Dananay, a doctoral student at CWRU.\nDananay worked with CWRU Biology Professor Michael Benard, Katherine Krynak, a recent PhD recipient at CWRU, and Tim Krynak, project manager for natural resources at the Cleveland MetroParks. Their findings are published in the journal Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry :\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/etc.3082/abstract\nPrevious laboratory studies had contradictory results, finding that exposure to salt reduced the size of tadpoles, Benard said. He and his research team wondered what would happen when the frogs were exposed to salt in their natural habitat.\nThe researchers sampled 30 wetlands on public and private property to determine where the wood frogs were present, their abundance and size, and whether their developmental stages were affected by road salt contamination.\nThey collected up to 30 frogs in nets, took measurements, then performed statistical analyses based on the level of road salt contamination in the water, and compared the abundance of wood frogs and their sizes.\nIntrigued by their findings, the researchers conducted additional experiments at artificial ponds at CWRU's Squire Valleevue and Valley Ridge farms. Wood frog tadpoles were introduced to ponds with clean water and compared to tadpoles raised in ponds with different concentrations of road salt. The tadpoles raised in salty water grew larger than the tadpoles in the clean water.\nJuvenile frogs were placed in pens of varying numbers. In the low-concentration pens, the frogs exposed to salt had significantly lower survival rates than the frogs from clean water.\nDananay studied the environmental effects of road salt while she was a graduate student at Penn State University. She knew the damage salt can cause, and suspected it was not limited to wood frogs.\n\"I would think a lot of the amphibians breeding in these ponds would be affected in some way,\" she said. \"But we're unsure whether they would be affected the same way.\"\nFuture studies could explore the physiological causes of the lower survival rates of salt-exposed frogs, Benard said.\n\"We know the frogs are dying,\" Benard said. \"We need to figure out the mechanism of why they are dying.\"\nIn the long run, Dananay said she hopes her research leads to environmental improvements in treating snowy and icy roads.\n\"I think it would be great if we could at least reduce the amount of salt that's put on the roads, or that we could deal with snow and ice more effectively.\"\nAlternative road treatments include sand, cinders and beet juice, she said.", "external_links": ["http://www.ohioamphibians.com/frogs/wood_frog.html", "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/etc.3082/abstract"], "published": "2015-08-18T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:12:58.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
