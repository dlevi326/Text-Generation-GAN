And, apparently, there's a fast and a slow way of doing that.\nThe slow way would involve gradually building up greenhouse gases inside the Martian atmosphere.\n\"The fast way is drop thermonuclear weapons over the poles,\" Musk said on CBS\" Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\nGetty The Red Planet: Mars has surface features similar to the craters of the Moon and the volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth\nThe Red Planet has been the focus of Musk's attention for some time and he has admitted he would like to go there.\nHowever, Mars' average temperature is -62°C and the atmosphere is currently less than 1% oxygen - meaning a spacesuit would have to be worn constantly.\nAround 40% of the energy released from a nuclear bomb is heat - so there would be plenty to help warm up the desolate planet.\nGetty Elon Musk believes dropping nukes on Mars is a quick way to heat it up\nWhile dropping nukes on Mars is probably ill-advised, the planet does suffer from explosive meteor impacts.\nBack in March, Mars-watchers spotted what looked like a nuclear mushroom cloud on the surface of the planet - something that could have been caused by one of these impacts.\n\"Mushroom clouds can form naturally from impact craters or volcanic explosions,\" said Peter Muller, the head of the Imaging Group at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory and a professor in the Department of Space and Climate Physics at University College London.\nUFOvni Disclosure\n\"There is no known volcanic activity on Mars so it is most likely to be the result of a meteoritic impact,\" Professor Muller told Mirror Tech.\n\"There are some 20 of these every year that smack into Mars but usually the meteorites are only a few tens of centimetres in size.\"\nVideo loading\nPoll loading …\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/v1/unsecured/media/4221396001/201509/119/4221396001_4477499901001_space.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-09-11T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T19:14:34.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
