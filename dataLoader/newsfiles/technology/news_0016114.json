Applied Math Modeling Inc., a leading provider of the data center design optimization software CoolSim, performed the detailed analysis using the ANSYS set of CFD modeling tools. The analysis was done over a period of 6 months and conclusions from the analysis were confirmed by laboratory testing.\nPaul Bemis, the President and CEO of Applied Math Modeling said: “We used the ANSYS set of CFD modeling tools due to their high fidelity meshing and solver capability to model the exact geometry of the Triad ICE Airflow panel and compared its performance to an industry standard generic perforated tile. The claims made by Triad about the superior performance of the Triad Ice Airflow Panel have been confirmed by these CFD studies. The unique geometry used in the Triad tile has a significant impact on rack cooling.”\nApplied Math Modeling is the supplier of the CoolSim data center CFD modeling software, which uses the ANSYS CFD technologies to provide high fidelity results.\nSubstantiated Claims of the Triad ICE Airflow Panel Include:\n1. Triad ICE Airflow Panel delivers 2-3 times more volume than industry standard airflow panels:\nValidated: Total flowrate was predicted to be more than 2x using the Triad ICE Airflow Panel using well accepted CFD modeling techniques.\n2. Positive flow coming from all sections of the Triad Airflow Panel, with little or no recirculation. (eliminating disruptive flat bottom panel flow shown above)\nValidated: CFD results showed no air recirculation across the entire Triad Airflow Panel\n3. The Triad ICE Airflow Panel delivers a very good level of air stratification\nValidated: CFD results show positive momentum of the Triad ICE Airflow panel over the entire height of the equipment rack.\n4. Superior cooling due to a higher directional flow angle to the rack\nValidated : CFD results showed a 50% greater directional flow angle of incidence towards the equipment rack, thereby improving rack cooling significantly.\nGary Meyer, President and CEO of Triad stated: “We are pleased to see the significant benefits being seen in Live Data Center testing by multiple end users around the world now be proven using analytical CFD modeling tools from Applied Math Modeling. Triad has attempted for the past 12 years to get CFD modelers to accurately model difference of Triad design over industry flat bottom airflow panel designs. Applied Math has the fidelity to now accurately capture the unique geometry on the Triad ICE Airflow panel, and that patented geometry is why Triad provides more efficient Heat Transfer over all other airflow panel designs.” Bemis added: “The use of body fitted meshing technology provided by our access to the ANSYS set of Computer Aided Engineering tools is what provided us the ability to capture the fine detailed design in the Triad Airflow Panel. This is the same meshing technology used in our CoolSim product and has helped to distinguish CoolSim as a market leader.  \nAbout Triad Floors Inc.\nTriad Raised Floor Company was founded in 2003. In response to the industry's need for an efficient cooling panel that would fit into any existing or new raised access floor system, the Triad \"River Cooling©\" Airflow Panels were designed. This innovative design passively increases Heat Transfer through the server. Typically 1 Triad panel provides cooling to 3 server racks, cutting down the quantity of airflow panels needed by flat bottom designs by 33-66%. Triad guarantees they can fit any raised floor system design without modification to raised floor system. Triad airflow panels deliver 2-3 times more CFM than the industry standard 25% airflow panels.\nTriad is proudly MADE in the USA. Global Distribution network provides rapid response and support anywhere in the world.\nVisit www.TriadAirflow.com or CoolSim at www.coolsimsoftware.com for more information", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T07:54:33.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
