She has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder in the deaths of three patients.\nThe 45-year-old could face life in prison if convicted.\nTseng is among only a handful of doctors nationwide to be charged with murder related to prescription drugs.\nHer trial is expected to take months.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/52/11/8561266/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/52/11/8561266/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/52/11/8561268/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/52/11/8561268/15/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-01T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T02:52:24.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
