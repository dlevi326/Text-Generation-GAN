The project is the first transportation project to receive an ISI Envision-verified sustainable infrastructure rating system award. \nThe Low Level Road project involved the realignment and elevation of approximately 2.6 kilometres of the Low Level Road in North Vancouver, B.C., providing space for two new rail tracks.\nThe project also eliminated three existing road and rail crossings and provided direct access to major port terminals. In addition, the project addressed safety, recreation and noise challenges associated with port operations along the Low Level Road, including the reconfiguration of three intersections and improved lanes for cyclists.\nThe project was designed to enhance rail and port operations as international trade continues to grow, and to address long-standing community safety and traffic congestion challenges in the area.\nWilliam Bertera, CEO and President of ISI, said: “Port Metro Vancouver’s realigned Low Level Road project improves community mobility, enhances the availability of active transportation options, improves community safety and mitigates threats from unstable slopes and seismic risks. The road project’s design team also contributed to sustainable infrastructure through economic development and stability in the local community.”\nRobin Silvester, President and CEO of Port Metro Vancouver, said: “The Low Level Road project has increased trade opportunities for Canada while providing safety, traffic flow and recreational benefits to the local community.”\nFact File: ISI’s Envision rating system measures sustainable infrastructure projects through the measurement of five categories: quality of life, leadership, natural world, resource allocation, and climate and risk. These contribute to overall credits for the positive social, economic, and environmental impacts in a community in the planning, design, and construction of infrastructure projects. \nFor all the latest on the Port Metro Vancouver, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:08:45.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
