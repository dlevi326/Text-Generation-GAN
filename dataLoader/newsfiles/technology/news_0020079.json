In turn, in April LVMH appointed Hector Muelas, former creative director of worldwide marketing communications for Apple, as DKNY’s chief image officer. Intel has signed a multiyear deal with Luxottica to team up on smart products, as well as with the Fossil Group and TAG Heuer, an LVMH brand. Mr. Rogers was at Yahoo and the music marketing company Topspin before joining Beats, which Apple bought last year for $3 billion. While still in college in the 1990s, Mr. Rogers was hired to run the Beastie Boys’ website, and among his many tattoos is the logo of NeXT, the computer company that Steve Jobs started after leaving Apple in the 1980s. Apple Music, which like Spotify and Rhapsody offers streaming music by subscription, arrived in late June and has had a mixed response. In early August, the company said that 11 million people had signed up for it during free trial periods, which last 90 days. When asked why he was leaving Apple for a business unrelated to music, Mr. Rogers wrote in an email: “I asked my wife the night of the Apple Music announcement: Was that the starting gun or the finish line for me in the digital music race? I decided I’m ready for a new challenge both professionally and personally. I have more to learn and contribute.” \nVanessa Friedman contributed reporting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:31:18.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
