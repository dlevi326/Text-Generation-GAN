Results show Gridstore has the lowest price-per-VM for a standard VM profile, but also lowest price-per-usable-storage over the other vendors while delivering an all-flash solution. Value Prism concludes Gridstore \"offers breakthrough density, economics, and price-to-performance\" over the competition. \nValue Prism Consulting, a valuation and management consulting firm headquartered in Seattle, WA, conducted an analysis of leading converged system vendors and hyper-converged vendor Gridstore using publicly-available price and specification information. Full rack appliances for each vendor were compared and included not only appliance cost, but also installation, maintenance, and support costs. Since the amount of cores, memory, and usable storage was not the same across all the appliances, price-per-VM was used as a price/value approximation to compare between systems. Gridstore offered the best value beating the next vendor by 66% demonstrating the value of both hyper-converged infrastructure and the Gridstore solution. \nTweet this: @valueprism says @gridstore delivers BREAKTHROUGH density, economics, and price-to-performance vs other solutions http://bit.ly/1kVkLu8 \nBesides the best metrics in each category studied, Gridstore provides a highly dense environment that supports 4x to 17x more VMs in a single 42U full rack solution compared to the competitors. Since most customers won't initially deploy an entire rack, Value Prism also compared a smaller, four system configuration and determined, \"…that too (came in) at a 75% smaller footprint.\" This density not only saves space, power, and cooling, but contributes to simplified administration and reduction of costs. \n\"The all-flash Gridstore HyperConverged Solution produces breakthrough economics, both in terms of a competitively priced solution compared to the other vendor options and also the best price-to-performance on key metrics such as Price-per-VM,\" said Marek Omilian, Managing Director, Value Prism Consulting. \"All the better metrics demonstrated in a single rack versus the other named vendor alternates enable customers to run both intensive and mixed workloads easily.\" \nBased on Gridstore's Fast Track Reference Architecture for Microsoft Private Cloud, Value Prism found the Gridstore HyperConverged Appliance in a full rack configuration when compared to competitive converged solutions offered: Price-per-VM: Gridstore is 3x to 6x less than either VCE Vblock, HP CS700, or IBM PureFlex Price-per-system core: Gridstore is 21% to 37% less Price-per-system-memory: Gridstore is up to 80% less Price-per-usable storage: Gridstore is up to 84% less \n\"It's gratifying to have an independent firm validate Gridstore's value and price-to-performance for customers,\" said Kelly Murphy, Founder and CTO, Gridstore, \"Our HyperConverged Infrastructure is not only a much better solution than the legacy converged systems, beating them out on every metric measured, but its all-flash storage delivers great performance and is extremely reliable, providing lasting value to every data center.\" \nRead the full report: http://www.gridstore.com/resource/analyst-reports/", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:54:06.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
