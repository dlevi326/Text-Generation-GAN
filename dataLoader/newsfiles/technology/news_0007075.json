Android Pay goes live in USA Article By: Hadlee Simons Fri, 11 Sep 2015 1:12 PM Share The Galaxy S6. Credit: Hadlee Simons \nGoogle's payment solution for Android has gone live across the USA this week. \nAndroid Pay allows users to tap their phone against a payment point to pay for goods and services, following in the footsteps of Apple Pay. \n\"With Android Pay, you can simply unlock your phone like you normally do, place it near a merchant's contactless terminal, and you're good to go,\" Google said on its Android blog. \n\"Android Pay does all the heavy lifting. You don't even need to open an app - just tap and go. You'll also see a payment confirmation and get transaction details right on your phone.\" \nGoogle says your loyalty programmes and special offers will automatically be applied too at checkout. \n\"Making an online purchase? The days of entering your credit card and shipping address each time you make a purchase online will be a thing of the past. Just select “Buy with Android Pay” and leave the rest to us; checkout is as fast as a tap.\" \nAndroid Pay will be accepted at over 70 000 locations across the USA, including McDonalds, Best Buy, Gamestop, Dunkin Donuts and Subway. \nThe payment platform will also be going live in more than 1000 apps, including Etsy, Groupon and Uber.
