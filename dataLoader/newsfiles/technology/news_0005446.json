In fulfilling that vision, his primary objective was to achieve his customer’s goals and to push the capabilities of CD-adapco’s software products beyond the merely possible.\nMacDonald’s unfailing commitment to recruit the best and brightest engineers leaves CD-adapco with the talent necessary to maintain its strong worldwide support organization and its leading industry position.\nAlthough the company is mourning his passing, MacDonald’s legacy is alive in a healthy organization of talented and motivated individuals who are carrying forward his vision and continuing his customer-first business model.
