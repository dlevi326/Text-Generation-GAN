Turrisio Cybersecurity recently discovered the flaw, which gives cyberhackers the ability to obtain the personal information of Mileage Plus customers.\n“An attacker can get access to personal details such as email, phone number, flight details (origin, destination, date, time, seat) and even the boarding pass,” Yosi Dahan, co-founder and CEO of Turrisio Cybersecurity said.\nDahan sat down with Motherboard to discuss the security flaw in a recent interview.\nThere is no proof that hackers have actually gotten into the app and used this information, but Turrisio Cybersecurity wants to make users aware of the possible breach since United Airlines seems to be downplaying the discovery.\nTurrisio Cybersecurity finds that, with the flaw still in place, consumers could potentially lose money to hackers who call the airline with flight information to ask for credit card information to solidify their flight itineraries.\nMore information can be found at http://blog.turrisio.com/2015/08/hacking-united-airlines-mobile-app-api-to-reveal-passengers-info/.\nAbout Turrisio Cybersecurity Ltd.\nTurrisio Cybersecurity offers premier mobile application security to protect companies and users from malicious cyberattacks.\nContact\nTurrisio Cybersecurity Ltd.\nE-mail:\nWebsite: http://turrisio.com/\n ###", "external_links": ["http://blog.turrisio.com/2015/08/hacking-united-airlines-mobile-app-api-to-reveal-passengers-info/.", "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/united-airlines-frequent-flyer-app-can-be-hacked-to-reveal-passenger-info", "http://turrisio.com/"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T10:36:31.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
