Researchers at Purdue University have invented a new tool called Hush, which may solve your problem. \nThe tool, available as an experimental sofware through GitHub, for Android phones works by killing apps that run in the background while your phone is asleep. \nIts big idea: it prioritises the apps you use a lot and stops apps that you rarely use, by suppressing their background app activities when the screen is off. \nFor instance for a heavy Facebooker, who doesn't tweet much, the tool will let Facebook update, but suppress Twitter. This way, the researchers say they can save you upto 16 per cent of battery. \n\"Being able to reduce the total daily energy drain by about 16 percent is rather significant because you can extend the battery charge by one-sixth,\" said Y. Charlie Hu, a Purdue professor of electrical and computer engineering. \nThe tool came out of a large-scale study of 2,000 Samsung Galaxy S3 and S4 phones users, served by 191 mobile operators in 61 countries. \nAccording to Hu, this was the first-ever \"in-the-wild\" study of smartphone battery use and discovered the bug that causes apps to drain your Android battery. \n\"The big picture is that we want to double the battery life for smartphones,\" Hu said. To do this, his team plans to look at other battery-drainers that are required for your phone's maintenance purposes such as WiFi beacons that ping signals every 200 milliseconds. \nHush is currently only available to developers , but both Apple and Google are already implementing \"low-power\" modes in their most recent mobile operating systems, so it Hush could very well be integrated into one of those tools.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:01:45.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
