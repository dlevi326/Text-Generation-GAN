Pacific National, one of Australia’s largest rail companies, has ordered 21 Hyster Reach Stackers, five masted container handlers and five heavy duty forklifts, with two boasting 105,000 pounds of lifting capacity and three with 45,000 pounds of lifting capacity.\nHyster, along with one of its dealers, Adaptalift, worked with Pacific National to evaluate each site across Australia, where the trucks would be deployed in rail terminals moving containers, trailers and steel coils.\nJan-Willem van den Brand, Manager of the Big Truck Application Center for Hyster, said: “A good analysis of each site’s application, together with the detailed tender document, allowed us to provide tailored solutions for each site, meeting Pacific National’s diverse requirements. The tender focused on total cost of ownership, ergonomics and safety.”\nAndrew Adam, General Manager of National Intermodal for Pacific National, said: “With system and option enhancements on the equipment, Pacific National was seeking to achieve safety, customer and performance benefits in line with its company values. While at Hyster’s factory in Nijmegen, Pacific National staff witnessed first-hand the alignment of these company values that supported our safety motto – to ensure that operators, customers and all facility users return ‘home safely every day’.”\nHyster will provide customised Reach Stackers that allow operators to easily swap between a standard container spreader to a piggy-back spreader, enabling quick response to changing operational demands of loads and helping to optimise fleet usage.\nThe Hyster big trucks that will be deployed at Pacific National’s various Australian locations will feature modular designs helping to minimise the variation of parts needed to support the trucks, making servicing and operator training easier. All trucks will be fully serviced by Adaptalift Hyster, the nationwide dealer for Hyster in Australia.\nFact File: Hyster is a leading world-wide lift truck designer and manufacturer. It offers 130 lift-truck models configured for gasoline, LPG, diesel and electric power, with one of the widest capacity ranges in the industry – from 2,000 to 105,000 lbs.
