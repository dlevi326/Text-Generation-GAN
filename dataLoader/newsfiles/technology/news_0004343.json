Source: TheAustralian\nAustralia’s insatiable appetite for on-demand video services such as Netflix is driving massive growth on the nation’s broadband networks that could slow internet speeds because of increased ­congestion.\nIndustry sources say the “Netflix effect” has seen a doubling of broadband traffic over the nat­ion’s fixed-line networks since the popular streaming service and local competitors such as Stan and Presto launched in March.\nThe Australian understands that since the US-streaming giant had its local launch, streaming traffic has exploded on Telstra’s network and now accounts for as much as 15 per cent of the telco giant’s total consumer traffic.\nWhen other video appli­cations and services are added in, including YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, more than 50 per cent of traffic flowing over Telstra’s network is now considered video content.\nThe spurt in video consumption means Telstra is on track to grow its total fixed-broadband traffic by as much as 80 per cent this year.\nYesterday, Bill Morrow, the head of the company building the government’s $49 billion Nat­ional Broadband Network, said the introduction of streaming video services was driving massive growth on its network.\nSince the introduction of Netflix, the data consumption of an average NBN customer has ballooned from 78 gigabytes a month in March to 121GB in August.\nThat surge in data consumption represents an overall traffic increase of 55 per cent in six months.\n“We see video consumption driving the bulk, if not all, of the growth of what we have to run over the network,” Mr Morrow told attendees at the ASTRA 2015 conference in Sydney yesterday. The insatiable consumption of video traffic is also threatening to slow download speeds as video-on-demand services consume huge amounts of data through the supply of constant streaming of high-definition videos to TVs, laptops, tablets and smartphones.\nEarlier this year, scores of iiNet customers vented their frustration on social media as the launch of Netflix coincided with a drastic slowdown in their internet connection speeds. That slowdown came as iiNet’s internet traffic surged 25 per cent less than a month after the Netflix launch.\nTelstra has also been the subject of complaints on social media, with customers complaining of slow internet speeds when using streaming video services.\nThe slowdowns occur as hundreds of thousands of internet users flick on streaming video services in peak evening periods.\nThe nation’s largest telcos, including Optus and Telstra, are closely monitoring consumption of their networks and investing in additional capacity to handle the increased flows of data.\n“Video-on-demand is changing consumer behaviour. Since video streaming services launched in Australia, Optus customers are using more data and staying online for longer periods of time,” said an Optus spokeswoman.", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/09/1227520/116360-20a7feb4-56dd-11e5-9f97-acb83e2be6e0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-10T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T08:16:51.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
