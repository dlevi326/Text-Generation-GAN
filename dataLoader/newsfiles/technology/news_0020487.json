The firm’s adviser, UBS, is finalising details of staple financing packages accessible to suitors, with the offering designed to entice private equity firms to bid, according to The Australian Financial Review .\nFirst-round offers are due in around a fortnight, with Blackstone leading the list of likely private equity buyers. US-based Koch Industries , Finland’s Metso , Denmark’s FLSmidth , Brazil’s Gerdau and South Korea’s POSCO have been earmarked as potential trade buyers.\nAnother embattled local firm, Santos , is looking at asset sales of its own, with its two-thirds stake in WA oilfield Stag up for grabs. It is believed Santos has tapped Miro Advisers to run an auction and wants over $150 million for its slice of the project. Binding proposals from suitors such as Fosun , Carnarvon Petroleum and Vermillion Energy will be required in October, with the deal seen as the precursor to more significant action at the oil and gas giant.\nSeveral other assets could follow suit in the form of its WA gas portfolio and potentially a suite of Northern Territory assets that could draw bids around $2.5bn. A capital raising of around $1bn may be on the cards should it opt to retain the NT projects.\nMeanwhile, the local pubs sector could be in line for consolidation as Charter Hall and Woolworths’ hospitality division, ALH Group , weigh a play for Redcape Hotel Group .\nThe target’s hedge fund owners -- York Capital and Varde Partners -- have already tapped UBS and JPMorgan to test the waters on a $500m IPO and while this remains the preferred exit route, a $650m-plus offer from ALH and Charter Hall would surely put a trade sale in the frame.\nIn the IPO market, Brett Blundy’s Aventus Retail Property Fund is looking to raise $300m through an October 1 listing, the AFR reports. Blundy and Aventus chief Darren Holland are expected to retain 30 per cent of the fund upon listing, with their stakes placed under escrow. A bookbuild is slated for next Wednesday.\nElsewhere, the Geoff Wilson -backed Future Generation Global appears likely to be the biggest listed investment company to float since the GFC despite falling short of a $550m target. The raising will instead come in around $300m, ahead of Argo’s $286m infrastructure LIC from earlier this year.\nFinally, Bradken has confirmed the conclusion of an exclusive due diligence period with suitors Champ Private Equity and Sigdo Koppers , putting an end to near-term expectations for a merger with Sigdo subsidiary Magotteaux . The prospective buyers failed to put a bid forward, but were reportedly keen to extend the exclusivity period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:25:06.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
