The initiative includes the release of Zoomdata 2.0, featuring Zoomdata Fusion, which is now available via one-click deployments on leading cloud providers. The AnyCloud initiative also includes the launch of a new partner cloud enablement program that accelerates the creation of end-to-end big data solutions. Together, these innovations enable \"analytics anywhere\" -- the ability to access modern and traditional data, real-time and historical data, across data in the cloud and on-premise. \nThe typical enterprise today is dealing with a combination of big data, relational data, real-time and historical data -- that is deployed both on-premise, and across a combination of public and private clouds (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc.). Analytics using multiple data sources and structures has become the norm, and businesses are challenged to tap into their data assets without incurring significant engineering and infrastructure costs. \n\"The big data industry is seeing significant growth as enterprises start to realize value through big data analytics,\" said Tim Stevens, vice president, Business and Corporate Development at Cloudera. \"Zoomdata is a key player in the field and we are pleased to support the Zoomdata AnyCloud initiative. Integration with all components of Cloudera Enterprise, including Spark, Impala, and Search, Zoomdata will bring real-time and historical visual analysis of big data to non-technical business users at the speed of thought.\" \nTo support this new \"Analytics Anywhere\" requirement, Zoomdata has addressed the difficult challenge of delivering analytics as services that can literally be deployed anywhere: Enabling Cloud Deployments -- Through a series of joint development initiatives, Zoomdata has expanded the number of ways that Zoomdata can be deployed to major cloud offerings. Joining Zoomdata's public cloud partnerships on ClouderaLive on AWS , in the Databricks Cloud , and with Cisco to deliver Zoomdata on an Apache Mesos-based containerized architecture for Cisco Intercloud, today Zoomdata is announcing Zoomdata for Microsoft Azure and HDInsights. Bringing Speed to Big Data Analytics -- Zoomdata has developed patented data-sharpening and micro-query technologies to address the speed requirements for modern analytics. Where the most popular desktop BI tools impose unacceptable load and processing times for large queries, Zoomdata gives users sub-second response time on queries of even billions of rows of data. As organizations increasingly move their big data workloads to the cloud, Zoomdata AnyCloud delivers this level of analytic performance across the broadest range of cloud platforms. Data Fusion At the Application Layer -- With Zoomdata Fusion, businesses can analyze data from an increasing variety of data stores. Zoomdata's patented Smart Connectors can combine and analyze data from multiple sources without moving the data from the original sources. Users can leverage Fusion to enrich Big Data with lookup information from relational or flat file sources, to combine metrics from a new Big Data source with metrics from your existing enterprise data warehouse or to correlate real-time data feeds with historical data.

With the Zoomdata Partner Enablement Program, resellers, integrators and trainers now have access to the tools to help them deploy programs for their customers. The Program features Partner Support Packages that include different options for sales and technical support, test and development licenses, joint marketing, training and webinars that highlight best practices for deploying Zoomdata.
