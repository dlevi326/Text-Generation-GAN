Another hunter went alone after his closest friend, who was going to join him, died shortly before their date of departure from the United States.\nThe two retirees, who ended a 10-day hunt in August, operated separately in the dry winter scrub. They waited in concealed positions near watering holes or mineral licks for hours and, in adrenaline-fueled instances, killed wildlife with compound bows. By night, they dined on the meat of elands, impalas, warthogs and other animals in an African safari experience.\n\"I don't want to shoot animals that are young or that are of producing age. I'm looking for the older, more mature trophy animals,\" said 59-year-old Steve Schultz, a former law enforcement official from Park Falls, Wisconsin who chafed at negative views of hunters stemming from the July killing of a lion named Cecil that was lured out of a national park in Zimbabwe.\nThe \"trophy\" hunting industry in Africa has come under greater scrutiny since an American dentist shot Cecil, who wore a GPS collar and was being monitored by researchers, in an allegedly illegal hunt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T16:04:54.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
