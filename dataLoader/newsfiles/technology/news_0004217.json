(NYSE: MTX) announced today that it has signed another commercial agreement with a prestigious global paper producer to provide Fulfill(R) E-325, a high-filler technology, at the paper company's mill in North America. This is the second agreement for the deployment of the FulFill(R) technology at this paper mill.Minerals Technologies now has 22 agreements with paper mills for adoption of the Fulfill(R) high-filler technology portfolio that the company introduced in late 2010. The agreement with this papermaker, which wishes to remain unnamed for competitive reasons, marks MTI's eighth in North America. These agreements confirm the commercial progress of the Fulfill(R) brand, a portfolio of high-filler technologies that offers papermakers a variety of efficient, flexible solutions that decreases dependency on natural fiber and reduces costs. The Fulfill(R) portfolio allows papermakers to increase loading levels of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), which replaces higher cost pulp, and increases PCC usage up to 30 percent and higher. \"The second adoption of this technology by this global papermaker at this facility illustrates its continued acceptance and reaffirms our commitment to advance our technology leadership throughout our satellite network around the world,\" said Joseph C. Muscari, chairman and chief executive officer. \"Adopting the FulFill(R) E-325 technology will allow this prestigious paper to produce quality paper at lower cost by replacing higher-cost fiber with PCC from our satellite plant at this paper mill,\" said W. Rand Mendez, senior vice president & managing director, Paper PCC. PCC is a specialty pigment for filling and coating high-quality paper. By substituting Minerals Technologies' PCC for more expensive wood fiber, customers are able to produce brighter, higher quality paper at lower cost. In 1986, Minerals Technologies originated the satellite concept for making and delivering PCC on-site at paper mills and the concept was a major factor in revolutionizing papermaking in North America. Today, the company has 64 satellite plants in operation or under construction around the world and continues to lead the industry with consistent quality and technical innovation. New York-based Minerals Technologies Inc. is a resource- and technology-based growth company that develops, produces and markets worldwide a broad range of specialty mineral, mineral-based and synthetic mineral products and related systems and services. MTI serves the paper, foundry, steel, environmental, energy, polymer and consumer products industries. The company reported sales of $1.725 billion in 2014.
