See: As volatility soars, this obscure trading strategy draws Wall Street’s ire .\nIn his appearance on CNBC, Cooperman estimated around 75% of daily trading is unrelated to fundamental investing, but instead consists of high-frequency trading and “slicing and dicing” ETFs.\nCooperman isn’t alone in blaming risk-parity and other quantitative strategies for heightened market turmoil. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. strategist Marko Kolanovic last week estimated that traders using trend-following strategies and those using the risk-parity asset-balancing technique probably have to get rid of another $100 billion in stocks in the next three weeks, according to Bloomberg .\nThe turmoil is scaring retail investors out of the market, which threatens to raise the cost of capital for businesses, Cooperman said. Omega manages around $9 billion in assets and has generated compound annual returns of 14%, net of fees, since 1991, according to CNBC. While Cooperman has remained upbeat on the outlook for stocks by year-end, he said the rough trading weather has turned his world upside down.\n“In the world I grew up in, and the world Warren Buffett grew up in, when something went down you wanted to own more, and in the world that we’re in now, it goes up you want to own more and it goes down you want to own less, and that is just counter-intuitive,” he said. “It lacks common sense.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-03/quant-fire-only-half-out-to-jpmorgan-analyst-who-saw-turbulence", "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/08/risk-parity-trading-is-causing-volatility-and-scaring-the-public-leon-cooperman.html"], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:53:33.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
