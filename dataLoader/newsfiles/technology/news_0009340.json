Build A New Billion Dollar Company' Dotcom faces charges that include copyright infringement, racketeering and money laundering. He said he cannot be held responsible for people who used his file-sharing site for illegitimate purposes. Along with Dotcom, U.S. officials are also seeking to extradite three other Megaupload employees. They have all said they are not guilty and vowed to vigorously fight the charges. \nI'm going to court today. The question is innovator or pirate. The answer will be Internet freedom or censorship. — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) September 20, 2015 The tech giant -- who is known for his larger-than-life reputation and his towering stature -- was arrested in January 2012 during a raid on his lavish estate in Coatesville, New Zealand. Megaupload was shut down after the raid, Dotcom's fleet of fancy cars was seized and the mogul's bank accounts were frozen. \nThis case is not just about me. This case is about how much control we allow US corporations and the US government to have over the Internet — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) September 20, 2015 \nThe judges on this case can become the champions for billions of Internet users or a handful of US content billionaires. #Hope — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) September 20, 2015 Dotcom and his supporters believe his case could have a greater impact on Internet freedom and the relationship between content creators and Internet sites. Regardless of the outcome, both sides will be able to appeal, meaning the drama that has surrounded Dotcom is far from over. \nIt's totally uplifting to get so many good luck wishes from all over the Internet. One for all and all for one. #InternetFreedom — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) September 21, 2015 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:54:00.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
