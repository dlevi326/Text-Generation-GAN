The newspaper said Apple has set a \"ship date\" of 2019, although that could just be a target for engineers to sign off on the design — not when a car would be available for sale. Apple declined comment Monday on the report, which cited unnamed sources. In recent months, Apple Inc. has hired experts in automotive and battery technology.
