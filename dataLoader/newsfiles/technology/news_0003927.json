Feedstock, storage and handling facilities \nHanhikivi 1 is a planned nuclear power plant in Pyhäjoki in northern Finland. \nThe multi-fuel power plant is designed to operate using biomass, coal and recycled waste as its feedstock. \nBiomass, which will be used as the primary feedstock will comprise mainly woodchips, sourced either locally from a radius of approximately 100km to 150km around the plant site or shipped. The plant is expected to initially use approximately 700,000m³ of woodchips, which is expected to increase to 1.2m cubic metres. \nThe plant's biomass handling facility will comprise three reception lines, two screening lines, a 120m long storage building with a storage capacity of 15,000m³, and two reclaimers with a combined reclaiming capacity of 700m³ an hour. \nThe new coal handling facilities, with a combined capacity of 1,000m³, will be integrated with existing facilities. Electricity and heat generation at TSE's NA4 CHP plant \nA main component of the power plant is the boiler , which will be based on circulating fluidised bed technology, integrating multiple fuel supply lines. The fully automated facility can be remotely controlled. \nCirculating fluidised bed technology involves feeding fuel to a fluidising material bed comprised of sand, ash and limestone. Fluidising air is then passed, which rapidly mixes with the solid fuel / fuels, drying and burning any crushed material below the size of 50mm. \nThe plant emits very little nitrogen oxide due to operation under low temperature (below 900°C). CO2 emissions are low due to good mixing properties and limestone is injected into the furnace, which binds sulphur dioxide and enables the removal of sulphur in solid form. \nHigh-pressure heat and steam from the boiler are fed to the steam turbine, where a generator integrated to the turbine shaft converts them into electricity. Excess heat from the turbine is conveyed to district heat exchangers and condensed for district heating purposes, while the excess steam is distributed either for reuse by the power plant or supplied to industrial customers. Contractors involved with the new power plant at Naantali \nThe engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCM) contractor for the project is Pöyry. \nValmet is supplying the boiler for the power plant. The company was also contracted to supply its DNA automation and safety interlocking systems for the plant. \nSiemens is supplying its SST-800 and SST-500 steam turbines, including an SGen5-100A-2P series generator. Pipe systems will be supplied by Caverion, who will also perform electrification works at the project site. \nShut-off valves and pipe fittings will be supplied by KSB Finland. \nThe main transformer will be supplied by ABB, whereas the 110kV connection and power transmission lines will be laid by Siemens.Solid fuel-handling systems will be supplied by Raumaster and a desalination plant at the site will be provided by Flootech. \nPressure vessels and storage tanks will be supplied by Mercell, while plate heat exchangers will be supplied by Sondex Tapiro. A naming ceremony of the third patrol vessel, RNOV Sadh, was held in September 2015. Bio-fuels will account for approximately 40% of feedstock in the initial operational phase and will increase to approximately 70% in the long run. Siemens is supplying its SST-800 turbine for the multi-fuel power plant. The new power plant will integrate with existing facilities to provide district heating requirements for decades.
