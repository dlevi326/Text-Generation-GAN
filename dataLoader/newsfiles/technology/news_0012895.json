Placing null characters, in this case %%30%30 or similar at the end of the URL causes Chrome to instantly choke through a series of attempts to rationalise the web address.\nThe bug affects the current release version of Chrome on Windows and OS X, but does not affect Chrome on Android devices in the Guardian’s testing, which instead simply fails to load the URL. Several reports indicate that the bug affects Android Web view – the version of Chrome that operates as part of Android to provide third-party apps such as Twitter, Facebook and others with an integrated web browser.\nChromium developers fixed the issue in the latest revision of the open-source base for Google’s Chrome today, but the fix will take time to migrate through the developer and beta builds to the most popular “stable” version of Chrome considered a full release.\nWhile Chrome can recover lost tabs on restarting, any text or other work entered into boxes that has not been saved will likely be lost.\nThe bug, with a sting of text being able to cause a crash, is reminiscent of the iPhone “Effective Power” bug found earlier this year which could be used to crash iPhones by sending a message.\niOS bug lets anyone crash your iPhone with a text message", "external_links": ["https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=533361#c57", "https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3lsiqz/google_chromes_3030_the_game_xpost_from/", "http://andrisatteka.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/a-simple-string-to-crash-google-chrome.html", "https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=533361"], "published": "2015-09-22T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:05:45.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
