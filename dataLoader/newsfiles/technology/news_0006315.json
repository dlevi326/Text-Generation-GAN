The Dow Jones Industrial Average recently rose 71 points, or 0.4%, to 16457. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, after both indexes declined sharply on Friday. Earlier the Dow industrials rose as much as 194 points.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 closed 0.9% higher, having fallen 1.8% in the previous session.\n\"It's quiet,\" said Brett Mock, managing director at brokerage JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, describing lower-than-average stock-trading volumes on Monday. \"There's not a lot of catalysts here for stocks until earnings.\"\nWeighing on the market were shares of biotechnology companies. Traders pointed to a comment posted by Hillary Clinton on Twitter about how tomorrow she will outline a plan to take on \"price gouging\" by certain specialty drug makers. Before the comment by the presidential hopeful, the Nasdaq Biotech Index was hovering around the flatline. Following Mrs. Clinton's remark, which referenced a New York Times article published Sunday on a certain drug's sharp price increase, the biotech index started its tumble. In recent afternoon trading, the index was down 4%.\nOther than biotech stocks in the U.S., markets generally steadied Monday after the Fed's decision last week to keep interest rates at record lows sparked a global selloff amid fears about the fragile state of the global economy. Although rock-bottom rates have helped fuel years of rising stocks since the financial crisis, the Fed's reluctance to lift borrowing costs was seen as a reminder that growth in the U.S. and elsewhere remains vulnerable to a slowdown in China.\nSome investors warned the Fed's decision and the uncertainty it brings has created a lasting overhang on stock markets.\n\"We're in for a period of choppy markets,\" said Julian Chillingworth, chief investment officer at Rathbone Brothers PLC, which manages GBP28.3 billion ($43.9 billion) in assets.\n\"People are now going to debate whether the Fed does or doesn't raise rates this year. With that uncertainty, markets will be focusing on the short term,\" he said.\nGlobal stock markets fell sharply in August. Although they have since steadied, there have been some big daily price swings.\nIn the U.S. on Monday, health-care stocks lagged behind the broader market.\nGiven the scale of recent declines, markets are liable to stage short-term rebounds unless additional bad news on the economy arrives, said Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, head of multiasset investments at NN Investment Partners, which oversees EUR184 billion. \"Without [a global recession] one should also be aware that a lot of problems are priced by now,\" he said.\nIn Asia, most indexes fell as markets reacted to Friday's decline on Wall Street, the biggest one-day loss in two weeks.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.8% and Australia's S&P/ ASX 200 lost 2%. China bucked the trend, with the Shanghai Composite closing 1.9% higher.\nJapanese markets were closed for a holiday.\nIn Europe, markets were mostly higher, encouraged by Alexis Tsipras's resounding win in Sunday's Greek election. Mr. Tsipras's re-election after agreeing a bailout deal may soothe tensions with European creditors that jolted markets during the summer.\n\"We are left with the same government that signed the [bailout] deal. The positive part of the outcome was the parties critical of Europe didn't really gain,\" said Thomas Wacker, head of credit research at UBS Wealth Management.\nGreece's Athex stock index fell 0.6%, but remains more than 9% higher in the past month.\nFrance's CAC 40 rose 1.1%, Italy's FTSE MIB was up 1.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.1%.\nFor global markets, Greece's politics have been on the back burner since Mr. Tsipras agreed on a new deal with the country's creditors.\n\"The only thing that would make it an issue for wider markets again is if the [eurozone] exit risk returns. We've seen with this government that things can change quickly, but as long as they don't go back on signed commitments, it would be surprising for that to happen at this stage,\" Mr. Wacker said.\nGermany's DAX lagged behind most markets in Europe, rising 0.3%. The index was held back by heavy losses for shares of Volkswagen AG, which fell 17% after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency accused the car maker of deliberately cheating emissions tests. The company halted American sales of popular diesel-powered cars and issued an apology for violating customers' trust.\nIn currency markets, the dollar rebounded from its post-Fed-decision losses. The euro was 1% lower against the dollar at $1.1191. The dollar climbed 0.4% against the yen to Yen120.4470.\nIn commodities, crude oil rose 3.3% to $46.50 a barrel. Gold was down 0.5% at $1,132.20 a troy ounce.\nWrite to Tommy Stubbington at tommy.stubbington@wsj.com and Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nSeptember 21, 2015 14:08 ET (18:08 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:30:05.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
