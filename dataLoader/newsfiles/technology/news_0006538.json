In many cases, a business’s receipts, invoices, and other forms are viewed more often than their own website – creating a massive opportunity for businesses to convert this unused digital real estate into a valuable publishing medium that unlocks new revenue, branding and marketing possibilities. By allowing businesses to collect, share and learn from their data in ways not previously possible, Canvas mobile apps and the new PDF Designer help organizations seize this opportunity, with no programming or coding needed.\n“Now an HVAC services company can not only convert its paper invoices to mobile versions, it can take the data most relevant to customers and create a trash-proof, customizable invoice with images of work done, coupons for follow-up service, or a customized layout to differentiate from competitors,” said Chris Morrisette, Chief Architect and Co-Founder, Canvas. “With Canvas PDF Designer, businesses can collect information with Canvas and mobile devices, and then easily customize the output to make it valuable inside and outside of the organization. There’s nothing else like this.”\nCanvas is a cloud-based software service and mobile app platform for businesses to replace expensive and inefficient paper forms and processes with customizable mobile apps for smartphones and tablets, with no programming or IT required. Canvas empowers businesses of all sizes to collect information using mobile devices; instantly share that information with colleagues, partners and customers; and seamlessly integrate the data with their businesses’ existing backend systems so that decision makers gain access to accurate, real-time information from their workforce.\nCanvas PDF Designer allows businesses to:\n➢ Create “trash-proof” customized digital receipts that fully embrace receipts and invoices as a powerful new publishing medium for mobile payments.\n➢ Easily customize the layout, colors and fonts of the digital documents generated from data captured with Canvas mobile business apps.\n➢ Add content such as links, images, social media and coupons to drive loyalty and differentiate from competitors.\n➢ Easily update digital documents and outputs on the fly as needs and regulations change (i.e. – a manufacturing safety team must update inspection forms regularly as their work and regulations change).\nCanvas also announced Canvas Connect for Excel, a plug-in that further allows businesses to access and analyze the data around work processes and forms captured with Canvas apps, and puts access to Canvas directly inside Microsoft Excel. In addition to its robust do-it-yourself mobile app builder and PDF Designer, Canvas also offers the first business-only mobile application store of its kind, with 17,000+ pre-built, fully customizable apps that work on all mobile platforms and service 30+ vertical markets.\nAbout Canvas\nCanvas is changing how companies collect and use business information through their cloud-based software service and mobile app platform.
