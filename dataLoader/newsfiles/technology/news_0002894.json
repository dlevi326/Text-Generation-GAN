You were not alone.\nMany users logging in to the service appeared to receive \"something went wrong\" errors when visiting the Web version of Facebook. It's not clear whether the outage extends to mobile devices.\nIn a statement Monday, Facebook says a \"configuration issue\" caused the service to go down for many users.\nNaturally, users are taking to Twitter to remain calm.\nIt's okay people, you WILL survive this...I promise.\n #facebookdown pic.twitter.com/Ud3UNYsIhj\n— Gord Macey (@GordMacey) September 28, 2015 I do not know what you are eating or that your baby sat up today. #facebookdown\n— Melissa Lantsman (@MelissaLantsman) September 28, 2015 I guess people are having to take their dinner down the street to show people now. #facebookdown\n— Dan Rigsby (@Dan_Rigsby) September 28, 2015 This is the second time in as many weeks Facebook went down for users. However, last week's outage lasted for a few minutes before service was restored.\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .\n24 CONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN 9 //usat.ly/1Fxwny7 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Dan_Rigsby/status/648582858559373312", "http://twitter.com/brettmolina23", "https://twitter.com/MelissaLantsman/status/648583031234646017", "https://twitter.com/GordMacey/status/648582062165917696", "http://t.co/Ud3UNYsIhj", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c725ce0c6db42155f7f0ab8d6d01ef5988f7cdd1/c=27-0-3017-2248&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/08/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635745453002615318-AXX-FACEBOOK-XX.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Fxwny7&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/facebookdown?src=hash", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9e555867d491c895d3e79be2c51befc87c053d19/r=500x369/local/-/media/2015/08/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635745453002615318-AXX-FACEBOOK-XX.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635745453002615318-AXX-FACEBOOK-XX.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Fxwny7&text=Facebook%20hit%20by%20brief%20outage&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1Fxwny7"], "published": "2015-09-28T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:55:37.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
