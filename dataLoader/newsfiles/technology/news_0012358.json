At the end of his statement, he threw meteorologists under the bus by stating his opinion that sports pundits are about as bad as meteorologists. A similarly disappointing perspective was also expressed last year by New England Patriots's Bill Belichick .This perspective is actually rampant in the public psyche, and almost every meteorologist that I know has heard the joke about being wrong “ 50% of the time yet still getting paid .”[caption id=\"attachment_173\" align=\"\" width=\"720\"] Examples of Opinion in Meteorology (Image courtesy of NOAA).[/caption]Meteorologists have opined fervently trying to dispel this perspective but it lives on.Statements about the inaccuracy of weather forecasts are examples of erroneous and dangerous “opinions” in weather. My inspiration for this piece is a very well written piece, “ No, It’s Not Your Opinion, You’re Just Wrong ” by Jef Rouner who shatters emerging perspective in society that opinion can redefine definitions, science, and facts.For me, the main culprits of the “opinion” that meteorologists are wrong is public misunderstanding of probability and statistics, long held myths (see my listing of 10 common myths in Forbes ), and new technology.On a recent tubing trip with my son in the Georgia mountains, a thunderstorm developed quickly. I overheard a women in the tube next to me say, “there was only a 20% chance of rain and now this, see those weather people don’t know what they are doing.” In reality this \"opinion\" was more illustrative of her lack of understanding of % chance of rain. For a great explanation, meteorologist Troy Kimmel’s explanation is helpful. From the explanation, there is an “area” and a “confidence” estimate to percent chance of rain. So even if it rains on a day with a “20% chance” there is nothing about that outcome that is necessarily inaccurate. With higher resolution gridded weather models, this definition will evolve.The rise of weather “opinions” on the Internet and social media is also worth noting. Though still summer, friend and colleague Rick Smith, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma has already posted a warning about a viral article predicting winter snowfall amounts. He writes,\nIt's only August 2nd and I've already seen this pop up a couple of times. This article is from last September, but the graphic is the same one making the rounds this year. Don't share, like, retweet, etc unless you know it came from a reliable source. I host Weather Geeks each Sunday on The Weather Channel. In our second episode, Capital Weather Gang’s Jason Samenow joined us to discuss the rise of the “ Social Media-rologist .” Increasingly, projections about hurricanes or winter storm are being posted by a range of people and often it is hard to distinguish between a credible forecast by an experienced meteorologist or the opinion of a hobbyist that is getting ready for the high school prom. Such opinions can create conflict and confusion in potentially life-threatening situations. Don’t get me wrong, as a weather geek since 6 th grade, I completely support and encourage student and enthusiast interest in the weather. However, the public, as they do with medical or legal advice, must apply appropriate filters. To be fair, I see questionable posts by professionals at times too.As the former president of the American Meteorological Society , this is an area that the professional community is trying to address. The National Weather Association has even developed a new Digital Seal Certification program similar to what TV meteorologists can attain.Finally, many of you are likely reading this on a smart phone that has a weather or radar app. Degrees in Phone Meteorology have skyrocketed :). Earlier this summer, the Miami Marlins Major League Baseball team, which has a retractable roof, experienced a rain delay because, as Barry Jackson of @flasportsbuzz tweeted, Marlins don't have a meteorologist consultant. Instead, three team executives monitor weather forecasts on APPs. According to the Miami Herald and Capital Weather Gang , Miami Marlins President David Samson said, I tried to predict a cloud would go north and it went south on top of us... I know some fine meteorologists at the National Weather Service Miami or on various television stations that could have helped. However, this illustrates the opinion that they can interpret weather patterns and rapidly changing situations better than degreed meteorologists or experienced forecasters. While weather apps are useful in a broad sense, they should never be relied upon for rapidly evolving weather hazards .I could go on for days with this discussion, but in my opinion, it is time to stop. And I did not even touch upon the rampant “opinions” about climate.", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/04/07/miami-marlins-learn-weather-apps-cant-replace-a-meteorologist/", "http://www.weather.com/tv/shows/amhq/video/bettes-schools-belichick", "http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/no-it-s-not-your-opinion-you-re-just-wrong-7611752", "http://thevane.gawker.com/your-weather-app-sucks-1696128249", "https://www2.ametsoc.org/ams/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2014/09/08/record-shattering-snow-this-winter-dont-fall-for-it/", "http://www.utexas.edu/depts/grg/kimmel/nwsforecasts.html", "http://www.weatherunderground.com/blog/DrShepherdWxGeeks/comment.html?entrynum=44", "http://www.weather.com/tv/shows/wx-geeks/video/social-mediarology-pt-1"], "published": "2015-09-03T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:00:32.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
