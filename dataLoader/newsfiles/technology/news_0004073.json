Fonon reaches out to their customer base on a routine basis to keep in touch. Deep within our CRM archives was John Callihan, owner of the Golf Store in Houston, Texas. John had been inquiring about an engraving machine for years to customize his club heads. He started his company in 2004, building his business and expanding his operations to include custom fitting his clients’ clubs. Every so often he would re-engage with us, eyeing the LaserTower™ Compact and dreaming of expanding his business. Each time John would get closer and closer but would pull back, realizing he had no practical experience operating a laser marking system or working with software to create the artwork to be laser etched into the golf club.\nThis time, however, two people helped change his mind. His daughter Emily and Fonon account manager Steve Russ. Once again, John called to inquire about the LaserTower™ Compact, asking question after question. Steve traced his history in CRM realizing John had been active in the system for years. It was time to help him out. First, his daughter told him she could work with the software after reading through the manual. Second, Steve kept telling him how user friendly the system is if he just took a leap of faith.\nJohn and his daughter recently completed their in-house training on the LaserTower™ Compact commenting, “I know I am the little guy with a dream. Steve was patient each time I called, which included more than one weekend and evenings. Even the Vice-President reached out to me with encouragement. Today, I just realized how straightforward it is to operate these systems while my daughter slam-dunked the software training. I really appreciate the extra effort invested by Fonon in helping me achieve my dream.”\nWe encourage “golfers” to visit John’s store in Houston, Texas to support his growing small business. Give John a call at (832) 659-6465 and see what he can do to personalize your clubs.\nThe LaserTower Compact is the ideal entry level system for owners just like John.
