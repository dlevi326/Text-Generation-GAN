However, the museum, which may also have exhibitions on Buddha as heritage, will continue to showcase life and contributions of Nehru too in many of the rooms in the NMML main building from the days of his childhood in Anand Bhawan, according to the proposed plan.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T06:37:52.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
