Nanophase slurries offer improved longevity, faster time to surface finish, reduced defectivity and reduced waste, saving customers time and money and allowing them to meet rigorous specifications.\nAlso at the conference, Nanophase Chemist Abigail Hooper will present two papers on controlling the optical polishing process to improve competitive advantage and profits. The first presentation, “ Nano alumina slurries for improved polishing on thermoset and thermoplastic resins ,” will explain why a spherical aluminum oxide abrasive is the best choice for polishing resins like polycarbonate and acrylic. In the paper “ Deterministic polishing from theory to practice ,” Sydor Optics and Nanophase examined how controlled experiments and trials led to improved throughput and cost reduction in filter glass polishing. Both presentations will take place the morning of Oct. 12 in Highland Room A/B.\n“In this economic environment, pressure is mounting for optical manufacturers to cut costs,” Hooper says. “Choosing the right polishing slurry and controlling variables in the manufacturing process are essential to improving optical quality and profitability.”\nAbout Nanophase Technologies Corporation\nNanophase Technologies Corporation (NANX), located in Romeoville, IL, is a global provider of engineered nanomaterial solutions across a broad range of markets, including personal care, coatings, energy storage and surface finishing.
