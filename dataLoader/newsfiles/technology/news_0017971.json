Contract talks began in July. \nIn August, more than 90 percent of those in United Auto Workers Local 1112 and Local 1714, which represents the assembly and fabrication plant workers, respectively, voted in favor of strike authorization if needed. \nA strike authorization vote is a normal part of the process for the UAW and does not necessarily signal the union’s intent to call a strike. A strike authorization vote by the union’s members gives the union’s leaders the ability to call a strike if contract talks stall or hit an impasse. \nUAW concerns are for longtime workers who haven’t received a base wage increase in 10 years, and many members continue to be unhappy about a two-tier wage system that pays newer workers less money. \nWhile Batey said he had no announcements about union talks, he said that the strike authorization was not something to worry about every day. \n“We’re negotiating as we speak,” he said. \nBatey said the company is on schedule as it rolls out the next-generation Cruze for next year. \nOn the other hand, a drop in gas prices has triggered more people to buy larger vehicles including pickups and trucks. But Batey said it’s not at the expense of the Cruze and the general compact-car market. \n“It’s a huge segment,” he said. \nDuring the breakfast kickoff, Batey announced that this year GM will match dollar for dollar contributions of GM employees nationwide to the 2015 United Way campaign.
