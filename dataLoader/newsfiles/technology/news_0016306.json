The informal economy needs to be lifted up by its boot straps and dragged — kicking and screaming, or tempted and teased, whichever is necessary — into the formal economic structures that anchor our country’s growth.\nOur chances in the Rugby World Cup improved a little on Saturday. We’re also improving our performance in inequality, albeit marginally. With a Gini coefficient of 0.60, where zero implies total equality and one total inequality, SA still has one of the highest measures of inequality among its population.\nSustained economic inequality drives revolutions. We can neither accept the status quo nor tinker with solutions around the edges. We need bold moves, and we need them fast.\nHow does inequality manifest in a country? It is not just the presumed evil of capitalism gone mad, as some would suggest. It does not happen overnight. It’s about dual economies; it’s about the informal sector never reaching the escape velocity required to contribute to, and benefit from, the formal economy.\nCommon flaws characterise an economically divided society, particularly in SA. Access to funding is central to any growth strategy, and SA needs to grow, not rationalise. We need to create new jobs, not cut existing ones. The trouble is, we don’t provide capital to entrepreneurs or small businesses — they get short shrift from the formal sector. Part of the reason for this, beyond previous racial division and attitudes, is the failure of exchange control as a capital-retention policy.\nSA was a closed capital economy — we weren’t allowed to take capital out. That should have driven us to invest more in the early-stage enterprises of our local economy, but we did not.\nInstead, big business invested only in big business — mining houses owned shares in banks, which owned shares in mining houses. Conglomerates grew without the discipline and performance that specific asset capital allocation demands. Companies that produced excess cash bought other already established companies that produced cash, and so the circularity of lazy capital continued, with very little risk.\nSAB owned Edgars, Goldfields owned Standard Bank — silly, really.\nOnce the best of our companies were allowed to go offshore, they tidied up and they left — they have been very successful, but they are gone.\nStill, we chase after them, instead of investing in our own people. Why? Lack of confidence, mistrust, and apparently reasonable returns in already established business. But the truth is that by not investing locally, we are feeding the greatest risks of all — poverty, unemployment and a growing divide.\nNeither established business nor the government seem prepared to take the risk of funding the informal sector alone, so we will have to do it together. If we do not, we will both bear the consequences — an increased burden on the state and unfunded consumers unable to support the private sector.\nBanks, which have the lowest cost of funding, prefer not to get into unsecured lending — why should they, if there is enough other business to share safely among them?\nThat may be okay for now, but the consequent creation and perpetuation of inequality will come back to bite. Outside of the regulated banking system, the cost of funding for those prepared to fund the unbanked is just too high for it to work. If your cost of funds is 12%-15% and your bad debts are running at 50% you have to charge 30% on your loans just to break even. No one can afford that interest rate, no matter what form they have just filled in — let alone the repayment of capital, children’s education, and buying food.\nThe banks have to come to the party. Equipped with the lessons learned from the African Bank extravaganza, the right price for unsecured lending will be found. An element of government subsidy will be required, but it is better than just giving away increasing amounts of tax revenue to the unemployed, instead of investing in their endeavours.\nThe next major impediment is the regulatory environment. It is difficult to start a business in SA. One of the broad consequences of that is the creation of an informal, somewhat illegal economy.\nInformal, unregistered businesses do not pay tax — all of the money circulating among them, among vast numbers in our population, does not circle back to provide essential services such as education, healthcare and other infrastructure support vital for the advancement of a growing economy.\nProductivity is to be found in the formal sector, evidence of which lowers the cost of capital, and the virtuous circle can begin. We need stokvel monies invested in the stock market, we need equity invested in entrepreneurs.\nVast sums of money are circulating among the haves, who are not prepared to risk investing in the have-nots.\nAn aerial view of such a dual economy shows two spinning wheels, never kicking into gear, never compounding, hardly moving forward, unlikely to generate growth at the pace required to sustain the population, always ending in conflict.\nTo break this impasse, we have to open the channel from the informal into the formal economy; we have to force it open, if that is what it takes.\nTo do that, we will have to take risks — political and financial risk.\nWe will have to focus on the long-term returns and tolerate some losses in the first few quarters. It will take equal measures of discipline and incentive, of austerity and easing, as we go.\nWe will have to move out of our comfort zones and old alliances towards pragmatic partnerships that will knit the fabric of our survival.\nIt is not just about money. Unequal education does not produce equal results — a private school matric certificate opens more doors than the same certificate from a government school.\nWe need fewer reasons to privatise our personal services — such as security, healthcare, education, reliable electricity supply, postal services; the list is long.\nThat will only happen when the government offering is brought up to scratch. The only way that will happen is with immediate and significant investment in economic and human capital.\nThe evidence is overwhelming — do not give the capital to business or the banks and hope for a trickle-down effect; invest the money directly in the people.\nPolitical popularity will have to be secondary to pragmatic economic policy.\nThat will require courage from our leaders — the visionaries among them will need to break ranks. What we have now isn’t good enough.\nIf we get our own house in order, the foreign capital will come pouring in. If we do not, what is still left here will go. Let us fix this now, before we lose another game we know we should have won.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:25:52.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
