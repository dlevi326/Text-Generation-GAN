(Antoine Doyen/AP Images for the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation) It’s fair to say that both Ta-Nehisi Coates and Lin-Manuel Miranda were already having a pretty impressive 2015. Coates, a journalist lauded for his insights into race, politics and culture, launched his memoir, “Between the World and Me,” straight to the bestseller lists. Miranda, already a Tony-winning composer, wrote and stars in the season’s hottest ticket on Broadway, the genre-crossing musical “ Hamilton .”\nTheir year just got better. Coates and Miranda are among the 24 people awarded MacArthur Foundation fellowships on Tuesday. The so-called genius grants are an annual vote of confidence given to some of America’s best and brightest scientists, writers, artists, academics and entrepreneurs. And the big check that comes with the fellowship doesn’t hurt, either.\nThe calls to recipients went out in early September from mysterious numbers, catching the new class of fellows off guard. For Miranda, the big reveal came on an ordinary day at home with his son.\n“I had just broken up with a cable provider the day before, which is the best thing in the world,” he said. So when a call came in from a strange number, he sent it to voice mail.\n“I was like, ‘Oh boy, they want me back.’ And then they called twice more and I kept sending it to voice mail, and by the third [call], I was keyed up, ready to be like, ‘Your cable box doesn’t work! And you’ve given me terrible service,’ ” he said. “And then it was, of course, the MacArthur Foundation.”\nLin-Manuel Miranda, creator and star of the Broadway musical “Hamilton.” (John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation) Similar scenes played out across the country. Classicist and archaeologist Dimitri Nakassis, who grew up in Gaithersburg and graduated from Richard Montgomery High School, said he found out while lying in a hospital bed, woozy from medication for a procedure he was undergoing. (His test came out fine.) And when puppeteer Basil Twist got the call in the middle of rehearsal for his new show, he bristled. “I was like, ‘Who is this, a bill collector?’ ” he said.\n[ Last year: MacArthur Foundation surprises 21 fellows with ‘genius’ grants and $625,000 ]\nFellows are nominated by leaders across various fields and chosen based on three criteria: “exceptional creativity,” the expectation of future accomplishments and the potential for the fellowship to encourage both. A changing panel of anonymous nominators from different disciplines suggests potential fellows each year, and an independent selection committee — also anonymous — winnows down the list.\nIts alumni include creative people who were already well-known when tapped — dancer/choreographer Twyla Tharp, novelist Junot Díaz and", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@MauraJudkis"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T09:02:02.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
