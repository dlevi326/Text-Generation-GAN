The CE910-DUAL delivers reliable CDMA mobile connectivity for low data throughput IoT applications. IoT systems, connected cars and industrial devices based on the CE910-DUAL can now be deployed on U.S. Cellular networks. \nRecommended for mid to high-volume, size sensitive applications, the CE910-DUAL has a compact 28.2 x 28.2 x 2.05 mm Land Grid Array (LGA) package. Full-duplex data rate of 153.6 Kpbs and extended operating temperature range of -40°C to +85°C make it a suitable platform for mobile and fixed applications such as vending, point-of-sale (POS), tracking, smart metering, and telematics devices. Features including minimal power consumption, various status indications and alarm management, add value to customer applications without adding cost. \n\"The reduced total cost of ownership, reliability and functionality of the CE910-DUAL is now accessible to U.S. Cellular customers,\" said Mike Ueland, President of Telit Americas. “The xE910 family allows customers to easily integrate 3G, 4G and LTE technologies into the same design.” \n“We are excited to be working with Telit to bring a variety of valuable solutions to our customers,” said Scott Scheuber, Director of Product Management at U.S. Cellular. “We look forward to continuing to build a total solution ecosystem with them.” \nAbout Telit Telit (AIM: TCM), is the global leader in Internet of Things (IoT) enablement.
