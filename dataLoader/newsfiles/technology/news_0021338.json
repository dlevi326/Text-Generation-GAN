When the time is right, Chrome will take out the garbage (believe it or not, that's actually the computer science term for what the new version of Chrome is doing). \nGoogle had already been doing some garbage collecting in previous versions of Chrome. But now, it will wait until Web pages are finished loading and completely idle -- then it will \"aggressively clean up old, unused memory.\" \nBy waiting until a page is idle until it drops the hammer on unused memory, Google says that Web pages will perform faster. Previous versions of Chrome took out the garbage at random times, sometimes in the middle of an animation or video. (Ever notice an animation just stop for a second? Your browser might have been emptying the garbage.) \nThe new feature will reduce memory usage by 10% on average and up to 45% in some cases, Google said in a blog post. \nAlso, if you set Chrome to automatically restore the tabs you were using when you last closed your browser, Google will now check your system's memory before reloading all of your previously used tabs. That will save some of your system's memory too, Google said. \nIn addition to all the memory savings, Chrome will also spare your smartphone or laptop's battery consumption. By automatically pausing Flash animations that aren't crucial to a website's operations (basically anything that's not a video), Google believes it can save up to 15% of your battery life. \nThe 15% figure comes from Google's lab tests, but the company said your total battery savings will depend on a number of factors, including which operating system you use and how much Flash content is on the websites you visit. \nGoogle says it will turn on that feature for all users over the next few weeks. \nChrome updates are typically not big news, since Google launches a new version of Chrome every six weeks or so (we're up to Chrome 45, for heaven's sake). But this particular update is chock-full of good news for customers. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:49:35.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
