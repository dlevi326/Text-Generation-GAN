Post a need or look for a need they can fulfill.\nCAMBRIDGE, MA (PRWEB) September 24, 2015\nGetmii’s founders like coconuts and sunshine. In June they flew their team to far-away Bangkok, Thailand to create an ambitious new smartphone app. After piloting in Kathmandu, Nepal, the group returned to the U.S. to launch the app this week at over 20 college campuses worldwide.\nRiffing off Dr. Ruth’s famous proclamation “Get some,” the Getmii app invites you to fulfill any need with someone nearby by submitting: “Getmii ” on the home screen. Its geo-location algorithm then broadcasts that need, be it a service, product or advice, to people near you.\nThe company’s co-founder Max Meyer, left McKinsey & Company to develop the app. “Search engines have us sorting through massive amounts of data,” says Meyer. “But browsing doesn't teach us to play the piano. A person does. We need a new kind of searching with immediacy and purpose.”\nIn that spirit, Getmii ran a pilot test at the foothills of the Himalayas to connect local blood donors to the Red Cross Central Blood Donation Center in the aftermath of April’s devastating earthquake. On September 10, Getmii doubled the number of blood donors with the help of local young people.\n“Young people everywhere are looking for better, more creative ways to engage the community,” says Meyer, a recent graduate of Harvard and Phillips Academy Andover.\nRecognizing its potential to positively shape communities worldwide, Getmii has assembled a network of over 500 young ambassadors from leading universities in 23 countries.\nLast week, the Getmii global team set up blank chalkboards and handwritten notes from San Francisco to Berlin to Sydney to ask a simple question: “What do you need?” Thousands upon thousands of passersby responded.\n“Our needs are what define us. By knowing what our communities need, we can be better servants and stewards,” said co-founder Darryl Lau, also formerly of McKinsey & Company.\nGetmii is available for free download on the Apple App store and Google Play.\n###\nFor more information on Getmii, or if you would like to schedule an interview, please contact:\nName: Maddie Rudnick\nPhone: +1.760.815.9253\nE-mail: press(at)getmii(dot)com\nURL: http://www.getmii.com\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12983834.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12983834.htm"], "published": "2015-09-25T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T12:03:29.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
