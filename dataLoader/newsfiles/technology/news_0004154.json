In Germany and Poland, for instance, the figure is above 30 percent.\nBroad adoption of ad-blocking would bring a new set of problems for online publishers, many of whom are already struggling with plummeting ad prices.\nWith its lates operating software released last month Apple Inc has for the first time allowed users to install ad-blocking apps on its iPhones and iPads.\nAd-blocking tools should help web pages load much faster on mobiles, as they strip out so-called scripts and trackers that are used to serve up the ads. Some early pilots have shown media outlets like Vice and the New York Times loading twice as fast.\nSurfing the web with fewer ads will also mean fewer megabytes of data allowances consumed by phone users.\nLast week Digicel said it was set to raise as much as $2 billion from an initial public offering in the United States, with the shares expected to be priced at $13-16 apiece to value the company at as much as $5 billion.
