This news follows an announcement by Navis that it had successfully implemented its Navis N4 system at seven terminals since June, 2015, including Peel Ports’ Liverpool2 container terminal. \nIn the next phase, Libra Terminais will implement N4 TOS at its second facility in Santos, Brazil, an action in step with Libra’s goal of being the key container terminal in Brazil’s trade market.\nLibra Terminais Rio is strategically located within Brazil’s port of Rio de Janeiro, a port that houses one of the largest bonded warehouses in the region, and is equipped to handle reefer, cold storage and consolidated cargo.\nTo read more about Navis in our Supplier Directory, click here \nDuring Libra Terminais Rio’s expansion and implementation of the N4 system, they increased their import/export warehousing area by 26% and storage capacity by 88%. Following the N4 go-live, Libra Terminais Rio is now better equipped to handle increased TEU throughput of as much as 630,000 annually, in turn increasing productivity.\nCelia Takano, IT Director at Libra Terminais Rio, said: “The implementation of any terminal operating system can be a highly demanding process. Fortunately, partnering with Navis’ knowledgeable team, the N4 TOS implementation process ran smoothly and we are happy with the results.\n“With the implementation complete at Rio—and in progress at Santos—we are looking forward to raising the bar for the level of service we can offer our customers.”\nThe implementation of the N4 TOS will help to optimise operations and processes to achieve competitive advantages and to improve customer satisfaction, as well as support Libra’s regional sustainability initiatives.\nTo read a Technical Paper by by Navis' Oscar Pernia on the definitive guide to terminal productivity, click here \nLibra is acutely aware of the environmental impact of its terminals, and works to assure that business operations are in line with those of the Vision for Sustainability and the Global Compact principles.\nChuck Schneider, Regional General Manager at Navis, concluded: “We believe that partnership and collaboration during the implementation process is the key to success. Due to the level of teamwork demonstrated by both teams throughout this project, I am confident that Libra Terminais Rio—and its customers—will achieve accelerated time-to-value with our TOS.”\nFact File: Navis is the global technology standard for managing the movement of cargo through terminals, standing the test of time.
