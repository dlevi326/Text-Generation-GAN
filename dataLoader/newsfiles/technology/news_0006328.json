The PCQR2 program allows for a relative comparison of printed circuit board fabricators covering various aspects of manufacturing and is managed by Conductor Analysis Technologies (CAT). Advanced Circuits Tempe did very well and had an overall Top Tier ranking on microvia and plated through-hole formation / reliability when compared to 12 other fabricators submitting similar high technology designs. This capability test consists of three builds of 5 panels each over a several week period. The design, which is created by CAT, consists of a 14 layer board with blind / buried vias, microvias, 2 mil trace / space and 14:1 aspect ratio holes.\nCAT and PCQR2 provide a peer comparison of process capability along with establishing a baseline for on-going enhancements to strengthen the company's performance and relative results among similar high-tech PCB manufacturers.\nAbout Advanced Circuits\nSince 1989, Advanced Circuits has been the leading printed circuit board quick turn manufacturer, specializing in both small and production quantities ranging from the simplest boards to the most complex designs; offering in-house PCB assembly services for quick turn - small quantity orders. Advanced Circuits operates divisions in Aurora, Colorado, Tempe, Arizona, and Maple Grove, Minnesota and is MIL-PRF-31032, MIL-PRF-55110G, AS9100C, ISO 9001:2008 certified, IPC 6012 class 3/3A qualified, ITAR registered and DOD contracts ready.
