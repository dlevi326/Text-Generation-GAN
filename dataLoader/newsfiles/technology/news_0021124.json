This will net Stellar R209.8m in cash once a takeover deal from Novatel Wireless proceeds next month.\nStellar finance chief Charl de Villiers said R130.2m of the proceeds would be used to settle the cash portion of its R909.3m cash and share offer for 34.58% of industrial group Torre.\n\"The remainder will be retained as cash resources on our balance sheet,\" he said.\nDigiCore is the sole distributor of some of the Nasdaq-listed Novatel’s products in SA.\nNovatel has agreed to buy the local company for $87m. DigiCore shareholders approved the transaction and the delisting of its shares from the JSE on Wednesday.\nThe DigiCore sale marks Stellar’s exit from another information and communications technology (ICT) venture. Stellar, which was formerly called ConvergeNet, sold electronics engineering company Contract Kitting and ICT company SCS to electronics company Tellumat late last year in exchange for 30% of Tellumat’s shares.\n\"We view Tellumat as a platform for the growth of our investment in the ICT sector and will be looking to increase our exposure here rather than to exit,\" said Mr De Villiers. \"We are building a portfolio of industrial, financial and ICT assets, although we will retain the capacity to consider other sectors on an opportunistic basis.\n\"We are a long-term strategic investor and will only invest where we believe we can add value.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T08:39:26.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
