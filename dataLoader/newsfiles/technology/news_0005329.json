But what if you don’t have the data for this? \nIt’s called Wi-Fi Assist, and most Android devices have had this for a couple of years under slightly different names such as Download Booster on Samsung Galaxy devices. On Android phones, the feature is implemented to help you download larger files faster by combining Wi-Fi with mobile data. This isn’t turned on by default, so you don’t need to worry about accidentally downloading a massive file on your mobile data. \nApple is using this feature a little differently on iOS 9, though. By default, Wi-Fi Assist is on and will allow your mobile data to kick in if your Wi-Fi connection is too slow. \nWhile on the surface this seems like a handy feature which makes sure you’re always connected to fast internet, it can also catch you out if you have limited mobile data limits. \nSo how do you turn it off? \nFirstly, jump into the settings app and then tap on Mobile. Alternatively, you could search for Wi-Fi Assist with the new search functions in settings. Source: \nAfter you’re in the Mobile menu, scroll right down to the bottom until you find the Wi-Fi Assist toggle and tap it off. Or you could keep it on if you have the data for it. Source: news.com.au \nThat’s it! Now feel free to download to your hearts content on slow Wi-Fi without the fear of your mobile data kicking in.
