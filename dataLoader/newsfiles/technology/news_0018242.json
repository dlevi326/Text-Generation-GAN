Lawrence, who joined FAA in 2010, previously led the agency's Kansas City-based Small Airplane Directorate, which is charged with regulating small aircraft, airships and balloons. \nThe appointments are part of an agency reorganization that was first announced in June by Huerta [ID: L1N0YP2IZ], who said FAA would create a new senior advisor position to handle the crush of private sector interest in drones and allow the existing UAS office to concentrate on rulemaking. \nUnder pressure from Congress and industry lobbyists, the FAA has been working to accommodate commercial drones as a new and potentially lucrative frontier for U.S. aviation. \nThe agency is expected to miss a congressionally mandated Sept 30 deadline for new commercial drone regulations but has pledged to publish them by next June -- months earlier than anticipated. The rules would allow for widespread commercial drone use for the first time. \nOver the past several months, the agency has also accelerated its process for allowing commercial drones on a case-by-case basis. The FAA, which had exempted only a handful of companies from the current near-ban early in the year, has since given the green light to over 1,500 private sector applicants, according to an FAA official.
