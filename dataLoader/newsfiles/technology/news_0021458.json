The chromosome is X-shaped because it is dividing. Introns are regions often found in eukaryote genes that are removed in the splicing process (after the DNA is transcribed into RNA): Only the exons encode the protein. The diagram labels a region of only 55 or so bases as a gene. In reality, most genes are hundreds of times longer.

In this study, published in the September edition of Translational Research , TGen scientists sequenced microRNAs (miRNAs) from liver biopsies , spelling out their biochemical molecules to identify several potential gene targets associated with NAFLD-related liver damage. \nThe miRNAs—RNA molecules that regulate gene expression—were obtained from liver biopsies of 30 female candidates for gastric bypass surgery: 15 with, and 15 without, NAFLD liver damage. \nUsing the most advanced technology to refine the data, researchers identified several potential gene targets associated with NAFLD-related liver damage. Specifically, they found that a particular miRNA called miR-182 produced a strong association with a protein called FOX03. \n\"Because of the known role of miR-182 in mechanisms related to liver cancer , we sought to investigate this miRNA in NAFLD-related liver damage by looking at relevant target genes,\" said TGen Research Associate Fatjon Leti, the study's lead author. \"We found that levels of FOX03, which has been implicated in liver metabolism , to be significantly decreased.\" \nImportantly, researchers observed a significant suppression of FOX03 protein levels in damaged livers, compared to those without liver damage, suggesting a potential role for this gene in the initiation of liver disease . \n\"These finding support a role for liver miRNAs in the disease development of NAFLD-related damage, and yield possible new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of liver damage and eventual liver failure,\" said Dr. Johanna DiStefano, Professor and Director of TGen's Diabetes, Cardiovascular & Metabolic Diseases Division, and the study's senior author. \n\"To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a high-throughput sequencing approach to the investigation of liver miRNAs in NAFLD-related liver damage,\" DiStefano said. \nThe authors cite limitations in this particular study: The study's small sample, and the fact that all 30 patients were obese females who were candidates for gastric bypass surgery , which may have limited the data. They were selected because obesity is a significant risk factor for NAFLD outcomes, and because of the value of obtaining unbiased liver samples. \n\"We consider this study an exploratory one, and we acknowledge that validation in a larger, independent dataset will be necessary to confirm our findings,\" DiStefano said. \"The results reported here do not allow us to make specific conclusions about miRNAs and biological pathways. Additional studies will be necessary to confirm the role of specific miRNAs in liver damage .\" Modest alcohol intake associated with less inflammation in patients with common liver disease May 15, 2012 \nNAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) is the most common type of liver disease in the developed world, affecting up to one-third of the US population. NAFLD is often associated with obesity and other parameters of the ... Weight loss surgery alters fatty liver disease genes August 6, 2013 \nResearch has shown that weight loss surgery can benefit obese individuals in ways that go beyond shedding pounds, for example by causing early remission of type 2 diabetes. Now scientists have found that the surgery can also ... New study identifies genes associated with unhealthy liver function October 1, 2013 \nA groundbreaking study of nearly 2,300 extremely obese diabetes patients, led by the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), has identified genes associated with unhealthy liver function. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease shown to affect the development of coronary artery calcification April 23, 2015 \nData revealed today at The International Liver Congress 2015 show that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) plays a role in the early stages of coronary atherosclerosis and in its more severe form it can also promote ... NASH associated with a 50 percent higher chance of death compared with NAFLD April 24, 2015 \nResults from a large population-based cohort of almost a million people in the UK found that the chances of dying from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), over a 14-year period, was approximately 50% higher than for those ... Gene mutation contributes to liver disease in patients of normal weight July 22, 2015 \nA gene mutation has been found to contribute to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a form of liver disease closely linked to obesity, in normal weight subjects. Carriers of the PNPLA3 mutant genotype were found to ... Recommended for you Genes physically held in silencing 'lock-down' in embryonic stem cells August 31, 2015 \nResearchers at the Babraham Institute have discovered a strong physical gene interaction network that is responsible for holding genes in a silencing grip during early development. In the same way that people can interact ... Adaptive mutation mechanism may explain some forms of antibiotic resistance August 25, 2015 \nEvolutionary theory says mutations are blind and occur randomly. But in the phenomenon of adaptive mutation, cells can peek under the blindfold, increasing their mutation rate in response to stress. Genetic overlapping in multiple autoimmune diseases may suggest common therapies August 24, 2015 \nScientists who analyzed the genes involved in 10 autoimmune diseases that begin in childhood have discovered 22 genome-wide signals shared by two or more diseases. These shared gene sites may reveal potential new targets ... Unique genes in Khoe-San people may lower risk of some pregnancy hazards August 20, 2015 \nAn examination of the immune genes of the southern African Khoe-San people has revealed a completely new kind of mutation, according to researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine.
