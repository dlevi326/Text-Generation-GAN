Nic Walker Share on twitter by Ruth Liew Technology group Bravura Solutions has asked the government to \"put their money where their mouth is\" when it comes to funding tech start-ups, after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Australia needed to position itself as a \"nation that is agile\".\nBravura, a financial services technology company that was previously listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, also hinted at a possible return to being a public company after group chief executive Tony Klim flagged improving fortunes in the local tech scene.\n\"I'd be looking to the Turnbull government ... to put their money where their mouth is, because it's through real funding that we're going to see [innovation],\" Mr Klim, who is visiting Sydney this week, said.\nLondon-based Mr Klim pointed to Britain's Project Innovate which is run by the Financial Conduct Authority, and the hundreds of millions of pounds invested in companies that embrace disruptive innovation and challenge existing business models.\n\"It's great to stimulate, it's great to have things like [Australian fin tech hub] Stone & Chalk, but I guess it's real investment that's going to make the difference,\" he added.\nMr Klim's comments come after Prime Minister Turnbull urged Australians to embrace a future nation that is \"agile, that is innovative, that is creative\".\n\"We have to recognise that the disruption that we see driven by technology, the volatility in change is our friend if we are agile and smart enough to take advantage of it,\" he said in his first speech after being elected Liberal leader.\nDoldrums Bravura, which counts some of the nation's biggest super funds, wealth managers and insurers among its clients, is an example of an Australian fin tech that has expanded globally.\nThe acquisition-hungry company provides software and technology services for superannuation, life insurance, investment and private wealth groups and currently manages more than $3 trillion of assets on its systems.\nSome of its clients include Bank of New York Mellon, JPMorgan, Mercer, Fidelity and Citi.\nBravura de-listed from the ASX two years ago when it was acquired by Ironbridge Capital during a period when its share price was in the doldrums. The company was listed on the ASX between 2006 and 2013.\nBut Mr Klim has not ruled out a re-listing on the ASX in the future.\n\"At the time certainly as I was looking at CEO, we weren't getting a lot of recognition â€“ fin tech then wasn't of great interest,\" he said of the de-listing.\n\"I think that has changed,\" he said. \"Fin tech is now very much of interest, possibly linked with the falling off a little of the mining [boom]. I think market conditions have changed significantly and I think we would look favourably at that [listing] as an option,\" he said.\nBravura's optimism for the fin tech sector comes amid a growing number of technology start-ups in Australia in recent years that are focused on disrupting traditional business models including banking and insurance.\nFormer AMP boss Craig Dunn is the chairman of a new physical fin-tech hub called Stone & Chalk which is being built in Sydney, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has established an innovation hub to help fin tech businesses navigate the regulatory system.\nMr Klim previously flagged that he would mentor up-and-coming entrepreneurs. \"We have experienced some of the pain these companies might have, and I would be very happy to share and offer advice,\" he said earlier this year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-09-22T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:16:40.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
