We needed a strong system that allows us to invest wisely, track and get good returns, and ensure our earnings are maximized. We are pleased with Business World’s flexibility.” \nTechnology analyst Cindy Jutras of Mint Jutras says, “Business change can occur as a result of new disruptive business models, changing financial or regulatory requirements, organizational restructuring…. Unlike these more traditional applications, Unit4’s ‘elastic’ applications can easily be changed and/or extended without disrupting the installed solution.” (In “Self Driving ERP”, July 2015.) \nNagle also cites a planned fundraising campaign as a key determinant in choosing Business World. “We want a system that will grow and expand with us into the future. Unit4’s ERP has capacity and multiple business uses,” he says. \nSouthern Illinois University Carbondale is a public, doctoral research university with an enrollment of 18,000 students and alumni base of 235,000.
