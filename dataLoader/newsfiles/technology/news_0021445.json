Source: Apple\nDays before rounding up fans and media for one of its regular product showcases , Apple created a Twitter account devoted to games .\nApple’s September event is usually headlined by a new iPhone. This year, the popular buzz is that the company will show a new Apple TV that has its own store for apps. According to 9 to 5 Mac , the Apple TV will focus in part on gaming.\nAside from mentioning Siri in its event invite, Apple hasn’t said what products it plans to talk about at the gathering.\nThe verified Twitter account, @AppStoreGames , instructs viewers to “embrace the future of gaming.” Apple already has done so through iOS and the explosion of casual, socially friendly games on mobile devices. Apple could be looking to carry that success to its streaming-media device.\nThe Twitter account, which made its first tweet Thursday, is the first vehicle for Apple’s game editors to talk to consumers. They will cover things like tips and previews, and have already dropped mentions of the beautiful artwork in “Monument Valley” and the music in “Sword & Sworcery” — two well-regarded apps.\nApple wouldn’t be the first company to try to unseat — or at least run alongside — Sony, Microsoft. and Nintendo as the dominant videogame companies in the living room. Razer, Amazon.com and Nvidia Corp. have created streaming boxes that put casual games on the TV. None yet have become widespread hits.\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-latest-challenge-topping-its-own-success-1441230293", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD867_appgam_G_20150904090843.jpg", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/apple-will-debut-new-apple-tv-in-september#.ytlZ7W5NL", "http://9to5mac.com/2015/08/31/apple-tv-gaming-siri-bluetooth-remote/", "https://twitter.com/AppStoreGames", "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/08/27/apple-announces-sept-9-event/"], "published": "2015-09-07T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:56:29.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
