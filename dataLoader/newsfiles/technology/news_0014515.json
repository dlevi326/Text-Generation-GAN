We hear stories, some good and many bad, but we don't know what it was really like. This movie looks into that portrayal of Steve Jobs.\" \nWhen asked whether the movie portrayed Apple's founding story well, Wozniak said that really wasn't really the focus of the film. \n\"This movie is not about the history of Apple; it is about Steve Jobs' personality,\" he said. \nWozniak also waved off a question about whether the film accurately depicted Jobs, as compared to a Jobs documentary just released by director Alex Gibney. \nThe documentary, \"Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine,\" portrays Jobs as a temperamental genius who was rude and disparaging to his colleagues. Apple executive Eddy Cue derided the film on Twitter , calling it \"an inaccurate and mean-spirited view of my friend.\" Very disappointed in SJ:Man in the Machine. An inaccurate and mean-spirited view of my friend. It's not a reflection of the Steve I knew. â€” Eddy Cue (@cue) March 16, 2015 \nWozniak said he has not yet seen the Gibney documentary, though he has \"heard from several people who have seen it, and they have all said that it matches their dealings with Jobs.\" \nThough many have said Jobs could be difficult, Wozniak said he never found Jobs to be that way. \n\"I have read that it deals with a lot of his unkind personality, but he basically never exhibited that towards me, at least not directly,\" Wozniak added. \nAs for the biopic's ability to capture Steve Jobs' personality, \"The viewer can draw many conclusions,\" Wozniak said. \"I predict that the masses will like the Danny Boyle movie very much, or will at least acknowledge it as a good movie, for what it is.\" \nThe film, starring Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs and Seth Rogen as Wozniak, premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado over Labor Day weekend. The movie will debut in theaters nationwide on October 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T16:22:57.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
