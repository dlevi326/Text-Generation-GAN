FreeCast, operator of the $10-a-year Rabbit TV Plus service and soon-to-launch Select TV, is already reimagining the traditional cable value proposition for the always-connected and on-demand 21st century. As perhaps the first virtual MSO (Multiple System Operator), FreeCast bundles free ad-supported content with premium subscription-based and pay-per-view offerings. Unlike traditional MSOs, this content is made available on all devices and accessible from any internet connection.\nFreeCast CEO William Mobley compared the vast online video landscape pulled together by Rabbit TV to today's familiar cable TV offerings: \"We're doing exactly what your current big MSOs do. We provide our users with free HDTV antennas so that they can receive their live local broadcasts from ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, the CW, Ion, Univision, and more, just like basic cable. Next you have subscription content, which includes your cable channels: Animal Planet, A&E, Discovery, the History Channel, NBA TV, as well as premiums like HBO and Showtime to name a few. We offer many of these, as well as web-based packages like Sling TV, Netflix, and more. Last there's pay-per-view. With cable you can pay-per-view for sporting events and recent movies, while we offer hundreds of thousands of movies on-demand in addition to sports, events, and concerts from around the globe.\"\nCosting just $10 annually, and boasting over 4 million subscribers, FreeCast's Rabbit TV is already a formidable foe for a cable TV industry increasingly plagued by cord-cutting. As consumers find themselves both limited to content that appears on cable and broadcast networks, while simultaneously forced to pay for potentially hundreds of unwanted channels, it's no surprise that FreeCast's web-first a la carte interpretation of the cable TV is finding new fans at such a rapid rate.\nMore Information:\nCompany: http://freecast.com\nNetwork: http://rabbittvgo.com\nProduct: http://rabbittvplus.com\n release/freecast-replicates-multibillion-dollar-cable-tv-operators-online-412962.php", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/freecast-replicates-multibillion-dollar-cable-tv-operators-online-412962.php"], "published": "2015-09-21T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T11:25:53.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
