Say what you want about these poor people's beliefs, they did not go to Mecca hoping to die.\nThis is a human tragedy, and I don't think we should participate in or condone in recommendations about how these people's beliefs caused their deaths; they grew up in Muslim cultures, and participated in a communal religious/cultural event, and their deaths are human tragedies.\nMohamed Saeed in an opinion piece (1) had this to say:\n“In the final analysis, whilst we feel distressed, hurt and are all deeply saddened by this heartbreak, as Muslims we must remind ourselves of the verse of the Quran: “We created you from earth, and into it we shall return you, and from it we shall bring you out once again”.\nDeath is inevitable; it’s a reality that every living creature has to face. Every soul shall taste death.\nHow blessed and fortunate are these pilgrims. They will meet Almighty, their creator, in a state of purity and chanting his greatness.\nTo Quote: the Prophet Muhammad: “you will rise on the day of Resurrection in the state you have passed away.”\nWell of course everyone is entitled to believe what they want and each culture must be seen in its cultural context. However is this not another, in a series of mass deaths at or near Mecca, driven by ignorant religious superstition?\nThe religion requires everyone who is able to undergo a Hajj during their lifetime to Mecca. In other words if these people were not involved with religion, there would not be 1 582 dead and injured. So this tragedy was avoidable. Surely the value of one life is worth more than all the superstition in the world?\nTragic stampede events like this are not limited to religious events as some soccer games have also been notorious for stampede deaths triggered by poor public planning/security or mob hysteria. In any given situation where there are hundreds to thousands of people gathered for an event for whatever reason, this type of tragedy has the potential to happen.\nHowever attending a soccer game or any other secular event is a choice and not a requirement or a demand from on high.\n(1) voices.news24.com/mohamed-saeed/2015/09/mina-stampede-death-inevitable/", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T12:04:09.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
