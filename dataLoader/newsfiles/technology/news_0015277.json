(Photo: Business Wire) \nIn the Kingdom of Hytopia, a fashion-obsessed realm where sartorial elegance is celebrated, an evil witch has placed a mysterious curse upon Princess Styla, casting the realm into disarray. With citizens calling for the return of a legendary trio of “Totem Heroes” to protect them, and King Tuft offering a unique reward for whosoever lifts the curse, venture into the Drablands to hunt down the witch and restore peace and stylishness to the land. \nEach of the game’s 36 outfits comes with its own special abilities that help the three Link characters solve puzzles and navigate difficult terrain. For example, “Goron Garb” allows Link to swim in lava, while the “Zora Costume” helps him swim through water with greater speed. \nYou also have a variety of ways to explore the game across its 32 stages. You can play in solo mode along with two paper doll-like figures called “Doppels.” Or you can use an Internet connection to go online in multiplayer mode and partner with two other heroic players who also own the game. You can choose to team up with a combination of players who are and are not part of your Nintendo 3DS friend list. Finally, Download Play allows you to connect locally with two other friends who own a system in the Nintendo 3DS family, even if only one person has the game.Only by working as a team will you be able to progress through the various hazards lying in wait, but for those who master an area, bonus challenges can be unlocked for access to more valuable rewards. \nTo share your great acts of teamwork and skill from throughout the game with others, players can visit the Photo Bro shop managing the in-game Miiverse Gallery. As well as posting these snaps to Miiverse, you can even unlock Miiverse stamps, which you can apply to your hand-drawn creations. \nThe Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes launches on Oct. 23 exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS family of systems.
