VoIP SIP service is a great technology choice for businesses. VoIP SIP Advantages\nSession Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a protocol that initiates and manages interactive user sessions involving voice, video, instant messaging, and other such multimedia sessions. It is a 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) signaling protocol. It is one of the major signaling protocols used in VoIP SIP ( http://voipsip.org/ ).\nSIP was developed by IETF MMUSIC Working Group in an initiative to create a more robust standard compared to the H.323, which is a current widely used standard for voice sessions. The need was to cater to the increasing demand put by services such as video conferencing, unified messaging, and voice chatting, which are now being implemented through Internet.\nVoIP SIP ( http://8voip.net/ ) is based on Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It basically deals with embedding call setup and signaling features in networking elements such as user agents and proxy servers. The signaling and call setup can be used by IP-based communication system to support the call processing functions and features present in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). SIP enables a VoIP application to have the same kind of high quality and reliability that traditional telephone systems can deliver. SIP adds quality and reliability to VoIP, which until recently has been associated with the term low cost alternative.\nSIP handles the signaling part of a communication session. It serves as a carrier for the Session Description Protocol (SDP). SDP handles the media portion of the session. The transmission of voice and video content are done by the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). A SIP session thus involves packet streams of RTP. SIP is a part of the protocols involved in a multimedia session.\nThe major advantage of VoIP SIP ( http://www.solveforce.com/advisory-services.html ) is in its support for both IP and conventional telephone communication. Communication service providers can leverage on this protocol to interconnect conventional telephone and IP communication services. This especially sounds good for the vendors of VoIP telephony, wherein both the domains are involved. Owing to SIP's roots in HTTP, voice based application can also be seamlessly integrated with web services.\nAbout Solveforce Ethernet Fiber Internet\nVoipsip.org is managed by SolveForce, a Master Agency that offers its consulting services in Ohio, and has been providing business solutions since 2004.
