No, it's not by drones just yet. Instead, Amazon Flex will let individuals deliver packages in their local area, using a similar model to Uber or Nimber. To begin, they'll just need their own car and an Android smartphone. \nFlex has initially been launched in Seattle, and people interested in making deliveries as part of the service can sign up at the Flex website. Amazon says drivers will be able to work as much as they want throughout the week, work flexible hours and earn around US$18-25 per hour. \nDrivers must be at least 21 years old, have a valid driverâ€™s license and undergo a background check. Once that's done, they will be given access to the Flex app and will be able to start accepting delivery opportunities. \nAmong the next cities in which Flex will next roll out are Manhattan, Baltimore, Miami, Dallas, Austin, Chicago, Indianapolis, Atlanta and Portland (Oregon). As yet, there's no mention of cities outside the US. Although Flex couriers will require a car to begin, Amazon says that bike and foot deliveries may be added to the service in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T19:26:32.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
