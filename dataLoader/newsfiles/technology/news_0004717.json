( 1.usa.gov/1NQZIWX ) \nGroupon, once the leader of the fast-growing online coupons market, has been struggling to attract customers and boost sales due to stiff competition from smaller companies. \nAttractive deals from online marketplaces operated by companies including Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc have also hurt Groupon. \nGroupon said in April it would sell a 46 percent stake in its South Korean business as part of its turnaround efforts. \nThe company said any cost savings from the restructuring actions were expected to be \"immaterial\" in 2015. Groupon said it would reinvest cost savings in subsequent years in the business. \nGroupon's shares were down about 1 percent in early trading. \n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey) \nOur top photos from the last 24 hours.
