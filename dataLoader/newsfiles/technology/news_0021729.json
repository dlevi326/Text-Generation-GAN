While they have a streaming device with the Apple TV, they've been wanting to delve more into the entertainment industry. \nApple has a good start with its new Apple Music streaming service to compete with the likes of Spotify, Pandora, and others. But they've been courting media companies as well to try and do something similar with TV and movies. Yet every time we think this might be the year for it, the year will pass with no new viewing service. \nWhile they are still working on that, Business Insider is reporting that Apple is also meeting with Hollywood executives looking to make their own original TV shows and movies, similar to what Netflix is doing with Orange Is the New Black and its multiple movie deal with Adam Sandler. \nRecently Apple made an \"unprecedented bid\" for the hosts of Top Gear —Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond—after they left the BBC show dedicated to cars back in July. Amazon beat Apple to the punch when then offered Clarkson alone $36 million. \nThis proposed service would leave Apple open to charging a monthly service for the content, similar to what Netflix does for its content. While iTunes currently offers movies and television shows, it's all a la carte. It would end up to be a visual version of what they offer now for Apple Music. That service has a going rate of $9.99 for an individual, and it's looking at a possible starting price of $40 a month for TV and movies along with cable stations. \nAssumedly, that service would then be available on all of Apple's devices – computers, iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches, iWatches, and of course Apple TV. To go along with this, the company is rumored to be debuting a new and improved Apple TV at their September 9 event where new iPhones are set to debut as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T09:05:07.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
