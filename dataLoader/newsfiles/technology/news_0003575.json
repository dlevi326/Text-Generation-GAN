The company, with new capital resources and executive leadership, has aligned its TeamForge platform and global training and services offerings with the needs of leading software organizations - where the flexibility to embrace a wide range of tools and processes must be combined with complete traceability and governance across the entire software delivery lifecycle. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150505/213850LOGO \n\"We see customers deploying DevOps as an extension of Agile practices and, subsequently, they increasingly need a single collaboration and integration environment to incrementally improve the efficiency and speed with which software is developed and deployed,\" said Flint Brenton, CEO for CollabNet. \"At CollabNet we have embraced open source and the notion of centralized flexibility and visibility since our founding more than 16 years ago. With recent major upgrades to TeamForge, we are ready to lead our customers and the industry in advancing the art of modern software delivery.\" \nCollabNet is a pioneer in two primary areas of software delivery - enterprise management of open-source SCM and helping software organizations manage large numbers of distributed developers and teams. It allows customers to use any tool or process, and deploy software using on-premise, SaaS or public/private clouds. It connects tools through deep integrations that reach into data and supporting content, provides history and context across tasks and functions, and promotes enterprise-wide visibility for both strategic planning and technical resource re-use. Its open-source SCM solutions are unparalleled, allowing IT organizations to manage Subversion and Git side-by-side with enterprise-grade management, traceability and visibility. \nCollabNet's strategy is focused on helping customers achieve transformational success in three major areas: \nAgile Development : CollabNet has a deep history helping organizations adopt and scale Agile-based development practices. Its training division has trained more ScrumMasters than any organization in the industry, and its global professional services team continues to help some the largest development organizations in the world scale initiatives beyond small teams. Recent releases of TeamForge include major enhancements for more in-depth Agile planning and reporting, Kanban and Lean support, and deeper integrations to JIRA and other widely used third party tools. To help scale organization-wide velocity, new Kanban boards have been introduced to allow Scrum and Kanban teams to share a common backlog for more effective collaboration. CollabNet will continue to add Agile functionality to its platform, embrace preferred tools and processes into its integration ecosystem, and offer public training and advanced consulting services that address the challenges of scaling Agile within large and complex software delivery environments. \nDevOps : Moving beyond the \"culture\" of DevOps requires a single, unified tool-chain that connects data, tasks and functions across the software development and deployment lifecycle. CollabNet TeamForge is recognized by analyst firms like Gartner as the most open application platform for integrating tools and processes for both enterprise-scale Agile and now - automated DevOps. Working with its largest enterprise customers, with up to 85,000 users on a single TeamForge instance, CollabNet has added resources and capabilities to TeamForge to lead the industry in adopting DevOps practices. In addition to integration partnerships with Chef, Opscode, Automic, JIRA, HP, Puppet and Jenkins, CollabNet recently introduced a new Associations Viewer that visually presents granular associations between related artifacts and activities throughout the application lifecycle, from requirement to deployment. The company's focus, investment and commitment to DevOps success will continue with integration innovation, training and consulting, and working hand-in-hand with leading software organization to link best practices to automated, technical workflows. In addition, CollabNet recently hired industry veteran and DevOps expert Eric Robertson to lead CollabNet's progress in this area. \nEnterprise SCM, Open Source and Commercial Tools : CollabNet has and will continue to offer the industry's strongest support for leading open source and commercial tools. Significant capital and technical resources have led to industry-first offerings that address the wide-spread use of these popular tools in the enterprise. For instance, it recently rolled out new, deeper integrations with Atlassian JIRA® that give users the ability to leverage TeamForge's best-in-class enterprise SCM capabilities for Git and Subversion. TeamForge also connects JIRA with tools like Jenkins and Nexus, while visually associating JIRA issues with related downstream artifacts and activities, such as CI builds and code reviews. It also has strengthened its offerings for best-in-class, enterprise-grade SCM management for distributed Git, with replication, branch-level protection, visualization and comparison support. For a connected view and governance, advanced reporting capabilities within and across functions measures and monitors project status and team performance. Only CollabNet now offers open-source SCM and portfolio-level reports to monitor progress and compare performance across open source and third-party commercial tools for better predictability and productivity. \n\"In many ways the changing dynamics of software delivery, where flexibility and a centralized view of tools and activities are a critical imperative, are coming to CollabNet and playing to our strengths as a company,\" says Brenton. \"Our new strategy is to sharpen our focus, and to listen closely to our customers and the industry for ways that we can contribute to the advancement of Agile, DevOps and open source SCM not as separate initiatives, but as a highly orchestrated, connected and automated workflow.\" \nTweet This: A new sharpened strategy for @collabnet focuses on enterprise #Agile, #DevOps & #opensource success.
