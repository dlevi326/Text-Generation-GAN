Xi and Obama were then to meet at Blair House, across the street from the White House. For Xi, the visit is about recognition of China’s status as a world power.\nAlthough both sides seek to present an image of cooperation and improved relations, Obama has a growing list of complaints on issues such as easing restrictions on U.S. businesses operating in China, currency policy, a maritime dispute in the South China Sea and human rights.\nThe top issue from the U.S. standpoint is the hacking of corporate computer systems to steal trade secrets or gain economic advantage. Obama and his top aides have repeatedly raised the prospect of U.S. sanctions if concerns over hacking aren’t adequately addressed.\n“It is clear that China now understands just how seriously we take this issue,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday, before Xi’s arrival.\nXi’s Promise Xi has denied that the Chinese government supports cyber attacks for commercial purposes. He said in Seattle that China was ready to establish a “high-level, joint-dialogue mechanism” with the U.S. to address the cyber issue.\nObama has said he wants a framework with China governing behavior in cyberspace. National security officials from both countries have met in recent weeks to discuss an accord. The administration has drawn a distinction between hacking for economic gain and traditional espionage.\nThe two countries had high-level exchanges on cyber issues that were suspended after the U.S. indicted five Chinese military officials last year on charges that they stole trade secrets from companies including Westinghouse Electric Co. and United States Steel Corp. China has denied engaging in economic espionage.\nState Visit Xi will make his formal arrival at the White House Friday morning, where he will be greeted with a military band and a 21-gun salute. That will be followed by an Oval Office meeting with Obama, a news conference with the two leaders at mid-day and a state dinner in the evening.\nThe amount of progress made on cybersecurity and other issues will be shaped by Obama’s private dinner with Xi on Thursday, Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser, said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.\nRecounting previous private dinners between Obama and Xi -- in California in 2013 and last year in China -- Rhodes said the two leaders typically set aside their talking points and have frank, free-wheeling discussions that later result in policy.\n“The most constructive engagements were when they were able to talk for several hours over dinner without a formal agenda,” Rhodes told reporters. “I think as we look ahead to this state visit, starting with that private dinner is very important.”\nEconomic Policy Obama will press Xi on China’s economic policy, which has drawn growing U.S. concern in recent months. The Chinese government’s move to prop up shares in its stock market, devalue its currency and raise barriers for U.S. companies “distorts the global economy,” National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Monday in a speech at George Washington University, previewing Xi’s visit.\nObama may try to persuade Xi to back away from two draft laws under consideration in China that crack down on foreign non-governmental organizations and U.S. technology firms in the banking sector.\nWhile points of tension abound, Xi and Obama will also seek to highlight areas of consensus, said Amy Celico , a China expert and former official at the U.S. Department of State who’s now a principal at the Albright Stonebridge Group, a consulting firm in Washington.\nThe U.S. will focus on cooperation with China on climate change, combating global disease and securing a deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, Rhodes said.", "external_links": ["http://www.albrightstonebridge.com/team/amy-celico\\"], "published": "2015-09-25T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T01:07:33.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
