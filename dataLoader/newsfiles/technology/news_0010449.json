Clashes were a regular feature during Moharram, when Shia muslims observe “matam” (mourning) to mark the martyrdom of Hussain, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, in the battle of Karbala at the hands of Yazidis.\nAtif Hanif, member of the core group of “Shoulders-to-Shoulders”, told Deccan Herald that this kind of joint prayer had never been held in the city before.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T06:35:19.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
