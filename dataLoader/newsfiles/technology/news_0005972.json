Utilizing a commercial device featuring an LTE modem with the Altair FourGee-1160 chipset and Anritsu's MD8430A/RTD LTE Signaling Tester, the demonstration will show ultra-low power consumption enabled by Power Saving Mode (PSM). By virtue of this exclusive demonstration, LTE Cat. 0 technology is ready for deployment into IoT devices ranging from refrigerators to industrial machinery. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150410/197878LOGO \n\"Anritsu is pleased to collaborate with Altair Semiconductor at CTIA Super Mobility 2015 to showcase our latest advance that supports LTE CAT-0,\" said Wade Hulon, President of Anritsu Company. \"Solutions to verify the performance of IoT devices are a natural extension of our industry leading LTE test portfolio. We will continue to offer solutions that will enable the development of consumer and industrial devices utilizing CAT-0 and LTE-M as the market expands to add the projected billions of IoT devices over the next few years.\" \n\"CAT-1 and CAT-0 will play a crucial role over the next few years in helping module and device manufacturers offer true IoT solutions,\" said Eran Eshed, Co-Founder and VP of Marketing and Business Development at Altair. \"This demonstration with Anritsu shows the significant power savings our FourGee-1160 CAT-1 and CAT-0 chipset can offer today.\" \nThe MD8430A is a scalable LTE network simulator, with six models ranging from Functional Test Model (FTM) to Enhanced Test Model (ETM), and available software options for both LTE FDD and TDD for any model. The associated Rapid Test Designer (RTD) graphical test software enables quick scripting of tests, with an intuitive user interface as well as available layer 3 and lower-layer libraries. \nThe FourGee-1160 is the industry's first chipset optimized for LTE CAT-1 and CAT-0. It features ultra-low power consumption, support for a variety of typical host/peripheral interfaces, an embedded power management unit and a flexible application layer with hardware based security. \nThe chipset has been adopted by numerous M2M/IoT module and device makers and is expected to ship commercially 4Q this year. \nAbout Altair Semiconductor \nAltair Semiconductor is a leading provider of single-mode LTE chipsets.
