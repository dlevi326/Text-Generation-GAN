Apple Music has a very similar family share deal, offering six people a group membership for $14.99.\nSpotify and Rdio both let you add an additional user for $5 each, but Spotify caps the maximum number of members at five people for a total of $30 per month.\nOn the same pricing tier, Tidal is also offering 50 percent off each extra person you add-- a family of five would pay $30 per month for the household, which is double the cost for the same family on Google Play Music or Apple Music.\nWith the Play Music plan, each family member will get full access to their own account on their own phones, which includes access to a host of curated playlists, artist recommendations, and top music charts.\nNo word yet from the company on when the new family plan will roll out, but it's likely that we'll see it happen before the end of the year.\nThis is a developing story.
