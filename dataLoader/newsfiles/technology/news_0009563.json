The company, which makes insurance claims software, said last month that it was exploring a sale. Shareholders of Solera Holdings Inc. will receive $55.85 for each share they own. That's a 13 percent premium to the Westlake, Texas, company's Friday closing price of $49.45. The companies put the deal's value at about $6.5 billion, including debt. Solera's board unanimously approved the acquisition. The transaction is targeted to close no later than 2016's first quarter. It still needs approval from Solera shareholders. Solera's stock gained $4.05, or 8 percent, to $53.50 before the opening bell on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:17:42.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
