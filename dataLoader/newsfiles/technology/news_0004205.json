Peter Schofield Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Look around a shopping centre in five years time and every T-shirt, every pair of shoes and every handbag will include electronics, according to Australian wearable tech entrepreneur Ben Moir.\nSpeaking at the Creative3 conference in Brisbane this week, Mr Moir (the co-founder of Snepo Research and Wearable Experiments) is just one of a number of speakers on the agenda in the wearable tech industry and he's confident the \"era of wearables is only just beginning\".\n\"The big and slow companies don't need to lead because they have existing markets. This is a challenge for new companies to come in and become the next big companies,\" he said.\nHeightened sense Snepo Research and Wearable Experiments co-founder Ben Moir says wearable tech will \"creep up\" on us until it's as ingrained in society as the smartphone. Supplied Through his business Wearable Experiments, Mr Moir was one of the main forces behind Durex's fundawear campaign.\nFundawear is the world's first smart underwear which lets physical touch be transferred through a smartphone app to a partner anywhere in the world.\nWearable Experiments, which is based in New York, also teamed up with CHE Proximity to create Foxtel's alert shirt which lets Fox Footy AFL viewers feel what the players are feeling in real-time.\n\"You can tap into the emotions of the players and the shirt lets you know their heartbeat, if they were exhausted or if they're frustrated. You get a heightened sense of what's happening,\" Mr Moir said.\n The shirt converts data on the player's physical condition into sensations.\n\"We've also created the navigate jacket which lets you punch directions into your phone and then the jacket tells you where to head,\" Mr Moir said.\n\"The jacket is more of a concept, we didn't launch it in stores, but it's something to educate people about how wearables need to be fashionable. People don't want to look like a computer.\"\nThe business, which is self-funded, is also expanding into fitness, creating yoga wearables.\n\"It will be like your own personal coach… it's about awareness of your body. We've got too many apps telling you how many steps you're doing. I know how many, not enough,\" he said.\nDisappointing Mr Moir's comments come at a time when smartwatch sales have disappointed experts.\nTelsyte figures released earlier this month revealed the Apple Watch had only sold about 165,000 in Australia since launching earlier this year.\nOnly 205,000 smartwatches were sold in the first half of 2015, compared to 3.7 million smartphones.\nAt the same time, 30 per cent of the smart fitness bands purchased were gifts and 15 per cent of the base users were no longer wearing their bands.\n\"It's still early days, you can criticise what's out there, but people didn't buy the first mobile phone which came out either. This is going to creep up on us,\" Mr Moir said.\n\"After wearing the Apple Watch for two weeks I'm addicted to it. I actually screen more calls and choose not to respond to as many text messages… It's given me time back.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/qb7DN3kpl2o", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-09-16T08:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:21:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
