Previously, mothers could take eight weeks, while no paid leave was offered to fathers.\nU.S. technology companies including Netflix Inc and Microsoft Corp have recently increased maternity leave as a way to keep and attract staff.\nYahoo said in its corporate blog on Tuesday that it was \"extremely happy\" for Mayer and supported her plans and approach.\nMayer, who has been married to start-up investor Zachary Bogue since 2009, was an executive at Google Inc before taking the helm at Yahoo in 2012.\nMayer has a net worth of about $380 million, according to Forbes. Her pay package jumped 69 percent to $42 million in 2014, mostly due to gains in Yahoo's stock price despite concerns about the health of its business.\nAmazon to limit Prime's...
