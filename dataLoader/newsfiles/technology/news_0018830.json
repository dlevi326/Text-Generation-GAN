According to Vancouver, Washington-based engineer Jay Small, however, waterproof cycling gloves have a harder time keeping out the rain while also letting the sweat escape. His solution? Use regular dry-weather gloves, and his DriBarz handlebar fairing. \nDriBarz reportedly installs on drop-style handlebars in seconds via rubber straps, fitting over Shimano, Campagnolo or SRAM brake hoods. The transparent aerodynamic cowlings protect the rider's hands from rain (and wind chill), while still allowing sweat moisture to exit through the back and bottom. \nAdditionally, a cycling computer, headlight or other device can be mounted on the bar joining the two cowlings, freeing up space on the handlebars. While it does look like water might just run down the arms of the user's jacket and onto their gloves, Small claims that most such water is blown off of the sleeves while riding. \nShould you be interested, DriBarz is currently the subject of a Kickstarter campaign. A pledge of US$89 will get you a set, when and if they reach production. You can see the product in use, in the following video. \nPotential buyers might also want to check out Bar Mitts .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T05:56:38.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
