For the first semester 2015, Adwen almost reaches 20% of the grid connected capacity in Europe, while Adwen turbines represent almost 19% of the cumulated installed capacity in Germany. \nBeyond its contribution to the offshore wind expansion in Germany, Adwen is committed to develop economic growth with 550 people directly employed and partnerships with a wide network of suppliers and subcontractors across the country. \nThe manufacturing, installation and commissioning of 120 turbines is an invaluable experience that will accelerate the development of Adwen and benefit to the upcoming projects, such as Wikinger, Iberdrola's 350 MW project in the Baltic Sea. \nThe lessons-learned combined with a proven technological platform also offer reinforced foundations for Adwen new generation turbine the AD 8-180, which serial production is planned to begin from 2018 in Adwen factories in Germany and France. \n\"Trianel wind farm Borkum and Global Tech I are a new milestone in Adwen's development. We could achieve those projects thanks to the confidence of our customers, the expertise and continuous commitment of our teams and a reliable and efficient technology. They will further pave the way of our rapid expansion\" said Luis Alvarez, Adwen General Director. \nAdwen is a 50-50 joint-venture of AREVA and Gamesa dedicated to offshore wind. Adwen is responsible for the design, manufacturing, installation, commissioning and services of offshore wind turbines. \nCombining both AREVA and Gamesa wind expertise and extensive track-record, Adwen is ideally positioned to become a leading player in the offshore wind segment with the objective of garnering a market share of close to 20% in Europe by 2020. Adwen has corporate offices in France, Spain, the UK and Germany. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T11:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T22:11:11.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
