Remote sensing consists of acquiring information about a specific object in the vicinity of a sensor without making physical contact with the object. Countless applications, including automotive driver assistance, robot guidance, traffic management and level sensing, exist for this technique.\nMultiple technology options are available for remote sensing which can be divided into three broad applications:\n· Presence or proximity detection, where the absence or presence of an object in a general area is the only information that is required (e.g., for security applications). This is the simplest form of remote sensing;\n· Speed measurement, where the exact position of an object does not need to be known but where its accurate speed is required (e.g., for law enforcement applications); and\n· Detection and ranging, where the position of an object relative to the sensor needs to be precisely and accurately determined.\nTo request the entire paper, go to: bit.ly/1Nt5gn2\nLeddarTech will be exhibiting at the upcoming Robobusiness show from September 23-24 in San Jose Convention Center, California at booth #301.\nAbout LeddarTech\nLeddarTech is the owner and provider of the patented, leading-edge Leddar sensing technology which enables advanced detection and ranging systems.
