It was an interactive forum where diverse cross-sections of the public gained insight of each other's cultures, subject views and life perspectives.\nAs a result of the ability to comment and exchange views, your readership numbers swelled and 'real' friendships and camaraderie developed among the readers who felt they 'knew' each other. Regardless of the fact that it appeared that some commenters had heated exchanges on various subjects, those commenters returned again and again much to everyone's reading pleasure.\nThe decision to silence the public on this forum and shut down the inter-activeness of MyNews24 will result in bored and disinterested readers, reading articles to which they cannot respond or voice their opinions.\nAs a result, MyNews24 will lose readership.\nPeople are not interested in being 'spoken to' and want the ability to air their views.\nI do not know what pressures lie behind your decision to ban commentary but suspect that now, even if you change your stance and try to revert your decision; you have driven away the core attraction of your website and it will be too late to restore the appeal of what was MyNews24 and News24.\nYour readers and commenters will have lost their trust and interest in N24.\nIt was not a good decision. N24 will never become a CNN or BBC or other lofty aspiration without it's readership and no one is interested in or loyal to a dictatorship of any kind.\nAn ill-considered decision by N24. Unless of course, your aim is to become the home of specific indoctrination [be it political or other] with daily broadcast of specific ideology only.\nJust be aware that it will have limited public appeal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:08:49.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
