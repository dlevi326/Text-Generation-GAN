She says the toy wrongfully appropriates her name and persona, harms her professional credibility as a journalist and is an insult. \n“Hasbro’s portrayal of Faulkner as a rodent is demeaning and insulting,” says the lawsuit, which was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in New Jersey. \nFaulkner has been at Fox News for a decade. She hosts the daytime show “Outnumbered” and anchors a Sunday evening newscast. \nHer lawsuit says that in addition to sharing her name, the toy bears a physical resemblance to Faulkner’s traditional professional appearance, including its complexion, eye shape and eye- makeup design. \nThe Harris Faulkner toy was introduced in 2014, according to the lawsuit, and was sold in a package as the pet hamster of a terrier named Benson Detwyler. Other toys in the popular line include animals named Pancakes Watkins, Puffball Petrovsky and Pepper Clark. \nThe lawsuit says Faulkner never gave permission for Hasbro to use her name or likeness and that she even demanded in January that Hasbro stop using it. \nJulie Duffy, a Hasbro spokeswoman, said the company doesn’t comment on litigation, but she took issue with the lawsuit’s contention that the doll is a “known choking hazard that risks harming small children.” Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T08:17:50.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
