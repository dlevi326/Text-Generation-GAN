It is one of the vehicles that Continental Japan disclosed to mass media Sept 3, 2015. [Click to enlarge image] The vehicle automatically carrying out parallel parking. Its steering, accelerator and brakes are automatically operated. [Click to enlarge image] \nContinental Japan, which is a Japanese subsidiary of Germany-based Continental, disclosed a prototyped car featuring an automatic parking function to mass media Sept 3, 2015. \nThe vehicle automatically finds vacant parking spaces, shows them on its display and parks the vehicle in a space selected by the driver. Moreover, if there is an obstacle located at the back, the vehicle automatically detects it and applies the brakes. \nAccording to Continental Japan, no automatic emergency braking system capable of detecting objects located to the rear side has been commercialized. So, its system might become the world's first such system. The company is planning to release it in 2016 or 2017 and is developing it in cooperation with automakers. \nThe prototyped vehicle supports parallel parking (both rear-to-front and side-to-side). To detect vacant spaces, ultrasonic sensors and cameras are used. The vehicle is equipped with 12 ultrasonic sensors (six each on the front and rear sides) and four cameras (in the center of the front grille, a central area behind the trunk and the lower parts of the right and left door mirrors). \nThe ultrasonic sensors detect unmoving objects located in the 10m-diameter area centered at the vehicle, and the cameras are used to distinguish objects, white lines, etc through image recognition. \nWhen there are vacant parking spaces, they are shown on the (touch-sensitive) display. The display shows the vehicle and the area surrounding it, and the parking spaces are depicted in white color. The driver touches a white area to select a parking space and start automatic parking. \nIf there is an (unmoving) obstacle in the space, an alarm sound is issued and the emergency brakes are automatically applied. The cameras are used for the recognition of such obstacles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T12:26:47.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
