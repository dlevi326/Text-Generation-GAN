REASON FOR THE REPORT: As mass produced ceramic capacitor products move to low-cost manufacturing regions, ceramic capacitor manufacturers in Japan, Korea, China, USA, Germany, UK and France must re-evaluate their existing production facilities in high-cost regions, and reposition their product portfolios to address markets that will remain localized. The majority of these markets require value-added and application-specific ceramic capacitors that can operate under high reliability specifications and in harsh environments. This market study sheds light on the fragmented, low volume, high value, high profit portion of the global ceramic capacitor industry. BENEFITS OF THE REPORT: This report gives detailed intelligence data on the specialty segment of the global ceramic capacitor market, where operating margins are the highest and where price is secondary to component quality and performance. As the low picofarad MLCC markets become inundated with suppliers, companies with smaller economies of scale must refocus all or part of their product portfolio to address more profitable segments of the market. This new focus should include application specific ceramic capacitors to increase profit margins and delay the continued price erosion in their overall ceramic capacitor product offering, and to understand the competitive environment, demand by world region, pricing, technology, and opportunities through detailed forecasts to 2020.
