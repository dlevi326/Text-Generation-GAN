In her remarks, Sitharaman highlighted the important role of the Indian IT companies on corporate social responsibilities (CSR). \n\"If u take the three top Indian companies-the role by them played in CSR is just unbelievable,\" she said.

And TCS has just announced a grant of more than USD 30 million towards a technology center in Carnegie Melon University, she said. \n\"These are examples that show that Indian companies do bring in something knowledge, create job. It is absolutely useful for public discourse. It assures the American company that they add to the US economy and do not take away jobs in India,\" Sitharaman said. \nIndian Ambassador to the US Arun K Singh said Indian IT companies are playing an important role in the leadership role that the US has in the field of innovation. The US is a world leader in innovation, and Indian companies through their work are contributing to profitability, competitiveness and innovation being done by US companies, he said. \nAccording to the report, India-based IT services companies paid more than USD 20 billion dollars between 2011-2015 in US federal, state, and local taxes. \nThey have also paid USD 375 million in 2011-2015 to the US Treasury including funds to help America secure its borders.
