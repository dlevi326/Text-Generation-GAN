The article notes that people who find that they have a tender protrusion, itching, rectal bleeding, and a variety of other symptoms should not delay scheduling an appointment to determine if they have a hernia, or any other type of medical issue that will likely require treatment. According to Dr. Shirin Towfigh, a leading hernia specialist and the head surgeon and physician of the Beverly Hills Hernia Center, getting to the initial diagnosis is a very important step that often occurs far too late in the process, if at all. Dr. Towfigh notes that there are important steps that can be taken by both doctors and patients to ensure that patients receive a correct diagnosis before any damage occurs:\nPatients: “Reaching Out” – While doctors should be the ones held responsible for the treatment of their patients, Dr. Towfigh acknowledges that it is up to the patient to seek out treatment in the first place. All too often, she notes, too many patients attempt to “tough it out” when it comes to dealing with seemingly minor medical problems. Yet, simply because the symptoms of a medical problem may seem mild at the beginning, doesn’t mean they will remain that way. Because many patients have a preconceived notion of hernias appearing painfully and immediately when lifting, twisting, or coughing, those that develop slowly can be ignored. Just as with many other areas of medicine, preventative care is the best approach to ensure serious hernia-related pain or health effects do not occur. Doctors: “Getting it Right” – Once patients take the first step to have a consultation with a hernia expert or their general physician to get to the bottom of their pain or symptoms, it is up to the physician to use all of the tools available in order to make a correct diagnosis. Far too often, Dr. Towfigh notes, the pain that female hernia patients in particular suffer from is incorrectly ascribed to some other medical condition. This initial misdiagnosis has the unfortunate effect of both prolonging the pain experienced by the patients, but also increasing the chance that the hernia may develop very serious complications. Dr. Towfigh notes that imaging technology such as MRI is an incredibly important piece in the hernia diagnostician’s toolset, and further implementation by physicians can help decrease misdiagnosis.\nDr. Towfigh concludes that patients should heed the advice of articles such as this and seek out the guidance of a hernia specialist, even if they have only the smallest suspicion that they may be suffering from a hernia.
