It even allows them to open the garage door for when they arrive home and set the heating. \nIt is an area where Silicon Valley giants Google and Apple are also active. \nThey may not have their own exhibit at the IAA yet, but their apps and technologies are almost omnipresent among new cars on display. And Google executives have come to Frankfurt this year to participate in round-table discussions. \nIf the two US tech giants are cooperating with automakers, they are also seen as potential rivals, as Google is working on a self-driving car of its own and there are rumblings about an Apple electric car. \n- 'Smartphones on wheels' - \n\"Carmakers, very strong in the traditional world of the automobile, are seeking to maintain their position,\" said Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center for Automotive Research. \n\"But groups like Google and Apple are also trying to move into the market. And the industry takes them seriously given their financial firepower and strength of innovation.\" \nIn the area of alternative powertrains, the success of startups such as Tesla, the US maker of luxury electric cars, is also forcing traditional manufacturers to sit up and take notice. \nElectric cars are still very much a niche market, both in the United States and Europe. \nBut with double- and even triple-digit growth seen in some countries, German carmakers, for one, are determined not to be edged out of the race. \nMartin Winterkorn, head of Volkswagen, said that Europe's biggest car maker was \"in the process of reinventing itself\". \n\"We will launch 20 new electric and hybrids by 2020 ... and by the end of the decade, we will have transformed all of our new cars into smartphones on wheels,\" he said. \n- Changing relationships - \nAnother trend the industry is watching is the changing relationship between people and their cars. \nAs cities become ever more crowded, fewer and fewer people see any advantage in actually having their own car. And they no longer see it as the status symbol it once was. \nThat means business models such as car-sharing are mushrooming and manufacturers like Daimler and BMW are keen to get a slice of the action. \nDrivy is a small French start-up making its first appearance at the IAA. \nLaunched in 2010, the company allows car-owners to rent out their vehicle to other people when they are not using it themselves. And Drivy describes itself as the European leader in the field. \n\"Fewer people are buying cars and are interested in new concepts of mobility like ours,\" the head of Drivy's German operations, Gero Graf, told AFP. \nExperts say that the combined forces of cooperation and competition have always driven the industry forward. \nStill, \"manufacturers may have to reinvent themselves at the risk of becoming mere parts suppliers and leave the creation of added value to Google,\" said German auto expert Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer. \nbur-esp/spm/fz/boc", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T16:32:13.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
