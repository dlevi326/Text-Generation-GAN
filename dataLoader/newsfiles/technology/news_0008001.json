It has a deck space of 71,400 square metres and door 6.50 metres high.\nAccording to Steinar Løvdal, Head of Capacity Management with Höegh Autoliners, “The launch of the Höegh Target is a milestone in the company’s history. This is the first Post-Panamax PCTC we have and the New Horizon design truly represents state-of-the-art Engineering”.\nHervé Cornède, Commercial and Marketing Director at HAROPA, said: “This call of the world’s largest Ro-Ro vessel confirms our port as the largest French platform for the import/export of new vehicles”.\nHAROPA Port of Le Havre also aims to facilitate the movement of second-hand “high and heavy” machines, heavy trucks and industrial projects markets; all of them using Ro-Ro shipping services.\nThe business offer of Höegh Autoliners via HAROPA Port of Le Havre covers several continents. Every ten days, a service of the shipping line serves the South-African countries as well as those in Oceania.\nTwice a month, a service connects the ports in the Mexican Gulf and the Caribbean Islands and another heads for ports in the Middle-East up to India, with possibilities of connection with Far-Eastern countries.\nAs for the Höegh Target, its first trips will be on the South Africa/Indian Ocean/Oceania route.\nManaging Director of HAROPA POTS Antoine Berbain is to write a Technical Paper on the HAROPA port system in the upcoming Mega-Ports Edition of PTI, to read a Q&A with Mr Berbain, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T18:18:25.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
