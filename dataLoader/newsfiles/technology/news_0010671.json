MindTap is available for 520 of Cengage's course areas and delivers a number of student functions â€” reading, homework, quizzes and flashcards. The new iOS and Android apps put some of those features into a mobile form to allow users to access the material on their smartphones in available \"pockets of time.\" \nMindTap Mobile is intended to act as a workflow manager for students. They're notified when an instructor sends a message, changes a due date or alters a grade. They can set reminders for what's due; review prebuilt flashcards or make their own; and take chapter-specific quizzes or generate self-quizzes from the flashcard deck. \n\"We set out to create a mobile product that adapts to students' busy lives outside of the classroom,\" said MindTap Product Director Jared Mann in a prepared statement. \"MindTap Mobile represents a subset of the MindTap experience that students told us would be most useful to have available right from their phone.\" About the Author \nDian Schaffhauser is a writer who covers technology and business for a number of publications.
