Relex's co-founder and CEO Mikko Kärkkäinen will also be speaking at the conference where he will reassure e-Tailers from across the UK that last year's chaotic Black Friday scenes can be avoided with good inventory planning and forecasting. \nThe fall-out from the pre-Christmas sales event has been a dominant topic amongst retailers in recent months and is sure to be uppermost in many attendees' minds as they gather for the eDelivery Conference 2015 in London this October. \nRelex will be exhibiting at stand 6 throughout the event where it will present its ground breaking technology that offers real time visibility and stock forecasting. In addition, Kärkkäinen, who started Relex after a career as a supply chain research scientist, will present from 11:55 to 12:25 on how the latest inventory management systems can support planning for seasonal and promotional campaigns and sharply improve performance. \n\"There's no simple single answer to planning for an event such as Black Friday or Cyber Monday,\" Kärkkäinen says, \"but by running all your channels as a unified operation, ensuring your supply chain is highly agile, pooling stock and avoiding silos, and by establishing common goals across your business, you'll have more happy customers and a lower risk of reputational damage.\" \n\"Good demand forecasting and inventory planning systems are the best foundation for running this sort of highly efficient supply chain operation.\" \nThe eDelivery Conference takes place at the Novotel, Hammersmith London on 13th October 2015 and will follow the board level agenda between expert, senior operations and supply chain leaders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T09:17:15.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
