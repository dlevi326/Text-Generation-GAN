Power 2015 Residential Television Service Provider and ISP Satisfaction Studies SM released today. In addition, AT&T High Speed Internet ranked highest in customer satisfaction among Internet service providers in the North Central Region, the study shows. DIRECTV and AT&T U-verse TV** and High Speed Internet ranked highest in overall satisfaction in the two studies that give customers the chance to evaluate performance and reliability, cost of service, communication, billing, and customer service. The TV study also ranks programming. \"We are honored to receive these customer rankings from J.D. Power,\" said John Stankey, CEO – AT&T Entertainment & Internet Services. \"We're proud of our history in this area and we know customers have many choices for TV and broadband, so it's gratifying to see that they place us at the top when it comes to their own experience. Our goal going forward is to provide them with an effortless entertainment experience anywhere.\" AT&T and DIRECTV have added many features over the past year that make the viewing and customer experience even better for customers. For example: DIRECTV continued its 2-decade legacy of TV innovation by becoming the first multi-channel video provider to offer 4K Ultra HD programming direct to customers' TVs. Its new 4K Genie Mini makes it easier for customers to watch 4K Ultra HD programming on a compatible 4K TV.*** AT&T U-verse now offers more than 241 live channels on the [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTloWW05MWRDNWhkSFF1WTI5dEwzTjBiM0o1TDNWd1pHRjBaWE5mZEc5ZmRYWmxjbk5sWDJGd2NDNW9kRzFzWENJZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCMFlYSm5aWFE5WENKZllteGhibXRjSWo1VkxYWmxjbk5sSUVGd2NDQm1iM0lnYzIxaGNuUndhRzl1WlhNZ1lXNWtJSFJoWW14bGRITThMMkUrfA==]], with more than 201 of those available to watch outside the home.
