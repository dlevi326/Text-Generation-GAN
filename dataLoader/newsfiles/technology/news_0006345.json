The 500,000-square-foot operation provides 50 percent of the chips Atmel sells. \nAtmel spokesman Peter Schuman said Sunday that the plant is an important part of the Atmel supply chain and many details still need to be worked out. \nAccording to the Colorado Springs Gazette (http://tinyurl.com/nvwjtbo ), San Jose, Calif.-based Atmel has been exploring a sale since CEO Steven Laub announced plans in May to retire in August. \nAtmel operates the only remaining semiconductor manufacturing plant in Colorado Springs.
