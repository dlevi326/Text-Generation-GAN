So many illegal butchers lurk near the abattoirs, having concealed their knives in a bag and solicit customers not far from where public security and traffic personnel are stationed.\nMany illegal butchers can be seen standing near roundabouts as well waiting for customers.\nThe charges of these butchers can reach up to a few hundred riyals depending on where they are taken and how many animals they slaughter, community elders say.\nThe Ministry of Environment has banned animal slaughter out of licensed abattoirs because of health risks posed by diseases animals and butchers may have which can be passed on to the meat eater.\n At the abattoirs, veterinarians check animals for diseases before slaughter and later test the meat to ensure if it is bacteria- or disease-free.\nButchers at the abattoirs are also issued health certifications that say they are fit to do the job.\nMeanwhile, Widam (Qatar Meat and Livestock Company) got enough printed coupons yesterday after Thursday’s shortages.\nThe company distributes coupons to people who buy animals for sacrifice to collect the meat.\nShare: Someone You Know Needs to Hear This", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T13:13:14.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
