Last week, it announced a link-up with Uber Technologies Inc and has also invested in three venture capital funds focusing on digital services.\n\"It's not about financial gain, (these) give us easier access to see what the new business models look like,\" Scott Gegenheimer, Zain Group chief executive, told a conference in Dubai. \"They're more agile than a lot of the telecom operators. We don't have the time and skill sets to do this in house.\"\nHe said Zain was interested in \"smart city\" initiatives, online advertising and television services.\n\"Digital advertising could be interesting - we're looking at two companies right now,\" said Gegenheimer.\nData provides about a fifth of Zain's revenue and this proportion is likely to increase.\n\"The amount of data we're giving away in our packages is not sustainable in the long run. In Europe, the U.S., the price for 1 or 2 gigabytes is the same as you pay in Saudi Arabia for 500 gigabytes,\" said Gegenheimer.\n\"We have to get some of these packages under control ... because (otherwise) you're not going to be able to monetise the data.\"\nZain, Kuwait's top mobile company by subscribers, has operations in eight countries including Sudan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.\nIts Sudan division, which accounts for a quarter of Zain's customers and a fifth of revenue, made a half-year net profit of $78 million, up 30 percent year-on-year. That ended a sustained earnings slump and Gegenheimer attributed the turnaround to a more stable Sudanese pound and easing local inflation.\n\"We've hedged a lot of our loans so don't have as much problem as before,\" Gegenheimer said.\nSudan's inflation rate slowed to 11.3 percent in August from 14.1 percent in July.
