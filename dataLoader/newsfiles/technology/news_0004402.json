But when one of Silicon Valley’s largest tech conferences ran out of space, it brought in a cruise ship.\nThough cruise liners can’t be hailed as easily as an Uber, Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, -0.23% went the extra mile to dock one of the massive vessels in San Francisco as the growth of its annual Dreamforce conference soaked up the city’s available hotel space. Dubbed the “Dreamboat,” the Carnival Cruises Ltd. cruise ship Infinity will house about 1,100 attendees — at $250 to $2,000 per night — for the conference, a measure Salesforce boasts is the first time any company has brought in a cruise ship for its own conference.\nSee the slideshow: Step aboard the “Dreamboat,” Salesforce’s floating hotel\nThis week’s event, which launches on Tuesday, will be the largest software conference in the world this year, Salesforce executive Michael Peachey said. Reached for an interview Monday afternoon, Peachey revealed first to MarketWatch that the conference had just cracked 160,000 registered attendees, topping last year’s record of 150,000.\n“Dreamforce is the Grammys, TED and the World Economic Forum all rolled into one,” said Peachey, the company’s vice president of solutions and product marketing.\nDreamforce has become a premier software conference as Salesforce’s influence has skyrocketed in Silicon Valley. An early pioneer in software as a service, or SaaS, the company has many rivals in the industry hustling to catch up with their own cloud-delivered software models.\n“Salesforce has established itself as the bellwether in enterprise software through innovation, achieving significant scale and embracing its role as a customer company,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Samad Samana said in an email Monday.\nSalesforce’s revenue has exploded in recent years, with the company topping $5 billion in sales in the 2015 fiscal year, which ended Jan. 31, after collecting $3.8 billion in 2014. That growth has been strong and steady, with Salesforce topping $1.5 billion in 2011, $2 billion in 2012 and $2.8 billion in 2013.\nThe company now hopes to find more gains by establishing cloud software verticals specifically aimed at important industries. Salesforce recently introduced software specifically targeting the financial-services sector and the health care industry .\n“We see the company’s influence only growing in the coming years as it expands its presence in the largest enterprises,” Samana predicted.\nDreamforce attendance has risen along with Salesforce’s booming sales. The company brought in 1,300 registered attendees for the first conference in 2003, and a steady rise received a jolt starting in 2011, when 46,000 people attended. Since then, Dreamforce has attracted 92,300 people in 2012, 120,000 in 2013 and 150,000 last year.\nThis year’s conference will include cofounder and Chief Executive Marc Benioff’s annual keynote Wednesday afternoon, during which he will be joined by new Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -1.23% CEO Chuck Robbins and other special guests. Benioff will also host Uber Technologies Inc. CEO Travis Kalanick for a “fireside chat” and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -1.01% CEO Sataya Nadella — rumored earlier this year to be interested in acquiring Salesforce — will have his own keynote address Wednesday evening.\n“Microsoft is a great partner of Salesforce, we’ve launched a number of integrations of products with them,” Peachey noted.\nAlong with those events are 2,600 sessions for partners and customers to learn about the software capabilities, as well as entertainment by the Foo Fighters, the Killers, and Gary Clark Jr. Those acts will be part of a concert raising $10 million for UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, part of philanthropic efforts that will also include a book drive that seeks to collect a million books for K-12 students.\nSalesforce shares closed down 0.2 percent Monday at $69.89, giving the company a market cap topping $46 billion. The stock has fallen 2.6% in the past three months, beating the 6.7% decline of the S&P 500 in that time.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T02:03:49.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
