It also has a new elevation.\nDenali, the Alaska mountain formerly known Mount McKinley, is now officially 3m shorter, measuring 6 200m at its highest point, the US Geological Survey announced on Wednesday.\nThe previous measurement of 6 190m stemmed from a 1953 survey that used the technology of the time, officials said. The new elevation is the result of data collected from the mountain by climbers in June using technology that didn't exist in the earlier survey, such as GPS instruments.\nThe climb to gather the data began June 15 and involved one climber from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and three climbers from the private survey company CompassData, USGA spokesperson Mark Newell said. During their 14 days on the mountain, the climbers pulled equipment and supplies on sleds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T00:44:07.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
