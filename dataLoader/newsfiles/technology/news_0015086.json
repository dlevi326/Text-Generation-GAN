Apple clearly has turned Siri into the centerpiece of the new Apple TV. The remote control comes with a microphone button that initiates voice control, and two integrated microphones — one to actually take voice commands, and one to monitor for and filter out background noise, like actors speaking on TV. The interface feels fast and fluid. It's based on pretty powerful hardware, and that shows when you navigate the device’s home screen. Scrolling through apps with the remote control’s touchpad is fast and fluid, app icons are 3D-animated, and the interface looks a lot lighter than that of the previous-generation system. The remote can do a lot. One of the best things about the new Apple TV may just be its remote. In addition to the microphone, it features a touchpad to navigate Apple TV’s menus, as well as fast-forward within a movie or TV show episode, all of which worked fairly well during the hands-on demo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T06:25:52.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
