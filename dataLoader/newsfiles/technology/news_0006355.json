The sarcophagus of King Tutankhamun, known as the 'Child Pharaoh' in its burial chamber on November 4, 2007 in the Valley of the Kings \nUnexplored chamber? \nBehind one such doorway could be \"a still unexplored storage chamber\" from Tutankhamun's burial. \nBut behind the other could be \"the undisturbed burial of the tomb's original owner—Nefertiti\". \nTutankhamun—the Boy King—died at the age of just 19 in 1324 BC after ruling for nine years. \nHis tomb was discovered in 1922 by British archaeologist Howard Carter. \nReeves believes that Tutankhamun's premature death meant his own tomb had not yet been built, so it was decided to reopen Nefertiti's tomb 10 years after her death so he could be buried there too. \nA news conference has been scheduled for October 1 in Cairo to present preliminary findings and an action plan to \"verify with certainty\" if hidden rooms exist and \"still conceal secrets or not\", the statement said. \nMinistry officials said that after the preliminary examination, a second study of the tomb wall may be made using special equipment brought in from Japan. \nOn September 20, the antiquities ministry announced that Tutankhamun's tomb would be closed from October for restoration. \nIt was not clear how long the restoration work, which includes giving the tomb a new floor, would last. \nLuxor, a city of half a million on the banks of the river Nile, is an open-air museum abounding with temples and tombs from ancient Egypt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T22:56:02.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
