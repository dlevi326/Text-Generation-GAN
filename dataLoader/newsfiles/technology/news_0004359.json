Researchers achieve higher solar-cell efficiency with zinc-oxide coating April 22, 2014 \n(Phys.org) —Engineering researchers at the University of Arkansas have achieved the highest efficiency ever in a 9 millimeter-squared solar cell made of gallium arsenide. After coating the cufflink-sized cells with a thin ... Guidelines for enhancing solar cells using surface plasmon polaritons August 18, 2014 \n(Phys.org) —Researchers from the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) have established guidelines for using surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) to improve absorption in both photovoltaic or photoelectrochemical ... New research to improve solar cells August 13, 2015 \nNew research from Professors Saiful Islam and Aron Walsh could lead to more efficient solar cells. The work appears in the leading journal Nature Communications. Solar cell absorbs high-energy light at 30-fold higher concentration than conventional cells September 2, 2015 \nBy combining designer quantum dot light-emitters with spectrally matched photonic mirrors, a team of scientists with Berkeley Lab and the University of Illinois created solar cells that collect blue photons at 30 times the ... PolyU develops novel efficient and low-cost semitransparent perovskite solar cells with graphene electrodes September 8, 2015 \nThe new technology has power conversion efficiencies of around 12% when they are illuminated from fluorine-doped tin oxide bottom electrodes or the graphene top electrodes, compared with 7% of conventional semitransparent ... Recommended for you New wearable technology can sense appliance use, help track carbon footprint September 9, 2015 \nIn today's smart home, technologies can track how much energy a particular appliance like a refrigerator or television or hair dryer is gobbling up. What they don't typically show is which person in the house actually flicked ... New nanoscale solar cells could revolutionize solar industry September 9, 2015 \nUniversity of Maryland Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Assistant Professor Jeremy Munday and graduate students Yunlu Xu and Tao Gong have designed a new type of nanoscale solar cell that they predict could ... Inspired by art, lightweight solar cells track the sun September 8, 2015 \nSolar cells capture up to 40 percent more energy when they can track the sun across the sky, but conventional, motorized trackers are too heavy and bulky for pitched rooftops and vehicle surfaces. Japanese paper art inspires new 3-D fabrication method September 8, 2015 \nA cut or tear in a material is typically a sign of weakness. Now, a Northwestern University, University of Illinois and Tsinghua University research team has created complex 3-D micro- and nanostructures out of silicon and ...
