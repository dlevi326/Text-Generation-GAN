The unique focused, short-wavelength acoustic field generated by AFA enables rapid, active paraffin removal and rehydration of FFPE tissue samples in aqueous buffer, thus enabling efficient and rapid tissue digestion, crosslink reversal, and nucleic acid release. \nAs a result of this unique technology, the truXTRAC solution results in higher yield and quality of DNA extracted from FFPE tissues. Furthermore, the extracted DNA is readily available for complex molecular biology assays, and generates higher complexity NGS libraries for clinical use, resulting in significant workflow improvements for extraction and purification. \n\"Molecular Pathology laboratories benefit from workflows that minimize sample requirements and process specimens in a high throughput manner,\" said Jeffrey Conroy , Senior Vice President of Technology Development at OmniSeq, LLC. \"By validating the truXTRACT DNA procedure in our CLIA laboratory, we not only automated paraffin removal and lysis of our patient specimens, but also improved DNA yield and fragment size. We are excited that even smaller biopsies can now be collected for OmniSeq Target SM testing.\" \nCovaris CEO, Jim Laugharn commented, \"NGS based technologies are rapidly being adopted in clinical diagnostics. At Covaris we believe that upstream workflows such as sample stabilization,extraction, and processing technologies necessary for the maximal utilization of NGS have to meet the yield and quality requirements of these sensitive technologies, and we have designed our truXTRAC FFPE DNA extraction solution to meet those needs. We are pleased that our truXTRAC solution exceeds the stringent yield and quality requirements of the OmniSeq Target clinical assay.\" \nAbout Covaris, Inc. Covaris is a recognized industry innovator in preanalytical sample preparation workflows involving sample stabilization, extraction, and processing. Leveraging its patented Adaptive Focused Acoustics ® (AFA™) technology and novel engineering solutions, Covaris has developed comprehensive packages of instrumentation, applications, reagents, and consumables to address the increasing sensitivity requirements of analytical technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry. The Covaris truSHEAR™ product line is the gold standard for random isothermal shearing of DNA and RNA for R&D and clinical NGS-based applications. Covaris Focused-ultrasonicators are recommended by all major NGS platform providers, and are used by leading Genome Centers worldwide. The Covaris AFA process is extensively cited in peer-reviewed research articles on DNA fragmentation, ChIP, FFPE DNA extraction, metabolomics, small molecule extraction, proteomics, and nanoformulation.
