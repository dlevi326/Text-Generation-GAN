As a result, they will begin winding down the relationship with Smashwords and remove our titles.” \n“The unfortunate news effectively hands the market for indie ebooks in India to Amazon.com,” he added. \nAmazon.com Inc was one of the first companies to launch an e-reader in India when it introduced the Kindle three years back. \nThe company recently said it is bringing to India a new service that allows unlimited ebook reading for Kindle users at an inaugural monthly price of Rs 99. \nSmashwords publishes novels, short fiction, poetry, personal memoirs, monographs, non-fiction, research reports and essays. The firm distributes eBooks to Apple iBookstore (in 51 countries), Barnes & Noble, Sony Reader Store, Kobo, Diesel eBook Store, Baker & Taylor”s Blio and Axis360, etc. In terms of traffic, India represents the fifth largest source of traffic for the company after the US, the UK, Canada and Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T18:37:11.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
