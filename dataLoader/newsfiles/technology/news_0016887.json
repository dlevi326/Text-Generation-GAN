They planned to gather at the Place de la Nation in eastern Paris, and some farmers want to head to Parliament.\nProtest organiser FNSEA, France's largest farming union, said 1 500 tractors from around the country were planning to take part.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T16:01:50.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
