The challenge is that, before sequencing can be done, the cell's DNA has to be amplified many times over. \n\nThis process is rife with errors, with some arbitrary chunks of DNA being amplified more than others. In addition, because many labs use their own software to examine CNVs, there is little consistency in how researchers analyze their results. \n\nTo address these two challenges, Schatz and his colleagues created Gingko. \n\nThe interactive, web-based programme automatically processes sequence data, maps the sequences to a reference genome, and creates CNV profiles for every cell that can then be viewed with a user-friendly graphical interface. \n\nThe software was described online in the journal Nature Methods.
