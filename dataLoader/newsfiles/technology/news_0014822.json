But we’re getting closer.”\nThe new SpaceShipTwo could be finished “within months,” Whitesides said. Construction reached a milestone in May, when the company laid the full weight of the finished rocket frame firmly on its landing gear and wheels, allowing the Virgin team to begin working on all the electronics, pneumatics and mechanical systems inside the vehicle.\nOnce finished, ground testing will begin again. That will be followed by “captive carry” testing on WhiteKnightTwo, the mothership that will carry the passenger rocket on its underbelly part of the way to space before SpaceShipTwo breaks away and fires its rockets to shoot into suborbit.\nAfter captive carry testing, Virgin will proceed to glider tests with the passenger vehicle, followed by rocket-powered tests to reach space. That’s the point Virgin was at last fall, when one of the pilots mistakenly deployed the ship’s braking system prematurely, tearing the rocket apart.\nA National Transportation Safety Board investigation, released this summer, found the rocket’s design is sound, although Virgin has integrated new features to guard against such human error in the future.\nWhitesides, a former chief of staff at NASA, was upbeat in delivering his progress report.\nHe said the company, which now employs more than 500 people primarily in California, is aggressively preparing its team for commercial operations. It just hired a sixth pilot and will hire a seventh in the fall. It needs six pilots for every suborbital flight: Two for the mothership, two for the passenger rocket and one each for a chase plane and for mission control.\nThe company is also developing a small satellite launch business that will use a separate rocket, LauncherOne, under construction in California. In June, Virgin signed OneWeb Ltd. — which is building a global communications system for affordable broadband access — as its first satellite launch client. Satellite launches will not operate out of New Mexico, at least at first, because federal regulations require that those launches take place over sea not over land, Whitesides said.\nSpaceport progress\nChristine Anderson, Spaceport America’s executive director, also addressed the gathering, and said the spaceport is steadily diversifying its commercial operations and customer base to generate more revenue as it awaits Virgin to launch the world’s first suborbital flights for tourists.\nSince May, the Spaceport has also signed up two new tenants: The satellite communications firm X2nSat and the drone and rocket launch systems firm ARCA Aerospace Corp.\nThey will join Virgin and two other firms —Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Colorado-based UP Aerospace — at the facility. But they’re the first ones who plan to use the Spaceport to develop other types of technology beyond rockets and rocket-launch systems. That’s part of an expanded business plan to diversify the facility’s customer base and revenue generation, Anderson said.\n“We’re targeting new customers with aggressive marketing to encourage more businesses to come here,” she said.\nThe facility opened its first visitor center in Truth or Consequences in June and is now regularly ferrying tourists from there to the Spaceport, Anderson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T03:17:00.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
