Researchers found that the growing incidence of attacks could cause insurance premiums to surge to $5 billion in 2018, and $7.5 billion in the two years to follow.\nIncreasing financial losses resulting from cyberattacks on medium-to-large companies are driving the surge in premiums, the authors said. They found that companies valued at $100 million to $1 billion lost an average of $1.3 million to cyberattacks in 2014, compared to $1 million in 2013, while those valued at more than $1 billion lost an average of $5.9 million, up from $3.9 million the previous year. Companies valued at less than $100 million, meanwhile, saw a slight decrease, from an average of $650,000 in losses to an average of $410,000.\nThe authors also suggested that the insurance industry wasn't keeping pace with demand in the insurance market, finding a \"limited number of insurers offering such coverage\" and offering coverage at levels below what their clients were seeking. The maximum coverage offered is $500 million.\nPaul Delbridge, an insurance partner at PwC, suggested that insurance companies should find a way to accommodate the market quickly, saying they \"are at serious risk of missing\" a \"rare market opportunity to secure high margins in a soft market.\n\"If the industry takes too long to innovate,\" Delbridge continued, \"there is a real risk that a disruptor will move in and corner the market with aggressive pricing and more favorable terms.\" However, he added, \"There is also a real possibility that overly onerous terms and conditions could invite regulatory action or litigation against insurers.\"\nCybersecurity costs are becoming a subject of increased speculation in light of increasing cybercrime. Last week, a study published by the Atlantic Council and the Zurich Insurance Group found that cyberattacks could cost the world up to $90 trillion in net economic benefit by 2030 unless developers ensure that cybersecurity advances at a pace equal to interconnectedness.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T02:23:27.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
