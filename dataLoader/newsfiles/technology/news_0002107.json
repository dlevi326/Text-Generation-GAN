It includes construction of ramp bridges from Highway 95 to the river crossing and vice-versa, as well as a box girder approach bridge on Highway 36 and a connecting structure between the river bridge and Highway 36 approach bridge. \nThe bridge deck will consist of a crossbeam, pier table and driving surface constructions. Each crossbeam will be 116.4ft long, 15.2ft wide and 18.2ft high. \nA total of 330 pre-cast segments were trucked from the on-site casting yard to the bridge areas. An additional 650 pre-cast segments were barged to the river bridge from Grey Cloud Island casting yard in Cottage Grove. \nThe bridge will be lower in height, which will minimise environmental impacts by keeping tower heights below the river bluffs and will also reduce the number of piers in the river to five. St Croix crossing construction Columbia River Crossing, Portland, Oregon to Vancouver, Washington, US \nColumbia River Crossing (CRC) was the replacement of the 90-year-old Interstate-5 bridge, which spans from SR500 in Vancouver, Washington to Victory Boulevard in Portland, Oregon. \nAn official groundbreaking was held for the river crossing project in May 2013. All works on the bridge foundations and footings below the water surface were completed in 2013. Construction work on all five pier locations began in June 2014. \nInstallation work of pre-cast river bridge segments and tower construction at pier nine in Minnesota shoreline and tower construction at Pier 12 in Wisconsin shoreline will be completed by the end of 2015. \nConstruction of the bicycle and pedestrian trail began in 2015 and will be completed by 2017. Contractors involved \nArchitectural and engineering firm HDR in association with Buckland & Taylor was awarded a $14.2m contract in June 2012 to provide lead design for the St Croix bridge project. \nLunda-Ames joint venture was awarded a $332.5m contract to lead construction of the St Croix crossing bridge superstructure in November 2013. \nJ?&?L Steel and Electrical Services was contracted to install the reinforcing steel, post tension and electrical materials on the superstructure of the St Croix crossing in February 2014. \nAggregate Industries was awarded the contract to provide pre-cast bridge girders. Financing \nThe river crossing is estimated to cost between $580m and $676m and is being financed by Minnesota and Wisconsin, with the former funding the majority.
