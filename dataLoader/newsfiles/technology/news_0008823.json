Appvion is also part of the initiative, and SATO is using its new Résiste® LE, which will be showcased at the Appvion stand (6A21), for production of weigh scale linerless products. \n\"We are delighted to be part of this great initiative which aims to bring together different players of the linerless label industry – from raw materials to final processing – to promote the use of linerless technology,\" comments Detlev Müller, General Manager D/A/CH - SATO Europe. \"With our unique expertise and experience in label and printer technology SATO is ideally placed to meet the environmental challenge by promoting greener and more efficient ways of producing labels.\" \nSATO is one of the few global companies to offer a complete linerless solution, including both labels and thermal printers. SATO's linerless labels are produced without backing paper meaning they have low environmental impact and zero landfill costs. With up to 40% more labels per roll than liner-backed rolls, they also reduce reel changes significantly and thus help increase productivity and efficiency. In addition, they help businesses reduce their carbon footprint and SATO estimates that, by switching to linerless technology, a company using 12 million standard labels per year could reduce CO2 emissions by 14,664 kg through a more efficient manufacturing process and 14,988 kg by eliminating liner incineration. \nAmong SATO's latest linerless label solutions is StripeStik, designed for use in on-demand secondary price markdown applications in the retail industry. Due to a patent-pending coating adhesive technology, it allows a second label to be securely applied on top of the first, making it extremely difficult to peel without tearing and thus discouraging tampering or product fraud. \nSATO has also developed special linerless printer technology such as the MB2i and MB4i mobile thermal printers. Lightweight and easy to use, these printers come with a variety of optional features including shoulder straps and swivel belt clips. They are claimed to be ideal for on-the-go applications (e.g. the courier industry) where eliminating the problem of disposing liners is vital. \nDesigned for intuitive operation, easy integration and industrial strength durability, SATO's CL4NX thermal printer is also available with an optional linerless kit to suit linerless labelling applications.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:38:03.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
