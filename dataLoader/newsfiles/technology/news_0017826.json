The new payment options include the ability to make and receive one-time payments, pay rent on any day of the month, and modify lease terms, all from any device.\nIncorporating feedback from Cozy’s Customer Advisory Board and working closely with the customer experience team, Cozy set out to update the experience for landlords to make it more flexible to collect payments and to greatly improve control over all details of the lease term.\nCozy’s new payments system focuses on several major feature updates: the ability to pay rent on any day of the month, the ability to make one-time payments, the ability to collect rent from multiple roommates individually, and the ability to edit leases on-the-fly.\nWith the new payments system, rent can now be paid on any day of the month, instead of just the first five days. Tenants can adjust their rent payment date to be sure they're always on time, regardless of bank holidays. Landlords and tenants in less common rental situations, like twice-monthly rent payments, or leases with rent due on mid-month, are also accommodated. Coupled with the upcoming ability to pay rent via debit or credit cards, Cozy offers the most flexible payment options in the industry.\nOne-time charges and payments are also new. Now, landlords and property managers can request one-time payments for things like utilities, late fees, and more. Tenants, similarly, can make one-time payments as necessary, even if the landlord hasn’t requested a payment yet, and maintain a positive balance.\nIn the past, payments didn't process until all tenants were set up and ready to make a payment. With Cozy’s new payments system, each tenant's payment will process as soon as it's ready, so property managers will receive one payment per resident rather than per unit. For some landlords, this can mean faster payments, because their rent deposit won’t be held up by one tenant, if they haven’t finished signing up yet or don’t have sufficient funds in their account.\nWhat’s more, landlords and property managers can now change their rent due dates, update lease dates, and end their leases all from within their account. Complete lease controls adds additional flexibility for landlords and tenants. Paired with Cozy's tenant screening tools, landlords and property managers now have easy and free online tools for the most critical stages of the rental lifecycle. Landlords and property managers can seamlessly run tenant credit reports and renter background checks , then get the tenants they picked set up with online payments.\n“We built the new Cozy payments platform from the ground up to be mobile-friendly, accessible anywhere and from any computer or mobile device that’s connected to the Internet,” said Chris Rivard, director of UX and Design at Cozy. “With our new set of tools, landlords never have to worry about dealing with paper checks. They can take complete control of their rental properties, making changes whenever and wherever it's most convenient.”\nAbout Cozy\nCozy makes renting easy for landlords, property managers, and tenants.
