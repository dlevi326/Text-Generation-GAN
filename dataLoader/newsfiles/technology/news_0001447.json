The deal, subject to shareholders' approval, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016.\nUnder the terms of that deal, Atmel would have to pay Dialog $137.3 million if, among other reasons, it terminates the merger to pursue a higher bid.\nAtmel, best known for chips called microcontrollers that offer computer power for consumer and business hardware, had signaled a possible sale when it postponed its chief executive's retirement date to oversee a review of operations. Chief Executive Steven Laub, who's led the company since 2006, had said in May he planned to retire on Aug. 31. As of Sept. 1, Mr. Laub remains chief executive on an at-will basis for an indefinite period.\nAtmel's shares, which set a 52-week-low of $5.84 on Aug. 24 when it announced the operational review, were down to $7.98 in recent trading.\nMeanwhile, Cypress' stock traded at $8.43 a share on Monday, down 41% this year.\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com\n 28, 2015 14:55 ET (18:55 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:15:56.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
