At $7000, the “sex robot can either have a conversation or interact physically!” and pre-orders allegedly are in the thousands. RealDoll manufacturer Abyss Creations , based in San Marcos, California, is a major seller of sex toys and is also in the early stages of a sex robot. \nTrue Companion chief executive Douglas Hines told the BBC that there is a real need for Roxxxy and Rocky. \n“We are not supplanting the wife or trying to replace a girlfriend. This is a solution for people who are between relationships or someone who has lost a spouse,” he said. \n“People can find happiness and fulfilment other than via human interaction.” \nHines said he hopes Roxxxy will eventually become a self-learning engine that is able to talk to her owner and learn his likes or dislikes. \n“The physical act of sex will only be a small part of the time you spend with a sex robot — the majority of time will be spent socialising and interacting,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:08:52.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
