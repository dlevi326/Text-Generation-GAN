The world has not listened. The Oxford Dictionaries recently canonized the phrase, defining it as “a type of female character depicted as vivacious and appealingly quirky, whose main purpose within the narrative is to inspire a greater appreciation for life in a male protagonist.” And now, the actress who played one of the most famous MPDGs ever has endorsed the term as useful.\nOn a panel before the Toronto Film Festival, Natalie Portman was asked about MPDGs in relation to her role in 2004’s Garden State , in which she plays Sam, a whimsical and mentally troubled young woman who teaches Zach Braff’s character to love the Shins. Her reply, according to Vulture :\nWhen I read [the Garden State script] I was like, ‘Oh, this is a character that’s wacky and interesting, and no one’s ever given me a chance to play something like this. It’s this sort of unusual girl. So that was my incentive to make it. But of course I see that trope and I think it’s a good thing to recognize the way those female characters are used. I mean, I appreciate that people are writing characters that are interesting and unusual, rather than some bland female character as the girlfriend in a movie, but when the point of the character in this movie is to, like, help the guy have his arc, that’s sort of the problem, and that’s why it’s good that they’re talking about it, because it certainly is a troubling trope.", "external_links": ["http://www.salon.com/2014/07/15/im_sorry_for_coining_the_phrase_manic_pixie_dream_girl/", "http://www.vulture.com/2015/09/natalie-portman-insecure-garden-state-broad-city.html"], "published": "2015-09-11T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T00:20:39.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
