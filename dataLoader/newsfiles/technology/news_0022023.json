At its 35 th anniversary mark this year, MIL now employs over 650 individuals, has a full-fledged corporate office, and holds contracts with 17 federal agencies. \nMIL opened its doors as a small business in 1980 and has grown to be a mid-level government contractor providing professional services, IT, engineering, and technical service support to federal agencies. The organization began contract work with the U.S. Department of Energy and since then has successfully competed for multiyear, multimillion dollar contracts with many federal agencies, including the U.S. Departments of the Navy, Commerce, State, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture. \nAt the helm of the organization is the President and Co-founder, Maurice I. Long, Jr. MIL is headquartered in Bowie, Md. , but operates across the country, with office in Lexington Park, Md. , Charleston, S.C. , Arlington, Va. , and Albuquerque, N.M. \n\"Back in 1980 when I started MIL I wanted to create a business that not only offered expert services, but also individualized and attentive support to clients,\" said Long. \"Our people have always been the foundation of what we do, and I take pride in the fact that while we are much larger now we still maintain the mantra of, 'people making the difference.' What this company has grown into over the years is exactly as I envisioned.\" \nAfter nearing the $100M annual income mark in 2013, MIL leadership restructured its business operations to include six defined service sectors to best meet the needs of their equally distributed defense and civilian customer base. These sectors include: Cybersecurity; C4 Integrated Systems; Engineering and Technical Services; Financial and Administrative Systems; Global Financial Services; and Information Technology. \nThe newly appointed VP of MIL Corporate Business Development (CBD), Marisa Daley , is very optimistic about MIL's future. Daley's role includes establishing MIL's CBD priorities, such as identifying and pursuing corporate strategic initiatives, leading the capture management process, and driving business development communication and outreach. \n\"As MIL celebrates its 35 th year, I am eager to apply my experience in leading strategic management consulting teams, as well as the skills I acquired while running my own business,\" said Daley. \"Specifically, I am thrilled about expanding MIL's client-base and cross-selling its deep expertise across business sectors. I know that our business sectors and their leaders give us solid roots to reach and exceed our customer's needs.\" \nAbout MIL The MIL Corporation (MIL), a CMMIÂ® Level 2 and 3 rated company established in 1980, provides agencies of the Federal government with outstanding professional services in the areas of financial management, information technology, cybersecurity, and engineering.
