The latest Android phone flaw is sheer stupidity. Locked phones require a passcode. But there's a way to get around that. Just type in an insanely long password. That overloads the computer, which redirects you to the phone's home screen.\nIt's a time-consuming hack, but it's actually easy to pull off.\nIn a report published Tuesday, computer security researcher John Gordon documented the vulnerability and posted a video of the hack. It only affects smartphones using the latest version of the Android operating system, Lollipop.\nIt's basically a game of copy-and-paste.\nFrom the locked screen, open the phone's \"Emergency Call\" feature. Type a few characters, then copy-and-paste the text repeatedly. The character \"string\" grows exponentially, so it quickly becomes close to 40,960 characters long.\nThen open the phone's camera app and prompt the phone to request a password. Paste the super long character string a few times until the system crashes. (Based on Gordon's video, it looks like 163,840 total characters.)\nWait maybe five minutes, and the phone goes straight to the unlocked home screen.\nGordon warned Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) about the vulnerability back in August, so the company released a patch for the flaw last week. But phones will remain vulnerable until they're updated with the latest software patch.\nThe patch is already available for Google's own line of phones -- the various Nexus models. But there's no telling when it'll reach Android devices made by Samsung, LG and others. Blame the Android's fractured updating system, which is slowed down by phone manufacturers and cellphone network carriers.\nGoogle has acknowledged the flaw, saying that the hack lets someone who grabs your phone \"view contact data, phone logs, SMS messages, and other data that is normally protected.\"\nRelated: Android phones can be hacked with a simple text\nRelated: The Moto X Pure Edition is the best Android phone ever\nRelated: The next version of Android will be called 'Marshmallow'\nCNNMoney (New York) September 16, 2015: 10:37 AM ET", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150618150614-android-nexus-google-780x439.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-pFCXEqB7A", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-pFCXEqB7A", "http://sites.utexas.edu/iso/2015/09/15/android-5-lockscreen-bypass/"], "published": "2015-09-16T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T05:23:13.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
