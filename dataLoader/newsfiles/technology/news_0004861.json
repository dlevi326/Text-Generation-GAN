In the second half of 2014, Android was narrowly behind Apple, with 46 per cent and 47 per cent of smartphone sales respectively.\nAccording to Telsyte the various Apple Watches, which launched on April 24, gained a seemingly impressive 64 per cent of the local smartwatch market, compared with 21 per cent for Android. However only 205,000 smartwatches in total were sold in Australia during the half. Comparatively, 3.7 million smartphones were sold during the period.\nNew iPhone Apple is expected to announce the new iPhone 6s on September 9, with some expected upgrades on existing models. It is expected to have a 12 megapixel camera, a front flash, Force Touch technology and be 0.2 millimetres thicker than the iPhone 6. The upgrade to a 12 megapixel camera will be the first increase in megapixels since the iPhone 4s, which launched in October 2011.\n Android has regained smartphone market dominance in Australia in the first half of 2015. Telsyte Telsyte managing director Foad Fadaghisaid if sales of the new iPhone were slower than last year's iPhone 6 release, which was likely, Android would hold on to the top spot throughout the second half.\n\"We do not expect the iPhone will receive a substantial upgrade this year and therefore its performance is unlikely to be as strong as the second half last year,\" Mr Fadaghi said.\n\"Apple received a major replacement cycle boost with the iPhone 6, overtaking Android in sales in the second half of 2014, but this was not sustained in the first half of the year.\"\nKantar Worldpanel ComTech Asia strategic insight director Tamsin Timpsonâ€‹ also believed the new iPhone would not be as \"ground-breaking\" as the iPhone 6, but she was more positive in her belief that Apple was still comfortably the market leader.\nSmart wristbands are still drastically more popular than smartwatches. Telsyte Last week Kantar released numbers showing iOS sales have increased 7.9 percentage points for the three months to July 2015, compared with the previous corresponding period.\n\"People aren't holding out as much for it as they were with the iPhone 6. Just before a new launch we expect a surge in sales of the iPhone 6, as prices come down a bit,\" Ms Timpson said\nMr Fadaghi said replacement cycles affected market dominance in Australia.\n\"The smartphone market is mature and shows signs of cyclical purchase behaviour,\" he said.\nTelsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi said the lack of new Android devices and the high price of the Apple Watch had impacted the potential sales of smartwatches. Supplied \"Typically we see Apple doing well in even years (2012, 2014 etc) and Android doing well in odd years.\"\nSmartwatches running slow When it comes to wearable tech, the Apple Watch has had a slower than expected start in Australia following its high profile launch.\nThe Telsyte figures show about 165,000 Apple Watches have been bought, making up about two-thirds of all smartwatch sales.\n\"The lack of new Android devices and the high price of the Apple Watch we believe impacted the potential sales of smartwatches,\" Mr Fadaghi said.\nTelsyte had conservative estimates for Apple Watch sales because of the high price point, but in August UBS lowered its expectations for global Apple Watch sales to 20 million, down from its 36 million prediction in May. This could indicate that consumers are not embracing the idea of smartwatches.\nTelsyte's study found only 4 per cent of Android users were likely to switch to iOS in order to use the Apple Watch.\nOf the Apple Watch owners surveyed, 61 per cent said they used their watches regularly, but a surprisingly high 10 per cent said they had already stopped using their smartwatch.\nMr Fadaghi said it was too early to call smartwatches a flop, but the market had shown that there was limited demand for premium wearables.\n\"The sweet spot for mainstream adoption of smartwatches is in the $200-$300 price range,\" he said.\n\"Demand for lower priced wearables such as wristbands remains strong. Sales in smart wristbands grew 30 per cent in the second half, compared with 18 per cent for smartwatches.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:32:23.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
