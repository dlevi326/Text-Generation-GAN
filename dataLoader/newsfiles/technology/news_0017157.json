We are confident that through the use of our solutions we can minimize providers' cash flow disruptions.\" \nAvaility's solutions, such as its web portal, revenue cycle management and clearinghouse, equip providers with the tools and flexibility they need to protect their everyday workflows, transactions, and reimbursements during the transition, and ensures that they continue to grow their businesses far beyond the implementation deadline. \n\"We built our system so our providers could test against their payers for ICD-10 and ICD-9,\" said Thomas. \"I encourage our providers to continue ICD-10 testing with their payers. We built the Availity gateway to allow ICD-10, ICD-9, or both by selected payers in anticipation that some payers would not be ready, which now appears to be the case.\" \nThe four states that requested a delay are California , Montana , Maryland , and Louisiana . These states have nearly 15 million Medicaid beneficiaries combined. Availity has a major footprint in California , Montana , and Maryland . \nThe affected states are each experiencing problems with their claims processing systems and will implement a temporary workaround that will allow them to continue using ICD-9 code sets for their Medicaid fee-for-service programs, including converting ICD-10 claims into ICD-9 codes to calculate payments. The technique, called a \"crosswalk,\" is a text file with ICD-9 codes in one column and corresponding ICD-10 codes in another. Providers are expressing concern about delays in payments and other issues, such as some ICD-10 codes not easily translating back to ICD-9. \n\"Should additional states or entities request a transition delay, Availity is prepared,\" said Thomas. \"The complexity of ICD-10 conversion further illustrates why it's critical to have a trusted partner like Availity managing your revenue cycle.\" \nTweet This: .@Availity prepared to assist providers impacted by latest ICD-10 delays http://bit.ly/1itCidp | #ICD10 #providers #healthIT \nAbout Availity As an industry-leading, HITRUST-certified health care information technology company, Availity serves an extensive network of health plans, providers, and technology partners nationwide through a suite of dynamic products built on a powerful, intelligent platform.
