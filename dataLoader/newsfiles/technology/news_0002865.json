Any damage may further prolong the time needed for reconstruction,\" Chou Chih-kang, a Wulai neighbourhood chief, told AFP. \nBy Monday night Wulai had already seen 600 mm of rain in 24 hours. \nThe weather bureau warned that the \"massive amount\" of rubble on mountain slopes and riverbeds since Soudelor could lead to further damage. \nMore than 24,000 troops were on standby for disaster relief and evacuations, with 100 shelters set up. \nA concert by US rock band Bon Jovi due to take place in Taipei Monday was cancelled, while 241 international and 144 domestic flights were also pulled. \nFerry services and flights to outlying islands were suspended. \nDujuan passed near the Japanese island of Ishigaki as it approached Taiwan. \nAround 100 domestic flights were cancelled in Japan, while 3,200 households lost power in Ishigaki and other islands, local media said. \nTyphoon Soudelor caused at least eight deaths in Taiwan last month and killed 21 people in China. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T15:04:31.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
