The new Apple Pencil, which will be released in November, functions as a stylus for concurrently released iPad Pro and works in a similar way to its leaded cousin. Choosing the “black pencil” setting comes out grey and when drawing with the pencil pressing down harder will lead to darker and thicker lines.\nWith the iPad Pro, Apple seems to be doubling down on the “bigger is better” direction they started going into with the iPhone 6 Plus and its 5.5 inch screen.\nRecommended: 10 weird things your iPhone can do The 12.9 inch display dwarfs the current biggest tablet in the Apple lineup, the iPad Air 2, which has a 9.7 inch screen and also comes with a bigger price tag at $699.\n10 weird things your iPhone can do With the introduction of the Apple Pencil and the physical keyboard cover, the tech company seems to be positioning itself to compete with Microsoft’s surface tablet range, which is set up as a cross between a notebook and a traditional tablet.\nOn the mobile end, the new Apple iPhone 6s looks pretty much the same as the previous version that came out last year, but as the old saying goes don’t judge a cell phone by its cover.\nInside the guts of the new iPhone there have been improvements to the camera, including increasing the megapixels to 12 and new sensors that enable quicker access to various functions.\nApple also introduced a new feature called 3D Touch, which basically allows users to create application shortcuts to directly access certain tasks. This is another dig at Microsoft’s Windows phone which has a similar shortcut feature, but without nearly the market control as Apple’s groundbreaking smartphone.\nRecommended: On Pinterest?

Also for selfie-lovers, the new iPhone lightens the screen as a kind of flash which isn’t as bright as the normal flash, but can provide lighting in low-visibility situations.\nThe new phones aren't coming out until Sept. 25, but advance orders begin Saturday.\nA new version of Apple TV, the company’s set-top streaming device, is coming out on October replete with a new remote armed a touchpad that allows more control over scrubbing over video and music.\nEven with all the shiny new toys, there was no big upswing in the company’s stock prices, with many commentators saying that Apple failed to unveil any breathtakingly visionary product.\nThis report contains materials from the Associated Press.", "external_links": ["https://www.pinterest.com/csmonitor/"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T19:36:59.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
