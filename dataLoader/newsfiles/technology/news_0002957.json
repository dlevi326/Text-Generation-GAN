That's much like a widget-building company might rely on a warehouse of raw materials when prices rise. But federal accounting rules can padlock those warehouses, particularly hurting small banks and their customers. They just don't have the funds to lend. They have less access to other funding resources -- commercial paper, exotics.\" Meder's paper, \"Interaction Between Accounting Standards and Monetary Policy: The Effect of SFAS 115,\" was published in the September 2015 issue of The Accounting Review. Website: http://www.binghamton.edu Blue Bell Creameries Not out of the Legal Woods Steve Laird Attorney Law Offices of Steven C. Laird, Fort Worth, Texas As Blue Bell ice cream makes its gradual return to store shelves, the beloved brand still has a long way to go in rebuilding public trust and overcoming a series of wrongful death claims and proposed class-action lawsuits. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Blue Bell Creameries' products sickened at least 13 people over the past five years, including three who died after allegedly eating listeria-tainted ice cream. Says Laird: \"It's likely that some of these cases, such as class actions seeking damages for product refunds, won't gain much traction. But the cases involving injuries and death are more troubling, especially as we learn more details about the failures of Blue Bell to fix the problems they apparently knew were there. The company's unwillingness to come clean - in every sense - may end up damaging Blue Bell's defense in court and create more reputational hurdles with consumers.\" Contact: Barry Pound, barry@androvett.com Allegations Surrounding Veterans for a Strong America Beth Gazley Associate Professor, School of Public & Environmental Affairs Indiana University In light of the recent Veterans for a Strong America allegations, Gazley says: \"A lot of nonprofit observers worry about the amount of 'whack-a-mole' political campaign activity out there right now, where an organization is created, fails to file public forms, gets exempt status revoked, and then pops up again elsewhere. By the time the public election is over and the votes are counted, however, the damage has already been done. In the case of Veterans for a Stronger America, Arends' strategy to file an appeal with the IRS supports that aim to delay the regulators until the campaign is over. For example, this past August, the same Joel Arends, an attorney in Sioux Falls, was the registered agent for a new domestic nonprofit in the state of South Dakota called Vets for America. The articles of incorporation provide absolutely no information about the exempt purposes of the organization. Specifically, an 'attached exhibit' described under Article III, which would provide members of the public with the specific exempt purposes of this organization, has not been attached and does not seem to exist.\" Website: https://spea.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/gazley-beth.html \nMEDIA JOBS: \nFollowing are links to job listings for staff and freelance writers, editors and producers.

In their 1931 book, \"Writing and Thinking,\" Norman Foerster and J. M. Steadman Jr. wrote, \"The comma is by far the most difficult mark of punctuation to master because of its many uses.\" The book goes on for 17 pages talking exclusively about commas and their usage, including three pages of exercises. There are plenty of rules to remember when it comes to using the comma. Here are the big three: http://prn.to/1gxAAWk -- MEDIA 411: LEGAL CHALLENGES JOURNALISTS FACE.
