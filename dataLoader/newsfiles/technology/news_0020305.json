The Top 100 CSPs generated more than $30 billion in combined cloud services revenues in 2014, up nearly 29 percent over what they reported the previous year. The full report is available now by visiting http://www.talkincloud.com/tc100 . \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150904/263858 \nLogicalis assists clients in determining the right cloud solution for their specific business needs, offering options ranging from private and hybrid cloud to public cloud offerings. The solution provider also offers task-specific cloud services including disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS), Cloud Storage for Backup, and backup as a service (BUaaS), as well as a Multi-Cloud Management Portal that allows IT pros to see, upload and control all of their cloud resources from a single point of view. \n\"There is a significant transformation taking place in the IT market today,\" says Mike Martin, Senior Vice President, Solutions and Services, Logicalis US. \"Business users are forming their opinions about what IT should deliver in the workplace based on the way they interact with technology in their consumer lives. To accommodate this kind of choice and agility, CIOs have become internal service providers, and they rely heavily on a range of cloud services to provide the solutions their users expect. Because cloud computing takes many shapes and forms, there isn't a one-size-fits-all option for users. Therefore, it's important that IT pros select a cloud partner that can help them define and implement the specific cloud services that will result in the best alignment between their IT and business needs. Being named to the Talkin Cloud 100 illustrates Logicalis' proficiency in doing this, and because we operate every day in the corporate space, our clients can rest assured that the cloud offerings we help them identify and implement will meet the rigorous demands and regulatory requirements common to enterprise environments.\" \nIn addition to honoring Logicalis, this year's Talkin' Cloud 100 report profiles: -- Cloud Services Providers: CSPs offer SaaS (software as a service), infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and/or PaaS (platform as a service) to partners/customers. -- Cloud Services Brokerages: CSBs, or cloud brokers, recommend and resell multiple cloud services to customers, and often integrate those services. -- Cloud Services Aggregators: CSAs, or cloud aggregators, typically offer a portal that allows VARs and MSPs to source multiple third-party cloud services for customers. -- MSPs (Managed Service Providers) with cloud services expertise: MSPs proactively monitor and manage customers' on-premises and cloud-based systems. -- VARs (value-added resellers) with cloud services expertise: VARs offer a range of IT consulting, deployment, integration and management services to customers. \nThe Talkin' Cloud 100 list is based on data from Talkin' Cloud's online survey, conducted January through May 2015. The Talkin' Cloud 100 list recognizes top cloud service providers based on such metrics as annual cloud services revenue growth (both in actual dollars and in percentage growth rates), and input from Penton Technology's Channel editors. \n\"On behalf of Penton and Talkin' Cloud, I would like to congratulate Logicalis for its recognition as a Talkin' Cloud 100 honoree,\" says Nicole Henderson, Editor in Chief, Talkin' Cloud. \"The industry is changing at a rapid pace, and the Talkin' Cloud 100 companies consistently demonstrate an agility and flexibility that sets them apart. They do so with innovation, via strategic partnerships, and through their commitment to providing superior customer experiences.\" \nTalkin' Cloud, produced by Penton, is the go-to resource for CSPs, VARs and MSPs profiting from cloud computing.
