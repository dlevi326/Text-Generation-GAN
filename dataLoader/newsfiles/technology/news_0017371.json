Rough Cut (no reporter narration). Reuters News Proof of alien existence? No, just the U.S. Navy. Picture: John Raoux Source: AP \nAN incredible bright light, described as a “giant comet”, streamed across the skies over Florida overnight. But it wasn’t a meteor or a sign of extraterrestrial life. It was the US Navy. \nIt was launching the Atlas V rocket to improve satellite communication, but the spectacular light show had unsuspecting residents fearing the worst. \nIt was a sheer stroke of luck that the comet-like light appeared at all: the rocket plume caught the sunlight at just the right angle, creating the effect. \n“When the Atlas went over the horizon, the plume was spreading out and the sunlight happened to come through it at the proper time that really illuminated the whole plume,” said John Hilliard, a public affairs volunteer with the 45th Space Wing, a United States Air Force unit stationed in Florida that provided support for the 6.18am launch. \n“We normally have that plume, but you don’t see it because we don’t have the illumination that we did today.” Booster separation (?) from @ulalaunch ’s #AtlasV with #MUOS .

About 500 of these are owned by the US, with 100 of those used for military purposes. \n“We have a responsibility to defend against all threats,” Air Force Space Command Commander General John Hyten said during a press conference last year. And finally, this AM's AtlasV/MUOS4 Launch with Noctilucent Clouds as seen from the Tampa Bay area: https://t.co/JevYQHpQT3 — David Dickinson (@Astroguyz) September 2, 2015 \n“That’s what our job is ... There is no doubt we have seen threats appear in the last decade, and we have to be prepared to respond to those threats.” \nThe launch comes as the world’s three leading superpowers — Russia, China and the US — are reportedly developing, testing and deploying sophisticated weapons in outer space in advance of a military attack that could see the first great conflict between the sparring superpowers in 70 years. \nThe satellite system is expected to be tested and evaluated in December, and if all goes to plan will be fully operation in 2017. — Chris Stewart (@CStewartWPTV) September 2, 2015 \n— youngma@news.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:59:23.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
