A day after HCL Technologies announced a three-year contract with Manchester United to strengthen its digital play, rival Wipro announced a similar deal with Man Utd's bete noire and reigning English Premier League champions, Chelsea.Wipro will be Chelsea's official digital and IT partner for the next three years.Wipro Digital, the digital business unit of the $7.5-billion Wipro, will reimagine the digital and technology experience for millions of Chelsea fans not only in-stadium, game-day experience, but also offer off-the-field experience leveraging on the English football club's rich heritage.\"We are engaging with fans through various digital engagements. Chelsea's app has become the primary focus to connect fans and the club through an enhanced digital experience,\" said Rajan Kohli, global head of Wipro Digital.Chelsea, owned by Russian billionaire Romanov Abramovich, has its home base in Stamford Bridge in London. The English football club already engages with its fans through Chelsea TV that airs live shows online, on-demand video, digital magazine and match audio commentary .Kohli said the company would leverage Chelsea's assets to expand its merchandising opportunities through several digital touch points for the fans. Wipro's digital pod in London, an innovation lab with giant digital screens simulating applications in a live use case scenario, would be instrumental in designing digital experiences for Chelsea's fans.Christian Purslow, managing director of Chelsea FC, said, \"Wipro's expertise in building winning propositions that sit at the intersection of strategy , design and technology will help sustain our position as the digital leader in global sport. It is also exciting for Chelsea FC to enter into a global partnership with Wipro given their significant presence and brand coverage in India -a market where we have over 50 million passionate supporters and where there is great potential to further build our fan base.\"Wipro's partnership with Chelsea comes two months after the Indian IT player was appointed by the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) as its official digital technology services partner for three years.Wipro expects its digital business to become one of its top three service lines over the next three years, generating revenues of over $1 billion. It recently acquired Denmark-based strategic design firm Designit for 85 million euros to bolster its digital offerings and engineering capabilities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:27:24.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
