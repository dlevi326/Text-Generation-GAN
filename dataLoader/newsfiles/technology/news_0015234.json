And I'm a bit selective, but I've always had in my mind that whichever films I will do are memorable,\" said Amrita who was present at the special screening of \"Baanke Ki Crazy Baraat\". \n\"I've seen the film and it will definitely rock. Vijay Raaz and Sanjay Mishra have done an incredible job in the film,\" Amrita said about the comedy film. \nWhen asked what kind of husband she wants, she said: \"I really don't know. I don't think so much. Whom the heart instantly likes, is the person made for you. I don't think that he should be of a specific type. If you love someone, there are no recipes, it just happens.\" \nShe was previously linked with Shahid Kapoor after working together in \"Ishq Vishka\" and \"Vivah\" which were extremely liked by audiences. \nAmrita has displayed her versatility over the years with fine performances in serious films but her light-hearted roles such as in \"Masti\" and \"Main Hoon Na\" are more popular. But comedy is not a cakewalk for her, she said. \n\"I've worked in many comedy films including \"Welcome To Sajjanpur\". Obviously to deliver the written dialogues in your style and to touch the audiences so that they laugh, is a very difficult task.\" \nShe said that she'll soon be seen in a film, the producers of which are going to make an announcement soon.
