The X-Rite dealer partners, in booths #535 and #436, respectively, will display a full range of end-to-end color workflow solutions designed to fit the needs of prepress, printing and packaging companies of all sizes. “Recent X-Rite research indicates that brand owners still consider the inability to achieve consistent color across their print and packaging supply chains a significant business issue,” says Chris Winczewski, Vice President of Product Marketing, X-Rite. “We’re dedicated to helping customers eliminate this concern. X-Rite’s dealer partners will feature the X-Rite solutions that printers are using to establish closed-loop color control, dramatically reduce make-ready times, and help minimize ink and substrate waste. These latest X-Rite technologies help printers stay competitive, save on resources, and meet customer delivery schedules.”\nX-Rite solutions on display in the ColorHQ and Rutherford Graphics Products booths include:\n X-Rite eXact Scan, a 2015 recipient of the prestigious InterTech Award and the only handheld spectrophotometer on the market that can measure a true M1 Part One (as opposed to a simulation) and capture M0, M2 and M3 simultaneously for both spot and scan readings.

X-Rite i1 software and solutions including the new i1iSis 2 for automated printer profile creation, now supporting M1 measurement standards, and the i1Pro 2, the standard for color profiling and calibration.\n“ColorHQ experts will be available in our booth to educate Graph Expo visitors about the latest developments in the art and science of color management.
