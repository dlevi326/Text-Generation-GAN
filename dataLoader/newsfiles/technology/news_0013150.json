Mathew, an analytics expert with more than 15 years of experience in the marketing industry, will explore why creating a single currency for measurement, optimization and activation is critical for accurately quantifying performance. \nWhy: While the rise of digital marketing and the advent of advanced measurement solutions have made it easier than ever to track direct response marketing efforts, brand marketers are challenged in their attempt to accurately quantify the results of their branding efforts. In fact, a recent study conducted by Visual IQ found that 84 percent of US-based brand marketers are less confident about their branding measurement capabilities in comparison to direct response, and 75 percent noted they face challenges in isolating and quantifying the impact of individual digital channels, as well as TV, on branding metrics. By leveraging advanced attribution, brand marketers can create a single currency for brand marketing measurement, optimization and activation across digital and TV channels. \nWhere: MediaPost’s inaugural OMMA Attribution event, which is taking place during Advertising Week in New York, will explore the disruption occurring in the attribution landscape and how marketers are just beginning to bring the pieces together when it comes to measuring marketing performance across channels. This event is taking place at the Metropolitan Pavilion.
