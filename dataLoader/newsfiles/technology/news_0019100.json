Can you tell by looking at seashells? \nThis study by Andy Roark and colleagues tested predictions that the supercontinent Pangea underwent strong monsoons, or massive seasonal changes in wind direction , during times of high sea level (i.e., interglacial) by analyzing the chemistry of fossil brachiopod shells. The shells were deposited in a shallow sea in present-day West Virginia and Ohio in the latest Pennsylvanian (~300 million years ago). \nBy carefully micro-sampling each shell along its direction of growth and analyzing for stable carbon and oxygen isotopes and trace elements, the team reconstructed a record of seasonal variation during the lifetimes of the organisms. The data showed that the region experienced minimal seasonal variation in temperature and rainfall; in other words, at most a very weak monsoon. \nThese results may help resolve a paleoclimate debate about the relationship between monsoonality and sea level and provide a glimpse of changing seasons on an ancient mega-continent. West African Ocean sediment core links monsoons to global climate evolution May 31, 2007 \nMonsoons, the life-giving, torrential rains of Asia and Africa, have an ancient, unsuspected connection to previous Ice Age climate cycles, according to scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and at Kiel ... Natural climate swings contribute more to increased monsoon rainfall than global warming March 20, 2013 \nNatural swings in the climate have significantly intensified Northern Hemisphere monsoon rainfall, showing that these swings must be taken into account for climate predictions in the coming decades. The findings are published ... Seashells provide million-year-old weather report February 4, 2014 \nNew research, published in Earth and Planetary Research Letters, led by scientists from the University of Cambridge, used plankton – tiny bugs, whose shells litter the ocean floors. By drilling into the seabed scientists ... Seafloor holds 15 million years of monsoon history March 2, 2015 \nWhen the research vessel JOIDES Resolution returned to port in late January after a two-month cruise, it had harvested more than 550 sediment cores from deep beneath the Indian Ocean. Locked within those tubes of muck is ... Study shows Lake Mega-Chad dried up far more quickly than thought June 30, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—A trio of researchers from the University of London and King's College, studying the history of Lake Chad has found that the lake was reduced to its current size very quickly just 1,000 years ago. In their paper ... X-rays reveal fossil secrets September 3, 2015 \nA sophisticated imaging technique has allowed scientists to virtually peer inside a 10-million-year-old sea urchin, uncovering a treasure trove of hidden fossils. Recommended for you Arctic sea ice still too thick for regular shipping route through Northwest Passage September 29, 2015 \nDespite climate change, sea ice in the Northwest Passage (NWP) remains too thick and treacherous for it to be a regular commercial Arctic shipping route for many decades, according to new research out of York University. Scientists simulate Earth's middle crust to understand earthquakes September 29, 2015 \nResearchers have for the first time been able to measure a material's resistance to fracturing from various types of tectonic motions in the Earth's middle crust, a discovery that may lead to better understanding of how large ... New ways to motivate climate change action around the world September 29, 2015 \nNew international research has found a way to help the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change promote their message for more urgent action around the world. Ancient dirt churners took their time stirring up the ocean floor September 29, 2015 \nEarth's early burrowers were slow to discover the bottom of the ocean as a good place to kick up dirt. Plant debris decomposition tied to manganese September 29, 2015 \nThe decomposition of plant debris (litter) is a fundamental process that regulates the release of nutrients for plant growth and the formation of soil organic matter in forest ecosystems. ew study shows molecular details of how organic aerosol helps heat up and color haze over megacities September 29, 2015 \nSitting on an airplane flying into nearly every major city on a sunny day, passengers can see a lingering brown haze. This haze event is linked to climate issues, as the thousands of chemicals involved act as a warming blanket, ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:00:25.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
