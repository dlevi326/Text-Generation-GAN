Anziva Technologies provides design and operation of neutral-host multi-tenant telecommunications facilities in Puerto Rico and United States and has chosen Dali’s all-digital Distributed Antenna System (DAS) to be installed at Condado Vanderbilt. With so many hotel and resort options now available for guests, it comes as no surprise that guest satisfaction is the key to maintain their competitiveness. Cellular experience plays a key role. Whether travelling on business or pleasure, guests expect to use their mobile devices to talk, text, browse the internet and stream videos without interruption.\nThe need to provide guests with the best cellular experience possible is what led Anziva Technologies to deploy an in-building cellular system from Dali Wireless in the Condado Vanderbilt, one of the finest hotel in Puerto Rico. With Dali’s all-digital Distributed Antenna System (DAS), it can reliably deliver ubiquitous multi-operators’ 3G and 4G services to the guests. The deployment of Condado Vanderbilt will cover an area of over 50,000 square feet including the meeting rooms, restaurant, bar, lobby and the basement.\n“Today, guests have low tolerance for poor cellular coverage and data services. There are so many options available and hotels that don’t provide top notch in-building cellular services will lose guests to competitors,” said Nicholas Gold, Assistant General Manager of Condado Vanderbilt. “Guest satisfaction is our main priority and we are continuing to invest in innovative technologies to improve guests’ loyalty. We are excited that Dali’s in-building cellular system will allow all mobile users to stay connected anytime, anywhere without interruption to services at our hotel.”\n“We partnered with Dali Wireless to deploy the in-building Distributed Antenna System to deliver a powerful mobile experience for the guests and staff at Condado Vanderbilt,” said Israel Aviles, Managing Partner of Anziva Technologies. “With Dali’s all-digital platform, it has the best technology infrastructure to handle MIMO operations. The delay can be set in the digital domain through the GUI making installation and commissioning much easier.\nClick here to see how Dali Wireless can improve your hotel, or other enterprises’ cellular coverage and capacity: http://daliwireless.com/enterprise_das/", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2RhbGl3aXJlbGVzcy5jb20vZW50ZXJwcmlzZV9kYXMv", "http://daliwireless.com/enterprise_das/"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T01:23:24.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
