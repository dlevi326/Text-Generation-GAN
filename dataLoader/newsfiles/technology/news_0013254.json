Otherwise, the papers were due Sept. 28.\nApple told the Supreme Court it believes several Manhattan judges wrongly interpreted the law pertaining to a \"disruptive entry by dynamic companies into new or stagnant markets.\"\nApple said its actions were justified when it entered the e-book market in January 2010 with the launch of the iPad and iBookstore.\nA message seeking comment from the Justice Department was not immediately returned.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
