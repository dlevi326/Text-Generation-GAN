Handelsblatt, citing an unnamed representative of a municipal shareholder, said Werner Brandt, former finance chief of SAP, was also a candidate for the post.\nThe current supervisory board chairman, 76-year old Manfred Schneider, will leave his position in April at his own request.\nThe municipal shareholders intend to nominate Mueller during RWE's supervisory board meeting on Sept. 18, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, confirming the reports.\nRWE declined to comment.
