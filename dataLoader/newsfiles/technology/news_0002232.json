There is increasing recognition that there is often a gap between the design intent and in-use performance of a wide range of built assets. As a consequence the whole life performance of such assets can be significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in considerable economic, environmental and social impacts. In response, governments across the world have made substantial investments in the emerging core topic of Digital Construction. This necessarily involves engineers applying augmented and virtual reality technologies to collect, collate and interpret disparate information and data to link design intentions to the in-use performance and help deliver the expected whole life performance. \nThe aim of this role will be to not only ensure the necessary skills are embedded within the curriculum of the School, thereby enhancing the employability of University of Portsmouth graduates, but also that the prevailing research and knowledge service opportunities are realised through effective industrial collaboration. Such a role will be truly multidisciplinary in nature and will necessarily need to engage with colleagues across the Faculty and beyond. \nThe Department has healthy undergraduate and postgraduate recruitment to a broad range of fully accredited courses supported by excellent links with industry and professional institutions. \nFor detailed information about the vacancy, please select this link: 10014976 - Senior Lecturer in Digital Construction..docx Share this job", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T02:35:13.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
