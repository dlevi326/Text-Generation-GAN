The text blocking system that keeps teen drivers safe by reducing cell phone distractions for the driver, but not the passenger. A conscientious solution. CarBlocker is a simple and automatic way to solve the issue of distracted teen driving. This unique product uses a plug-in adapter and an in-phone App together to detect not only when the phone is in a moving vehicle, but it helps to determine who has the driver’s phone and who has the passenger’s phone. This important feature means that the driver cannot operate their phone while driving, but passenger phones in the rest of the vehicle are unaffected. This innovative technology is set to become the new standard in the car safety industry.\nThe CarBlocker is an easy to use car plug-in and it has an intuitive application with quick set up. This will protect younger drivers by keeping them focused on the road. Lastly, it is completely customizable to preferences and specific needs. However, before this incredible product can improve road safety, CarBlocker needs help. That’s why they launched this campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $38,500 by November 20, 2015. The funds raised will go towards packaging and production.\nTo help create this innovative product, please visit the IndieGoGo campaign or click here . Backers can choose from many attractive rewards as a “thank you” for their donations.\nDon’t miss out on this great opportunity in helping to get this robust solution to texting and driving into the hands of those who need it.\nKnow others that would love this?
