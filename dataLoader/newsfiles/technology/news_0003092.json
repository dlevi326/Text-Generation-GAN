criticises Australian minister's 'lapping waves' quip by Staff Writers Sydney (AFP) Sept 12, 2015 Australian minister's 'lapping' waves quip falls flat after climate talks Sydney (AFP) Sept 11, 2015 - An Australian minister's quip about \"water lapping at your door\" after talks with Pacific island leaders concerned about rising sea levels was criticised Friday as a \"bad joke\" which could horrify regional neighbours.\nImmigration Minister Peter Dutton made the comment to Prime Minister Tony Abbott -- who had just returned from the Pacific Islands Forum in Papua New Guinea's capital Port Moresby -- as a meeting on refugees ran late. \nDutton said the event was running to \"Cape York time\", a reference to the remote Aboriginal area in Australia's far northeast where Abbott recently visited, to which the prime minister replied: \"We had a bit of that up in Port Moresby\". \n\"Time doesn't mean anything when you're about to be, you know, have water lapping at your door,\" Dutton added. \nFootage from media which had been invited to cover the start of the meeting shows Abbott laughing somewhat awkwardly at that comment before Social Services Minister Scott Morrison points out the sound boom microphone above their heads. \nThe Pacific Islands Forum, a 16-nation group of mainly small island nations, some of which are susceptible to rising sea levels, wrapped up this week with leaders agreeing to disagree. \nThe smaller nations wanted to use the meeting to send a clear message to climate talks in Paris in December that the average global warming should be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels. \nBut regional powers Australia and New Zealand refused to commit to that target, which is tougher than the UN mandate for no more than a 2.0-degree rise. \nGreens Senator Larissa Waters said Pacific leaders, particularly those who believe their islands are in danger of inundation from climate change, would be unimpressed. \n\"I think our regional neighbours are going to be utterly horrified at the disdain that our prime minister has shown them,\" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \nLabor opposition leader Bill Shorten echoed comments made by United States President Barack Obama earlier this year that \"any leader who treats climate change as a joke isn't fit to lead\". \n\"It was a bad joke by a minister who is a bad joke,\" Shorten told reporters. \nDutton has refused to explain what he meant by the comment, saying only it was a \"private conversation with the prime minister\". \n\"I don't intend to comment publicly on that,\" he said. \nPresident Anote Tong, whose low-lying Pacific nation of Kiribati is threatened by rising seas, Saturday criticised an Australian minister's quip about \"water lapping at your door\", saying it showed \"moral irresponsibility\". \nImmigration Minister Peter Dutton made the remark on Friday while chatting with Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who had just returned from the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) in Papua New Guinea's capital Port Moresby. \nAs the event they were at appeared to be running late, Dutton made mention of \"Cape York time\", a reference to a remote indigenous area in Australia's far northeast. \nWhen Abbott replied that there were similar issues in Port Moresby, Dutton said in comments captured by a media microphone: \"Time doesn't mean anything when you're about to be, you know, have water lapping at your door.\" \nCombatting climate change was a key issue at the PIF, with leaders ultimately agreeing to disagree after Australia and New Zealand blocked a bid by small island states to limit average global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels rather than 2 degrees. \nKiribati's Tong, who has long campaigned about the impact of climate change in the Pacific, said he had reacted with \"sadness\" rather than anger to Dutton's remark. \n\"I find that extremely sad, extremely disappointing. that we are making jokes about a very serious issue,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \n\"It shows a sense of moral irresponsibility quite unbecoming of leadership in any capacity.\" \nAfter the days of tension about climate change in Port Moresby, Marshall Islands Foreign Minister Tony de Brum also expressed his dismay about the comments. \n\"Seems insensitivity knows no bounds in the big polluting island down s(ou)th,\" he tweeted. \n\"Next time waves are battering my home & grandkids are scared, I'll ask Peter Dutton to come over, and we'll see if he is still laughing.\" \nAbbott defended Dutton, pointing out that his minister had spent the week drawing up plans to resettle 12,000 refugees from the Middle East. \n\"If there's one thing that should be remembered about Peter Dutton's week, it's that this is the week that he masterminded the plan to bring 12,000 needy people to this country,\" Abbott said in Canberra. \nBut criticism also came from other quarters, with indigenous leader Gerhardt Pearson from Cape York saying Dutton's comments were an echo of past times. \n\"We are constantly burdened with the view espoused by the likes of Dutton: it's one of soft bigotry and low expectations, and it continues to dominate policy responses,\" he said in a statement. \nPacific leaders agree to disagree on climate change Port Moresby (AFP) Sept 11, 2015 - Pacific island leaders have agreed to disagree on how to tackle climate change, after Australia and New Zealand blocked a bid from low-lying island nations for a tougher global target. \nProblems with negotiations behind closed doors at the Pacific Islands Forum in Port Moresby were evident with the official communique, due Thursday evening, not released until mid-morning Friday. \nThe 16-nation group consists mainly of small island nations, most of which are susceptible to rising sea levels. \nThey wanted to send a clear message to climate talks in Paris in December that the average global warming should be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels. \nHowever, the UN mandate is for no more than a 2.0-degree rise, and the stumbling block at the conference was the refusal of the two regional powers Australia and New Zealand to commit to the lower number. \nThe carefully worded communique noted the Pacific Island states were among \"the most vulnerable and least able to adapt and to respond\" to the consequences of climate change. \nThe Pacific Islands Forum leaders \"declare that an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius would severely exacerbate the particular challenges facing the most vulnerable smaller island states of the Pacific and urge all effort be made to stay within the global temperature goal\". \nAt a press conference ahead of the communique release, Kiribati President Anote Tong said it was an agreement to disagree. \n\"It's not the best outcome that we would have liked,\" he said of Australia and New Zealand's refusal to back a figure lower than the UN mandate. \n\"I think we must respect that. Whether we accept that or not is a different question,\" Tong said. \nMany of the island states are barely two metres above sea level, which leaders said added weight to their lower target. \nThey faced serious problems \"on the frontline\" of global warming and were in a very different position to Australia and New Zealand, Tong said. \nThe forum mostly comprises poor island states and Fiji Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama in May called for an end to Australia and New Zealand's \"undue influence\" on Oceania's largest regional grouping. \nAhead of the meeting the leaders of the group's six smallest members said the upcoming climate talks in Paris were the last chance for the world to reach an agreement that could save their vulnerable island nations. \nTuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said he would continue to push for 1.5 degrees to be a legally binding target. \n\"That's the position of the Forum island countries. It is 1.5 degrees and not 2.0 degrees. We will take it to Paris and battle it out there.\" \nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia would go to Paris with \"very ambitious targets\" and he believed they could get emissions down. \nNew Zealand leader John Key said his country and Australia stood by the 2.0 degree target but accepted that low-lying states were particularly vulnerable and they would \"seek an even more ambitious target in Paris\". .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T08:20:34.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
