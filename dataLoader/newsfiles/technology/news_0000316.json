Tomb explorer Bit falls to pieces when Dizzy wakes up a mummy; Arcade gamer Dizzy falls in love with the top prize, a scooter; Pirate Captain Bean falls into a shady sea creature's endless web of games. \nPART 2: Here We Go Again! Super spies Bean, Bit, and NinDitZu (Dizzy) chase down the evil genius who is causing UMIGO to become unhinged; ghost hunters Bean, Bit, and Dizzy must capture all the umighosts haunting an old hotel; and thrill seekers Bean, Bit, and Dizzy have to figure out why they aren't tall enough to ride UMIGO's wildest rollercoaster. \nFor more, visit netaonline.org/pressroom . \nAbout UMIGO Guided by a curriculum team of highly respected educators, UMIGO'S educational content is aligned with Standards for Mathematics for the first and second grades.
