Every fortnight - at new moon or full moon - the Earth, Sun and moon are in a straight line, which causes an increase in tidal ranges. These higher than average tides are called spring tides. The word is thought to derive from the German or Anglo-Saxon word to \"leap up\". \nYet some spring tides are higher than others. Tidal forces are strengthened if the moon is closest to Earth in its elliptical orbit . Tide generating forces are also enhanced when the Sun and the moon are directly overhead at the equator. For the Sun this happens on or around the equinoxes, which happen on 21 March or September. Spring tides are always higher at these times of year. The moon's orbit also takes it above and below the equator over a period of 27.2 days. Just as with the Sun, the tide generating forces are greatest when the moon is directly overhead at the equator. \nThe high tides predicted for 2015 are due to a very slow change in the moon's orbit, which is inclined to the plane in which Earth orbits the Sun. The moon's orbit cuts this surface at an angle of approximately 5 degrees. Over 18.6 years the moon's orbit slowly rotates around so it cuts through the solar orbit in a different place. This so-called nodal cycle has the effect of changing how far above or below the equator the moon can reach in its orbit. \nIn 2015 the moon's orbital excursion above or below the equator takes the minimum value of 18 degrees. This slightly increases the chances of the moon being directly overhead at the equator coinciding with the other factors that contribute to extreme tidal forces.

But it is important to remember that stormy weather has a greater impact than exotic tides. Storm surges, due to low pressure and high winds, can raise sea levels by up to 3m around the UK coastline. \nProfessor Kevin Horsburgh, from the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), said: \"NOC scientists continue to lead the world in the study of tides and all factors contributing to sea level change. The 18.6 year cycle is a fascinating result of heavenly motions. Whilst many features of tides have been known for centuries we are still making new discoveries – for instance we recently showed how slow changes in global sea level can affect the ocean tides \". \nDetails of the highest tides each year can be found on the website of the National Tidal and Sea Level Facility. 22 hours ago 3 Video: NASA scientist sheds light on rare Sept. 27 supermoon eclipse September 15, 2015 \nComing soon for the first time in more than 30 years: you'll be able to witness a supermoon in combination with a lunar eclipse. Fact over fiction on the 'apocalyptic' super blood moon September 25, 2015 \nFor many people, the sight of the moon turning deep red – some would say blood red – during a lunar eclipse is a wonderful sight.

Video: NASA's SDO catches a double photobomb September 15, 2015 \nOn Sept. 13, 2015, as NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, kept up its constant watch on the sun, its view was photobombed not once, but twice. Just as the moon came into SDO's field of view on a path to cross the sun, ...

Out on the pull: Why the moon always shows its face March 27, 2013 \nTechnically, Pink Floyd had it wrong. The space-facing side of the moon isn't dark (except at full moon when the Earth is between the sun and the moon). Not that you'd know that, given we always see the same side of our nearest ...
