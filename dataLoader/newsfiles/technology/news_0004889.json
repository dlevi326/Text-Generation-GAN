They chose ResidentShield because it seamlessly integrates with their core Yardi Voyager system and provides program compliance reporting at the property level. It also offers two convenient coverage options for residents, including a default option that Tarragon automatically applies. \nAccording to Shelly Gil, multifamily regional manager for Tarragon, “ResidentShield has been an amazing addition to our Yardi Voyager system. It is easy to use and provides our residents with a very simple sign up process. We love that it seamlessly integrates with Voyager, and with the touch of a button, we can pull reports to confirm that our properties are fully covered.” \nResidentShield also enables Tarragon to eliminate time-consuming application processing for their staff — which saves time and money. Tarragon provides iPad® tablets in their onsite rental offices so that prospective residents can easily apply online for a rental unit and purchase renters insurance at the same time. In addition, the program includes convenient marketing materials for their staff and rental offices to help promote ResidentShield. \nGil continued, “With ResidentShield, we have greatly limited our out-of-pocket risk by requiring our residents to carry renters insurance. As a result, we have achieved 100% coverage and compliance at all of our properties, for all our residents, across our portfolio.” \n“We are delighted that Tarragon Property Services is protecting its properties with ResidentShield as part of their Yardi single-stack business solution. And, residents are receiving proven coverage that gives them peace of mind and increases their satisfaction,” said Terri Dowen, senior vice president of sales for Yardi. \nAbout Tarragon Property Services \nBased in Sumner, Wash., Tarragon Property Services, an Investco Company, performs commercial and residential property management services for the real estate investments owned and managed by Investco Financial Corporation.
