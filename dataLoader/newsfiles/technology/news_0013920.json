The event will feature interactive workshops and a product and solutions expo, showcasing the new MultiXpress 7 Series, which is now available to Samsung dealers and their customers. The MultiXpress 7 Series combines the printer portfolio of Samsung with the power of an Android tablet interface, and was recognized “Outstanding A3 Monochrome MFP” and “Outstanding A3 Color MFP” by Buyers Laboratory. \nSamsung will also be demonstrating its new M4080FX desktop MFP and M4030ND desktop printers during the event. These printers feature quality text and images with ReCP Technology, enterprise level security for safe printing, powerful paper handling and maximum monthly duty cycle of 120K. With Samsung’s MobilePrint App, users can quickly scan and print email. With its Dual Scan Document Feeder technology, users can scan dual-sided documents at speeds of up to 60 ipm. Users can work efficiently by tailoring their solutions via the Open Architecture-Embedded (XOA-E) platform. \n“The MX7 is the newest addition to Samsung’s innovative print portfolio that addresses the evolution to a mobile-focused workforce and is a result of our commitment to solutions that transform the way businesses work,” said Matt Smith, Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Printing Solutions for Samsung Business, Samsung Electronics America. “We’re excited to bring our latest devices to market for our dealers along with our enterprise solutions and strategies to drive their businesses in an increasingly mobile environment.” \nNext Generation Samsung Smart UX 2.0 \nAt the Summit, Samsung is showcasing its next generation Smart UX 2.0, which features a mobile-friendly interface, and will be available on Android smartphones and tablets as well as iOS devices in 2016. The Smart UX 2.0 allows users to operate the new M4080FX Desktop MFP directly from a mobile device, providing familiarity and a personalized interface. It also enables users to create dynamic workflows that they can then utilize on any of their enterprise multifunction printers. \nEnhanced Support and System Updates \nSamsung is also demonstrating Rsupport, available on all of its MX Series printing devices. This new remote support system allows a service technician to provide remote control, fix and modify to any machine connected to the Internet, providing remote assistance to either an end user or an IT staff member at the customer’s location. Also being introduced is the Smart Update Solution, available in Q1 2016, which allows automatic updates to firmware from Samsung and implements the latest releases of firmware. \nSamsung Business is also partnering with ImageNet, the first dealer in the U.S. using Samsung’s Smart Software Development Kit (SDK) to develop an application that leverages the Smart UX platform. The application enables end customers to order supplies, share meter reads or request a service call using a one-touch button from the operation panel, sending requests directly to the dealer. \n“We are thrilled to be partnering with Samsung Business to provide an easy solution for customers to submit their service requests,” said Pat Russell, Chief Executive Officer at ImageNet. “Completed in less than 20 business days, this solution will provide a seamless process for work orders, creating greater efficiency and productivity for our customers.” \nFor more information about Samsung printing solutions for business, please visit www.samsung.com/us/business .
