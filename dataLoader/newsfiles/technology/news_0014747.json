Redbooth’s new workflow templates now make assigning and managing tasks based on content stored in the cloud—with popular services like Box and Google Drive—immediately actionable by embedding best-practices into repeatable workflows. \nInitially, Redbooth is offering more than a dozen pre-formatted templates to easily set up digital workspaces for a variety of the most common disciplines in which improved collaboration can help teams increase productivity and accountability. The company expects to develop additional templates as customers continue to provide feedback.

From the feedback, best-practices and commonly shared requirements across a variety of disciplines materialized, and providing pre-formatted digital workspaces to make those findings of value to all Redbooth customers became a priority for the company. \n“Redbooth’s full set of unified communication modalities and our intuitive workstream collaboration capabilities make it a powerful solution for organizations who may already be using Box to store files and looking for ways to accelerate their pace of business,” said Redbooth CEO, Dan Schoenbaum. “Our new workflow templates can now have our customer teams experiencing real meaningful results on their first day of using Redbooth.” \nWith more than 900,000 registered users worldwide, Redbooth was named a 2015 Cool Vendor in Unified Communications by Gartner and was ranked the 10 th fastest-growing private software company in America on the 2015 Inc. 5000 (89 th overall).
