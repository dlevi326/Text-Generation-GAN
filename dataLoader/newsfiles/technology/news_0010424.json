There are certain variables such as time, functions, performance, and price that change frequently with the product lifecycle processes. Therefore, the product innovation process should be done based on the changes in above mentioned variables to meet the market the demand. Delivering right product at right time is the major goal of enterprises in the market. PLM provides many benefits to organizations such as significant reduction in time-to-market the product, production cost minimization, and product quality and reliability enhancement. The various challenges faced by product development teams in enterprises include globalization, and growing demand for mass customization as well as quick innovation. These challenges are leading to the growing need for PLM solutions, which provide the collaborative environment and knowledge management of a product's lifecycle process. This research report provides in-depth analysis of the global PLM market based on component types, end-use applications, and geography. In terms of geographical regions, the report segments the global PLM market into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (MEA), and Latin America, which are analyzed in terms of revenue generation. North America is further segmented into the U.S. and Rest of North America, while Europe is divided into EU7, Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and Rest of Europe. Moreover, Asia Pacific is subdivided into Japan, China, South Asia, Australasia, and Rest of Asia Pacific. Also, MEA is further segmented into Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, North Africa, Southern Africa, and Rest of MEA, while Latin America is subdivided into Brazil and Rest of Latin America.The PLM market is categorized based on component types into software and services. The market is experiencing implementation of PLM software in both on-premise as well as cloud-based models. The report further segments both on-premise and cloud-based PLM into various software types including CAD/CAM/CAE (CAx), numerical control (NC), simulation and analysis (S&A), architecture, engineering and construction (AEC), collaborative product definition management (CPDM), digital manufacturing, electronic design automation (EDA), and others.
