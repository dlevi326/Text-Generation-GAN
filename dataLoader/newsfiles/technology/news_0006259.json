At its 29 September media event in San Francisco, Google confirmed that the new Android Marshmallow mobile operating system with software version 6.0 will start rolling out for Nexus owners across the globe next week, but did not mention a specific date. \nThe new Nexus devices â€“ Nexus 6P (Huawei-made first Nexus with a metal build), LG's Nexus 5X and Google's Pixel C tablet will be the first devices to ship with the Marshmallow flavour. Nexus 6, Nexus 5, Nexus 7 2013, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player will receive the upgrade as early as next week. \nA screenshot on the forum of Canadian carrier network Telus hints at a 5 October rollout. This is also expected to be the same date when Google releases the final Marshmallow code to AOSP. So stay tuned until Google's official rollout. However, there's some bad news for owners of older devices introduced in 2012. The Nexus 4, Nexus 7 2012 and 10in Nexus tablet will not receive further Android support and will instead remain on Lollipop forever. Nevertheless, they will continue receiving security updates for a while, except for the 2012 Nexus 7, the oldest among the Nexus devices, which may not even get that.
