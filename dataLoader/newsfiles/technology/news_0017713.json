Imagine receiving a message can be felt, a communication without words. TACTonics™, LLC's patented Sensory Messaging technology makes this a reality. Using a sleek, wearable device called the TACTpuck™, this new dimension of digital communication allows users to send discreet Sensory Messages, called TACTs, which will be felt through the Receiver's senses.\nThe Receiver doesn't have to open, read or even look at your message. Instead, the Sensory Message is called a TACT™ because it's tactile and sensed by touch. The free app TACTspace™ sends from a message from one phone, tablet or computer to another. A wearable device called a TACTpuck™ delivers the message directly and discreetly. A TACTpuck™is about the size of a quarter and can be worn anywhere against the skin. However, before this new dimension of digital communication can come to market, TACTpuck Wearable Technologyneeds help. That’s why they launched this campaign . The goal of the project is to raise $200,000 by October 11, 2015. The funds raised will go towards production and manufacturing.\nTo help create this line of wearable technology, please visit the IndieGoGo campaign or click here . Backers can choose from many attractive rewards as a “thank you” for their donations.\nDon’t miss out on this great opportunity to own this incredible technology!\nTACTonics™\nShaun Sosebee\n404.566.2146\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
