Among other new capabilities available to them, the site’s millions of users can now follow other cooks and share what they have made on Facebook. But behind the redesign is also an attempt to make the site a more appealing destination for advertisers. The company is calling its new site an “always-on platform,” where brands can “be part of the conversation” by creating their own profile pages. Stan Pavlovsky, the president of Allrecipes, said the offering would give brands a way to incorporate themselves into the cooking site and improve the consumer experience. Swanson, part of the Campbell Soup Company , has created a profile page that includes recipes for flank steak and spaghetti soup. But there may also be another benefit, both for advertisers and for Allrecipes. A brand’s profile page — basically, a native advertisement — would almost certainly be immune to the simple software that has become a big source of anxiety for digital media companies: ad blockers. “I think it’s become much more important for the industry to do native ads,” Mr. Pavlovsky said. “Our native experiences would not be filtered by an ad blocker because they’re part of our site experience.” Ad blocking has troubled publishers for years. But the technology has dominated conversation in the industry in recent weeks, causing soul-searching among publishers and advertisers as they rethink how to capture consumers’ attention and make the web-browsing experience less cumbersome. A report last month from Adobe and PageFair, an Irish start-up that monitors ad blocking, projected that the software would lead to nearly $22 billion in lost revenue for advertisers this year. Roughly 200 million people globally now use ad-blocking software; global usage increased 41 percent in the last year. Moves by big players in Silicon Valley are adding to the concern. Most of the ad-blocking activity now occurs on desktop web browsers, according to the Adobe/PageFair report, but Apple said recently that the latest version of its mobile operating system, iOS9, would allow users to download ad-blocking software. And on Tuesday, Google began blocking Flash ads on its Chrome browser. “It’s an industry wake-up call,” said Joe Marchese, president of advanced advertising products at Fox Networks Group and the chief executive of TrueX, an ad technology company that has been acquired by 21st Century Fox. “The current practice of loading up pages with ads is not working.” Ad experts say privacy concerns are driving consumers to run ad blockers. But more than that, many users want to speed up the web-browsing experience, which has become bogged down by a glut of intrusive ads. “What users are really after is a faster web,” said Neal Richter, the chief technology officer at the Rubicon Project, which aims to automate the buying and selling of ads. “Their primary concern is speed, and when you utilize an ad blocker, the web gets a little faster.” \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T04:08:12.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
