India's ability to post a respectable growth rate looks very positive this year,\" he told PTI on the sidelines of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting here.\n\"The Fed hike remains a matter which the US will decide later this month. But, according to me, whatever situation emerges, that would be only a transient phase and therefore our response is that we have to strengthen our own real economy parameters,\" Jaitley said.\nSpeaking after the meeting, the minister said that India needs to ensure that the parameters of its own real economy are strengthened and the government progresses well on that track.\nHis comments come against the backdrop of India's GDP growth slowing to 7 per cent in the three months ended June from 7.5 per cent recorded in the January-March quarter. The decline was mainly on account of deceleration in farm, services and manufacturing sectors.\nThe GDP grew at 7.5 per cent in the January-March quarter while it was 6.7 per cent in the April-June quarter last year, according to data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO).\nTo a query on whether concerns on Chinese currency and Fed rate hike were raised at the G20 meeting, Jaitley said comments were made from various quarters in this regard.\nWhen asked whether industry's concerns over land acquisition would come in the way of economic growth, the Finance Minister said the government has already indicated an \"alternative road map\" in that regard.\nHe said states would be free to pass their own land acquisition laws.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T00:09:53.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
