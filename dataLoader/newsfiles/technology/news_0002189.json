With visibility into this data, marine terminals can plan more efficiently and reduce congestion at the gate.\n“Truck visits to marine terminals can take over two hours due to any number of delays,” said Eric Klein, CEO and Co-Founder of Crux Systems.\n“We reduce turn times by enabling better visibility and communication between terminals, dispatchers and drivers. By introducing more efficient gate processing with automated gate tickets, marine terminals can improve turnaround times even more.”\nThe new app works by drivers or dispatchers simply forwarding their delivery orders to orders@cruxsystems.com, and the information is then automatically imported to their account.\nUsers then gain visibility into container availability, routes, truck locations, and pickup and drop off times.\nNotifications about container availability are automatically updated, so potential problems with delivery orders can be addressed before drivers arrive at the terminal gate.\n“The notifications are all provided automatically, so drivers and dispatchers no longer have to go to dozens of different websites to seek out this information,” said Klein.\nKey features include container availability status, automated gate tickets and advance arrival notifications.\n“Crux Systems eliminates a lot of wasted time that drivers, dispatchers and terminals spend seeking out the information they need to complete their jobs,” adds Klein.\n“By saving a driver just 60 minutes a day through more efficient planning and communication, that’s a potential increase of 10% additional time available for driving. Drivers are able get on their way to their final destination more quickly, and ultimately, save them time that can be spent completing another delivery.”\nThe driver app is available as a free download from the App Store. Plans for dispatchers start at $35/month for container availability notifications, visibility into driver routes and locations, automatic recording of pickups and drop offs, and access to delivery order and driver histories.\nFact File: Crux Systems \nCrux Systems helps moves trucks faster through marine terminals with streamline workflows and better visibility into the data that drivers, dispatchers and terminals need to do their jobs, including container availability notifications and automatic gate tickets. The company was founded in Burlingame, California by Eric Klein and Skylar Stein, both of whom have extensive experience with marine terminal companies and technologies. The name comes from the rock climbing world. Once a climber gets past the crux of a route, the most difficult part of a climb, the rest is easy. We like to believe that Crux Systems helps drivers do just that – get through the most difficult part of the route quickly, and get on their way to their final destination. www.cruxsystems.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T19:03:26.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
