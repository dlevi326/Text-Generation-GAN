In keeping with restrictions ahead of procurement announcements, Jones did not elaborate on the RFP. \nDIA Director Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, who took the reins of the agency in January, has emphasized the importance of ICITE to the agency's mission, while being clear that much more work is needed to figure out how the architecture will be used. \nSpeaking to a conference hosted by AFCEA NOVA in Vienna, Va., Jones described ICITE as an imperative for modernizing intelligence agencies' use of IT. When the project began in 2012, she said, the IC was spending a quarter of its budget on IT, much of it on maintenance. NGA creates Arctic website, map of Earth's radioactivity \nThe National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has created a website for unclassified information on the Arctic that is intended to support broad U.S. government goals for the region. The site provides 3D representations of the Arctic's surface, depictions that will support things like land management and sustainable development, the agency said. \nSeparately, the agency published a map of the Earth's radioactivity. The map uses geophysical and \"antineutrino detection\" data to show variations in radioactivity. \"The open access availability of these antineutrino maps represents the next generation of cartography and gives important insights into the basic understanding about the interior of our planet,\" Shawn Usman, an NGA R&D scientist, said in a statement. \nA significant portion of the NGA's work is unclassified, allowing the agency to showcase its work more than secretive intelligence agencies such as the CIA and the NSA. Former FBI lawyer: Chinese hacker hit my home computer \nMarion \"Spike\" Bowman, a former FBI lawyer and U.S. counterintelligence official, says that a Chinese hacker penetrated his home computer, Newsweek reported . \nBowman, who was deputy general counsel between 1995 and 2006, said he reported a suspicious email he received last week to the FBI, according to the report.
