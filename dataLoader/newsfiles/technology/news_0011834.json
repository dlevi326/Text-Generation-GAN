Financial threats came third, with 63% concerned about possibly losing money from an account, followed by phishing emails and websites - yet another threat targeting account credentials - in fourth place.Threats designed to steal credentials were also among those that users are most familiar with - 86% of respondents are aware of account hacking, phishing and malware that intercepts passwords. This shows that the best known and most worrying online threat for users is the theft of their digital identity.The threats that worry users the least are DDoS attacks and global espionage campaigns. This may be because these types of cyberattacks primarily target companies and rarely threaten ordinary users. Unsurprisingly, DDoS and espionage campaigns are the threats that users are least familiar with - 29% and 27% of respondents, respectively, have not heard about them.One alarming result highlighted by the survey is the fact that 28% of users are ignorant of the ransomware threat. This is at a time when new malicious programs that encrypt files on computers and demand payment for a decryption key are emerging more and more frequently.Kaspersky Lab experts, for example, recently reported a new modification of the Tesla Crypt Trojan that demanded $500 from each victim.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T16:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T19:50:12.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
