Solveforce is the only company offering a real-time quoting tool for searching these top providers in the area. Advantages of a T1 over DSL at the same bandwidth\nIf a company's major and only concern is cost, T1 Bandwidth services ( http://t1.serviceproviders.biz/ ) will win hands down. A T1 is going to be more reliable. The big plus is if it does go down, the SLA (Service Level Agreement) and QoS (Quality of Service) negotiated with the provider mandates a quick response (as in a few hours) to start fixing any T1 issues. A DSL could go down for days and nothing can be done about it. With DSL there's rarely any mandated response times for repairs.\nAlso, a T1 is usually more dedicated than DSL. For example, the provider could have 200 customers or more out of one DSLAM... but the T1 is all for the company. Then there will be fewer latency and bandwidth problems with T1 Bandwidth services ( http://t1closer.net/ ) than anyone would have with a DSL from the same provider. This may not be the case all over... but for most it is true.\nAbout Solveforce T1 Bandwidth\nT1prices.org is managed by SolveForce, a T1 Bandwidth ( http://t1prices.org/ ) Agency that offers its consulting services in the California Region and has been providing business solutions since 2004.
