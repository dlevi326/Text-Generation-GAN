They will sell new wireless communication devices and accessories. They will provide related services for cell phone and other cellular-enabled devices, including configuration and firmware upgrading. Freeyourmobile Services is perfect for anyone who needs flexibility and “carrier-portability” in their wireless services. For example, a business person who regularly travels from Canada to Asia, or Europe, or a retired person who travels widely and regularly as part of their retirement plan.\nFreeyourmobile Services is interested in going the extra mile for clients. They want to be accommodating to clients who have busy schedules by meeting clients at their choice of location and time. However, before these services can be available, Freeyourmobile Services needs help. That’s why they launched this campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $10,000 by November 15, 2015. The funds raised will go towards building a user-friendly website with new features and a Freeyourmobile Services location.\nTo help bring this incredible service to life, please visit the IndieGoGo campaign or click here . Backers can choose from many attractive rewards as a “thank you” for their donations.\nDon’t miss out on this great opportunity to be liberated from a particular cellular provider!\nKnow others that would love this? Spread the word about Freeyourmobile Services by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks.\nContact: Ewen Cameron\nTitle: founder\nPhone: 604 809 2924\nemail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
