It already operates in Australia and New Zealand. \nNetflix has ambitions to make its service available throughout the world and has already been selling its services in more than 50 other countries outside the U.S. \nThe company is borrowing $1 billion to help finance its global expansion, which it plans to complete by the end of next year. \nHowever, it may have to forge partnerships to enter some countries such as China, where there is stiff competition from state-owned broadcasters and media companies as well as big, private Internet firms.
