Institutions already have access to this data without restriction and so should students. The need to demonstrate competency and the ability to learn does not end with graduation â€“ it's a lifelong requirement. Institutions want to follow their students off campus to research student experiences to help guide decisions that will affect future learners. This applies equally to alumni who completed degrees and those who did not. Schools and employers need a bridge to support their dialogue through the people they have in common: students. \n\"It's our hope that this offer will ignite a conversation between institutions, their students and others that to date has been sporadic and unnatural at best,\" Chalk & Wire CEO Geoff Irvine said. \"We want to use this initiative to create partnerships between Chalk & Wire's research group and the organizations we serve to expand our initiatives to aid student success. Such research will shed light on the variables that enhance student success beyond formal education and will also build a two-way bridge with students who have ended their time in formal studies.\" About the Author \nAbout the author: Rhea Kelly is executive editor for Campus Technology.
