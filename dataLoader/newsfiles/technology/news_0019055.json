Industry experts and working professionals from companies, associations and research institutions can now “offer sessions” on topics of their choice and – with Nepris’ new social features – interact more with educators. Nepris has also created a white-label version available for industry groups, associations and regional/statewide STEM coalitions. Click to tweet \nNepris is a cloud-based social platform where teachers and industry professionals connect and collaborate through virtual, interactive sessions and show students science, technology, engineering, the Arts and math applied in the real world. Thousands of such sessions have already been held in schools around the country but in an effort to increase the pool of professionals in its system, Nepris has teamed up with LinkedIn for Good , the social impact arm of LinkedIn, to reach out to professionals who can sign up for skills-based volunteering through Nepris. Over half of Nepris’ industry professionals and experts are now crowd-sourced through LinkedIn where members can discover opportunities best matching their skills and sign up to virtually connect with a classroom. See this article in edSurge for more. \n“Offered sessions” are gaining traction among associations seeking career and technical education (CTE) outreach. These are proactively offered by a company, individual or academic institution and cover a variety of topics related to workforce readiness or career pathways. Recent sessions include one on careers in nursing and another on forensic photography hosted by the National Association for the Advancement of Forensic and Investigative Science . Upcoming sessions for October include one on immigration issues hosted by the World Affairs Council of Dallas and another on human-microbe interactions hosted by graduate students from the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center. \n“The newest additions to Nepris coupled with our relationship with LinkedIn for Good are contributing to our double digit growth,” said Sabari Raja, CEO and founder of Nepris. “Our vision is to build Nepris as the connection hub for bringing industry groups, professionals and experts together with schools. Nepris users now can follow their favorite topics and people, have active discussions around a completed session, message anyone within the platform without barriers and assign archived videos to students while monitoring their access. These new features directly affect student engagement and open their eyes to career possibilities while adding relevance to classroom instruction.” \nAbout Nepris \nDallas-based Nepris brings STEM to life (and now STEAM, which adds the Arts to science, technology, engineering and mathematics) by connecting professionals with teachers and classrooms who need speakers, project mentors or evaluators for interactive, cloud-based sessions. Nepris makes this a turn-key process: identifying and registering professionals and teachers, matching professionals’ skills to the teachers’ needs, advising on best practices for classroom interaction, hosting the interactive sessions and tracking all the data in a social platform.
