Some users also had trouble logging in and finding information such as credit balances or profile details. \nIn some cases, people in group chats were also unable to send messages, although Skype's chat function is largely working as normal. \nAfter several hours, Skype said it had rectified the problem and that full service was being restored . \"We have identified the network issue which prevented users from logging in and using Skype today. We're in the process of reconnecting our users, and focused on restoring full service,\" it said. We're pleased to say we've found and are now rectifying the Skype problem you may have had today.
