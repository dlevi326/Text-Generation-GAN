Photo: supplied\nSIGHT & SOUND\nWhen it comes to musical reproduction, Bluetooth still has plenty of critics. But even its harshest knockers can't deny that since the aptX codec made its way into the technology, it's far better than it was. That's provided, of course, that both the source unit and the speakers are aptX equipped.\nWhen serious speaker brands such as Focal get into it, you have to accept that Bluetooth is becoming a legitimate audio participant. Focal makes serious speakers. You can spend a couple of hundred dollars on Focals or almost $300,000 if you've got it and a lounge room that can accommodate a couple of speakers the size of phone boxes; but you always get top performance for the money.\nFocal XS Book Wireless: High-quality computer speakers with built-in Bluetooth apt-X. Photo: Supplied\nAnd now there's Bluetooth. Focal's aptX-equipped XS wireless speakers are compact bass reflex units primarily intended for a desktop, so they have a modest footprint of 11.4 centimetres by 20 centimetres (height is 28 centimetres) and are wider at the middle than at the top or bottom to accommodate a 10-centimetre polyglass mid/bass driver with a 1.9-centimetre aluminium tweeter above and below the vent. There's also a built-in amplifier delivering a generous 20 watts to each set of drivers.\nAdvertisement Despite their modest dimensions, these get down to 60 Hertz for a solid bassline and go up to 22 kiloHertz, beyond the range of hearing but not beyond the ability of musical instruments – and the frequencies generated up there have an effect on the frequencies you can hear, so having speakers that get to highs you can't hear improves the accuracy of what you can.\nYour first wow moment with these things comes when you unpack them – they're heavy, getting on to three kilograms each, beyond anything you'd expect from speakers intended for your computer. The next big thing is how easy they are to set up. Plug the right speaker into the power, plug the left speaker into the right, and you're in business. Bluetooth pairing is effortless – I had these operating within five minutes of attacking the box, and that included scanning the instructions.\nThe cable connecting the right and left speaker provides a high-quality connection and it's 1.5 metres long, about average for computer speakers. But here's the thing: a 1.5-metre extension for it is also included, giving you maximum separation of three metres. That's because Focal is pretty sure that many people will use these for a home system rather than as computer speakers.\nIf I had to be picky, I'd say these are just a tad too bass-heavy for me and occasionally the highs can get a bit sharpish. But the sound quality is easily good enough for a home system for anyone but a propeller-head audiophile. And the speakers accept an RCA cable input from another source as well as Bluetooth, so set these up with a decent DAC or CD player and bingo, instant music system. There's also a 3.5mm input.\nI had them running in my man cave and it's a big space – as big as the double garage it sits atop – and they filled the entire area with sound effortlessly. For an apartment, these are a highly viable audio solution and they'll work successfully even in larger living rooms.\nOn Bluetooth the sound quality is marginally down on CD quality, although I noticed it only when I was listening hard to the tracks I use to test equipment. For music running in the background while working, I didn't have any problems with the sound quality. I guess the telling point is that I intended to spend a weekend with these but that blew out to five days because I didn't want to pack them up and send them on.\nIt's a pity they are only available in high gloss black, but being so compact they tend to melt into the background, especially in a shelf-load of books or placed on each side of a television (and routing the telly's sound to them brings a noticeable improvement in sound quality there too).\nWhich brings us to price. They're $549 a pair and, yes, that's expensive for computer speakers but it's a bargain for the sound quality and flexibility these supply.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T07:44:43.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
