Developed by Aedima and designed with a sleek and stylish interface, TooNight lets users swipe through a list of their friends to discover:\n1. Where they are, such as at a club, restaurant, park, or anywhere else.\n2. Who they’re with, such as their BFF, work colleague, etc.\n3. How “legendary” they rate their experience on a scale of 5 stars (with 1 star being boring, and 5 stars being amazing).\nIf they’re intrigued by what they discover, users can use the app’s built-in messaging platform to connect with their friends and make plans, and put in motion what promises to be an unforgettable night. They can also “check in” to a location and be found by their friends via the app.\nOr, if users aren’t interested in getting together with their friends because nobody is proposing anything fun, interesting or appealing, they can find new friends via TooNight’s messaging interface (which has a similar look and feel to WhatsApp), or via Facebook integration. In this way, the app has the potential to expand each user’s social circle by hundreds or thousands of new people -- which can turn any lacklustre, boring evening into one full of exciting adventure. At the same time, users can add anyone to their “block” list if they don’t want to be contacted.\n“The key to experiencing a legendary night isn’t what people do, but it’s who they do it with,” commented François Rochat of Aedima. “With TooNight, people can connect with old and new friends in the heart of the action, have fun and, of course: be legendary!”\nTooNight is available now at no-cost from the App Store at https://itunes.apple.com/app/toonight/id913614522 .\nAdditional TooNight details and a video trailer is available at http://toonightapp.com .\nFor all other information or media inquiries, contact Mark Johnson on behalf of Aedima at +1 408 757 0156 or press (at)appshout(dot)com.\nAbout Aedima\nFounded in 2012 and a major incubator in Switzerland, Aedima is involved in a variety of technology projects and iPhone apps.
