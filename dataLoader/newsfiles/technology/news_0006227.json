More than ever, enterprise businesses are implementing Bring Your Own Device programs to allow their employees to work on their personal devices away from the office, on the move, and from remote locations. BCC Research reveals in its new report that the growing trend for enterprises to adopt enterprise mobility technology will lead the market to double its value during the forecast period. An enterprise mobility solution enables employees to access corporate data on their mobile devices. The technology involves data capture, manipulation, transfer, storage and management.\nThis report organizes information based on the market data of three key components of enterprise mobility technology: devices (desktop and mobile PCs, smartphones and tablets), mobile operating systems (Android, Apple, Microsoft and Samsung) and services (managed and professional).\nThe global market for enterprise mobility is expected to reach $99.5 billion and $201.6 billion in 2015 and 2020, respectively, reflecting a five-year (2015-2020) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.2%. North America’s enterprise mobility market was estimated at $31.1 billion in 2014, and should reach $67.1 billion by 2020, posting a five-year CAGR of 13.6%. Europe’s market was estimated at $28.5 billion in 2014, and should total nearly $71.5 billion in 2020, registering a five-year CAGR of 16.6%. The Asia-Pacific enterprise mobility market was estimated at $8.3 billion in 2014, and should total $24.7 billion in 2020, reaching a 19.8% CAGR during the forecast period.\nFrom a product category standpoint, end-user devices dominated the global enterprise mobility market in 2014 with a 55% share, followed by open-operating system and services with a 31.4% and 13.6% share, respectively. As the largest end-user devices type in 2014, smartphones garnered a 38.1% share of the market, with mobile PCs, desktop PCs, and media tablets occupying 32.2%, 24.6% and 5.1% of the market share, respectively. In 2014, Android was the largest enterprise mobility open operating system type, followed by Apple, Other, and then Microsoft.\nThe exponential growth of the global enterprise mobility market is anticipated to continue. Key market drivers include unprecedented demand for mobile devices and increasing use of mobility by consumers and employees. This exponential growth is easing market entry, as well as creating opportunities for core product development. These factors, along with an upswing in acquisitions, also are driving global growth.\n“Three forces—technology convergence, ubiquitous connectivity/computing and increasing affordability—are driving the demand for smart devices,” says BCC Research analyst Natrai Pandal. “The International Telecommunication Union reports that between 2000 and 2015, Internet penetration increased almost seven-fold from 6.5% to 43% of the global population. Forecasts indicate that the total installed base of smart devices will exceed that of PCs and laptops in the next few years.”\nThe Global Enterprise Mobility Market (IFT119A) examines aspects of enterprise mobility, demand trends and market opportunities. The report also reviews the overall global enterprise mobility market and the market penetration of this technology in different regions and countries.\nMarket dynamics, growth drivers, inhibitors, opportunities, and forecasts trends and revenue through 2020.\nEditors and reporters who wish to speak with the analyst should contact Steven Cumming at steven.cumming(at)bccresearch(dot)com.\nAbout BCC Research\nBCC Research publishes market research reports that make organizations worldwide more profitable with intelligence that drives smart business decisions.
