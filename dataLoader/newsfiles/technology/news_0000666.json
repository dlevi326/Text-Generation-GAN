I’m going to use Zimbabwe as a reference point only because a number of Zimbabwe’s consumer goods are manufactured here in South Africa which makes the cost of production exactly the same.\nI must admit that I have never been to Zimbabwe. I will be referring to an article below from a Human rights researcher Michael Hobbs who frequents the country. The link to his story is below.\nHe writes in his blog that a cappuccino cost him $4(R54) and in S.A. this will cost you on average R15. –R39. This means that buying the same product in Dollars comes at a premium (R39). This to me sounds like an inflated value. This also means that the dollar is not strong but inflated. If it was strong, according to me, one would have been able to buy the product above for $1 or less. It appears, given the above, that converting your currency to dollar is of no benefit not unless if you are travelling to America or Zimbabwe as in the case above.\nI want to now prove to you that contrary to the dollar, the ZAR is strong and not inflated. I will now swop the positions. The ZAR will take the Dollar’s position as a stronger unit and the Nigerian Naira will take the ZAR’s position as a weaker unit. The exchange rate between the ZAR to the Naira is R1=N14.23\nThis exchange rate is not that far from the $1=R13.80 and this will make this example more relevant to my point. My use of Nigeria’s currency as a reference point cannot come at a better time than now just after it has taken over South Africa as the largest economy in Africa. This on its own will prove that I did not just randomly, to suit my argument, choose just any currency.\nIn Nigeria the price of our product above is, on average, N588 which is R41. For this much I can get 1 cappuccino, extra sugar, and the whole packet of Tennis biscuit and get to pocket the change. I was not able to do this using the so called strong but inflated dollar to the Rand.\nThe above comparison, at least to me, means that even though the ZAR is getting weaker and weaker in dollar terms, it has not lost that much purchasing power in Rand terms. The Dollar is the one that has gotten more and more inflated instead of getting stronger and stronger.\nhttp://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=Nigeria\nhttps://www.google.co.za/#q=dollar%20to%20rand", "external_links": ["http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=Nigeria", "https://www.google.co.za/#q=dollar%20to%20rand"], "published": "2015-09-08T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T10:03:31.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
