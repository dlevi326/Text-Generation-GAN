The building includes a classroom, health station, public showers and bathroom, while the covered area serves various purposes, such as theater and meeting space. The surrounding outdoor area is used for sports like badminton and volleyball, and is also used as a physical training ground. \nAccording to H&P Architects, Re-ainbow is designed to withstand heavy storms. It was part-built using recycled and unwanted materials which include scaffolding pipes, sheet metal, brick and bathroom ware. Costs were also kept down by tasking local volunteers with some of the manual labor required. \nThe firm added some sensible sustainable tech too. A solar panel measuring 1.1 x 0.5 m (3.6 x 1.6 ft) produces electricity and there's also a solar hot water system. A 500 l (132 US gallon) rainwater collection tank is also integrated into the roof, and the building's overall design aims to maximize natural ventilation and lighting. \nRe-ainbow was completed this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:18:32.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
