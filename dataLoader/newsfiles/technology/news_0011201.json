Among the key findings in the report are that employee training programs deliver overall better results when the content is delivered via online, micro-video content . \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150908/264407 \nThis nationwide survey, conducted from June 10 through Aug. 4, 2015 on behalf of BizLibrary, collected a total of 1,821 responses , 55% of which came from the public (non-BizLibrary client employees) and 45% from BizLibrary client employees. The report provides evidence on changes in online training trends and the industry as a whole. \nThis initial volume reports employee perceptions on the effectiveness of training programs at performing three foundational tasks: teaching new skills, improving performance and preparing for the future . The report also measures employee perceptions on the effectiveness of different training methods. \nAmong the other key findings reported are that BizLibrary client employees with access to online content delivered via micro-video report substantially better learning results compared to public participants with access to different types of learning programs. \nThe next volume of this series will explore the relationship between employee perceptions of training effectiveness and the content and topics organizations provide. The third volume will provide a range of data from technology use to topics, based on job roles. \nClick here to view the full report: Employee Perspectives on Training Vol. 1 \nQuote attributable to Chris Osborn, Vice President of Organizational Strategy: \n\"We looked carefully at the 'State of the Industry' reports that are generated each year, and we noticed an important theme. All of the data shared a common point of view. All of those reports came from data generated by organizational leaders in either HR or employee training. None of the widely published data reported any information about how employees felt about the effectiveness of $70 billion spent by American organizations each year on employee learning. This survey and subsequent report represent our attempt to change that. \nWe wanted to learn what employees think about the training they receive from their employers, but to find out, we had to ask ourselves. So we developed and ran this survey. We are very pleased with the level of participation. With over 1,800 responses, we believe we have a substantial enough sample size that these results are significant. We are also deeply gratified that BizLibrary client employees reported results that are so much better than employees at other organizations. We believe we've been at the leading edge of employee learning for quite some time, and this data really helps confirm that belief.\" \nAbout BizLibrary \nBizLibrary is a leading provider of online employee training and eLearning solutions.
