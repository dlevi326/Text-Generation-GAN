Inc. \nSALEM, N.H., Sept. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Ezenia! Inc. (\"Ezenia\" or the \"Company\") today announced that the bankruptcy court has issued a favorable ruling for the Company in its years-long dispute with former CEO Khoa Nguyen. Specifically, the court (i) denied Nguyen's claims for severance benefits and federal income tax damages, (ii) limited Nguyen's allowed claims for deferred compensation, (iii) denied Nguyen's sanctions motion against the Company in their entirety, and (iv) granted the Company's sanctions motion against Nguyen in the amount of $45,000. \nThe Company had previously escrowed funds to reserve for the entire amount of the claims sought by Nguyen. Following the bankruptcy court's decision, these funds will now be released from escrow and used to repay a material portion of the Company's outstanding indebtedness. The conclusion of this matter and resulting debt reduction will allow the Company to resume its focus on developing a next generation platform for insider threat detection and unified communications. \nAbout Ezenia!
