This is an incredible breakthrough as previously paralyzed individuals had successfully moved limbs with their mind, but had not been able to feel back with those limbs. In one study, a 28-year-old man who was paralyzed more than a decade ago became the first person to “feel” physical touch through a prosthetic hand. In another breakthrough, volunteers who got electrical arrays implanted in their brains are seeing improvements in their memory, DARPA said. In another study, DARPA engineers and scientists at Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory inserted electrodes into the patient’s motor cortex which allowed him to control the hand with mere thoughts. The working of the arm uses sensors that detect pressure being applied to its fingers, and converts this pressure into electric signals which tell the brain implant how the device has to act. In a series of tests, the team touched each of the prosthetic hand’s fingers while the patient was blindfolded to measure the accuracy to the arm. The subject was able to respond with 100% accuracy most times. “At one point, instead of pressing one finger, the team decided to press two without telling him,” Justin Sanchez, the program manager said in a statement. “He responded asking whether somebody was trying to play a trick on him. That is when we knew that the feelings he was perceiving through the robotic hand were near-natural.” In yet another study, the spatial memory of the subjects undergoing brain surgery, saw significant improvements with the insertion of electrode implants. The small electrode arrays placed in brain regions were involved in the formation of declarative memory, according to DARPA. The goal is to improve memory by using targeted electrical stimulation, which could help people with memory problems — including those with traumatic brain injuries, Sanchez said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T09:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T07:36:35.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
