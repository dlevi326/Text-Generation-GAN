It goes without saying that most people will hate the experience.\nWhether they’re buying or selling, going through a dealership or negotiating the transaction through a classified website such as craigslist.org , a majority of customers fear they will be ripped off – buyers by paying too much for a car of dubious history, sellers by getting too small a price.\n“There is a lot of uncertainty in the purchase of a used vehicle,” said Sy Bohy, CEO and co-founder of Instamotor, a new service that allows used-car buyers and sellers to list and purchase vehicles through a smartphone app.\nThrough the app, sellers list their cars, including information on mileage and features, as well as post pictures taken with their phones. Instamotor then reviews each car for problems that could make the vehicle unsafe, such as government recalls and prior accidents, and decides whether to accept or reject the listing.\nBuyers are likewise verified through the app in an effort to reduce the incidence of fraud.\n“We just weren’t happy with the idea that you can go to a supermarket and there are more regulations from the FDA to protect you from poisons than there are regulations protecting you when you buy a $15,000 or $20,000 vehicle on Craigslist,” said Bohy, echoing the sentiments of half a dozen used-car marketplace startups that have recently expanded into Orange County.\nLaunched in the Bay Area in March and available here since June, Instamotor is one of several new Internet-enabled used-car services that negate the need for customers to ever step foot inside a dealership or haggle with absolute strangers.\nAnother used-car buying app, Shift, also launched in June 2014, following the used-car marketplace websites beepi.com , carvana.com , carlypso.com and vroom.com – all of which have become available in Orange County in the past year.\nWhile the mechanics of each site and app work differently, each promises a less time-consuming, more transparent experience for buyers and sellers. They often claim to yield better prices on both sides of the deal – a higher yield for sellers and a lower price for buyers.\nMany, such as Vroom, Beepi and Shift, offer vetting services that put vehicles through multipoint vehicle inspections, similar to the certified preowned programs run by many automakers. Some will even deliver the car for free or arrange a test drive – all at the press of a button.\nThe proliferation of used-car-buying web sites and apps is a response “to some feeling out there that elements of the car-buying process are broken,” said Jack Nerad, executive marketing analyst at Kelley Blue Book in Irvine. “Some people are also looking at the size of the industry and the number of car transactions and seeing some profit to be gained by approaching that in a different way.”\nThe fixes needed are multifaceted, Nerad said. One of the biggest complaints about car buying is the amount of time it takes to complete a transaction. But there are also concerns about vehicles’ crash and recall histories, as well as fair pricing, since there is so much variability in the value of used cars, even among seemingly identical makes and models, he said.\n“With used cars, there’s no common understanding about what a vehicle is worth. A vehicle is worth what one person will pay for it as long as the check doesn’t bounce,” said Nerad, whose website gives approximate values of used cars based on their condition and features.\n“Each used car is an individual item. It’s maintained differently than every other vehicle just like it, with different miles. There’s a lot of variables, so it’s hard to generalize about their value,” he said.\nThe dealer markup on a used car is often about 50 percent, making used-car sellers understandably leery about making less than what their cars are actually worth. But selling cars themselves through online classifieds is rife with other risks.\n“I have had many inquiries about my car in the last two weeks, with 10 percent being scams from who knows where,” said Jason Bray of Torrance, who was trying to sell his 2001 Audi S4 on Craigslist’s Orange County site. “Eighty percent have been people that lowball the heck out of you to the point that I do not even respond.”\nMany of the new online used-car services guarantee a price to sellers while assuring buyers they are also getting a deal that is often below market value. Lacking the costly overhead of dealerships and marketing, many of the services save money by keeping sellers’ cars in their owners’ driveways until they are sold.\nMany of them also make their money by being a one-stop shop for financing, insurance and registration instead of skimming a percentage off the car.\nThe Shift app is similar to many of its competitors in that it sends a flesh-and-blood “car enthusiast” to evaluate the vehicles it eventually sells, and to take photos and post the listings.\nUnlike the competition, Shift leverages the larger audiences of other web sites such as autotrader.com and cars.com to bring in the best possible price for sellers. Shift and Instamotor are the only services of their kind to provide test drives to potential buyers.\nThe used-car buying websites, including Beepi, don’t provide test drives, though they do offer buyers a money-back guarantee within a short time frame.\n“The main problem we’re here to solve is information asymmetry, said Owen Savir, co-founder of Beepi, which works as a virtual middleman for buyers and sellers of used cars. “The seller of the car, whether it’s private party or a dealer, knows everything there is to know about the car, whereas the buyer doesn’t know anything. We think that’s the source of most of the things that are wrong.”\nSince launching in San Francisco in April 2014 and expanding to 12 additional metropolitan areas this year, Beepi is on track to be the largest used-car dealer in California by the end of 2015, Savir said.\nTo assure buyers of a car’s quality, Beepi only accepts vehicles that are less than six years old or have fewer than 60,000 miles. The cars Beepi sells can only have had two owners, and they can’t have been in a crash.\nThey are also run through a two-hour, 185-point inspection to look at the interior and exterior both mechanically and cosmetically. The car is checked for any crash history through CarFax. One out of every three cars is rejected, Savir said.\nSellers begin the process with Beepi by filling out an online form that takes about two minutes and yields a price for the car. If the seller accepts the price, he’s pretty much done. An inspector comes to his home or office to evaluate the car’s condition and take pictures, then Beepi staff list the vehicle on the website. Beepi guarantees the car will be sold within 30 days or it will buy it from the seller for the Quote: d price.\nBuyers can search the website for cars by make, model, mileage and other qualifiers and see detailed photos of the interiors and exteriors. If they like a car, they buy it through the website with a credit card, check or financing arranged through Beepi.\nBeepi picks up the car from the seller, washes it, fills it with gas and delivers it via flatbed truck. And if the buyer doesn’t like it for any reason, Beepi will take it back and refund the money.\n“Being a husband and father of two kids, I’m often looking to find efficient ways to do things,” said Randy Scott Wong, an Irvine entrepreneur who had an Audi S7 sport sedan he needed to sell when he came across a Facebook post about Beepi in March and decided to give it a try.\nWong was especially thrilled he didn’t have to let strangers test drive his car or show it to anybody other than a Beepi inspector.\nWong doesn’t recall the exact price he was offered, “but it was slightly better than what you might expect by going to a traditional dealer,” he said . “You could haggle all day and probably meet that, but I just felt this was realistic. Somebody has completely inspected it. They’re offering to sell it. I got an email offer I could feel good about, and hey, the car is sold.”\nContact the writer: scarpenter@ocregister.com On Twitter: @OCRegCarpenter", "external_links": ["http://carlypso.com/", "http://carvana.com/", "http://craigslist.org/", "http://vroom.com/", "http://autotrader.com/", "http://beepi.com/", "http://cars.com/"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T15:10:38.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
