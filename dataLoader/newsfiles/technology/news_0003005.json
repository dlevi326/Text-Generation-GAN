BIMCO believe illegal fishing increases the risk of piracy for commercial shipping, according to IHS Maritime 360 .\nMaritime piracy is currently going through a boom period, with two containerships recently attacked in August, 2015 along the straits of Singapore and Malacca, and Singapore-based anti-piracy organisation ReCAAP noting an 18% increase in maritime piracy incidents from January-August, 2015 , in comparison to 2014.\nGiles Noakes, Chief Maritime Security Officer at BIMCO, said: \"For me personally, from a BIMCO perspective, I see it [illegal fishing] as a problem area because it is a potential catalyst for re-aggravating the local community.\n\"How we deal with it, though, is not within the Atlanta agreement, so it is a very difficult situation.
