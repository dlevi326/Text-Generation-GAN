On March 6, 2015 , MaxPoint completed its IPO, selling 6.5 million shares of common stock to investors at $11.50 per share, for gross proceeds of more than $74 million . In connection with its IPO, the Company filed a Registration Statement and Prospectus (collectively, the \"Offering Materials\") with the SEC. The complaint alleges that the Company's Offering Materials contained false and misleading statements about the Company's financial condition, business and prospects. Among other things, the complaint alleges that MaxPoint's Offering Materials failed to disclose: (i) that the Company was wholly dependent upon its top 50 customers alone for two-third of its sales; and (ii) that the Company had been signing smaller customers with smaller advertising budgets in the months leading up to its IPO. Following the Company's IPO, the price of MaxPoint common stock significantly declined to a current trading price of approximately $5.00 per share.
