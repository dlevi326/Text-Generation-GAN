Mr Evans said the most recalled items were around domestic economics conditions and overseas issues.\n“News on the Australian dollar was noted by 15.5 per cent of respondents -- the highest on the dollar since June 2002,\" Mr Evans said.\nThe weakness in the Australian dollar was likely to have unnerved households, he said. The currency has plunged to a fresh six-year low, diving below US70c for the first time since 2009.\n“The government would be pleased to see that ‘budget and taxation’ caught the attention of only 23.1 per cent of respondents compared to 62.7 per cent in September last year,\" Mr Evans said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T04:15:44.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
