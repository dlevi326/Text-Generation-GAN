ANZ’s reading of consumer confidence showed sentiment slumped to a 14-month low.\nMeanwhile, the Australian dollar had ticked up slightly to around US69.5c on NAB’s conditions report and after Japan upwardly revised its second-quarter GDP read, which showed that economy had contracted less than expected.\nLooking forward, Westpac/Melbourne Institute releases its monthly consumer confidence survey tomorrow while the Australian Bureau of Statistics offers up housing finance data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T09:50:34.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
