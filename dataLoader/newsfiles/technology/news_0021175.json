The aroma of incense sticks filled the air. \nAmong them was 31-year-old Bijay Darshan who walked through the crowd holding a large photo of his family members, buried when the earthquake toppled his five-floor rented house. \n\"I lost five from my family, including my nine-year-old daughter. I am walking for them today,\" Darshan told AFP. \n\"There is a strange solace in walking with so many others bereaved like us,\" Darshan, a tailor, added. \nMany were lined up along the crowded route with sweets, milk, money and fruit, offering them to the children leading the procession. \n\"This is a spiritual walk. My daughter's face is flashing before my eyes as I pray for her,\" said Radhika Napi, 45, whose 24-year-old daughter and grandson died in the quake. \nThe festival began after Kathmandu's king Pratap Malla, in a bid to console his queen over their son's death, urged his subjects to stage a procession if they had also had a death in their family that year. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T08:01:55.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
