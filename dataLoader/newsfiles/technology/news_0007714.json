Yatra.com, which gets 30 per cent of its revenues through mobile, was galvanised by the response and has set itself a target to increase revenues from the mobile app to about 50 per cent of its total in about 18 months.Not just Yatra, travel companies such as MakeMytrip.com and Expedia have also seen a lot of traction on their mobile applications and are working with different strategies to populate them.\"About 30 per cent of our revenues come from the mobile application and we plan to increase it to 50 per cent over 18 months. We have set aside about $5 million on mobile investments to ramp up the mobile business. My sense is that the penetration of mobile is growing and we should be able to scale it up faster,\" Yatra.com chief executive officer Dhruv Shringi had told ET in an interview recently.Makemytrip.com, India's largest online travel portal in terms of revenue, believes that the shift towards mobile has started and traffic from mobile apps have grown 250- 300 per cent year-on-year compared with about 30 per cent y-o-y growth in website traffic. Close to 45 per cent of Expedia's business in India comes through the mobile app. Travel portals believe that the mobile app will grow faster with the increasing number of smartphone users in India. While Yatra.com has set aside funds for it, Makemytrip and Expedia have entered the fight with incentives for users and innovative features for their application.\"We have set aside about $5 million dollars on mobile investments to ramp up the mobile business. The funds will be invested in populating the mobile application and acquire customers through discounts and advertisements and incentives,\" said Shringi.Makemytrip.com's strategy to promote its application is through promotions and offers. \"Application downloads are incentivised with a promotional discount of Rs 500. We run \"Appy Hours\" every Thursday (6 -10 pm) to promote hotel bookings. We have also introduced the concept of \"Trippy Tuesdays\" recently, where users get a flat discount of Rs 1,250 upon paying for flight bookingsthrough select bank partners,\" said an email response from the company.Expedia's strategy is to attract consumers to their mobile application by converting it into a guide for the passenger. \"Our application will soon have features that will integrate your travel plans with your calendar and Passbook and will work as your personal assistant with regular reminders and useful information, while on the move. It will be available even when the phone is not connected to the Internet,\" Vikram Malhi, managing director- Asia,Expedia, told ET.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:39:55.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
