Makes sense to me – all organizations should make room and opportunity for innovation. \nOne of the results of this initiative is the new “Snip” tool for Windows. Snip is a screen capture and annotation tool (or just a ‘whiteboard’ if you want it). It makes it really easy to create instructional videos by writing or drawing on a screen ‘snips and saving the resulting video as an MP4 file. \nI created this newest “ 3 Minute Teaching With Tech Tutorial ” to show you how easy it is to use: \nThere are other tools around like this, but Snip combines some important basic functions and delivers them in one unique free tool. \nAfter watching the brief video, learn more by checking out my post, Create Video Lessons in a Snap with Snip on FlippedClassroomWorkshop.com. Snip can be great for teaching, learning, or technical support. It’s quick and easy to download – take a few minutes and try it out !
