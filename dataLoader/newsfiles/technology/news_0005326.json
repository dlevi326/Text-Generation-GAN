Earlier this month, Cook told Stephen Colbert that he was not happy with how Steve Jobs is portrayed in Sorkin's upcoming new movie about the legendary Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) founder.\n\"He was a joy to work with,\" Cook said on the \"Late Show.\" \"I think that a lot of people are trying to be opportunistic, and I hate this. It's not a great part of our world.\"\nSorkin seemed to take exception to the \"opportunistic\" accusation. \"If you've got a factory full of children in China assembling phones for 17 cents an hour, you've got a lot of nerve calling someone else opportunistic,\" Sorkin said, according to the Hollywood Reporter .\nNow Sorkin says he's sorry.\n\"You know what, I think that Tim Cook and I probably both went a little too far. And I apologize to Tim Cook,\" Sorkin told E! News . \"I hope when he sees the movie he enjoys it as much as I enjoy his products.\"\nSorkin's film, \"Steve Jobs,\" is set to be released next month.\nCNNMoney (New York) September 28, 2015: 11:04 AM ET", "external_links": ["http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/aaron-sorkin-tim-cook-youve-827284", "http://www.eonline.com/news/700364/aaron-sorkin-apologizes-to-apple-ceo-tim-cook-after-slamming-him-over-opportunistic-remarks", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150909094639-steve-jobs-film-trailer-1024x576.png"], "published": "2015-09-28T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T04:10:27.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
