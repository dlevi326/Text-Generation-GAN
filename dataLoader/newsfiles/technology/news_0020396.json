Fiat Chrysler sold 201,672 vehicles overall. \nOther automakers report sales later Tuesday. \nIndustry sales were expected to drop 3 percent from last August, according to car buying site TrueCar.com. It was the first year-over-year monthly sales decline since January 2014. But industry analysts say a quirk in the calendar — not a lack of demand — was to blame. \nLabor Day is typically one of the biggest sales weekends of the year as dealers hold model year-end clearance sales. Last year, Labor Day weekend was counted as part of August sales. This year it's in September.
