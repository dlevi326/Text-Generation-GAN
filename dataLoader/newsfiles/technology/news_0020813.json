The deal is the largest office lease signed to date in Hollywood in terms of square feet. \n\"ICON is a state-of-the-art facility that places Netflix squarely in the middle of Hollywood's creative culture to support our next stage of growth and content creation,\" said Netflix CFO David Wells. \"The property's combination of office, stage and production space provides an ideal setting.\" \nThe planned move of the Netflix Southern California office comes as the over-the-top ( OTT ) video company ramps up original production in Los Angeles and surrounding communities. Among the Netflix originals shot in or near Los Angeles are Arrested Development and the Emmy-nominated Grace and Frankie, as well as upcoming series Fuller House, The Ranch, Lady Dynamite, Flaked, Love and With Bob and David. The Netflix original film Pee-wee's Big Holiday will also be filmed there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:28:38.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
