To set the scene the report starts by charting some global need-to know numbers; these highlight where growth is looking strongest and include a few records.\nA handful of notable figures:\nIn percentages:\n4% - the rise in visits to the UK visits between May 2014 and 2015 - a record\n38% - outbound travel expected to rise to the US from Mexico by 2020\n80% - how much IATA expects airline industry profits to grow in 2015 – another record\nIn millions:\n20 million – the number of overnight stays in Germany in the first four months of 2015\n62 million - the number of Chinese who travelled abroad in the first half of 2015, a rise of 13%\n26 million – the number of mobile subscribers added in India in Q1 alone\nIn billions:\n$58 billion : the estimated global real estate transaction volume in 2015\n$50 billion: the rumoured valuation of a potential Uber IPO\nMobile times\nAside from the big numbers the report provides a concise and useful overview of the broad economic trends likely to impact the travel sector in the coming months, and highlights some key figures from all major global economies. It also documents specific industry trends in the airline, hotel, online travel and business travel sectors.\nWhat’s abundantly clear is that the explosive rise of mobile is set to continue and will have a huge impact on how consumers can increasingly call the shots. According to the GSMA there were 3.7 billion unique mobile subscribers by mid-2015. By 2020 it expects to there to be 4.6 billion individual users.\nCiting Comscore White writes: ‘Overall, the consumption of digital media is on the rise but it is the field of mobile where the growth is most striking. From 2010 to 2014, the time spent on digital platforms in the US increased by 157%. Within this, desktop consumption increased by 37% but smartphone increased by 394%’\nLike we said at the start of this report update, anyone standing still will be left behind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T17:27:30.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
