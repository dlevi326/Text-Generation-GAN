The new Office catches up to a rival package from Google in some respects.\nMicrosoft is nudging customers to buy the new Office 2016 as part of an online subscription service, known as Office 365, instead of a one-time purchase.\nIt's the first major Office update for Windows computers since 2013. In recent months, Microsoft has released a series of new Office apps for iPhones, iPads and Android devices, as well as Mac computers.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-22T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:42:30.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
