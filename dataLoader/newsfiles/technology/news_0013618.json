But, while addressing smaller audiences using @ symbol, they are more likely to use non-standard words such as nah, cuz and smh. It was also found when people write to someone from the same city , they are even more likely to use non-standard language. Jacob Eisenstein, who led the research, said, \"Since social media facilitates conversations between people all over the world, we were curious why we still see such a remarkable degree of geographical differentiation in online language.\" \"Our research shows that the most geographically differentiated language is more likely to be used in messages that will reach only a local audience, and therefore, will be less likely to spread to other locations,\" he said. His team sifted through three years of tweets a pool that included 114 million geotagged messages from 2.77 million users. For example, while the emoticon :) is used everywhere, the alternative ;o is significantly more popular in Los Angeles. Similarly , \"mayne\", a drawn out way of pronouncing \"man\", is likely to be found in Houston than anywhere else.
