[O/R]\nBudget carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle ( NWC.OL ) stands to benefit. Many European airlines were 70-90 percent hedged going into 2015, but Norwegian was largely unhedged.\n\"Typically we have not done much hedging,\" Norwegian Air's chief financial officer, Frode Foss, told Reuters. \"But in the last month we have started accumulating, relatively speaking, a lot of hedging to lock in fuel at very favorable levels.\"\nThe airline has hedged 23 percent of its fuel needs for the rest of this year, and 28 percent for 2016, with the potential to increase and extend hedges out to 2017, Foss said.\n\"You might see us at 50 percent or more, depending on the forward curve,\" Foss said.\nNorwegian has one of the lowest hedge coverings of the major European airlines, and can buy around three quarters of its fuel for this year and next on the spot market; good news if prices fall further.\nBut airlines that entered the current price decline heavily hedged cannot benefit in the same way.\nWith 93 percent of its 2015 fuel needs hedged, according to an analyst note from HSBC, Air Berlin ( AB1.DE ), Germany's second-largest airline, has been stung by falling prices.\n\"Our hedges come from a time when fuel was at $900 a tonne. Now it's at $500-$600. So it's a negative impact,\" the carrier's finance chief, Arnd Schwierholz, said in August.\nLarge hedges at prices significantly higher than the spot market can make airfares less competitive by forcing carriers to pass on the extra cost to passengers.\nIn March, British low-cost airline Flybe ( FLYB.L ) had 70 percent of the next 12 months' fuel hedged at $919 per tonne.\nSeptember's European jet fuel spot price has so far been around $500 per tonne.\n\"Some airlines that cannot afford to be as well hedged as Flybe have been reducing their prices,\" Flybe said in its results for the year to March.\nQUEST FOR CERTAINTY\nRyanair ( RYA.I ) has the largest publicly declared hedging percentage among European airlines. It is 90 percent hedged for the year to March 2016 at $910 per tonne, and 70 percent hedged at $657 per tonne for the next year.\nRyanair's chief executive said that while low prices are beneficial, price certainty is as important a reason to hedge.\n\"We don't need to be the best in the world at buying fuel, we don't need to be the one that gets the lowest price at the bottom of the cycle. We just want certainty for the next 12 months,\" Michael O’Leary said at a travel conference in Germany.\nTo achieve this, most major European airlines hedge regularly throughout the year.\nLarge airlines do not significantly add hedges on falling or rising prices and hedging managers commonly have little leeway to increase hedges, Commerzbank analyst Johannes Braun said.\nNevertheless, third-quarter results for this year are expected to show carriers hedging larger amounts of fuel and further out into the future than usual, industry sources say.\nHedging strategy is also in flux.\n\"The tendency is to go more into an options-based hedging program when there is market uncertainty and huge volatility,\" said Hans Erik Christensen, managing director at fuel risk company Global Risk Management.\nOptions contracts give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell fuel in the future at a certain price.\nUnlike simple forward purchases or swaps, options have a charge attached and most airlines - with the exception of Lufthansa, which has preferred options for many years - see them as a disadvantage.\n\"However, when the oil price is falling, options are an advantage. It is cheaper to hedge forwards and get protection if prices go up, but if you pay a premium for options you also retain the potential to benefit from lower oil prices more immediately,\" Commerzbank's Braun said.\n(Additional reporting by Victoria Bryan in Germany; Editing by Christopher Johnson and Dale Hudson )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T09:23:26.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
