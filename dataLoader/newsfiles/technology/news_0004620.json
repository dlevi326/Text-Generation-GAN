U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Andrea Medeiros says a cause of death has not been determined for the animals found near Cape Lisburne. Twelve of the dead animals were young pups, and some were missing their heads and tusks. The carcasses were photographed by a person who works at an Air Force radar station at the cape, a barren, isolated spot about 230 miles northeast of the Bering Strait. The report came in Wednesday but inclement weather kept agency personnel from reaching the site until Thursday. Medeiros says investigators do not reach conclusions regarding animals deaths based only on reports from the public. She says the walrus could have died in the Chukchi (chuk-CHEE') Sea and washed up on shore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:40:48.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
