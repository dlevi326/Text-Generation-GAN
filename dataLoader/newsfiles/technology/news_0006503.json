Apple wants to make the already-important TV screen into an essential hub for communication and entertainment, he said. \n“TV plays a huge role in our lives and it occupies an important place in our homes,” Cook said during his presentation. He added that Apple believes “the future of television is apps” that deliver streaming video, games and other services. \nFor now, however, the iPhone still is Apple’s most-important product. Sales of the iconic smartphone contributed more than two-thirds of the Cupertino, Calif., company’s $107 billion in revenue during the first half of 2015. \nApple announced Wednesday that it will sell two new iPhone models, dubbed the 6s and 6s Plus, starting Sept. 25. They’re roughly the same size and will cost the same as the record-selling 6 and 6 Plus models introduced last year, which will now sell for $100 less. \nThe new iPhones will have more memory and faster processors, along with a new 12 mega-pixel camera. \nPerhaps the most noticeable upgrade, however, is the addition of “3D Touch,” a feature that uses added screen sensors to detect the difference between a light tap and extended finger pressure, triggering different menus and functions for apps made by Apple and outside developers. \n“No matter what you like to do with your phone, 3D Touch makes it better than ever,” boasted Apple Senior Vice President Craig Federighi.
