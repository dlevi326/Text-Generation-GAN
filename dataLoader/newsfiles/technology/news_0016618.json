Then he heads west, where he will meet with influential Indian Americans in the tech community and will call on business leaders whose companies want to invest in India.\nModi will pay a visit to Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. and Tesla Motors in Fremont, Calif. On Sunday morning he will take part in a question-and-answer session with Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook's Menlo Park, Calif., campus. He'll attend a \"Digital India Technology Dinner\" in San Jose on Saturday night that will be emceed by Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen. And he will address a sold-out stadium in San Jose during an event showcasing the innovations of Indian start-ups.\nUSA TODAY\nNarendra Modi to take part in Facebook town hall with Mark Zuckerberg\nModi sees technology as vital to bringing more economic growth to India. He has launched an ambitious set of \"Digital India\" initiatives to create more tech jobs, increase electronics manufacturing, expand Internet access to thousands of Indian villages and develop mobile apps to improve government services.\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google, is expected to meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Silicon Valley. (Photo: Manu Fernandez, Associated Press)\nSome of those efforts have raised concerns about digital privacy, a faint echo of the concerns that swirled around China's President Xi Jinping 's visit with U.S. tech leaders this week.\nModi is capitalizing on growing interest and investment by global investors in Indian start-ups. His visit also affords Facebook and Google the opportunity to press him on issues such as India's unreliable infrastructure, slow Internet speeds, bureaucratic red tape and confusing tax laws, all of which have slowed investment. Both tech giants are blocked in China, making access to India, the world's second most populous country with 1.3 billion people, vital to their global expansion plans.\nMark Zuckerberg is holding a town hall with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday.

Warren-Pool, Getty Images)\n\"This trip is very historic and very timely,\" says Aarthi Ramamurthy, founder and chief executive of Lumoid, a San Francisco company that runs a try-before-you-buy service for consumer electronics. \"This is the right time for the prime minister to come here and seek investment. He is prioritizing and focusing on tech and how both India and the U.S. can mutually benefit each other.\"\nModi, who took office 16 months ago on a pro-business platform, has many friends among U.S. tech companies, where Indian Americans such as Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Google's Sundar Pichai have scaled to the top of the tech world.\n\"I think he wants to strengthen relationships with Silicon Valley and bring tech to India,\" says Shruti Gandhi, managing partner at Array Ventures. \"He knows that tech is a good sector for growth.\"\nIndia is expected to become the world's fastest growing economy by 2017, according to the World Bank. The digital economy is expected to be a big part of that growth. India has more than 350 million Internet users and that number is expected to grow swiftly as more people use mobile devices to go online.\n\"There is a lot that is going to happen in the next one to two to three to four years. We are going to see more and more startups start in India that cater first to the Indian market and then expand internationally,\" Ramamurthy says.\nWith his participation in a town hall-style session at Facebook with Zuckerberg that will be aired on prime time television in India, Modi will only increase his profile and popularity on social media. He has 30 million likes on his Facebook page and more than 15 million followers on Twitter.\nUSA TODAY\nChina should be a Silicon Valley obsession\n\"We will discuss some global issues and issues relating to India, particularly on the economy and society,\" Modi said in a Facebook post about the question-and-answer session that will be streamed live on the Web.\nZuckerberg said the pair will \"discuss how communities can work together to address social and economic challenges.\"\nModi’s trip to Silicon Valley isn't popular with everyone. His Silicon Valley stops are expected to be dogged by protests from groups that want to draw attention to their concerns about his politics.\nMore than 100 academics from major American universities sent an open letter to technology executives warning them not to support his \"Digital India\" initiatives, saying the initiatives lack privacy protections and could harm the rights of Indians. They also accused Modi's government of cracking down on advocacy groups and harassing scholars and critics.\nOthers critics want to highlight allegations Modi did not stop religious riots that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly minority Muslims, while he was running the Gujarat state in 2002.\n93 CONNECT 129 TWEET 27 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT //usat.ly/1KxRgYM TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1KxRgYM", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a9504bd23c6952d902dfb3cc189a32ea2456a151/r=500x334/local/-/media/2015/09/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787082041068583-Modi.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/abf7fc9e077790e137c6a86512b8396963a5a375/c=0-302-3264-2146&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/09/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635778217190767095-GTY-484536690.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d5385c84663c017778ff90a0e8bab308128467c0/c=56-0-968-686&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787082041068583-Modi.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KxRgYM&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787082041068583-Modi.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7847a73f0d4a9c3e638e688a61ce8900780ca9ad/c=76-0-948-656&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787088308408758-Pichai.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5b08b58f55fc7d7673938c8f905d5cfa04de83cb/c=13-0-1011-750&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787086647154109-zuckerberg.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2bf83cec21c934f365f02a24c2eb3b475a1bc96d/c=0-157-717-562&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635778283099043029-Modi.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KxRgYM&text=Indian%20Prime%20Minister%20Modi%20on%20Silicon%20Valley%20swing%20to%20deepen%20ties&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-09-25T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T07:15:29.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
