The supporting laws need to be strengthened, parents need to be educated to monitor children's activities in cyber space and educate children about good cyberbehaviour,\" the committee has said in its report. \n\nA Rs 400 crore cybercrime control hub, to be called 'Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre' (IC4), will be set up to check all cybercrime, including child pornography and online abuse, as per the recommendations of the committee. \n\n\"Home Minister Rajnath Singh has already directed speedy implementation of recommendations of the committee,\" an official said. \n\nThe government has taken seriously the issue of pornography and asked Internet Service Providers to block over 800 sites which had child porn content. \n\nThe Supreme Court too had pulled up the government for not doing much to check child pornography. \n\nThere has been almost 40% annual increase in cybercrimes registered in the country during the past two-three years, according to an official estimate. \n\nThe expert committee found that India lacks centralized online reporting mechanism, inadequate infrastructure for cybercrime monitoring and investigation, besides skilled cyber professionals. \n\nOther drawbacks include challenges related to technology and research and development, lack of citizen awareness, legal and jurisdictional issues and lack of Standard Operating Procedure for cyber crime investigation. \n\nThe IC4 will have linkages with CCTNS and NATGRID, the two databases having information related to various kinds of crime and criminals.
