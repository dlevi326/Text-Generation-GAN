They took a 5-0 lead in the first inning — before many of the Yankee faithful had even filtered into their seats — and continued to pound their way from there.\nRussell Martin, who had been mired in a miserable slump since the beginning of August, slammed two homers at his old stomping grounds, while Josh Donaldson, Justin Smoak and Edwin Encarnacion each added two-run shots of their own.\nWith the win the Jays extend their lead to 2 1/2 games over the Yankees, who in addition to facing an upward battle in the American League East are now also dealing with season-ending injuries to Mark Teixeira and Nathan Eovaldi, arguably their top hitter and starting pitcher, respectively.\nWhether or not the Jays sensed any vulnerability in their opposition on Friday, they were certainly poised to pounce early and often.\nBlue Jays fan reactions So the Blue Jays are on nationally on FOX tomorrow afternoon.

Three hits and three runs later and the rout was on. Severino — who has been something of a saviour to the Yankees’ rotation in the second half — was chased after just 2 1/3 innings, the shortest outing of his young career.\nThe only blip for the Jays on Friday came when manager John Gibbons curiously lifted Price after five innings. Price had thrown 96 pitches and the Jays held a comfortable, seven-run lead at the time, but with a doubleheader tomorrow it seemed strange not to try to get at least another inning out of his durable ace. With Price gone, the Yankees took immediate advantage, tagging reliever LaTroy Hawkins — who hadn’t pitched since Sunday — on a three-run homer by shortstop Didi Gregorius.\nBut a half-inning later Martin hit his second homer in as many at-bats to pull the Jays away again.\nThe added bonus of Friday’s pounding for the Jays is how it depleted the Yankees’ bullpen the night before a doubleheader. “That’s probably both teams’ biggest concern,” Jays manager John Gibbons said of protecting the bullpen for tomorrow’s back-to-back games.\nJoe Girardi didn’t have to use up any of high-leverage arms — notably bullpen anchors Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller — but he did expend five different pitchers after Severino was chased in the third.\nBefore the game Gibbons was queried about whether he was approaching this series any differently than any other, given its obvious import. While he recognized the significance of these games, he didn’t think it would lead him to manage any differently. He certainly wasn’t going to give any motivational speeches to his charges. “I haven’t said a word to them. I don’t think there’s a need for it,” he said. In fact, Gibbons said, he hasn’t addressed them all season. To start now would be strange.\n“I have zero concerns how they’re going to respond,” he said. “It doesn’t mean they’re going to play good every night, but they’re going to be ready to play, you know?”\nGibbons says he’s “never been a big talker,” but with this group he has found it even less necessary.\n“There’s something different about this group. Where that takes us, who knows yet? But there’s definitely something different out there. It’s a very focused group.”\nPrevious teams Gibbons has managed in Toronto haven’t been “near as focused,” he said. The change started with the off-season additions of Donaldson and Martin, while the deadline acquisitions of Troy Tulowitzki and David Price merely added to the established culture.\nPrice did recently make a bold impact, purchasing for his teammates a set of plush, royal blue bathrobes inscribed with Jays’ insignia and each of their last names and numbers, uniform-style. The new threads give the team a kingly — if a little cartoonish — swagger, even inside a visiting clubhouse. After Friday’s onslaught it was a fitting look.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays make opening statement in Bronx: DiManno\nAdonis (Superman) Stevenson knocks out Kryptonite in third round", "external_links": ["http://t.co/qyap1ABUdj", "https://twitter.com/KPILLAR4", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/cheaperthantheelection?src=hash", "https://instagram.com/p/7g2r_eMoKd/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlueJays?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/JPBoutros/status/642522805800706048", "https://twitter.com/PatMyBuck/status/642493652602892288", "https://twitter.com/JoeyBats19", "https://twitter.com/Lang_2727/status/642519040053903360", "https://twitter.com/haleyswayne/status/642519034148323328", "http://t.co/2KieUE4eaD", "https://twitter.com/Joecartersmom/status/642518971086950400", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ComeTogether?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoJaysGo?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/CherylFull/status/642522736724701184", "http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "https://twitter.com/BringerOfRain20", "https://twitter.com/BlueJays", "https://twitter.com/BlueJayHunter/status/642519198858522624", "http://t.co/PVIdWmG0lJ", "https://t.co/3RzjrtM1ez", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BuckMartinezSays?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/lovethisteam?src=hash"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T06:36:01.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
