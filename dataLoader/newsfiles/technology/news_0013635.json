Introduction & Scope INTRODUCTION A \"smart city\" is an innovative city that uses information and communications technologies (ICTs) and other means to improve the quality of life, the efficiency of urban operations and services, and competitiveness, and ensure that it meets the needs of present and future generations with respect to economic, social and environmental aspects. Despite the enormous potential embedded in the goals of a smart city, it is important to acknowledge the challenges associated with global urbanization, urban migration trends, environmental degradation, climate change, and aging populations and infrastructures, as well as constraints in the resources and structures needed to respond to these challenges. Within these increasingly complex urban systems, ICTs can act as a platform to help overcome these challenges and take advantage of emerging opportunities as cities advance toward becoming smarter and more sustainable places to live.Going beyond the environmental benefits, the improvement of systems through ICT can contribute to social equality through universal access to a city's public services. Such improvements save lives by allowing for more immediate access to emergency services. They make cities more resilient in times of crisis, allow them to prepare for natural and other disasters, and help to restore services after disruption in the wake of such disasters. They create new economic zones that drive growth and prosperity.Such improvements are not exclusive to modern and wealthy communities. Via realistic, measurable timetables and financial vehicles, almost any city can achieve a more intelligent infrastructure. By honing in on solutions that focus on their most acute \"pain\" points and taking a step-by-step, system-based approach, cities can implement strategies that deliver the immediate, visible, and measurable results they need and that their constituents deserve. City leaders worldwide have embraced innovative technology to help meet — and even exceed — citizen and business expectations while realizing the tangible benefits of being smarter. However, becoming a smart city is a journey, and cities continue to face complicated challenges. Many regions lack the resources to keep pace with rapid population growth while delivering services that citizens and businesses demand. Cities and other urban organizations also must house and manage ever-increasing amounts and types of data, as wellas contend with aging infrastructures, resource scarcity and increased security threats. At the same time, they face an evolving constituency, as advances in social and mobile technology further empower citizens all over the world. Cities that take this approach are commonly referred to as \"smart cities,\" a concept highly discussed and often debated in urban planning and city policy circles worldwide.In the last few years, interest in smart cities has triggered plenty of theoretical and technology-led discussions, but not enough market progress has been made in implementing these initiatives in cities around the world. There are a number of factors hindering adoption of smart city solutions: scaling of newer technologies is unproven; technology challenges the status quo in how cities are run; and technology is not well understood across several city sectors. However, the main barrier to adopting such solutions is the complexity in how cities are operated, financed, regulated and planned. This report will show in considerable detail how the smart city market is arranged, what the major players are planning for the next years and how the process of implementing smart city solutions is achieved through the private sector with interaction with the public sector. PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT Despite the wide range of public and private company reports, academic literature and market research data that exists on the global topic of smart cities, there is a lack of market players' definitions on the specific parameters that characterize a smart city. Therefore, a comprehensive view of separated markets is crucial to foster research and investment in this field. Considering this, this report will try to answer the following questions:- How do information and communication technologies (ICTs) and different segments vary across the different smart city sectors?- What are the different types of smart city networks?- Which smart city network sectors will take a leading position in the marketplace?- Infrastructure or services? Which sector will provide better opportunities for the smart city market?- Which smart city sectors should ICT solution providers focus on?This report seeks to provide an overview of the main attributes that make cities smart and to explore the role and potential of the key ICT infrastructure needed to enable smart city strategies, both from the point of view of regional/local authorities and investors in the identified market sectors. Market sizes and revenue forecasts across different geographies as well as industry and sector arenas will be analyzed. REPORT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES This report aims to shed light on the often elusive definition of a \"smart city.\" The report will focus on the identification and implementation of ICT in urban spaces to collect and manage relevant data for urban planners, public authorities and citizens in order to improve human living in urban spaces. SCOPE OF REPORT Creating more sustainable, resilient, and livable cities is of vital importance to nations around the world. In particular, the rapid urbanization of Asia and South America is driving strong growth in the market for smart city technologies that can connect and modernize power grids, water treatment and transfer systems, transportation management systems, and energy-efficient buildings. This report examines the evolution of the global smart city market, detailing the impacts on key technology markets, including energy management; water management; transport management; waste management; assisted living; and e-government, security and education systems. It compares different approaches to the smart city and provides comprehensive profiles of noteworthy smart city projects in each major world region.The report's purpose is not to provide an exhaustive technical assessment of smart city technologies. Rather, it aims to offer a strategic examination of the market with a focus on key economic, business, and social drivers, technology issues, regulatory factors, and the competitive landscape. The market data reported here will provide a better understanding of the real dimension of the entire ICT market for smart cities.The report will define and provide in-depth analysis and forecasting of potential revenues for the various smart city sub-segments of technologies, solutions, services and regions. In addition to market drivers, it also identifies restraints on the market with insights into trends, opportunities and challenges in North and South America , Europe , Asia-Pacific and other regions. INTENDED AUDIENCE The report intends to be a reference in several economic activity sectors and for market professionals who are interested in the smart cities market, such as:- Hardware and software providers.- IT, networking, and telecommunications providers and vendors.- Building equipment and appliance providers.- IT system integrators.- Government agencies and investor communities.- City and local councils. INFORMATION SOURCES This report is the result of primary and secondary research conducted by BCC Research. Governmental and non-governmental entities or companies have provided input through interviews, comments and correspondence, and published reports for the development of the current report. As the smart city market is being defined and pilot test beds are becoming more successful, the number of companies that can provide holistic solutions, or just a specific part of one technology, is increasing every year. This has to do not only with the public interest of central governments and local authorities but also the usability of the common citizen to improve his or her quality of life in major urban centers.
