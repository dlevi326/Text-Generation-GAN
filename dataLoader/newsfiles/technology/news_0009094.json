The SunLase patch changes to black as it reacts to CO 2 or fiber lasers. The result is a clear, crisp bar code, logo or text on the package. \n“Whether marking cases and cartons for supply chain management, track and trace requirements or late-stage pack differentiation, brand owners are demanding the flexibility and variable data that lasers can provide,” said Peter Lindstrom, North American Product Manager for Videojet. “With SunLase technology, our lasers produce an enhanced mark quality for excellent readability throughout the supply chain.” \nAt Pack Expo, Videojet will showcase the SunLase solution with the Videojet 3330 laser marking system . This high performance CO 2 laser delivers a powerful combination of performance and flexibility for high resolution marking on cases and cartons running at moderate to high speeds. Its 21 mark field and focal distance combinations help produce complex, permanent codes. \n“Both long and short-run operations can enjoy the flexibility to add information like ingredients, logos, bar codes and other tracking information to packaging late in production,” Lindstrom said. “As a solvent and ink-free solution, laser marking offers additional advantages including low odor and low consumables. We are proud to partner with Sun Chemical to provide our customers with the operational and functional benefits of SunLase technology and Videojet laser marking systems.” \nFor more information please visit the Videojet booth #C-1841 and Sun Chemical’s booth #S-7476 during PACK EXPO, or visit www.videojet.com or www.sunchemical.com/product/sunlase . \nAbout Sun Chemical \nSun Chemical, a member of the DIC group, is the world's largest producer of printing inks and pigments and a leading provider of materials to packaging, publication, coatings, plastics, cosmetics, and other industrial markets.
