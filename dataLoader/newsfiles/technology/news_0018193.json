Jessica Hromas by Tim Dodd Students have used multiple online identities to cheat in massive open online courses (MOOCs), according to researchers at MIT and Harvard.\nThe cheaters enrol in a course multiple times (which is free), using some of their accounts to randomly answer the commonly-used multiple choice assessment questions. When they have eliminated the wrong answers, they use their \"real\" identity to complete the test correctly.\nThis CAMEO strategy (Copying Answers using Multiple Existences Online) \"presents a serious threat to the trustworthiness of MOOC certification\", the researchers say in a paper, Detecting and Preventing 'Multiple-Account' Cheating in Massive Open Online Courses .\nThey estimate that 1.3 per cent of certificates earned from 115 MOOCs offered by Harvard and MIT appear to have been obtained using the CAMEO strategy.\nAmong students who had earned 20 or more certificates, one-quarter appeared to have used this cheating strategy. Cheaters were more likely to be young, less-educated males, residing outside of the US where MOOC completion certificates (which are not certified qualifications) have more perceived value.\nCheating was found to be more prevalent in government, health and social science courses, and lowest in computer science courses.\nThe researchers say that cheating can be reduced by randomising multiple choice questions and not revealing answers until after assignments are due.\n ", "external_links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05699", "http://news.mit.edu/2015/cheating-moocs-0824"], "published": "2015-09-03T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:22:10.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
