SonGear ( www.songear.com ), online Christian retail site, announces the launch of SonGear Marketplace. The SonGear Marketplace is a first to market faith-based online ecommerce platform that allows small, medium and large producers of Christian lifestyle products to partner with SonGear.com and find a presence on the web in the SonGear.com store. Founded six years ago, SonGear has grown to be a premiere destination for those seeking Christian lifestyle products online. The SonGear Marketplace now provides a more diverse group of products to its dedicated customer base, deepening those relationships and cultivating new customer relationships. We feel confident at SonGear that, via the SonGear Marketplace, even the smallest of faith-based manufacturers will have the opportunity to reach Christians who wish to purchase a variety of products that align with their values and traditions.\n\"The biggest problem we all face is the incredible clutter of shopping sites – both Christian and secular – online,\" says SonGear.com founder and CEO, Bob Van Zandt . \"I am extremely excited to launch this endeavor and to facilitate large and small companies coming together to leverage the SonGear brand and together gain a greater share of the faith-based consumer market.\" The challenge of helping the customer navigate the \"clutter\" is what the SonGear Marketplace is all about – SonGear is now a one-stop shop for anything from religious art and housewares to Christian jewelry and clothing. The SonGear Marketplace takes our very strong brand and makes it even stronger and more diverse.\nOn the vendor side, the SonGear Marketplace partnership offers vendors an opportunity to promote their brands on the SonGear.com world class ecommerce sales platform – without the initial and upfront costs normally associated with getting a product online. The investments in technology, marketing and time are often the reasons vendors will struggle to get their products in front of the right consumer – this is no longer an obstacle when participating as a partner with SonGear Marketplace.\n\"SonGear is about giving back to those in need,\" added Van Zandt . \"We take our responsibility as a leader in this sector seriously and believe our customers trust the SonGear brand because of our values and dedication to helping others. With the addition of the SonGear Marketplace they will have access to a wider range of products to buy or give as gifts while knowing their purchases give back and help others around the world.\"\nMarketplace Partner Access\nFor those vendors signing up (and approved) to be a SonGear Marketplace partner by September 30, 2015 , SonGear.com is offering free access to upload products and participate in our program through February 28, 2016 .\nRequest SonGear Marketplace access at http://www.songear.com/marketplace\nAbout SonGear\nIn 2009, Bob Van Zandt wanted to take his knowledge from 15 years of technology leadership in the secular business world and apply his deep IT and business experience towards advancing God's kingdom. After considerable prayer and reflection, he created SonGear , a socially marketed online store featuring custom Christian clothing, jewelry, and gifts that gives a portion of its proceeds back to human rights and ministry projects around the world.\nSix years later, SonGear realized its online platform could help other Christian producers and launched SonGear Marketplace. With every item purchased, SonGear is able to help a person in need through our financial support of Christian charities worldwide .\nMedia Contact\nDawn Perry\nVP, Communications\nSonGear.com\n630-806-8751\ndawn@songear.com\nVideo - http://youtu.be/QzNGvEAHDhk\nSOURCE SonGear\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.songear.com", "external_links": ["http://www.songear.com/marketplace?utm_source=PRN&utm_medium=Release&utm_term=MP3&utm_campaign=MPLaunch", "http://youtu.be/QzNGvEAHDhk", "http://www.songear.com/songear-giving?utm_source=PRN&utm_medium=Release&utm_term=MP4&utm_campaign=MPLaunch", "http://facebook.com/songear", "http://www.songear.com/?utm_source=PRN&utm_medium=Release&utm_term=MP1&utm_campaign=MPLaunch", "http://www.songear.com/?utm_source=PRN&utm_medium=Release&utm_term=MP5&utm_campaign=MPLaunch", "http://www.songear.com/marketplace?utm_source=PRN&utm_medium=Release&utm_term=MP2&utm_campaign=MPLaunch", "http://www.songear.com/marketplace"], "published": "2015-09-01T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T14:34:36.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
