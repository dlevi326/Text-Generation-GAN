It was a mockery. It was widely accepted that a reference to the platform was a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment that it was a festering pit for right wing, racist, narrow-minded bigots.\"\nAnd I agree, this is indeed the case and I agree with Andrew Trench's position to want to become better and the need to provide quality content rather than being known for being a platform for bigots and trolls to reign free.\nIt is true, I cannot deny the fact that the MyNews24 platform has become a platform for racists, homophobes, anti-securists and anti-theists to throw spew vile unadulterated hatred against those that differ from them.\nI agree that the decision to take more control over what is presented for public consumption is not a freedom of speech issue as trolls and bigots still have the freedom to say hateful things elsewhere on social media, the platform doesn't have to be a pulpit to preach hate.\nRegular contributor Fox writes: \"In South Africa we need to be encouraging open and constructive discussion between all racial groups towards our mutually-inclusive future...\"\nIntellectually, I agree, it's the only logical decision to take as effective moderation control is almost impossible, it's an ethically sound decision and one that should have been taken a long time ago.\nBut emotionally, it doesn't feel right, although my head tells me it is right, my heart is telling me that something is being taken away from me, and I fear losing the ability to engage with people on the issues I care about, so this makes me resistant to change, atheist contributor Colleen's article on the comments issue speaks to a lot of how I feel.\nThe comment section was a good place to debate with people and build friendships and change perspectives, but as noted - the problem with bigotry and trolling is very real, but not only that, the comment section has another flaw: It encourages reactionary and emotive responses and enables people to say things without thinking things through, which is the key difference between making quick comments and writing a thought out article.\nSo if you will still have me, if I can still offer my contribution in article form, I won't go anywhere, I still want to be, or try to be a positive voice for free thought, I still want to change people's minds in how they perceive non-religious people and the LGBT and I still want to speak out against discrimination of all kinds.\nI can recognize the fact the comment section has been counterproductive in many ways and instead of changing people's perceptions, it often just entrenched people in the prejudices they already hold.\nLeonard Nimoy who played Spock in hit classic Star Trek movie, The Wrath of Khan, famously said: \"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T14:05:26.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
