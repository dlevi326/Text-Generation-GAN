With the initial FTTN rollout launched in Belmont, New South Wales, FTTN is aiming to have 500,000 FTTN premises ready for service (RFS) by mid-2016 and 3.7 million by mid-2018.\nThe state of the copper network has been a significant bone of contention in the overall NBN debate, with NBN Co’s critics highlighting that the degraded state of the copper lines will lead to onerous cost blowouts. However, Mr Cross said that so far the FTTN pilots have not uncovered any nasty surprises.\n“We are pretty happy with what we have discovered in the trials so far but to be honest they haven’t been running long enough for us to get any long term insight into any maintenance,” he said.\nThe FTTN trials have so far delivering download speeds of 100Mbps and upload speeds of 40Mbps for residents who live within 400m of a node and an average speed of 50/20 for premises that are 700m from the node.\nAccording to internal NBN data, about 90 per cent of the nation’s premises lie within 700m of a node, as for the 10 per cent of premises that are beyond the 700m range, Mr Cross said they will receive a 25/5 service.\nOne noticeable feature unearthed during the Belmont trials is that premises with faulty or subpar internal wiring end up receiving slower than expected broadband speeds. It’s unclear just how damaging the issue in-home wiring might be for the overall FTTN NBN build, but Mr Cross said that it’s an issue that will ultimately be dealt by the retail service providers (RSPs).\n“In majority of cases the internal wiring is not an issue but if the end user wants to have that looked at then that’s completely up to them and it’s up to the RSPs to see how they can turn it into a product construct that’s part of a service offering or is a chargeable amount,” he said.\n“It’s entirely up to them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:54:22.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
