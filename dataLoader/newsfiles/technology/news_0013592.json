Taps will be fitted on the pipeline to provide access to larger customers. Compressor stations along Atlantic Coast pipeline Rover Pipeline Project, US \nThe Rover Pipeline Project is a proposed interstate natural gas pipeline system that will transport natural gas to US and Canada from processing facilities located in the Marcellus and Utica shale areas. \nCompressor station one, to be built in Lewis County, West Virginia, will supply natural gas from the proposed Kincheloe metering and regulating station to the mainline AP-1. \nComprising four gas driven turbines, the station will give a combined 55,015 horsepower (hp) of compression. \nCompressor station two will be constructed in Buckingham County, Virginia, at the intersection of mainline AP-1 with Transco transmission pipelines. \nThe station will be bi-directional and will receive natural gas from both mainline AP-1 and existing Transco pipelines. It will also be able to discharge natural gas downstream into the mainline AP-1 and Transco pipelines. With four gas driven turbines, the station will provide 40,715hp of compression. \nCompressor station three to be built in Northampton County, North Carolina, will be located at the intersection of the two mainlines and the lateral line one. It will supply natural gas from mainline AP-1 to mainline AP-2 and lateral AP-3. Consisting of three gas-driven compressors, the station will provide 21,815hp of compression. Feed gas supply to the interstate natural gas pipeline \nThe proposed pipeline will receive natural gas from two new interconnections. One of them will be the Marts Junction Interconnection that will be established in Harrison County, West Virginia, between the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Dominion transmission facilities. \nThe second interconnection will be the Buckingham Interconnect that will be located in Buckingham County, Virginia, between the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and existing Transco facilities. Sale of gas from the Atlantic Coast Pipeline \nSubsidiaries and affiliates of the four partners in the JV will be customers of the pipeline, while PSNC Energy has also signed a 20-year contract to off-take the gas. Contractors involved \nDura-Bond was selected through a bidding process to provide steel pipes for the project in an agreement worth more than $400m. Pipes will be manufactured at Dura-Bond's Steelton mill in late 2015. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a proposed project that involves the construction of an approximately 564.1 mile (907.8km) long, interstate natural gas transmission pipeline. The estimated investment on the project is between $4.5bn and $5bn. The proposed pipeline will traverse West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina.
