It also comes installed on the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and forthcoming Google Pixel C tablet.\nStay tuned for details on when Android 6.0 will arrive on other, non-Google branded phones, as manufacturers will announce those details separately. If you have a flagship phone from 2015, like the Samsung Galaxy S6 or LG G4, there's a good chance you'll get the update.\nFor more about today's Nexus events, check out CNET's coverage .", "external_links": ["http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/29/6235adc8-57fc-4901-a344-67938c6f7390/resize/570xauto/f1b27b198edd86c4d5383db7a51e1a44/google-092915-nexus-5x-nexus5x-5886.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-29T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:58:38.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
