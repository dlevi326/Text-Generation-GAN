With the new funding, Infoworks has expanded its management team to prepare for the next stage of growth. \nIn a separate announcement at the 2015 Strata conference, Infoworks also announced availability of a complete solution for data warehouse augmentation, which is built on the company’s dynamic data warehousing (DDW) platform. \n“Existing methodologies and systems for data management are proving to be too slow, inflexible, and expensive to meet the emerging needs of data-driven enterprises,” said Amar Arsikere, CEO and co-founder of Infoworks. “Just as Google crawls the web and organizes information for search, the Infoworks DDW platform automatically crawls enterprise databases, ingests the data into Hadoop, and organizes it into high performance data warehouses and other data models that support all enterprise use cases, including cubes,” Arsikere continued. \nArsikere was previously responsible for designing and building a data warehousing platform on Bigtable at Google, and a petabyte scale in-memory data infrastructure at Zynga. Realizing that there is a broader need for a solution for enterprises to manage data warehousing on Hadoop, in 2014, Arsikere teamed up with Buno Pati, Chairman of Infoworks, and an experienced entrepreneur, CEO, and investor, in founding Infoworks. \n“The strong positive response of large enterprises to the technology developed by Infoworks was impressive - amongst the strongest I have seen in over twenty years of working with technology startups, and a clear indication of the market need,” stated Buno Pati, Chairman and co-founder of Infoworks. \nNaren Gupta, Managing Partner of Nexus Venture Partners, said, “Infoworks addresses a pressing industry need for building data warehouses and data models for rapidly changing big data. We were very impressed with the company’s vision, and are excited to be part of the team.” Mr. Gupta also joins the board of directors of Infoworks in conjunction with the financing. \n“Naren and his colleagues at Nexus Venture Partners bring a wealth of experience and knowledge in building enterprise software companies, and we welcome them as our partners in building Infoworks,” stated Arsikere. \nExpanded Team \nInfoworks also announced today that it has expanded its management team, bringing onboard decades of analytics and enterprise software experience. Recent additions to the management team include Ramesh Menon, head of product management, and Jitender Nankani, head of customer success. Menon most recently led product management at YarcData, which resulted in the world’s largest shared-memory analytics appliance, and previously directed market strategy for Informatica’s Master Data Management business unit. Nankani was most recently a principal at Saama and has delivered numerous big data solutions for Fortune 500 companies. \n“Over the past several years, I have been closely involved in numerous big data projects and have personally seen the challenges enterprises are facing. I was very impressed with the innovative approach, functionality and performance that Infoworks DDW platform provides. It is a perfect fit for a number of high priority use cases in the enterprise. I am excited to join an impressive team at Infoworks and bring this product to market,” said Menon. \n“Ramesh comes with a deep understanding of the big data and analytics market. He was instrumental in shaping product strategy and growing sizable businesses at YarcData and Informatica. I am thrilled to have him on board and looking forward to working with him to build a great product and a great company,” stated Arsikere. \nAbout Infoworks \nFounded in 2014, Infoworks has developed the first Dynamic Data Warehousing (DDW) platform on Hadoop.
