These are relevant subjects nationally and they are relevant subjects here,\" he saidJohnston said the definitions of telemedicine vary, but the one he finds most important is Medicare's definition, which is that telemedicine is a \"real-time interaction,\" like communicating via Facetime or Skype, rather than a technology application that stores data for future use.Memorial Hospital uses telemedicine in the ROSE (Rehabilitation of Special Elderly) Geriatric Behavioral Health Unit for patients to interact on a big screen TV with their psychiatrist, who moved to Montreal.MHS Chief Executive Officer Mark Miller admitted he and ROSE Unit Director Marcel Shoemaker were originally concerned about the concept of conducting geriatric psychiatric appointments via telemedicine, but \"Marcel is kind of wowed by it — he thinks it's working really well.\"Another new technological change at MHS involves texting between the hospital and physicians.\"Straight-up texting is not HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability) compliant,\" Miller said, referencing the legality of anonymity in regard to patient information. \"We've been working around it, trying to leave patients' names out of the texts and things along those lines, but they now have software that encrypts texts.\"The health system opted to purchase the text-encrypting software, which costs $70 per device per year. The nurses' stations and physicians' phones will all be equipped with the software, \"so they'll be able to text more detailed information and be sure we're talking about the same patient,\" Miller said.In other board matters: Miller received word from a dialysis company wanting to know if the hospital has a facility with a certain number of square footage available for a dialysis treatment area. Miller said the \"bottom line is good news — they didn't say no. If the pro-forma had said no, they wouldn't be asking me about square footage. There is a chance still that we will be able to move forward with a small dialysis center here, which is pretty cool.\"  The board accepted the credentialing of Arnold Graham, MD, from St. Francis in Topeka, for consulting in cardiology; and Debra Wolfe, APRN, for locum tenens work in the emergency department.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T00:13:35.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
