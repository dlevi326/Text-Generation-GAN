When applied to prosthetic hands the findings have a potential to help prosthesis users cope with psychosocial effects of losing a part of their body. \n\nThe study was published in IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering in May and highlighted in an article ‘The Truth about the Turing Test’ on BBC Future in July. \n\nThe team created an artificial hand by acquiring a detailed geometry of a human hand with computer tomography imaging replicating its skeleton with 3D printing technologies and substituting the skin tissue with a silicone material with lifelike softness. Beneath the soft skin are heaters that create perceptually acceptable warmth on the artificial skin’s surface. \n\nDr Cabibihan said: “The cutting-edge research opens possibilities for prosthetic and robotic hands that are lifelike and more socially acceptable. It is one of the examples of the level of innovative research being conducted at the college and its collaborative efforts with researchers from around the world in line with the college’s plan and institutional research road map.” \n\nDr Rashid Alammari Dean of the college said: “This is one of the research that highlights the core role of the college in advancing technology for the greater good of society. It is the result of QU’s vision in general and the college in particular to address critical issues facing the community and seek sustainable solutions.” \nTHE PENINSULA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T05:19:35.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
