All times local (CET): \n___ \n2:00 p.m. \nFormer Czech President Vaclav Klaus, a renowned Euro-skeptic, has launched an \"Against Immigration\" petition which calls \"mass immigration a fundamental threat for the stability of Europe and individual EU member states.\" \nIn the text, Klaus called on the Czech government to use all possible means, including police and armed forces, to protect the country's border and to reject any plans by the European Union to establish a quota system for accepting migrants in the 28-member bloc. \nHe said it was \"unacceptable\" for Germany and France to put pressure on other EU member states on the issue. \nMeanwhile, the Czech Republic's most famous female athlete, seven-time Olympic gymnastics champion Vera Caslavska, published an appeal to the public asking the Czechs to help migrants and refugees. Caslavska said it would be Europeans, not the migrants, who lose human dignity if they refuse to help. \n___ \n1:00 p.m. \nThe U.N. refugee agency has praised Austria and Germany for deciding to take in thousands of migrants who crossed the border from Hungary. \nThe agency said in a statement Saturday that \"this is political leadership based on humanitarian values.\" \nThe Geneva-based body also lauded civil society groups and ordinary citizens in Austria and Germany for helping provide a welcome to people in need. \nThe agency said that \"a remarkable outpouring of public response\" is driving some governments to change their stance on accepting migrants. \nBut it said \"the concentration of refugees and migrants in a small number of countries willing to receive them is not a sustainable solution.\" \n___ \n12:30 p.m. \nGerman police have searched the home of a 26-year-old Berlin man alleged to have celebrated the drowning of a Syrian boy in a Facebook posting. \nA spokeswoman for Berlin police says officers seized a computer and two cellphones during the raid early Saturday. \nValeska Jakubowski told The Associated Press that the man, whose name was not disclosed, was being investigated for \"defaming the memory of the deceased and incitement to hatred.\" If convicted he could face up to three years in prison. \nPolice say the man wrote \"we are not mourning but celebrating it\" above a picture of the body of Aylan Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned earlier this week off the coast of Turkey. \nGerman authorities are cracking down on far-right extremists using social media to stir up hatred of migrants \n___ \n11:20 a.m. \nThe first train carrying 167 migrants from Austria to Germany has arrived in Munich. \nPolice say the train arrived in the Bavarian capital at 10:25 a.m. (0825 GMT). The migrants were among a larger group who had traveled by bus from Hungary to Austria. \nFederal police spokesman Simon Hegewald told The Associated Press that a specially chartered train from Salzburg, Austria, with several hundred migrants on board was expected in Munich around noon. \n___ \n11:15 a.m. \nFinnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila says he is ready to open his house for refugees, and they can move in on Jan. 1, 2016. \nSipila told Finnish broadcaster YLE Saturday morning that his family has a house in central Finland that they no longer use since moving to Helsinki. \nDetails of how to apply and how many people the house could accommodate weren't immediately available. \nLast month, Finland's interior ministry said it expects that up to 15,000 people would apply for asylum in the country - 10,000 higher than previous estimates. \nThe leader of the Center Party, Sipila has been heading a center-right government since May. \n___ \n9:00 a.m. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel says there is no legal limit to the number of asylum seekers her country can receive. \nMerkel told the Funke consortium of newspapers in an interview published Saturday that \"the right to political asylum has no limits on the number of asylum seekers.\" \nShe says that \"as a strong, economically healthy country we have the strength to do what is necessary\" and ensure every asylum seeker gets a fair hearing. \nBut Merkel repeated her government's position that those migrants who stand no realistic chance of getting permission to stay need to be returned to their home country. \nGermany has seen tens of thousands of migrants arriving each month, many of them refugees fleeing war and persecution in Syria, Eritrea and elsewhere. \n___ \n7 a.m. \nMore than 1,000 people from the Middle East and Asia, exhausted after breaking away from police and marching for hours toward Western Europe, have arrived before dawn Saturday on the border with Austria. \nThe breakthrough became possible when Austria announced that it and Germany would take the migrants on humanitarian grounds and to aid their EU neighbor. \nIn jubilant scenes on the border, hundreds of migrants bearing blankets over their shoulders to provide cover from heavy rains walked off from buses and into Austria, where volunteers at a roadside Red Cross shelter offered them hot tea and handshakes of welcome. \nMany collapsed in exhaustion on the floor, smiles on their faces.
