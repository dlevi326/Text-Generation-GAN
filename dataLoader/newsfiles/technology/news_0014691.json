We want to stop people crossing,\" Orban told reporters in Vienna after a meeting aimed at smoothing over differences with Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann.\n\"Introducing the border protection to Serbia has met expectations. Our duty is to make it happen on the Hungarian-Croatian border as well,\" he said.\nOrban said however that he would seek to secure international support before closing the border.\nHungary has seen more than 250,000 migrants enter the country this year, travelling up from Greece through the western Balkans and hoping to make it to northern Europe, in particular Germany and Sweden.\nOn September 15 Hungary effectively sealed its Serbian border - the main route into Hungary - with razor wire and by barring the official crossing points.\nThis has since diverted 55,000 people in the past nine days into Croatia.\nBut Croatia, overwhelmed by the new arrivals, has been transferring them to its border with Hungary, which then transports them to the Austrian frontier.\nHungary has also begun closing off the 41-kilometre (25.5-mile) stretch of its border with Croatia not covered by the uncrossable Drava river.\nAt present, migrants are entering Hungary from Croatia via official border crossing points.\nHungary announced on Thursday that it has also started to roll out barbed wire along its border with Slovenia, the first such known measure between two members of Europe's passport-free Schengen zone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T15:47:32.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
