Low capacitance diodes are integrated with an additional Zener diode to protect each I/O pin against ESD and high-surge events. These devices offer surge protection/capacitance ratio, absorbing up to 24-A of lightning-induced surges while presenting only 1.5-pF per I/O-to-ground connection, assuring minimal signal degradation. The array can also handle a minimum of ±30-kV ESD. Peak pulse power (500 W for SP4044, 600 W for SP4045) allows more headroom against electrical threats as defined by regulatory standards. Low dynamic resistance (0.22 Ω for SP4044, 0.3 Ω for SP4045) produces low clamping voltages, allowing these devices to protect modern/small geometry chipsets against industry-defined ESD transients. \n\n\nThe low loading capacitance of the TVS diode array also makes the SP4044 and SP4045 series suitable for protecting high speed signal pins. Straight-through routing allows these components to sit on top of the lines they protect, eliminating stub parasitic capacitance and inductance and ensuring higher signal integrity. Typical applications for the SP4044 and SP4045 include protecting HDBaseT, 2.5 and 5 Gigabit Ethernet, and 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports, as well as secondary protection for T1/E1 , T3/E3, and high-end audio-visual equipment lines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T06:14:57.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
