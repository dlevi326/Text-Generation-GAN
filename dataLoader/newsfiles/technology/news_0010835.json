Starting this Spring, Prime Video in the U.S. will be the exclusive subscription streaming home for Mr. Robot. Prime members can watch all ten episodes of the dramatic thriller series that follows a young programmer who works as a cyber-security engineer by day and as a vigilante hacker by night. All ten episodes of season one of the series will exclusively premiere on Prime Video in the U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan. Prime members can watch via the Amazon Video app for TVs, connected devices and mobile devices, or online at www.amazon.com/PrimeVideo —the series will also be available for Prime members to download on iOS, Android and Fire devices for offline viewing. \nThe first episode of Mr. Robot premiered in the U.S. at the South by Southwest Film Festival where it won the Audience Award for Episodic Television, and aired this summer on the USA Network to critical acclaim. The NBCUniversal series, from Universal Cable Productions, currently has an IMDb rating of 9.0/10 and has already won widespread critical acclaim. One of the best-reviewed series of the year, season one of Mr. Robot is the first show on Rotten Tomatoes to score 100 percent for every episode. \nHere’s what critics are saying about Mr. Robot: “It left me electrified. A”– Jeff Jensen, Entertainment Weekly “Addictive, entertaining and popular out-of-nowhere summer series”– Tim Goodman, The Hollywood Reporter “A modern classic”– Merrill Barr, Forbes “A cyber-age thriller infused with a dark, almost nihilistic pessimism about the Internet, capitalism and income inequality. And that makes it kind of fun.”– Alessandra Stanley, The New York Times “Mr. Robot is compulsively watchable and interesting. It's a reminder that even the most well-worn cliches can still work with the right execution”– Alan Sepinwall, Hitfix “Damn near perfect”– Jessica Rawden, Cinemablend \n“ Mr. Robot is one the most compelling new dramas on television,” said Brad Beale, Amazon Vice President of Digital Video Content Acquisition. “Rami Malek delivers a mesmerizing performance and leads a great cast with an intriguing story full of dark twists. Prime members are going to love binging on this awesome show.” \n“ Mr. Robot is a tremendous success and Amazon Prime has provided a great opportunity to make the show even more accessible to audiences,” said Frances Manfredi, President, NBCUniversal Television and New Media Distribution. \"We are pleased that Amazon recognizes the high quality of NBCUniversal’s content and is partnering with us in a network friendly way that allows viewers to watch the show when and where they want it.” \nMr. Robot stars Rami Malek ( The Pacific ) as Elliot, a young computer programmer who works as a cyber-security engineer by day and as a vigilante hacker by night. Elliot finds himself at a crossroads when the mysterious leader of an underground hacker group played by Christian Slater ( Nymphomaniac ) recruits him to destroy the firm he is paid to protect. Compelled by his personal beliefs, Elliot struggles to resist the chance to take down the multinational CEOs he believes are running (and ruining) the world. \nMr. Robot also stars Portia Doubleday ( Her ), Carly Chaikin ( Suburgatory ) and Martin Wallström ( Simple Simon ). Sam Esmail ( Comet ) is creator, writer and executive producer. Anonymous Content’s Steve Golin ( True Detective ) and Chad Hamilton ( Breakup at a Wedding ) also serve as executive producers. \nAbout Amazon Video \nAmazon Video includes tens of thousands of movies and TV episodes available on Prime Video at no additional charge to Prime members, as well as access to hundreds of thousands of titles to buy or rent.
