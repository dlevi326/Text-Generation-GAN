The HuddlePod Air from HuddleCamHD is a full duplex wireless USB conference phone that uses a wireless USB 2.0 receiver over a discreet 2.4 GHz connection instead of traditional Bluetooth technology. Bluetooth is notoriously low quality and difficult for end users to \"pair\" to their computer.\nMatthew Davis lead engineer at HuddleCamHD explains \"The HuddlePod air allows for a higher quality audio conferencing experience when compared to traditional Bluetooth.\" Davis continues \"It was our goal to find a way to make this technology affordable and we have done that with the HuddlePod Air priced at only $299.\"\nVideo conferencing software providers like Zoom.US have already added the HuddlePod Air to their suggested equipment list for their popular \"Zoom Rooms\". A high quality USB 2.0 audio conference phone with wireless is a staple for deploying successful video conference rooms without draping cables over the floor.\nPaul Richards, Business Development for HuddleCamHD explains \"The HuddlePod Air is the perfect compliment to our USB conference camera line. Paired with the HuddleCam 3X you can have a $698 solution with a wide angle camera and a large microphone pick up range. It's a slam dunk for small to medium sized meeting spaces\".\nThe HuddlePod Air is available from your favorite online retail store such as BnH Photo, Conference Room Systems or Amazon. Pick one up today for $299 and experience the high quality audio conferencing your team can enjoy.\nThe entire HuddleCamHD UVC audio & video product line is also available through AV distribution from: PicturePhone, StarinAV & Stampede Global. From video conferencing, to live streaming and unified communications, HuddleCamHD has solutions that will make communications more affordable and easier to use.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12939050.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12939050.htm", "http://www.conferenceroomsystems.com/wireless-usb-speakerphone-p/huddlepod-air.htm", "https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/204003179", "http://huddlecamhd.com/huddlepod-air/"], "published": "2015-09-09T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T15:31:20.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
