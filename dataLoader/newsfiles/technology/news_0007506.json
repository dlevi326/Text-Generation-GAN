Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Tim Dodd In his two years as Education Minister Christopher Pyne could not manage to pass the reforms he advocated which would have utterly remade Australian higher education .\nNor did he manage to articulate a response to the wave of digital disruption lapping at the edges of the comfortable environment our universities have become accustomed to.\nBut last week he did see one of his endeavours come to fruition: My School has come to universities, and they are calling it QILT – the Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching.\nIt is a landmark arrival in the world of higher education. In the website www.qilt.edu.au , which went live last Wednesday, the federal government has released, for the first time, those parts of its vast higher education databank that allow students to meaningfully compare universities with one another.\nStudents can find out which universities produce the graduates most likely to find jobs after they complete their course. They can also find out – for each university – graduates' median starting salary.\nIt's possible to drill down further and compare this information for different disciplines and courses – although the information is still very broad-brush in some areas.\nIt's also possible to see the results of the huge student satisfaction survey the federal government co-ordinates each year – university by university and course by course.\nQILT is a tremendous tool for students wanting more information to inform their choice about what course they do and where they study.\n And this is where Pyne came into it. Universities have never wanted this information made public. Higher education is very clubbish, and universities have never been happy about being thrust into a more competitive environment.\nAnd releasing this sort of useful comparative data was not consistent with long-held government and departmental policy which held that all of Australia's public universities were equal. It didn't matter where you studied because it was all high-quality with perfectly satisfactory outcomes. So they said.\nPyne's outstanding contribution was to upset this cosy, but unrealistic, consensus. He decided the data had to be released and be accessible.\nThe website www.qilt.edu.au is a creditable first try, but still a little clumsy. One problem is that it's not possible to directly compare data from more than six universities. This makes it impossible to see which university, among the 40 whose information is posted, is the best in a particular area.\nNor can you create a league table within the website that ranks all universities for a particular characteristic, such as graduate employment rates.\nGiven universities' reluctance to be compared, this feature may have been deliberately designed to make it difficult. (Universities and many other stakeholders were consulted to the n th degree about QILT.)\nBut in the digital age such shortcomings are soon fixed. Within hours of QILT being released on Wednesday, The Australian Financial Review had scraped the data and posted an interactive table allowing all universities to be ranked by graduate income, graduate employment rate, and overall educational experience as judged by students. (Have a look. It's very useful.)\nPyne insisted on QILT because if he had managed to introduce his deregulation reforms to universities a source of transparent information about university performance would be essential. But, even though he failed to introduce his changes, they are still extremely important in shifting the focus of higher education on to the results it produces for students.\nQILT needs further development. It will have more information added to it, including from non-university higher education providers. Its usability could also be improved.\nBut overall, it's a very positive change that will shift university culture. It says that students are consumers who have a right to know all the available information about the courses they contemplate spending tens of thousand of dollars on. It says that transparency and choice are paramount.\nEven though it's a mere website, I think it will prove to be one of the most important legacies of Pyne's two years as education minister.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TimDoddAFR", "https://plus.google.com/+TimDoddSydney"], "published": "2015-09-20T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:04:08.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
