Why? Because this case is about sovereignty.\" \nUS officials in December 2013 persuaded a magistrate judge to grant a warrant to access to a Microsoft-based email account that was suspected of being used in narcotics trade. \nBut Microsoft refused to comply, saying the records were stored at a data center in Dublin, Ireland. A US district court sided with the government. \nRosenkranz said the 1986 US law cited by the government in the case predates modern communication systems, including the use of overseas data storage, and that there is nothing in the statute that implies that it governs overseas operations. \nThe government has argued that the specific location of the records is irrelevant because Microsoft, as a US company, is subject to US rules. \n\"Under international law... the norm is that sovereigns have jurisdiction over entities before them and can compel them to produce materials,\" said Justin Anderson, an assistant US attorney. \nA legal brief outlining the government's case quoted an earlier ruling on overseas records that said: \"the test for production of documents is control, not location.\" \nSince Microsoft officials in the US maintained control over the Dublin data center , they must hand over the records, Anderson said. \nMembers of the three-judge panel seemed open to both sides and extended an oral argument originally scheduled for 24 minutes well past an hour. \n\"The implications of what we do here are obviously broad,\" said appellate judge Gerard Lynch. \nMicrosoft has won backing from numerous tech, media and telecom heavyweights, including Apple, the Washington Post and Verizon. \nThe Center for Democracy and Technology, which has supported Microsoft, warned of an international \"Wild West\" if the warrant is upheld as foreign governments seek to seize data held in the US. \n\"The economic consequences of this case could be huge,\" said Greg Nojeim, an attorney at CDT. \n\"It could make it even more difficult for US providers to sell services abroad when the US government claims special rights to access content conveyed over those services. Many potential customers will conflate such access with NSA (National Security Agency) surveillance, to the detriment of US cloud providers.\" Microsoft builds support over Ireland email case December 15, 2014 \nMicrosoft said Monday it had secured broad support from a coalition of influential technology and media firms as it seeks to challenge a US ruling ordering it to hand over emails stored on a server in Ireland.

Microsoft fights court order in test on overseas data June 11, 2014 \nMicrosoft is challenging a US court order that would require it to hand over data from an overseas server in a test of the reach of American law enforcement. Microsoft says private data 'at risk' in court case December 8, 2014 \nMicrosoft argued Monday in a court brief that an order requiring it to give US prosecutors data stored in Ireland could \"put all of our private digital information at risk.\" Microsoft challenging US on overseas data July 31, 2014 \nIn a case closely watched by the tech sector, Microsoft will challenge Thursday a US court order requiring it to give prosecutors electronic mail content associated with an overseas server.
