It dismissed arguments by Google that with the order the regulator went beyond its capacities under French law.\n“It simply requests full observance of European legislation by non-European players offering their services in Europe,” Paris-based CNIL said in a statement on Monday. “If this right was limited to some extensions, it could be easily circumvented.”\nThe order comes after a judgment by the EU’s highest court in May 2014 created a right to be forgotten -- allowing people to seek the deletion of links on search engines if the information was outdated or irrelevant. The ruling provoked a furor, with Google creating a special panel to advise it on implementing the law. The panel opposed applying the ruling beyond EU domains.\n“We’ve worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten ruling thoughtfully and comprehensively in Europe, and we’ll continue to do so,” Google said in an e-mailed statement. “But as a matter of principle, we respectfully disagree with the idea that one national data protection authority can assert global authority to control the content that people can access around the world.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T15:09:51.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
