The contract runs for five years, but some orders could be extended for up to an additional 24 months, it said.\nDave Wajsgras, president of Raytheon Intelligence, Information and Services, said the company had invested over $3.5 billion in recent years to expand its cybersecurity capabilities. He said cybersecurity incidents had increased an average of 66 percent a year worldwide between 2009 and 2014.\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal ; Editing by David Gregorio )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T04:49:32.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
