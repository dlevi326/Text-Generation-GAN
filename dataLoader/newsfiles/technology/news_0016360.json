CEL Robox is the first 3D printing manufacturer to have this filament brand spooled directly onto their SmartReels and is available from 30 th September in the full range of colours. \nRuud Rouleaux, CEO at ColorFabb explained: “I first saw the Robox printer in action in 2014 and was immediately taken by the ease of use that Robox offers consumers. So when we began looking for a 3D printer to partner with we naturally reached out to Robox to see how we could work together to make 3D printing in a range of different materials more accessible to everyone. In Robox we have found a partner that we can work together with to achieve our goal of allowing people to create functional and aesthetically beautiful prints.” \nColorFabb_XT is made from Amphora 3D Polymer, a product of the Eastman Chemical Company, and has a number of advantages over both PLA and ABS materials including an extremely low shrink rate, good bed adhesion and strong inter-layer bonding. \nThe new relationship with RS will make CEL’s Robox 3D printer available to its global customer base, including engineers and education professionals, from early October. RS brings great 3D design software, DesignSpark Mechanical, with a huge library of off-the-shelf components to users, which enables engineers to seamlessly design parts and order hardware to finish their projects. \nBen Lawton, Global Head of Tools and Consumables at RS, added: “We’re excited to be able to offer such a highly versatile 3D printer like Robox to our customers, enabling them to create professional quality prints for rapid prototyping for a range of disciplines. The printer’s ease-of-use, competitive price and future-proof upgradable design potentially makes it the complete micro-manufacturing solution – whether you’re a maker at home, creator at school or professional engineer.” \nChris Elsworthy, CEO of CEL, commented: “The addition of ColorFabb’s range of co-polyester materials is fantastic news for Robox users, offering them the ability to print in even more new and interesting ways. We’re also excited to be working with RS to offer Robox to industry specific customers, giving them access to a versatile and easy-to-use prototyping tool that creates professional quality prints. In both ColorFabb and RS we have found partners that are as dedicated as we are to delivering great experiences to the growing number of people using 3D printers around the world.” \nVisitors to TCT Show + Personalize can visit CEL on stand C25 on 30 th September – 1 st October at the NEC, Birmingham.
