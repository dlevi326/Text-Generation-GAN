You must be sure all of your components are compatible, confident that your power supply can handle the load, and overall, that you know how to put everything together properly. Thanks to Acer, this process is now easy as vertically stacking a bunch of Legos on top of one another, but with every new piece you add, your tower gains a new ability. Now that sounds like a good time. \nAcer's Revo Build Mini PC. \nAcer recently announced a little modular desktop computer called the Revo Build Mini PC. It starts out as a 5x5x2-inch box running on a lower-end Intel Celeron or Pentium processor with integrated graphics. The base brick also includes 8 Gbytes RAM, 32 gigs of solid-state storage, and plenty of I/O on the back and around the side of the unit: 3 USB ports, HDMI-out, DisplayPort, Ethernet, and an SD card slot. \nIncluded in the little bricks are speakers, microphones, and an optional GPU base unit that ups the system’s performance for gamers and video-editors, but one of the coolest features has to do with power. The “Wireless Power Bank,” as it’s called, can keep the small desktop PC running when you’re away from outlets, AKA: you can hit up the beach while also taking care of business. \nAcer's little bricks are packed. \nUnfortunately the Revo Build Mini PC won’t be coming to the U.S. right away, and prices and specs aren’t yet available for each module. But if you’re in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, the base configuration will be available in October for around $220, and it’ll come to China in December starting at $315.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T20:02:59.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
