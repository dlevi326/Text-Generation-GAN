September 17, 2015 SARASOTA, Fla. – Brian Butler has been promoted to vice president of operational support for Environmental Pest Service. Butler was previously President of Atlanta-based Skyline Pest Solutions, an EPS company, which he co-founded in 2004. In his new role, Butler will oversee purchasing, fleet, software and IT infrastructure for the three EPS brand platforms: Skyline Pest Solutions in metro Atlanta; Arrow Environmental Services in west and central Florida; and Bug Out Service in northeast Florida and southeast Georgia. “Brian has built an extremely successful business at Skyline over the past 11 years,” said Joe Finney, Chief Executive Officer of Environmental Pest Service. “We are very excited to leverage his knowledge and innovative thinking for all three EPS brand platforms.” By 2013, Butler had expanded Skyline Pest Solutions’ services from termite and pest control to include wildlife exclusion and insulation, and had 13,000 customers and $5 million in annual revenues. He partnered with EPS in October 2013 to help his business continue growing, while keeping customer service and quality a priority. As Butler transitions into his new position over the next few months, Brandon Ansley has been hired as president of Skyline Pest Solutions, bringing more than eight years of performance-focused leadership experience. Ansley most recently served as the president of Atlanta-based Northwest Heating and Cooling, where he was responsible for direction, strategy and growth of the company. Prior to joining Northwest Heating and Cooling, Ansley was the president of Atlanta-based Pest Control Insulation, which markets and distributes natural, low-toxicity proprietary insulation products to pest control companies across the United States. Butler and Ansley will both have significant roles in the company’s strategic planning as EPS continues to expand through mergers and acquisitions, and organic growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:46:21.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
