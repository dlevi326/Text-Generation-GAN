It's not interesting anymore to see me like that,\" she added. \nCyrus also admitted it would be hard for her to fit again into mainstream society. \n\"I don't think I'll grow that way,\" Cyrus said. \"It seems like it would be backwards.\" More Technology Industry News  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:17:18.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
