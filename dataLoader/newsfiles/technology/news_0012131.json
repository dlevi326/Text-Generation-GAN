The decision by the Internal Revenue Service , which Yahoo received Sept. 2 but disclosed in a securities filing on Tuesday, could endanger the spinoff, which has been highly anticipated by the company’s shareholders. Yahoo’s core business of selling advertising has struggled for years, and analysts say that the value of its stake in Alibaba, China’s leading e-commerce company, accounts for most of its stock price. Yahoo shares fell about 3 percent in after-hours trading after the company disclosed the I.R.S. ruling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T00:53:21.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
