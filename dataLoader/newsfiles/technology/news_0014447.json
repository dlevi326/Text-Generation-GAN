Forman Team Engineering Excellence Award . The team has developed an optics-based LAT that detects the time resolved emission of light from switching transistors within integrated circuits, operating down to .5V, thus creating a new tool for device analysis in advanced process technologies. The group comprises researchers and scientists from, MIT , Photon Spot, Inc. , DCG Systems and IBM , and has been led by Dr. Euan Ramsay of DCG Systems. The team will receive the award during the plenary session at OSA’s Annual Meeting, Frontiers in Optics (FiO), which takes place 18-22 October in San Jose, California, USA. \n“The development and successful testing of the Logic Analysis Tool is an impressive example of innovation in optics and photonics,” said Philip Russell, president of The Optical Society. “Bringing together top minds from different companies, the team has created a tool that leads the way for the next generation of circuit analysis and characterization. The LAT will be vital in the creation of faster and denser microchips that consume less power, spurring further innovation. The Optical Society is delighted to recognize the team's remarkable achievements with this award and congratulates them on their success.” \nThe research team first came together in 2010 in response to a call from the Intelligence Advanced Research Program Activity (IARPA) for innovative solutions to circuit analysis. Despite being geographically dispersed and working for different organizations, the LAT team has earned praise for its cohesiveness and ability to overcome technical obstacles that surfaced during development, successfully delivering the prototype on time and on budget. The project is a significant example of the best in cooperative innovation, and the team's results are already attracting substantial interest from the government circuit analysis community. \n“We are honored to be recognized by The Optical Society with the Forman award,” said Dr. Euan Ramsay, DCG Systems, Inc. “Without the hard work and dedication of the talented members of the team, we would not have been able to achieve the results we have.” \nThe Logic Analysis Tool team includes: DCG Systems, Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:51:53.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
