These are in addition to the order for ten similar vessels announced in August, 2015 from CSBC in Taiwan. The latest contract was signed by EMC Chairman Mr. Anchor Chang and Imabari Shipbuilding President Mr. Yukito Higaki. The first ship is planned to be delivered during the first half of 2018, with the completion of the series due by the first half of 2019.  All twenty new-buildings are planned to be deployed in the intra-Asia trade.\nEvergreen’s B-type vessels will be 211 metres in length, 32.8 metres wide, and have a design draft of 10 metres with a capacity of around 2,800 TEU. The ships are designed to load 13 rows of containers on deck, which is within the span of existing gantry cranes in the major ports on the intra-Asian trade.\nThe hull design of the vessels is wider in comparison to ships of a similar capacity. Such design enables the ships to navigate in the shallower ports encountered in the intra-Asia trade and to enhance their cargo carrying capability.\nFact File: Founded in 1901, Imabari Shipbuilding is Japan’s largest shipbuilder. The agreement for B-type vessels is the third project in which Imabari will participate in Evergreen Line’s fleet renewal program. Evergreen has signed agreements with Shoei Kisen Kaisha, the ship owning arm of Imabari Shipbuilding Group, to charter five 14,000 TEU containerships to be delivered in 2017 and eleven 18,000 TEU containerships to be delivered in 2018 and 2019.\nFor all the latest on Evergreen Line, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:39:24.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
