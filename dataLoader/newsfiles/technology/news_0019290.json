It will incorporate advanced technology for ammonia production in compliance with safety measures. \nThe engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) activities are expected to be completed within three years. \" We are pleased to have launched the construction of our new ammonia production facility in Kingisepp.\" \nThe project is in line with the company's plan to obtain self-sufficiency through its own raw materials base. \nEuroChem CEO Dmitry Strezhnev said: \"We are pleased to have launched the construction of our new ammonia production facility in Kingisepp, which is expected to be brought online in 2018. \n\"The additional volumes of ammonia from the Kingisepp facility will have a direct, positive effect on the future efficiency and reliability of our fertiliser production. \n\"This will further strengthen our business, placing us at the forefront of global fertilizer production.\" \nInternational expert organisations have issued positive comments on the project with respect to its environmental and social impact, and industrial safety, EuroChem said. \nIn April, Eurochem, Maire Tecnimont and SACE signed a memorandum of understanding to develop five projects in the US, Kazakhstan and Russia in the next ten years, to produce five million tonnes of ammonia and 7.5 million tonnes of urea a year. \nIn June, EuroChem awarded a â‚¬660m contract to Maire Tecnimont to design and construct an ammonia plant in Kingisepp. Follow Us:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T01:16:34.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
