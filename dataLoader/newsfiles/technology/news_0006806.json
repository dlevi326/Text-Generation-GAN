This is the first time that such as decision has been taken in Haryana. The municipalities across the state today started implementing the ban order, which was issued in concurrence of the directive of the Directorate of Urban Local Bodies, even as dhaba owners, meat and chicken sellers and butchers protested the move. A few days ago, a delegation of the Jain community had met Urban Local Minister Kavita Jain and urged her to keep the slaughter houses closed during “Paryushan Parva”. Jain later urged the municipal officials to appeal to owners of slaughter houses to keep them closed during the festival. Even though Jain had not issued any order, the urban local bodies department seemed to have gone overboard to “please” the minister with municipalities across the state enforcing the ban. The notice (a copy is with The Tribune) issued by the Fatehabad Municipal Council to the slaughter house owners warned them of legal action in case they violated its order. In Fatehabad, notices have been served on as many 27 meat and chicken sellers and butchers by Municipal Council’s Executive Officer OP Sihag. Sirsa Municipal Council’s Executive Officer Attar Singh also confirmed having served notices in the town. The affected meat-sellers and slaughter house owners today protested the order and accused the government of snatching people’s employment. “The BJP government had come to power with the promise of providing employment to all. But with its deeds, the government has been robbing people of their business,” alleged Salim, a protester. They warned that the government should immediately withdraw its order, otherwise it would have to face heavy price for it politically.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T22:47:57.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
