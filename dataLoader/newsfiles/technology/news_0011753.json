Titan provides a free standing Data Acquisition Terminal that charges the cameras, extracts the data, wipes the camera clean of the data and then stores the video onto a local secure server. The data management software is easy and makes accessing the video by an assigned administrator easy. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150928/271562 \nWhat's makes this so unique and different is that it completely takes away from monthly fees, storage fees and licensing fees. It keeps all your files literally at your fingertips with a simplistic easy back end management system. These units also delete videos of low importance after any set amount of days the agency or legislation desires. Therefore the unit only keeps footage that is consider high importance which ensures that you are utilizing your server space to the fullest. \nClick here for comparison chart of body camera systems. \nThe chart demonstrates how Titan Body Worn Camera Systems compares against leading competitors for a 50 officer department for a 5 year period. These numbers include the cameras, installation, monthly charges and any other hidden costs we could find. \nIn an example of these costs, in Birmingham, Alabama, the City Council approved a five-year $889,000 contract with TASER International for police body cameras and a companion digital management system. The city will pay the company $238,000 for the first year of service. Birmingham police initially bought five terabytes of data, and already have used 2 Â½ since the cameras went into use.\" Which means they are going to need more storage which is going to cost more money every year down the road. \nIn SiliconeAngle Magazine, Mike Wheatley, a Senior Staff Writer, recently wrote an article about TASER, entitled: \"Are the cops being cheated on cloud costs?\" \nThis is one of many stories that make implementing these body camera systems costly . What we are finding is that all the cameras available on the market do what they promise to do and that is to record video. What agencies need to be concerned about is the longevity of the devices and how the costs will look in 4-5 years. \nBut, Titan Body Worn Camera Systems has solved this problem. Titan offers an all inclusive cost that includes equipment, set up, training and storage which eliminates recurring and accumulating monthly fees. Because unless this data is managed and archived it accumulates storage fees. \nFor more information, contact Titan Body Worn Camera Today \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/video-data-storage-and-monthly-fee-issues-solved-for-police-body-cameras-300150398.html \nSOURCE Titan Body Camera", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T06:33:38.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
