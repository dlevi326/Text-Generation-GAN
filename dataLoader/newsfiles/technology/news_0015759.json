But it said that by the end of August the central government had already spent 96 per cent of its annual infrastructure investment budget.\nTo achieve China’s 2015 growth target of around seven per cent, the ministry said it would step up and improve a “proactive fiscal policy, fine tune the measures in a timely manner and accelerate reforms that will help stabilise growth”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T08:14:22.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
