Sphero’s BB-8 droid is one of the coolest things you will ever see, and the little remote-controlled droid won’t only go around your entire house, but it won’t break the bank either. \nAs reported by the Verge , the BB-8 isn’t really a toy so much as a “robot performer with Pixar-esque aspirations.” That sounds about right, and you can really tell that by watching the promotional video for the little guy. <noscript><iframe src=\"http://widgets.ign.com/video/embed/content.html?url=http://www.ign.com/videos/2015/09/03/the-sphero-bb-8-toy-is-ridiculously-cool\" width=\"568\" height=\"363\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></noscript> \nYou just can’t help but love BB-8, and that’s even if you aren’t a fan of Star Wars and all that it encompasses. Being able to have a little droid roam around your home or office and project holograms for others to see is an incredible breakthrough in technology. \nBB-8 is one of newest characters in the franchise and he will make his debut in Star Wars: The Force Awakens when it hits theaters this Christmas. He has a head similar to the beloved R2-D2, but he rolls around quickly on a sphere-shaped body. \nThe remote-controlled toy version of BB-8 is about the size of a baseball, and that fits right in with the 12-inch tall Star Wars action figures , according to the Wall Street Journal . \nA smartphone app will be used to control BB-8, and it will indeed be available via both iOS and Android. Making things even cooler with all of this is that BB-8 can travel up to speeds of five miles per hour, which is the same speed that a child’s Barbie Jeep can travel. \nBB-8 is also extremely durable, so don’t worry about bumping into walls and minor hits coming around a blind corner. Even if his magnetic head happens to pop off, it can be placed right back on. \nThe BB-8 remote controlled droid toy will be on sale beginning this Friday and available in Apple’s retail stores, Best Buy, and the official Sphero website. As if BB-8 wasn’t already awesome enough, he comes with a price tag of only $149.99 \nOh, and if there ever comes a time that you don’t feel like driving BB-8 around but don’t want to put him back on his charger, you can do that. There is a “Patrol Mode” which will allow for him to wander around the room and check things out. \nSure, this little guy doesn’t have the full technology from Star Wars and most things are done through the app, but it’s still fun to enjoy. The remote-controlled BB-8 droid will allow you to place yourself in a galaxy far, far away and not have to spend a lot of money on it either. \n[Image via LucasFilm/The Verge]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T20:48:08.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
