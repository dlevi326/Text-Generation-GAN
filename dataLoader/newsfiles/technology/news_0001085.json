Is Black Mass as great a film as, say, Goodfellas ? No, of course it’s not. Will some of its themes and formulations be familiar to moviegoers who have watched their share of mob cinema and of films set on the South Side of Boston? Yes, they will.\nRelated Story 10 Great American Gangster Movies\nBut for those willing to grant these (perhaps inevitable) allowances, Black Mass is a very, very good film. Directed by Scott Cooper and starring Johnny Depp, the movie tells the true story of James “Whitey” Bulger, who rose to become the most powerful and ruthless crime lord in Boston thanks in large part to his “alliance” with the local branch of the FBI.\nThe story—largely accurate, though with occasional details rearranged—begins in the mid-1970s, with the return to Boston of FBI Special Agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). Connolly, a native of the South Side, had known and admired Bulger (Depp) while growing up, and he soon sells his superiors on the idea of turning the crime boss into an FBI informant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:48:29.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
