In 2013, Mr. McAdam quietly negotiated with Intel executives in Silicon Valley to buy the business for less than $200 million.\nThis week, the carrier began showing off what it has done with OnCue and a handful of other acquisitions including its $4.4 billion buyout of AOL Inc. Verizon launched a mobile video service, called Go90, targeted at teens and 20-somethings. The free, ad-supported service will be available to smartphone users on any carrier at the end of the month.\nYet Verizon's service is dramatically scaled back from what OnCue was developing, and even from what Verizon said it planned to do when it struck the deal. In the more than 18 months Verizon has owned it, a number of players have jumped into the market with services that are more like what Intel was poised to launch in early 2014.\nCable and content companies have struggled to adapt to changing viewer habits as more people cut the cable cord in favor of streaming video online. Companies like Dish Network Corp. and Sony Corp. have launched online streaming services. AT&T Inc. paid $49 billion for DirecTV with plans to bundle traditional video with smartphone plans.\nVerizon, which has been selling off chunks of its traditional pay-TV business, is taking a different path by focusing almost exclusively on millennials.\nThe Go90 service can be watched on phones and tablets via an app and will count against a user's data plan. Verizon has deals with 15 of the top 30 cable networks for specific programs rather than 24-hour feeds, which means users will be able to watch some full programs like \"The Daily Show.\" Verizon will offer some NFL games and content from companies targeting young people, such as AwesomenessTV. The app lets users create clips of shows they can share on social media.\nThe service is likely to put more pressure on an already strained pay-TV industry, which saw cord-cutting accelerate in the most recent quarter, said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG. \"Free is pretty compelling,\" he added. But winning over fickle teenagers might be difficult, as many of them have already developed habits watching mobile videos on many competitors like Facebook, Vine, Snapchat and YouTube. `\nDevelopment of OnCue began around 2011, and it was the pet project of former Intel chief Paul Otellini, who was searching for ways to diversify Intel's business beyond computer chips.\nBy the time Verizon bought it, in January 2014, the service was nearly complete. OnCue would record three prior days' worth of content and store it online so consumers could watch anything on demand. It had deals with most of the major content providers, two people familiar with the matter said, and it had a deal with Amazon to incorporate much of its Web video library. Users accessed the service via a device that would plug into a television set. It had a sleek remote and search functions similar to what Apple Inc. showed off for Apple TV on Wednesday.\n\"The interface was beautiful; it worked really well,\" said Mr. Greenfield, who tested OnCue months before Verizon bought it. Verizon was \"handed something that was very innovative for the time.\"\nThousands of employees were testing it in their homes in Oregon, California and Arizona. The service was slated to cost $50 a month. It needed 2 million sign-ups to break even, one of the people said. The service would have only launched in a handful of markets because it had to negotiate deals with local TV networks, the people said.\nWhen Mr. Otellini retired in May 2013, his successor, Brian Krzanich, didn't share the same vision for disrupting the TV industry. Mr. Krzanich wanted Intel to stay focused on its roots.\nVerizon executives questioned the business model, too. OnCue's early 2014 launch was canceled. Pop-up stores that had been planned in Chicago, New York City and Los Angeles to promote the service displayed existing Intel products instead.\n\"Based on the way the content deals would be structured, it would be really difficult to have a compelling offer,\" said Brian Angiolet, a Verizon executive who was one of the architects of Go90. A $50-a-month service, on top of what consumers paid for broadband, was simply too expensive, he said.\nOne major challenge to OnCue's business model was that media companies were hoping to charge high \"new entrant\" prices and trying to stuff more of their content bundles into the service--a problem that every new streaming service is contending with, from Sony to Apple.\nShortly after the acquisition, Verizon held focus groups with teenagers and adults under age 34 to study how they watched video. The company recorded people in their living rooms, on the go and in restaurants, Mr. Angiolet said.\nThe studies confirmed what Verizon felt it already knew: Millennials overwhelmingly use their smartphones to find, watch and share videos.\n\"When we put all that together we said they best way to enter this market is more from a mobile-first orientation,\" Mr. Angiolet said, adding that Verizon may incorporate additional OnCue features as part of FiOS television service in the future. For now, \"it was more about where do we think the market is going.\"\nThe decision to change direction disappointed many inside OnCue, who felt the carrier was abandoning a product that had great potential. There was also some friction between OnCue's Santa Clara staff and Verizon's New Jersey executives, former employees said. There was definitely a culture clash,\" said one former employee. \"I think a lot of people were very frustrated.\"\nAlberto Canal, a Verizon spokesman, said the company is \"continuously impressed by the former OnCue team's ability to adjust to the changing market.\"\nWrite to Ryan Knutson at ryan.knutson@wsj.com\n 10, 2015 13:47 ET (17:47 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:37:05.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
