Because consumer 3D printing involves unique standards requirements, IEEE P3030 is planned to provide a needed blueprint for data abstraction, quality, protection and safety. The architectural framework for consumer 3D printing is intended to be a reference model that defines relationships among various domains and common architecture elements, and that addresses all contingencies related to the industry, regulatory bodies and consumers. \n“Consumer 3D printing technology is emerging rapidly and there is a need to incentivize industry adoption of standards specific to the marketplace, and to be cognizant of unique challenges where 3D printed items from a wide range of future equipment will need to produce identical results in order to achieve broader market acceptance,” said Yu Yuan, chair, IEEE Consumer 3D Printing Working Group. “IEEE P3030 is focused on standards development to establish quality metrics and accuracy grades so that printed materials at the consumer level can be assembled faultlessly, while also addressing issues related to privacy, security and control measures.” \nIEEE will host several workshops on consumer 3D printing to collect input and solicit participation for IEEE P3030. The first workshop will be held during the 2015 IEEE Global High Tech Congress on Electronics (GHTCE) in conjunction with the 17 th China Hi-Tech Fair on 16-21 November 2015 in Shenzhen, the largest electronics industry base in China. \nTo learn more about IEEE P3030, please visit http://standards.ieee.org/develop/project/3030.html . \nTo learn more about IEEE-SA, visit us on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/ieeesa , follow us on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/ieeesa , connect with us on LinkedIn at http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1791118 , or on the Standards Insight Blog at http://www.standardsinsight.com . \nAbout the IEEE Standards Association \nThe IEEE Standards Association, a globally recognized standards-setting body within IEEE, develops consensus standards through an open process that engages industry and brings together a broad stakeholder community.
