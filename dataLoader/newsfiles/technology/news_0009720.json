This headcount milestone is an increase of approximately 4,000 employees since September 2013. \nThe new Seattle office is a consolidation of Luxoft's previous location, which has been serving clients for over 10 years, with the offices of Radius, Inc. - a recently acquired solution provider focused on the growing Internet of Things (IoT) industry. The Seattle office is a home location of the Center of Excellence (CoE) for Luxoft's IoT and Big Data horizontal practices. These practices will continue to bring innovation across all of the Company's vertical lines of business: Financial Services, Automotive, Telecom, Travel & Aviation, Technology, and Energy. Luxoft's expanded presence in Seattle will continue to serve both U.S. and global clients. \n\"I am very excited to announce our opening of a much larger and consolidated office here in Seattle,\" said Anders Brown, Managing Director of Luxoft's IoT Practice and former President of Radius Inc. \"As Luxoft and Radius continue on the path of full integration, our newly combined presence offers several important advantages such as increased stability and productivity. We also expanded space to frther pursue research and development, and continue with quality delivery in areas of agriculture, retail, and logistics, among others.\" \n\"Luxoft has a long history of doing business in Seattle, most importantly for servicing global companies like Boeing ( News - Alert ), and now newer clients, such as Microsoft,\" said Michael Minkevich, Luxoft's Vice President for Technology Services. \"As the IoT technology ecosystem continues to evolve, we see growing our presence in Seattle as critical to build our brand within these spheres of technology. Luxoft's new space will give us the infrastructure needed to grow and compete at much higher levels than ever before.\" \nIn addition to the Company's expansion in North America, Luxoft reached a major milestone of 10,000 staff globally. Luxoft's dynamic recruitment organization continues to yield talented engineers and delivery professionals who can deliver the sought after end-to-end services by current and potential clients. \nLuxoft has been adding capable personnel in all of its locations, and in particular in its three major delivery hubs in the European Union: Romania, Poland, and Bulgaria. For example, presence in Poland more than doubled over the last 12 months as a result of new hires and staff relocations, now exceeding 1,200 employees. Luxoft recently received an award from the Polish Agency of Foreign Investments (PAIZ), as testament to its commitment to growth in Poland. The award provides for a subsidy to Luxoft for each individual hired in Poland over the next five years. \n\"It is a very exciting time for Luxoft in Poland and for Luxoft as a global IT services company in general. Less than three years ago, we had 240 employees in Poland, which eventually grew to 600 in 2014, and now we stand at 1,200 with plans to expand even further,\" said Wojciech Mach, Managing Director of Luxoft Poland. \"It has been a tremendous experience to grow our offices here. To be a recipient of this government grant supporting our future hiring efforts speaks volumes about our contribution to the information technology community and the local economy within Poland.\" \nAbout Luxoft \nLuxoft Holding, Inc.
