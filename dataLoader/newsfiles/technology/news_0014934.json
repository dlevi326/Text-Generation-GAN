One is BinMaster , Lincoln, Neb., which donated rotary and vibrating-rod level sensors, dust-detection devices, and aeration equipment. Other equipment at the center was supplied by Coperion K-Tron , Sewell, N.J., and Vortex Valves , Salina. Companies sponsoring research at the center include ExxonMobil, Dow, DuPont, Cargill, Procter & Gamble, and Archer Daniels Midland.
