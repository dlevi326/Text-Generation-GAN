VULOG is recognized as a pioneer in new generation carsharing referred to as \" free floating \" (or \" one-way \"), offering no constraints of pick-up points and return stations, while eliminating the need for advance reservations. Users can therefore benefit from a flexible and on-demand mobility solution.

What if you had, at any moment in time , wherever you may be , a vehicle available upon request via your smartphone and only had to pay for the time spent behind the wheel? \" adds Fabrice Bienfait , Investment Director at Environmental Technologies Fund.
