It is the first ever drone with Virtual Reality Goggles. The takeoffs, landings, and hovering, are all automated and gives users a first-hand flying experience. The FlyBi allows users to capture daily activities and preserve their adventures. It can create stunning time-lapse videos and it’s all controlled by the Wearable Wrist Remote Control. It looks and feels like a watch, but it controls the flying drone! Use the pre-programmable flight mode to program the flight path with the wrist remote. Snap on the goggles, hit the “record flight” button on the wrist remote and begin flying.\nFlyBi, seen in Tech Time and Digital Trends, also comes with the head-tracker goggles. Get high above the ground without ever leaving it! Simply put the head-tracker goggles on and experience the drones point of view via live streaming video. However, before this incredible drone can come to market, FlyBi needs help. That’s why they launched this campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $35,000 by October 22, 2015. The funds raised will go towards production and manufacturing.\nTo help create this innovative drone technology, please visit the IndieGoGo campaign or click here . Backers can choose from many attractive rewards as a “thank you” for their donations.\nDon’t miss out on this great opportunity to own this amazing, automated drone!\nKnow others that would love this?
