One investor estimates the company will raise approximately $50 million, on top of the roughly $120 million it has already raised. \nThe company declined to disclose the amount of funding. \n“Financial markets are supporting companies like us really well,” said CEO Patrick Morley. \nAnd Zscaler, a cloud security company, also recently closed a new funding round, according to sources close to the company who declined to give the amount. This deal comes just more than a month after Zscaler raised $85 million. \nThe sector so far this year raised more than $2.3 billion globally, according to industry data, on a pace to top last year's total, and it is expected to remain a hot spot for big-dollar financing deals even during an economic downturn. \n“One of the very few times a CEO is fired is when you are exposed to a security breach,” said Venky Ganesan, managing director at Menlo Ventures. “This will be the last thing cut on the budget because nobody wants to lose their job.” \nMore funding \nMore funding was announced Tuesday, when CloudFlare, a company that offers both the ability to improve websites' performance and defend them from hackers, disclosed that it raised $110 million, bringing its total funding to $182 million in less than six years. \nEven on the heels of the worst of the stock market turbulence in late August, cybersecurity software firm Tanium announced it raised $120 million from investors, and security companies Netskope and Okta announced $75 million financing rounds just days later. \n“There is still tremendous opportunity to find some security companies solving hard problems,” said Enrique Salem, managing director at Bain Capital Ventures and former CEO of Symantec, a cybersecurity firm. \nAs with other tech sectors, investors worry about excessive valuations. Some investors say they expect more than a third of companies raising money now will fail outright, while others will be acquired and written off as a loss. \n“There will be some level of disappointment,” said Gilman Louie, partner at Alsop Louie Partners who previously led tech investments for the Central Intelligence Agency. But, he said, “There will be some unicorns out there. And there will be a lot of companies in the middle where you might get your money back.” \nBut such concerns have been sidelined by enthusiasm for a sector that is aiming to solve what many call the most persistent, difficult and costly problem facing businesses and government. \nAlberto Yepez, managing director of Trident Capital and longtime security expert, says there is little hesitation on the part of investors for security upstarts. \nGrowing budgets \nGlobal cybersecurity investments last year reached $2.5 billion and $1.7 billion in 2013, according to data firm CB Insights. Investments so far this year exceed $2.3 billion, according to data from CB Insights and Bain Capital Ventures and analysed by Reuters. \nVery few tech sectors raise more than $2.5 billion in a year. \nGiven the demand from banks, retailers, government agencies and hospitals, worldwide spending on information security technology is expected to grow from about $77 billion this year to $108 billion in 2019, according to research firm Gartner. \nCyber attacks will accelerate, and company budgets for cybersecurity spending will grow independent of what the economy does, said Bob Ackerman, security expert and founder of Allegis Capital. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co said in August it would double its cybersecurity spending this year to $500 million, after a cyberattack last year that involved the theft of contact information for about 83 million households and businesses. \nPublic companies offer VCs a peek at the possible returns from their investments. Palo Alto Networks, for instance, is trading close to $185 a share, up nearly five fold from its IPO price in 2012. \n“All the venture guys go, 'Wow, that's easy money,'“ Louie said. \nREUTERS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:45:54.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
