This makes it easy to see which songs will vanish from iTunes if users cancel their Apple Music subscription and can also help them make an informed choice as to whether to subscribe to Apple Music at the end of the free 3-month trial. This feature is available with the Tune Sweeper free demo, so no payment is required to use it.\nStafford, United Kingdom â€“ Apple Music is a great way of discovering new music. It allows users to listen to everything in the iTunes store and allows them to add any track or album from the iTunes Store directly to their music library. However, when music it added to iTunes, Apple Music tracks appear just like the rest of iTunes music and cannot be differentiated from music purchased on iTunes. Users whose free 3-month Apple Music trials are due to expire soon, and those who are considering cancelling their subscription, especially those with large music libraries, may be wondering which tracks in their collection were added by Apple Music.\nTo help users make an informed decision whether to subscribe to Apple Music streaming service at the end of the free 3-month trial, the developers at Wide Angle Software Ltd, have updated their iTunes clean-up software, Tune Sweeper, to identify tracks from Apple Music . This makes it easy to see which songs will vanish from iTunes if users cancel their Apple Music subscription.\nTune Sweeper runs on a Mac or PC and will display a complete list of tracks and albums that were added by the Apple Music streaming service. Using Tune Sweeper, users can even visit the albums store page in iTunes quickly by selecting the albums shown in Tune Sweeper, enabling them to purchase individual tracks or albums, rather than opting for a monthly Apple Music subscription.\nTune Sweeper also enables users to remove duplicate and missing tracks in iTunes as well as view their iTunes usage statistics. The software will also fix incorrect song data and download any missing album art. The Apple Music feature in Tune Sweeper is available as part of the free software demo, which can be downloaded from the Wide Angle Software website at https://www.wideanglesoftware.com/tunesweeper/ . Tune Sweeper is compatible with Mac OSX 10.7 or higher, as well as with Windows 7, 8 and 10.\nAbout Wide Angle Software\nWide Angle Software was founded in 2006 and is behind popular desktop and iOS software including iPod and iPhone backup software TouchCopy and the iTunes clean- up app Tune Sweeper.
