Balch. \nThe longest and largest controlled burn experiment ever conducted in the Amazon rainforest has yielded new insight into the ways that tropical forests succumb to—and bounce back from—large-scale wildfires, according to new research co-authored by a University of Colorado Boulder professor. \nThe findings, which were published today in the journal BioScience , are the result of a decade-long study in the world's largest rainforest and highlight the complex roles that factors such as climate, burn frequency and plant diversity can play in determining the forest's response to wildfires. \nThe research shows that Amazon forests were able to withstand an initial, low-intensity burn without suffering permanent damage but could not hold up against repeated blazes, especially when those fires coincided with drought years. \n\"Timing is critical,\" said Jennifer Balch, assistant professor in the Department of Geography at CU-Boulder and the lead author of the new study. \"The forest is quite resilient after a single burn and we can see canopy recovery. But when you get repeated fires happening right on top of one another, this can quickly transform a forest into a degraded grassland.\" \nIn 2004, the researchers established a roughly 370-acre plot in the southeastern portion of the Amazon and began testing the effects of different burn frequencies. Some sections were burned annually (a pattern reflecting human-caused wildfires) while other sections were burned every three years to mimic the natural El Nino cycle, which tends to bring drier weather to the Amazon. \nControlled fires are frequently used for land management and agricultural purposes. However, blazes can often escape into surrounding areas and burn for weeks or months at a time during the dry season. Although Brazil's deforestation rate has declined somewhat in recent years, wildfires have not. \n\"The widespread deforestation over the past 20 years in southeast Amazonia created a fragmented landscape that is much more flammable than before,\" said study co-author Paulo Brando, a scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center (WHRC) and the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM). \nWildfires burned through approximately 9.6 million acres of Amazon forest during the El Nino-driven drought year of 1997-1998, which is on par with the highest annual total ever recorded in the U.S. \n\"The rainforest is not a place that's supposed to burn like that,\" Balch said, noting that the length of the study allowed the researchers to document one of the highest tree mortality rates ever witnessed in the Amazon. \nThe study also found an unexpectedly strong correlation between the extent of the burn area and the presence of nearby leaf-cutter ant colonies. The ants remove leaf litter and other woody debris on the ground, taking away potential fuel sources for the blaze and effectively creating a network of natural fire breaks. Drought, fires impact ability of Amazon to hold carbon dioxide February 25, 2014 \nFires in the Amazon could jeopardize the forest's ability to soak up carbon dioxide emissions even as deforestation there slows down, according to a Penn State geographer. Fire and drought may push Amazonian forests beyond tipping point April 14, 2014 \nFuture simulations of climate in the Amazon suggest a longer dry season leading to more drought and fires. Woods Hole Research Center scientists Michael Coe, Paulo Brando, Marcia Macedo and colleagues have published a new ... As California wildfires burn, southern plant species are shifting northward August 10, 2015 \nAs California wildfires burn tree canopies and the forest floors they support, the plants that are replacing the understory are increasingly those found in more southern areas of the West, according to a study from the University ... 'Half a million ants march in Germany' for protection of Amazon rainforest August 18, 2015 \nHalf a million ants were enlisted at a German zoo Tuesday by ecologists from the conservation group WWF to call for the protection of the Amazon rainforest, ahead of a trip by Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel to Brazil. Peat fires in Sumatra strengthen in El Nino years August 21, 2015 \nSumatra's burning again and the El Nino event that is occurring this year is partially to blame for the proliferation of the blazes. Amazonian forests are vulnerable to repeated and coupled perturbations September 2, 2015 \nIntentional burning in tropical forests has accounted for nearly 20% of all greenhouse-gas emissions since preindustrial times and will have major implications for Earth's climate and biodiversity in years to come. To better ... Recommended for you CT scan of Earth links deep mantle plumes with volcanic hotspots September 2, 2015 \nUniversity of California, Berkeley, seismologists have produced for the first time a sharp, three-dimensional scan of Earth's interior that conclusively connects plumes of hot rock rising through the mantle with surface hotspots ... Three trillion trees: Study finds there are 7.5 times more trees than previously believed September 2, 2015 \nA new Yale-led study estimates that there are more than 3 trillion trees on Earth, about seven and a half times more than some previous estimates. But the total number of trees has plummeted by roughly 46 percent since the ... Radioactive contaminants found in coal ash September 2, 2015 \nA new Duke University-led study has revealed the presence of radioactive contaminants in coal ash from all three major U.S. coal-producing basins. Evidence that Earth's first mass extinction was caused by critters not catastrophe September 2, 2015 \nIn the popular mind, mass extinctions are associated with catastrophic events, like giant meteorite impacts and volcanic super-eruptions.
