This new custom search feature allows users to search using technology categories, technology names, and technology versions (ex: Windows 7, Windows 8). This new feature enables marketers to better define their audiences so that relevant content and messages are delivered to the right people, for game-changing campaign results. “At Social123 we fully embrace the philosophy of getting the right messages in front of the right people at the right time,” said Aaron Biddar, CEO of Social123. “With the addition of installed software intelligence, offered no where else, we can arm our customers with the data they need to get relevant messaging in front of exactly the right people, which is even easier now with this new feature.”\nThe new software search feature is available to all users and is situated in the platform with all of the other search criteria, like group affiliations, location, title, skills, and 22 other criteria for targeted searches. The installed software search can be paired with any of the other search criteria to ensure that you are targeting exactly the right people.
