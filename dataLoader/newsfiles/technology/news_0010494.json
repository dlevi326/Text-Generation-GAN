The report then analyzes the major forces driving and inhibiting the adoption of cloud services across enterprise segments in the region. The report also presents case studies that provide an in-depth view of what telcos are doing in the cloud space. It concludes with a number of key findings and a set of recommendations \nKey Findings - This report finds that enterprise cloud services in Latin America will grow more vigorously than the mobile and fixed telecom services markets. This is due mainly to the fact that enterprise telecom services have reached mature levels, unlike cloud services, which are still at the introductory stage. Enterprise cloud service revenue in Latin America will increase at a CAGR of 26.9% from 2014 to 2019, reaching $21.5bn by the end of the five-year period.- Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Peru will represent 82% of the region's total cloud enterprise revenue opportunity in 2015. Regional telcos América Móvil and Telefónica will continue to invest in these main countries to gain substantial economies of scale and revenue volumes before investing in other regional markets. - Micro-businesses and SMBs will represent 54% of the total enterprise cloud services revenue opportunity by 2019. Telcos are changing gears to develop unique channel strategies and service offerings to address the needs of a high-volume segment that accounts for approximately 99% of the total number of enterprises. \n- Leading telcos such as Telmex, Embratel, Telefónica Argentina, Vivo Brasil, Alestra and UOL Brasil have started to take the steps to address the needs of the enterprise market. Pyramid Research expects competition to intensify as local telcos launch cloud offerings and as other cloud service providers consolidate their presence in Latin America. We also expect Amazon AWS, Google and Microsoft among others to continue to invest in the region in order to compete but also to collaborate with telcos in the region. - Technology transformation is the factor that will have the greatest impact on the cloud telco journey. Pyramid Research believes that technology enablers such as carrier Ethernet deployments and NFV/SDN transformation will have the greatest impact on the demand for enterprise cloud services in the upcoming years. - Pyramid Research predicts that starting in 2015, the Latin American market will experience a shift, mainly driven by network transformation. Our expectation is that by 2019, most Latin American telcos will have achieved higher levels of maturity (Level III or IV) and will become central players in the enterprise cloud ecosystem. \nSynopsis \"'Carrier Enterprise Services in Latin America: Creating the Cloud Telco, a Telecom Insider Report by Pyramid Research.
