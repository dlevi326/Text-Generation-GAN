Peter Faricy, vice president for Amazon Marketplace, says in a statement that Amazon is \"focused on hiring in the state.\" \nAmazon says it has about 100 employees at the Detroit office with roles including software development, engineering and advertising sales. \nAs part of the announcement, Amazon is donating $10,000 and 30 Amazon Fire tablets to the Detroit Public Schools' Carver STEM Academy program. The school offers a curriculum rich in science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to indicate that the office is opening Monday, not in early 2016. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
