This year, the program was expanded to include teachers from the Garland and Lancaster independent school districts (ISDs) along with those from the Dallas , Mesquite , Plano and Richardson ISDs.\nThe awards program, now in its ninth year, honors local secondary math and science teachers who consistently demonstrate quality instruction and build student achievement in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) subjects. Each honoree receives $10,000 , of which $5,000 is directly awarded to the teacher. The other $5,000 is to be used at his or her discretion for professional development or instructional technology. The grants are awarded through the independent foundations that support each district.\nTo date, the TI Foundation has invested more than $1 million in the STEM Awards to recognize and help retain 122 excellent teachers in North Texas school districts.\n\"These teachers are true STEM champions, and we are pleased to have the opportunity to honor them,\" said Ann Pomykal , TI Foundation director of major education gifts. \"The work they do is essential to preparing future innovators, discoverers and explorers.\"\n\"A key strategy to improving student achievement in math and science is teacher effectiveness. That is why we focus our support on this area, with a special emphasis on reaching girls and minorities who are underrepresented in STEM careers,\" she said. \"As STEM-related jobs become a larger pillar of the U.S. economy, we rely on teachers like those we are honoring today to make STEM subjects interesting and accessible to all students.\"\nPrincipals nominate teachers for the STEM awards based on criteria, such as demonstrating and documenting teaching effectiveness, establishing classroom innovation, participating in education activities outside the classroom, and encouraging curiosity and increasing interest in STEM subjects among students. Teams within each district review the applications and make classroom observations. After a detailed selection process, the winners were announced.\nThe 2015 TI Foundation STEM Award recipients are:\nDallas ISD\nRobert Allison , Bryan Adams High School , teaches pre-calculus and calculus for 10 th , 11 th and 12 th grades. Mr. Allison offers a rigorous curriculum that encourages students to push themselves to a level they may not realize they can reach.\nMaya Brown , Samuell High School , teaches aquatic science to 12 th graders. Ms. Brown draws real world correlations between what they are learning and how it connects to their world.\nDee Coyle , Lang Middle School , teaches touch system data entry for 7 th and 8 th grades. Ms. Coyle integrates math and science into her computer keyboarding classes.\nFelicia Cummings , Zan Holmes Middle School , teaches 6 th grade science. Ms. Cummings encourages students to be curious and inquire about the world around them. She uses her students' data to plan lessons that challenge their thinking and problem-solving skills.\nJoseph Ibarra , Irma Rangel All Girls High School, teaches statistics, calculus and algebra II for 9 th through 12 th grades. Mr. Ibarra hopes that all his students will use math to invent something that will transform humanity in a positive way forever. He is focused on preparing his students for success in rigorous college coursework.\nTravis Smith , Trinidad Garza Early College , teaches pre-calculus and calculus for grades 11 and 12. Mr. Smith believes that even the most dejected \"I HATE MATH\" student can be successful if the math is made accessible and if the teacher is enthusiastic.\nBrandi Stennis , J.F. Kimball High School , teaches biotechnical engineering to 10 th and 11 th graders. Ms. Stennis works to tie what they are learning to something in their lives.\nGarland ISD\nCreighton Bryan taught engineering and robotics at South Garland High School.

His passion for helping students become technology leaders inspires Mr. Bushland to consistently implement innovative programs in his classroom to engage his students.\nGye Kraemer , Hudson Middle School , teaches science and robotics. Mr. Kraemer started a program to make obscure STEM concepts a hands-on reality. His afterschool robotics club quickly blossomed, leading to the creation of a highly sought after robotics class.\nLancaster ISD\nNicholas Keith , George Washington Carver 6 th grade STEM Learning Center, taught integrated STEM classes. In the coming year, he will be a blended learning STEM specialist for K-12, working with teachers and students. Mr. Keith was named \"teacher of the year\" at the campus and district levels for both elementary and secondary schools.\nMesquite ISD\nPatricia Oliver , West Mesquite High School, teaches chemistry and AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) for 10 th and 11 th grades. Ms. Oliver meets the varying needs of her students by differentiating her lessons, infusing technology and relating difficult concepts to everyday situations that students can understand. She encourages students to be free thinkers.\nKristi Hernandez , Agnew Middle School , teaches 8 th grade science and Gifted & Talented.

He administers two physics websites, authored instructional materials and developed a Physics Olympics competition.\nNona Gill , Shepton High School , teaches geometry, \"Introduction to Engineering Design\" and \"Principles of Engineering\" to the 9 th and 10 th grades. When you walk into Ms. Gill's classroom you might encounter students racing robots or creating surgical arms. Ms. Gill is passionate about encouraging students to pursue STEM related careers, making an effort to reach students who are underrepresented in these fields.\nEric McDaniels , Frankford Middle School , teaches 6 th grade math. Mr. McDaniels' students learn to be fearless in their attempts to understand mathematical concepts. He encourages constant reflection and celebrates not only among students who get the right answer but also with students who discover where they missed a step in problem solving.\nRichardson ISD\nCarrie Galvin , L.V. Berkner High School , teaches honors anatomy & physiology and biology. The 'ah-ha moment' is Ms. Galvin's favorite moment in teaching – that's when she knows her job has been done. Ms. Galvin was an early adopter of using technology for student learning.\nMark Mester , Richardson High School , teaches automotive technology to grades 9 through 12.

He implements the latest technology and incorporates problem solving skills to teach his students how to use their skills in the workforce.\nThe Innovations in STEM Teaching Awards are one of many initiatives of the TI Foundation, which has led and supported innovative education programs for decades. Education is the Foundation's primary philanthropic focus, with grants specifically enhancing STEM education and supporting effective teaching.\nInnovation and technology changes have led to demand for STEM competencies beyond traditional STEM occupations – skills necessary for innovation are scattered across a wider swath of the economy.\n\"These teachers are undoubtedly equipping students with the skills they need to take advantage of these opportunities,\" Pomykal said.\nAbout the Texas Instruments Foundation\nThe Texas Instruments Foundation, founded in 1964, is a non-profit organization providing philanthropic support for educational and charitable purposes primarily in the communities where Texas Instruments operates.
