Maine.gov was ranked as one of the top state government web portals for 2015. \nThe Center for Digital Government ( News - Alert ) is a national research and advisory institute that focuses on information technology and best practices in state and local government. Maine.gov was evaluated in a number of areas including innovation, web-based delivery of public services, efficiency and accessibility.

LePage. \"The state has been diligent in maintaining and growing its web presence. When we receive outside recognition of this hard work, it is always appreciated.\" \nThe redesigned Maine.gov portal was created to maximize the user's experience by utilizing a flat simplified layout with parallax scrolling, which allows the site to use high-quality images without the loss of speed or efficiency. Maine's standards-compliant coding also ensures that the site works well across different web browsers. \nUsing responsive design, the portal automatically adjusts for a desktop, tablet, or smartphone and features an off-canvas menu, which slides out for easy navigation. Additionally, the portal's one-stop services, convenient notification options, and excellent customer service make Maine.gov a well-rounded gateway for state resources and information. \n\"We are once again honored to receive such recognition from the Center for Digital Government,\" commented Maine's Chief Technology Officer Greg McNeal. \"Maine.gov has been a national eGovernment success story over the past 16 years. We will continue to look for creative and innovative solutions involving government interaction, while also maintaining and improving the accessibility and efficiency of the website. Maine.gov and its online services were developed to serve and support citizens and businesses alike and that will never change.\" \nMoving forward, Maine.gov will continue to be a tremendous resource for transacting government business. The site currently processes approximately 4 million transactions annually, offering over 465 unique online services and 300,000 pages of content. \nThe state's official website was redesigned at no cost to Maine taxpayers through a collaboration between Maine's eGovernment partner, Maine Information Network, LLC., a subsidiary of NIC ( News - Alert ), and the State of Maine. \nAbout Maine.gov \nMaine.gov ( http://www.Maine.gov ) is the official Web portal of the state of Maine.
