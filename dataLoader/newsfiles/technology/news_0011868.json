GPA", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "In the USA GPA means grade point average, This is the way they decide if you are bright enough to attend college or university. Having a good GPA is essential to success but we are not talking about grade point average, we are talking Goals, Plan, Action. As a person who has spent way more on motivational junk than I should have over the years I want to tell you that the one thing the people that will sell you courses and more will not tell you is that shit happens. This and my next articles will be showing you how to survive, what to look for and how not to go bust. You ask what can someone who has failed in business more times than most bring to the table. The secret is I know all the mistakes, the things to avoid and how to survive with nothing but hope and an empty fuel tank.\nI can talk to you about your SWOT analysis and I am not talking about product analysis, I am talking people analysis. I am writing this article in order to explain my failures, my wins and my situation, not to you but to me, In order for me to show you the way, I need to understand why bad things happen to good people, how to avoid those bad things and how to achieve real success.\nI have survived the depressions of the 80's, the 90's and now am planning to beat the current one by being just a little smarter and dodging the bullets instead of taking them in the back. During the writing I will publish excerpts and will be brutally honest not only with me, but with you. I saw something the other day that said that people are unable to solve their problems because they can't see them.\nA friend of mine works for a company that is bound up in red tape, inspections and more. The different departments in the company are handling adverse inspection reports in different ways. One department is pointing fingers, refusing to take responsibility, because they fail to see the problem. What they do works and the company should not be bothered by these inspections. The adverse inspection reports should open their eyes, but they are sticking steadfastly to the theory that someone else is to blame, the inspectors are knuckle heads and don't get the real world etc.\nThe other department is building a relationship with the inspectors by asking the right questions, asking how can we fix this and then fixing it. They are people that have a good GPA. They allow others to point out the errors and ask for help in fixing the errors. They then set a goal to solve the problem, create a plan and most importantly put it in action.\nService delivery is a problem in our country, not because there are no goals, or no plans it all falls down on the ACTION. If you look at all those glorious plans that the ANC has and just imagine that there was someone to actually action the plans, This country would be a better place already.\nI know everyone is concerned about the economy, Money is not flowing like it did in the 80's, people are loath to spend because an economist predicted doom and gloom on the box. I am going to help you overcome your concerns. Imagine the economy is a steam engine belching smoke and ash coming down the track. If it is running at full speed, you will get flattened if you don't get off the track. If it's only running at 80% of it's speed you will still get flattened, even at 25% of it's speed your ass is grass if you don't get out of it's way. The only difference is instead of diving off the bridge you can now take a leisurely stroll to the end of the bridge before it gets to you.\nOnly if the train is stationary are you not in danger of being run over. The economy works like that, There will be less money floating around but even at 1.4% growth the train is moving forward. You will have to work a little harder for your money, you may even have to be satisfied with a little less. If you have a GPA you can and will survive it. Do you have any other choice?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:06:00.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
