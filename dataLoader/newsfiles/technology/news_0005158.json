He asked his 4.2 million followers to toss him a question, any question, using the hash tag #AskTrump.\n#AskTrump Send me your questions to answer live from @TwitterNYC later this afternoon.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2015 Before you knew it, the Twitterverse had replied with a barrage of questions, more of them naughty than nice, more insulting than inquisitive. It didn’t take long for #AskTrump to move up Twitter’s trending topics list to the No. 1 slot. Here’s a sampling:\n@realDonaldTrump Is there a special test rich people use to diagnose autism after getting a vaccination for a horse? #AskTrump\n— Chris Needham (@CYNeedham) September 21, 2015 @realDonaldTrump @TwitterNYC why do you hate immigrants while your campaign relies on their labor #AskTrump\n— ⚇ andrik (@bruhitzandrik1) September 21, 2015 @realDonaldTrump #AskTrump Why do you think you can lead the country with as many bankruptcies as you've filed?\n— Jason Truitt (@JasonHGTruitt) September 21, 2015 Plenty of substantive questions also popped up on his feed:\n@realDonaldTrump @TwitterNYC What will the first thing you do be when you are elected as POTUS? #AskTrump\n— Dane (@symmetric78) September 21, 2015 @realDonaldTrump @TwitterNYC What makes you a better CEO than Carly Fiorina?\n— Anthony Scalzo (@TepsMTG) September 21, 2015 Trump is hardly the first well-known individual to get in trouble with an invitation to “ask me anything.” Conservative commentator Ann Coulter once left a Reddit chat with a metaphorical black eye after users called her out on her stances against same-sex marriage and women's voting rights. MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow took a similar beating when she exposed herself to conservative hardballs.\nTHE TAKEAWAY\nFor A-listers and candidates: Never ask a question you can’t answer. Double down on that advice when it comes to social media. Followers, fans and foes will take you at your word.\nAs for regular people floating such hot-potato questions as \"How does this dress look on me?\" or \"What do you think of my new haircut?\" I have only two words: Be careful.\nA few years ago, I wrote a tongue-in-cheek column about trying to look younger, naturally. Implicit was the question: How do I look? One reader posted this in response: \"Show me a man who stands up for his country or beliefs or family, not some vain, middle-aged narcissist who wants an award for shunning Botox and tanning salons!\"\nTo anyone tempted to comment cruelly online, remember what your mother undoubtedly advised you at some point: If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all. Double down on that advice when it comes to posting, since your words will live forever.\nDefinitely don’t worry about Donald Trump, though. He has clearly survived the day unscathed:\nI had a great time at @TwitterNYC #AskTrump pic.twitter.com/RfWQdDPB33\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2015 Agree or disagree with my advice? Let me know in the comments section.\nSubmit your question to Steven at stevenpetrow@earthlink.net .
