(NASDAQ: ENTG ), a leader in yield-enhancing materials and solutions for highly advanced manufacturing environments, announced today at the SEMICON ® Taiwan tradeshow the development of a platform of CMP filtration solutions using nano-melt-blown (NMB) filtration technology, as well as the expansion of its CMP research, analytical services and manufacturing capabilities in Taiwan. These investments enable the company to further serve the growing demand for advanced CMP filtration solutions. \nA photo accompanying this release is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/prs/?pkgid=35799 \n\"CMP processes continue to grow in complexity in both the materials used and the need for greater planarity in each layer of today's devices,\" said Entegris Vice-President of the Liquid Microcontamination Control business unit, Clint Haris. \"Entegris continues to invest in people, technology and facilities in Asia to introduce new solutions for the semiconductor market. As our customers produce integrated circuits with smaller feature sizes, our nano-fiber technology reduces the number of defect-causing contaminants from reaching the wafer.\" \nThe Entegris filter platform using NMB media now includes the Planargard ® bulk, Solaris ® point-of-tool and Planarcap ® point-of-dispense families to provide contamination control solutions throughout the CMP process area. Developed and manufactured in Taiwan, the NMB media utilizes the increased porosity of the nano-fibers to reduce shear stress placed upon the slurry during transport and filtration operations. These innovations result in extended filter lifetime and greater removal of defect-causing contaminants. \nFor more information, please visit http://www.bit.ly/CMPSlurryFilter \nAbout Entegris \nEntegris is a leading provider of a wide range of products for purifying, protecting and transporting critical materials used in processing and manufacturing in the semiconductor and other high-tech industries.
