Most of my company's clients operate a number of sales channels– some can have up to 8-9 channels with pan-European coverage and all these orders have to be integrated seamlessly. \nMany new entrants to the fulfilment market fail to invest in the appropriate software and their service – and the reputation of their clients – suffers as a result. \nAnd, when it comes to offering a fulfilment proposition, a company also needs to have the flexibility to adapt its processes to meet its customers' requirements as and when required. \nFor example, one of our clients – a major high street fashion accessories retailer – recently took delivery of 1.5 million products that had to be relabelled to go back in to their stores. We brought in extra staff from our other sites and completed the job within 10 days. I can think of several of the so called leading logistics firms that would still be having meetings to discuss how best to proceed after 10 days! \nOf course, the bigger logistics firms do have a significant advantage when it comes to costing solutions for shipping. After all, e-commerce is all about volume. Quite simply the more you ship the better the price you can negotiate. \nBut, while price will always be an important consideration in any fulfilment contract discussion, any online retailer must consider all aspects of the potential fulfilment partner's service proposition. \nIt goes without saying that it is frustrating to lose business to a competitor who I know does not offer the expertise that we provide because they quote a price that is 5-10% per cent cheaper. However, I also know in the first week of January we will receive three or four phone calls from companies that we have spoken to throughout the year asking us to 'rescue' them because their chosen provider has not been able to cope with the Christmas rush or lived up to any of their promises. \nMark Elward is managing director of Coventry-based DK Fulfilment Ltd.
