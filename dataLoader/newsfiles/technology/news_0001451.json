By the end of 2016, he said, everything will be AT&T.\nAT&T also plans to invest $3 billion or so to expand its high-speed mobile service to 100 million people in Mexico by the end of 2018.\n“By the end of this year we will reach 40 million people,” Arroyo said. “By the end of next year, 75 million people.”\nAT&T’s wireless move into Mexico comes amid its biggest corporate transformation yet.\nIt recently completed the acquisition of DirecTV, the satellite television distributor, which has substantial operations in Latin America as well as in the U.S.\nIn wireless, AT&T plans to create a North American mobile network that eventually reaches 400 million people in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.\nArroyo, 52, was appointed to his position in January and moved to Mexico City in February. He had been president of technology development for AT&T.\nHe said mobile broadband development in Mexico is at an early “pivot point.”\nSmartphone penetration among mobile customers there is just 30 percent, he said, compared with 80 percent in some areas of the U.S.\nOne of the reasons for the difference, Arroyo said, is that most of the broadband available in Mexico is older-generation technology. Slow mobile broadband is not as useful as 4G LTE, the latest technology, which AT&T plans to deploy.\n“The Internet in Mexico is just like the U.S.,” Arroyo said. “It’s becoming deeply embedded in everyone’s life.”\nIn a securities filing, AT&T said it had 9 million subscribers in Mexico at the end of June. For the second quarter, the company reported $491 million in revenue from its Mexican wireless operations and expenses of $654 million.\nOverall revenue at the company in the quarter was $33 billion. That number will increase substantially with the integration of DirecTV.\nArroyo said his operations in Mexico employ about 16,000 now. That number is growing, he said, but he declined to be more specific.\nHis goals for the next year include expanding network coverage and distribution and enhancing customer experiences.\n“None of this is possible without the engagement of our employees,” Arroyo said. Another of his goals is for AT&T to be considered one of the best employers in Mexico.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T14:58:02.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
