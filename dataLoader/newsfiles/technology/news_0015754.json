Enlarge Image This is one of the only bits of hard facts hidden in the new teaser for Netflix and Marvel's upcoming \"Jessica Jones.\" Video screenshot by Michael Franco/CNET \nThe new teaser trailer for Netflix's upcoming series \"Jessica Jones\" ends with the words \"It's time the world knew her name\" flashed on the screen in the broken-glass theme that pervades the promo below. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all fans are going to know by the end of the minute-long clip -- that, and the fact that the show premieres on November 20. \nThe trailer, released Thursday, is basically a music video set to Of Monster and Men's \"Thousands Eyes\" with lots of purples, oranges and broken glass atmospherically filling the screen. It can ostensibly be inferred that the opening bit, where a barrel of a liquid tips over and leads to the creation of Alias Investigations, is the backstory of Jones, who achieved superpowers when a car her father was driving smashed up against a military vehicle carrying an experimental liquid. \nBut that's pretty much the only hint viewers get of the show in this clip that really takes the word \"teaser\" seriously.

The show is actually based on Marvel's \"Alias\" comics that were written from 2001 through 2004. \nOf course, Jones keeps one foot in the superhero world, spending her time investing people with extraordinary abilities. She also dates hero-for-hire Luke Cage and eventually gets hired by Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil, which is likely how this show will fit in with Marvel's first Netflix release. \nAfter \"Daredevil\" (which premiered on April 10), \"Jessica Jones\" is the second of four shows Marvel has planned for release on Netflix. The third will be \"Luke Cage\" (naturally) and the fourth is slated to be \"Iron Fist.\" After those shows have their runs, all four characters will team up for the ensemble show \"The Defenders.\" \n\"Jessica Jones\" will feature 13 episodes, available for binge-watching at 12:01 a.m. PT on November 20.
