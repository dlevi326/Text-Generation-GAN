The update has also launched for Windows Phone, with Android to follow.\nThe update is a significant moment for Minecraft’s Pocket Edition, which reached the milestone of 30m sales in January 2015 , but has always lagged behind the versions for computers and consoles in its features.\nThe game has been improving rapidly, though, in response to its increasingly large audience: many of whom have only ever played Minecraft on a mobile device.\nRelated: Zombies, creepers and kids all flock to Minecraft’s block party\nPrevious significant updates included 0.95 in July 2014 which added infinite worlds, caves and wolves, and 0.11 in June 2015 which added a skins feature for players to customise their characters.\nMojang announced plans for the 0.12 update at its Minecon conference in July, with the addition of The Nether getting the biggest cheer from the thousands of attendees.\nThe next major improvement will be full use of the virtual redstone material to create circuits that transmit power, which Mojang promised would come in a Pocket Edition update by the end of 2015.\nThe developer, which was acquired by Microsoft for $2.5bn in 2014 , is also planning to launch its Realms service – where players pay a monthly subscription to manage their own private Minecraft servers to play on with friends – for the Pocket Edition.\nMojang is also working with developer Telltale Games on a new “narrative-driven adventure” called Minecraft: Story Mode , which is expected to debut by the end of 2015.", "external_links": ["https://mojang.com/2015/01/youve-bought-pocket-edition-many-many-times/"], "published": "2015-09-09T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:09:14.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
