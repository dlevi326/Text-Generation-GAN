The effort is intended to provide airlines more opportunities to differentiate and merchandise their unique and diverse product attributes to valuable travel agency customers and corporate travelers. Travel agents benefit from having better product content to provide their customers. Examples include relevant descriptions, photos, videos, and tours of seats, food, amenities, and lounges in search results. \n\"Routehappy Hub helps airlines differentiate and better monetize their diverse array of products in every shopping transaction in any channel, efficiently from a common platform that they manage,\" said Robert Albert, CEO at Routehappy. \"Sabre is one of the world's largest global distribution partners to airlines, with the scale and technical sophistication to make a positive measureable impact to airline revenue generation quickly with integration of relevant, standardized merchandising content.\" \nRich, targeted merchandising content in flight search results, upgrade offers, itineraries, and check-in emails will create more informed, satisfied travelers, more productive travel agents, and a more effective selling environment for airlines to promote their unique, compelling product characteristics. \n\"We're in business to help our customers succeed, and we are committed to providing airlines with the easiest and most impactful ways to differentiate their products and reach customers in all of our channels,\" said Shelly Terry, Vice President, Travel Products, Sabre Travel Network. \"Our relationship with Routehappy is a great example of our interest in working with innovators that help us deliver unique value to our customers.\" \nWith Routehappy Hub, airlines efficiently manage their product content from a common platform in a content standard called Universal Product Attributes (UPAs).
