Samsung is testing it with Snapdragon 820 and 620 chipsets. RELATED NEW DELHI: After Apple debuted its new 3D Touch display technology with the new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, all eyes are on Samsung to introduce a game-changing technology that will lure buyers away from its arch rival. While the dual curved screens of Galaxy S6 created waves, Samsung may have another ace up its sleeve -- foldable touchscreens. In March, a Samsung Display official had said that smartphones with foldable touchscreens would be commercially possible in 2016. The company seems to have been taking the project forward since then. A new report by a blogger on Chinese social network Weibo has dished out a few details related to Samsung's upcoming foldable touchscreen smartphone. According to the report, the smartphone is being developed under the name Project Valley or Project V and will be ready for production by January next year. This timeline suggests that the South Korean giant may unveil the world's first foldable touchscreen smartphone at Mobile World Congress in March or possibly a few weeks before the tech event, as it did with Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ in August. On the hardware part, it is likely that the display will be flexible OLED, as no manufacturer has been able to achieve foldable LED displays yet. The report also says that Samsung is testing the phone with two chipsets: Snapdragon 820 and Snapdragon 620. It is not yet clear whether this phone will be released in just one variant or two.

Samsung did not use Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors in its top-end smartphones this year, instead relying on its own Exynos chipset range to power Galaxy S6, S6 edge, S6 edge+ and Note 5. A foldable touchscreen smartphone would be a great selling point, but it is not yet known what unique features this type of form-factor would entail. Moreover, getting Google Play Store developers to create apps for the foldable design may prove to be a challenge, though Samsung can deliver those through its own Apps platform, like it currently does for the Edge series phones.
