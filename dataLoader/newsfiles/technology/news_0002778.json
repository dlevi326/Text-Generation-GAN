Copiers are expensive and the process of choosing the right copier is time consuming. Most companies want to purchase a copier that they can use for many years. In addition to weighing different brands and models, you must also decide whether you would like to purchase or lease a new copier or purchase a refurbished, remanufactured, or used copier. Long Island Copiers has noticed a trend in more companies investing in refurbished copier machines recently.\nLong Island Copiers knows that making a few small changes in the way you conduct your everyday business can make a huge impact and help you to save money. When upgrading your copier, there are many factors to consider. A refurbished copier may be just what your company needs. Refurbished copiers are typically sold 50-75 percent below MSRP. That means on a $50,000 copier you could potentially save from $25,000 - $35,000 on a slightly used copier that is capable of all the same functions. Because you can buy a refurbished copy machine at such discounted prices, you or your company will be able to afford a much better, top name brand copier than you might be able to buy otherwise.\nRefurbished equipment from a reliable dealer will be in “like new” condition. Some start up organizations need a new and larger machine, but do not have the funds right now for a new machine. Some businesses purchase refurbished as a “green” choice which keeps a perfectly good machine from being placed in a landfill before its true end of life. Reliable dealers will also have a warranty on refurbished devices.
