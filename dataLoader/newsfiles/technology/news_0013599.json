These include the title track, a J. Cole collaboration called \"No Sleeep,\" and now, \"BURNITUP!,\" a dance floor-filler featuring Missy Elliott. The track has already been played during Jackson's ongoing world tour, and made its radio debut on BBC Radio 1 last night, with Jackson tweeting out a link to the song earlier today. Both artists have been relatively absent from the music world for a while now (not counting Missy's appearance at the Super Bowl halftime show for \"Get Ur Freak On\"), and this track shows why it's good to have them back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:05:22.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
