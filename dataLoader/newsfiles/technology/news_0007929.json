(Prakash Singh/AFP/Getty Images) SAN JOSE -- He has more Twitter followers than Kanye or Beyonce, and more Facebook fans than any politician except for Barack Obama. He dabbles in Pinterest, Tumblr, Flickr and LinkedIn. Oh, and he won the world's biggest democratic election last year. \nSo it's no surprise that tech giants Google and Facebook, carmaker Tesla and thousands of Indian-Americans plan to lay down the silicon carpet for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he tours the Bay Area this month. His economic development message will be greeted with adulation in many corners, skepticism or protest in others, but no one disputes that the visit is historic. \nModi will be the first Indian head of state to land in the Bay Area since the 1970s and the most highly anticipated since Jawaharlal Nehru, the anti-colonial hero and first prime minister, addressed an overflow crowd at UC Berkeley's Greek Theatre in 1949. \n\"It's symbolic that there is finally a government in India that understands technology and innovation are critical to India,\" said Venktesh Shukla, a venture capitalist helping to organize Modi's community reception. \nMore than 45,000 people sought to get free tickets to an 18,500-capacity event where Modi will speak on Sept. 27 at the SAP Center in San Jose, said Rakhi Israni of the Indo American Community of West Coast, a group newly formed to host the celebration sponsored by dozens of local Indian-American organizations.

Other meetings with tech executives are also expected. \nThe visit allows Modi to build relationships with tech firms that want to invest in India, while also fostering support from the Bay Area's influential Indian-American community and startup founders who want to see reform of India's complicated business regulations, said Shukla, who is president of the Silicon Valley branch of nonprofit organization TiE, also known as The Indus Entrepreneurs. \nNearly 270,000 Bay Area residents identified themselves as Indian in the U.S. Census, and about 180,000 were born in India. \n\"From taxi drivers and farmers to professionals and CEOs of large companies, the excitement being felt in the Silicon Valley is unprecedented,\" says a statement from the Indo American Community of West Coast. \nBut as welcome plans are forming, so are the protests. New York-based Sikhs for Justice promised this week that thousands of Bay Area Sikhs will protest outside the San Jose celebration to \"oppose Modi's nationalist agenda,\" which they believe excludes religious minorities in the Hindu-majority nation. \nAcademics at Stanford, Santa Clara University, UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz and schools around the country have also called for more debate about Modi's leadership and legacy when he visits the region. More than 130 professors recently penned an open letter raising privacy concerns about his new \"Digital India\" initiative and questioning alleged government harassment of activists and meddling in academic institutions. \nThe letter \"responds to a rather uncritical adulation of Modi as a new savior of India,\" said Thomas Blom Hansen, a Stanford anthropology professor who has studied the rise of Hindu nationalism and Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, known as the BJP. \n\"We feel there is an anti-democratic streak in this wider movement,\" he said. \"The government is pushing to shut down dissent and go after its opponents in ways that are rather disturbing.\" \nAfter the letter was met with fierce online criticism and derogatory comments, the professors wrote a follow-up note this month clarifying their intentions. \n\"Everyone signed the letter for slightly different reasons,\" said Priya Satia, a history professor at Stanford. \"For me, the point was to provoke some kind of productive, constructive debate about Prime Minister Modi and his visit and the purposes of his visit. Before this came out, there was just uncritical fanfare.\" \nShe saw the letter as a \"general encouragement of Indians who live in Silicon Valley to ask questions about the whole range of Modi's record, be it Digital India or the violence in Gujarat,\" the state where Modi was chief minister for more than a decade before he became prime minister last year. Anti-Muslim riots in the state led the Bush administration to ban Modi from entering the United States in 2005. \nModi's Bay Area visit is the first by an Indian head of state since Prime Minister Morarji Desai picked up an award at UC Berkeley in 1978. And Modi's tour will be the first in California since Nehru's daughter, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, visited Los Angeles in 1982. \nModi was greeted like a rock star by Indian-Americans at New York's Madison Square Garden last year and has plans for an even bigger event in London this fall. \nHis message of technological and economic growth and pledges to clean up the country's streets and root out corruption have helped expand his movement's support beyond its North Indian stronghold and also appealed to tech engineers and elites, Hansen said. That might come in handy as India moves toward a system that could allow Indian citizens living abroad to vote in Indian elections. \n\"It's very smart politics,\" said Hansen. \"He's a very smart politician; there's no doubt about that.\" Contact Matt O'Brien at 408-920-5011.
