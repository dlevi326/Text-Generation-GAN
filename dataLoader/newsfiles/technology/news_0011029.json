Kiev, Ukraine - September 22, 2015 - ( Newswire.com ) \nAs fantastic as it may sound the actual thing really works. \nAll that needs to be done is to create a message using Minute of Life media editor and choose the message to be sent via Augmented Reality option. In the Minute of Life marker store choose a category called Money, pick a dollar bill and it is done. \nThe recipient will get an email with QR code and will need to install Minute of Life App to be able to scan the QR code. Then all that is needed is the dollar bill from a wallet. \nTo try how it works – please download Minute of Life App from Google play or App Store , scan this QR code with the App and find a 20 dollar bill to watch the message by pointing smartphone’s camera at the bill just after scanning QR. \nThe QR-code you can find in attachment to this article. If for any reason the QR code is not scanned from here please visit thedollarmessage .com \nMinute of Life is a service that offers users to create meaningful messages and send them in two options. \n1. Regular Time Message where a customer chooses a date and time for a recipient to be able to watch the message. \n2. Augmented Message where a customer chooses a certain marker (image) for the message to be hidden in and then displayed via mobile app . \nEffectively everyone can have same marker – like a 20 dollar bill – but all different personal messages on it. \nThe Dollar Message Campaign is exceptionally fun and entertaining promo campaign for the public to enjoy Augmented reality messaging and see its functionality. The dollar markers are free to use in Minute of Life marker store. The images of the dollar bills in the Minute of Life store are not genuine US dollar images.
