The founders never dreamed that the television show they created would reach children in 150 countries, some with their very own locally produced Sesame Street,\" said Steve Youngwood, COO, Sesame Workshop , the non-profit educational organisation behind Sesame Street. \n\"Through the tireless work of Bidaya Media, ABEGS, JPPI, twofour54 and our wonderful partners on the ground, we are producing and delivering content that promotes the heritage, language and culture of the region, and helping kids grow smarter, stronger and kinder.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T10:00:33.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
