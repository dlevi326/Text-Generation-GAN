The informatics challenges in this area are immense, as standard current practice is to manually transcribe or, at best, copy-and-paste analysis results into a manuscript. Despite recent advances in automating neuroimaging meta-analysis, the enterprise is hobbled by a lack of standards and methods to keep track of results provenance. \nUsing your knowledge of matlab, R, and unix, you will support the research activity across the board, gaining a valuable insight into the workings and outputs expected from a major funded research project. We are particularly keen to hear from applicants with some experience with neuroimaging data and the Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM). \nYou will have an Honours degree in a relevant subject such as Mathematic or Statistics and demonstrate a flexible approach to supporting research requirements.
