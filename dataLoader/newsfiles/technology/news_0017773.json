The Huawei watch, powered by Android Wear™, enables you to stay connected wherever you are, with instant alerts for calls, texts, instant messages and emails. With Bluetooth connectivity for wireless headphone usage, coupled with offline music download support, staying active is made even easier. Music can be started via voice commands, with users able to search for destinations and navigate their way there using the same voice actions. Locating missing phones has never been easier than with the watch’s “find my phone” function.\nAnd now, thanks to the latest version of Google ’s Android Wear™, both Android and iOS users will be able to connect to the Huawei Watch.\nA classic design aesthetic\nThe Huawei watch measures 42mm in diameter, which is the traditional dimension for wristwatches. The watch face is unique in design with its fully circular face and crown located at the two o’clock position.\nThere are a range of rose gold, stainless steel and black frames to choose from, as well as a variety of bespoke watch face designs, across a range of classic, luxury, business, feminine, modern and simple aesthetics.\nThe choice of straps includes stainless steel mesh, stainless steel links, rose gold, and black-plated stainless steel links, and brown and black leather. Easy to change, they will fit any watch strap with 18mm width lug interface.\nClassically crafted\nCrafted using sophisticated materials, the watch features a fully circular 1.4-inch touch-sensitive AMOLED display, coated in scratch-proof sapphire crystal (the favoured choice amongst Swiss watch manufacturers), a cold-forged stainless steel frame, and comes with a built-in heart rate monitor and 6-Axis motion sensors. It has a 400 x 400 pixels resolution in 286 ppi at a 10,000:1 high contrast ratio, making it the most vibrant Android Wear smart watch to date.\nIn keeping with the classic, premium design aesthetic of the watch, Huawei Consumer BG has partnered with the world’s most famous fashion photographer Mario Testino to produce an advertising campaign featuring American supermodel Karlie Kloss and one of the world’s top male models, Sean O’Pry.\nA new era of sporting technology\nThe Huawei watch includes a heart rate monitor sensor (PPG sensor), which can accurately measure heart rates. The sensor protrudes slightly for better skin contact and greater accuracy.\nThe 6-Axis motion sensor, with a gyroscope and accelerometer, helps to track your activities anywhere, any time, and can distinguish between different physical activities, including walking, running and climbing.\nMr. Benjamin Norton, Wearable Design Expert at the Huawei Consumer BG, said: “Today, consumers are rarely content with just staying connected; they are looking for a premium smartwatch that is technologically innovative. When designing this watch, we were keen to combine the best in technology and innovation with premium materials and a classic look and feel. With the sapphire crystal and circular watch face, we feel that the Huawei watch has achieved this.”\nMr. Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei Consumer BG, said: “Huawei is dedicated to continually innovating and creating new products to suit our consumers’ needs. This first smartwatch in our wearables family has been designed following extensive research and demonstrated consumer demand for smart wrist wear. The Huawei watch is unique within the market with its premium look and feel and classic design, combined with superior smart technology, which allows users to stay connected on the go.
