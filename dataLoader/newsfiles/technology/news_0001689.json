Source: AAP\nThe entry of Netflix into Australia this year has been a wake-up call for the local telecommunications and media sector in more ways than one.\nThe so-called Netflix effect has not only managed to highlight the burgeoning appetite of Australian consumers for on-demand video services, but illuminated the gaps in the existing prediction models used to manage bandwidth.\nThe primacy of data in today’s telco environment is well understood, but that hasn’t always translated to robust bandwidth and traffic management as the ­nation’s fixed-line networks are put under increasing stress.\nOne reason for the discrepancy, according to VTX Holdings’ Cameron Worth, is that while we have a pretty good idea of how to store the data, the problem lies in moving large chunks of data ­efficiently across a network. “It’s not just that the volume of video data has increased, it’s more that the demand to move large amount of it has increased,” says Worth, who is a technical and commercial adviser to VTX.\n“We have known for a while that we need to keep increasing our storage ability, but now we have hit this point where it really matters how quickly we can move the data.”\nASX-listed VTX is in the process of being taken over by New Zealand-based software technology company NexGen, which is in the business of optimising data flow on existing hardware.\nHistorically, managing cap­acity constraints has relied on a continued uptick in hardware capabilities, with every advance taking some pressure off the network. The advent of on-demand streaming has added a new dimension to this and Worth says network operators worldwide have been blindsided by the trend.\n“We have seen a perfect storm develop around streaming technology. We have everyone spruiking their devices or services that support 4K video but the missing link has been how do we get the data from the original source to your 4K screen,” Worth says.\nAs the ecosystem of bandwidth-intensive applications develops further, it raises the question of whether the current mix-technology National Broadband Network will be robust enough to cope with the demands. According to Worth, even a full-fibre NBN might not solve the problem entirely.\n“Fibre is currently the best technology we have access to move data between two points and fibre-to-the-home or as close to the home as possible delivers the best potential bandwidth to the end user,” he says.\n“But that’s only the bandwidth within Australia or between two nodes on the NBN and doesn’t address the issue of moving data between countries.\n“Bandwidth is a cumulative thing. If you have one 4K TV you need 25Mbps to stream to it but once you have two you need 50Mbps.\n“It’s the cumulative load that’s of interest and there’s no magic technology that will conjure up more speed.”\nThe current limitations mean that network operators and consumers need to make the most of the existing infrastructure and technologies.\nCompression is one technology that helps alleviate the crunch and outfits such as NexGen are working on solutions that slice and dice the data packets on the cloud and also optimise the delivery of it from the server to the device. The end result is an offering that cuts data consumption costs.\nRecent trials of NexGen’s technology has seen it reduce Netflix data usage by up to 53 per cent and Instagram data usage by up to 57 per cent.\nIf the results are anything to go by, NexGen could not have picked its time better and the impact of the Netflix effect on the network could potentially lead to a hefty windfall for NexGen.\n“The crazy thing is that we started our discussions before Netflix came to Australia and to be honest we were pretty sceptical,” Worth says.\nThis article was first published in The Australian.", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/28/1227547/964757-8625d254-65cc-11e5-ae2c-91350e74fa5b.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-29T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:33:20.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
