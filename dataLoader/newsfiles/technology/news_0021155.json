ADVERTISEMENT \"Email has proven to be the number one channel,” Cohen says.\nCohen, the chief marketing officer for Fluent, a company specializing in email acquisitions, says technology allowing campaigns to identify “custom audiences” is opening a new avenue for campaigns to target specific segments of the population. A campaign can simply upload the email addresses they’ve collected and share them with advertisement networks, which then use Facebook to identify certain people to send a campaign ad based on their profile. \nUnlike his competition, leading Republican candidate Donald Trump doesn’t have an email address list, a move Cohen advises against. \nTo hear Cohen's advice to Trump, and more details on how many emails Clinton and Bush have gathered, keep watching the video above.
