Today, there are $4 trillion in annual transactions, with the largest portion being the $1.3 trillion in credit card payments, Holland said. At the other end of the spectrum is the $3.1 billion in mobile payments, with the leader in this area being Starbucks. \nMobile is the conduit between online and offline space, Holland added. So mobile payments will progress rapidly over the next few years, reaching $53.1 billion in 2019. \n“What really needs fixing is the checkout, which I refer to as yard sale technology,” Holland added. He described the example of a customer using a self-checkout lane with a cart full of goods and more than a handful of coupons, defeating the purpose of the “fast,” self-service checkout line. \nIn that instance, many customers went to the staffed checkout lines, because self-checkout was no longer simpler or quicker. Similarly, consumers won’t shift to mobile payments until it is simpler and quicker than traditional payments, Holland added. Even when mobile advances in efficiency, people still won’t pay additional fees in order to make mobile payments.
