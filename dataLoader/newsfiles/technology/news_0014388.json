The agreement was signed in London, last week on September 10th.\nQualis Hospitality will mainly work in the affiliation of new member hotels to HotelREZ, and its GDS connectivity service, with a competitive model based on cost per acquisition, and by waiving most of the fixed costs that similar services require.\nAt the same time, both companies will work together on promotional activities, both on and offline, aimed at several key international markets, and by offering a range of comprehensive services at a competitive price point.\nNúria Galià and Ildefonso Moyano, Managing Partners at Qualis Hospitality, welcomed the agreement and acknowledged its strategic meaning for the company’s growth:\n“The agreement with HotelREZ allows us to complement our current hospitality services with a very competitive GDS connectivity product. At the same time it will allow Qualis Hospitality to further increase its presence in the South American market.”\nMeanwhile, HotelREZ is also confident the partnership will enlarge its own hotel portfolio, in two key markets:\n“We have found in Qualis Hospitality, a partner with considerable experience and local knowledge, which will allow us to get to hotels in both Spain and South America. They know our products well and understand that GDS distribution represents a rather substantial volume of sales for hotels”, says Daniel Simmons, Executive Director at HotelREZ Hotels & Resorts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:28:51.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
