It features a nearly 13-inch, diagonal screen and is designed to appeal to corporate customers and government agencies. \nSince releasing its original iPad, Apple has confined the screen size to 10 inches and focused on selling the tablet to consumers. A slump in iPad sales prompted Apple to look for ways to expand the potential market. \nThe redesigned Apple TV box relies on a system that revolves around apps and voice controls. Its price will start at $150, more expensive than competing devices.
