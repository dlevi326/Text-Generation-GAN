The PC industry as a whole has been shrinking, thanks to the popularity of smartphones and tablets. Yet Apple has been expanding sales of Macs. Apple’s shipments climbed 16 percent in the second quarter, making it the fourth-largest global PC vendor, according to IDC.\nThe name El Capitan comes from an imposing 3,000-foot tall granite rock formation in Yosemite, which is the code name for the current version of OS X. The new version is mainly a bunch of small visual enhancements on top of some basic rewiring of the software that will make it easier to create rich, detailed graphics.\n“El Capitan refines the Mac experience and improves performance in a lot of little ways that make a very big difference,” Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, said in the statement.", "external_links": ["http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25742015\\", "https://www.apple.com/osx/elcapitan-preview/\\"], "published": "2015-09-29T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T19:28:55.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
