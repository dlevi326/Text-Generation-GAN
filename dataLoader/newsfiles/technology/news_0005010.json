This exclusive live coding stream will be hosted by Y Combinator backed startup LiveCoding.TV. \nWolfram's live stream can be accessed at www.livecoding.tv/christopherwolfram/ Sep. 22, starting at 8 p.m. EDT. \nChristopher Wolfram is the second oldest of Stephen Wolfram's four children. Though only 16 years old, Christopher's aptitude for programming is bolstered by seven years experience. Like his father, Christopher has given many public demonstrations of the Wolfram Language. Notably, he programmed a quadricopter drone in front of a live audience, at only age 13 (Maker Faire in New York; https://youtu.be/eoXADAE67ig ). \n\"One of the things I've always liked about programming is that there are few limitations on what you can build. With something like, say, carpentry, you are limited by all sorts of practical issues,\" said Christopher. \"I really started programming seriously when I started having ideas for software-related projects.\" \nTune in to livecoding.tv/christopherwolfram to see Christopher Wolfram demonstrate a sample of his projects during his Sept. 22 broadcast. \nLiveCoding.tv, dubbed \"Twitch.tv for coders\" by TechCrunch, is an educational Y Combinator - backed startup that allows developers to stream live video of themselves creating apps, writing games, and debugging code. Earlier this year, Stephen Wolfram personally tested the platform with a demonstration of the power of the Wolfram Language. His demo has been the most successful Livecoding.tv video to date, with 60,000+ views. \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/live-coding-with-stephen-wolframs-son-300143464.html \nSOURCE Wolfram Research", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:25:24.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
