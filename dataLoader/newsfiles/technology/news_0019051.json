Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDNS ) today announced that Chris Rowen , CTO of the IP Group at Cadence, and Himanshu Sanghavi , Group Director of the Tensilica R&D team at Cadence, are scheduled to present on vision processing technology at the Linley Processor Conference on October 6-7, 2015 , at the Hyatt Regency in Santa Clara, CA. WHAT: Chris Rowen is scheduled to present, \"Instruction Set Innovation in Fourth-Generation Vision DSPs.\" In this presentation, he plans to unveil the architecture for Cadence's fourth generation of vision DSPs. Based on work done with customers and Cadence's own extensive research, the presentation will describe instruction-set improvements in arithmetic operation parallelism and functionality, memory system throughput and VLIW encoding. Himanshu Sanghavi plans to present, \"Baby You Can Drive My Car: Vision-Based SoC Architectures.\" To deliver breakthrough performance, advanced vision DSP cores require complete solutions. This talk outlines innovations in multi-core clusters, DMA channels, memory hierarchies, and image stream interfaces, as well as in vision libraries, parallel programming environments, development systems and performance modeling techniques. It details the effect of this rich hardware and software solution on real-world applications including enhanced object detection, tracking, and recognition methods. ADAS will be used to illustrate the integration of vision, radar and sensor-fusion subsystems into a complete hardware/software platform design.
