The audit also alleges that the Connector misused federal grant money intended for system development, not the operation and maintenance of its system. Mansha Consulting , which has offices in Chantilly, Virginia, and Honolulu, was the Connector’s second-highest paid contractor, with a total of $21.6 million awarded for the management and oversight of IT system integration of the Connector and the state Medicaid health insurance enrollment system. The Connector has paid $15.3 million to Mansha under two contracts that expired August 2014, but would not pay for services “rendered and invoiced from July 1, 2014 through Dec. 5, 2014, when Mansha withdrew its team from the Connector project,” according to the report. Mansha has claimed it is still owed money by the Connector, but Connector officials say nothing else is due. The audit alleges that under the leadership of a former director, the contract was awarded based on “personal recommendation” and failed to justify the award or determine precise fees for services. The Connector's first executive director, Coral Andrews , stepped down in November 2013. In a separate audit in January, the auditor found that Andrews “withheld information” from the board. The audit released Tuesday found she approved a $168,000 contract amendment without consulting the Connector’s board. According to the latest audit, 16 workers were given a five-month job initially slated for one year and 20 people. The contract was never amended to make up the difference, and was ultimately over obligated by approximately $8.2 million. An additional $3.4 million in federal grant funding was channeled to “questionable” costs, outside of the grant’s requirement. Hawaii Health Connector Executive Director Jeff Kissel called the auditor’s report a “sumptuous elaboration of the obvious.” “We reported all of the numbers to the public not only to our board meetings bur also in testimony for the Legislature,” he told PBN. “I have no idea what the basis is for the $11 million — it doesn’t tie to anything that have been in our records and our records have been audited by our auditors. “ The Health Connector also took issue with the audit’s notion that Hawaii taxpayers would have to pay for any costs connected to any future federal government investigation. “Our statute is very clear that the state is not liable for any expenses by the Connector,” he said. “We’re a separate corporation by the law itself that established us.” Acting State Auditor Jan Yamane told PBN this follow-up stemmed from the need for more information regarding Mansha that was not provided by the Connector for the audit one year ago. “The Connector is correct when they say they are not a state agency and that the state will not assume its obligations if there are any at the end of the day, but our comment comes from the whole notion that the Connector has always looked to the state for funding,” she said. “If the state is not responsible then I think the question becomes, who is going to pay? They have no other revenue source.” State plans to infuse the Connector with $3.3 million to extend its life through October 2016 were revealed Friday. The federal government has also agreed to pitch in $2.8 million to maintain funding for the Connector’s partnering nonprofit organizations that do outreach work in the community. Earlier this year, the Legislature appropriated $2 million to fund its operations — a fraction of the $10 million initially requested to continue operations this fall. A remaining $70 million of a $204 million federal grant was frozen by the federal government in January after the Connector could not prove financial sustainability, as required by all exchanges under the Affordable Care Act by 2015. \nGet Honolulu  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:07:13.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
