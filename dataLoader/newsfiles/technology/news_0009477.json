Case studies or real-life stories from customers provide a unique perspective and can have a large impact on target audiences. Relatability. Craft stories that have the power to amaze, inspire and spark emotions from readers. Lazuka suggests utilizing buyer personas to create relatable characters that are experiencing similar problems that current customers are facing. Fiction flair. Read fiction to understand the importance of style and learn what makes a great story. Grip readers with fiction-writing elements such as: word selection, structure, personality and tone of voice.
