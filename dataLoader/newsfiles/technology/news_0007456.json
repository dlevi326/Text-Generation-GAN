It typically peaks in September. \nOnly two of those storms have reached hurricane strength, but to date the most destructive has been tropical storm Erika, which left at least 31 dead and two dozen missing after striking the tiny Caribbean island of Dominica last month. \nThe National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted that the current season will be less active than usual, with at most four hurricanes. .
