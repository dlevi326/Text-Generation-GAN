We can see how they keep on coming to us with value for money smartphones that are of comparable quality with the big boys. They have also been busy producing in large volumes too, as to keep up with the growing demands of the market. \nOn display here is the Mi 4c that is a variant of their phone which has been out for more than a year ago. At least they didn’t come out with lots of models in a short period, as to confuse and dilute the market. The kind of space which they allowed themselves in between each release is just right. \nIt will be sporting a 5-inch Full HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~441 ppi pixel density. In partnership with AUO/Sharp, it will be offering a screen with advanced Panel Self Refresh (PSR) technology, lower power consumption, up to 450nit brightness, and a 95% reduction in reflection thank a full GFF lamination. As added protection, there’s the Corning scratch-resistant glass that will come in handy sooner or later. \nWith a body measurement of 138.1 x 69.6 x 7.8 mm (5.44 x 2.74 x 0.31 in) and weighs 130 g (4.59 oz), it certainly has that slim and lightweight profile. \nThe best thing about the Mi 4c is what you can find under the hood of it. There’s the Qualcomm MSM8992 Snapdragon 808 chipset paired with an Octa-core processor comprising Quad-core 1.44 GHz Cortex-A53 & dual-core 1.82 GHz Cortex-A57, Adreno 418 and 2GB RAM. This makes for a very powerful device, the only thing missing is 1GB or 2GB of additional memory to make it more solid. - Advertisement - \nCamera-wise, there’s the same 13MP-5MP combination that still makes for a potent combination and can capture the moments in high detail. Taking photos is fast and blur, and a dual-tone LED flash creates the perfect balance of light for night shots. Even the faster action can be tamed with a zero lag 30 fps burst mode. \nPerhaps the only downside for the Mi 4c is its rather limited 16GB storage that does not come with a microSD slot. Yes, there were rumors of a 32GB version, but if you were to live with just 16GB; that’s a serious drawback. Imagine most of the popular apps and games already eating up quite some space, and you would be left with very little to live with. This would mean that you have to perform house-cleaning now and then or you will be running low on space in no time at all. You can also turn to cloud storage to help overcome this issue. \nIn terms of software, it will be having the latest Android Lollipop 5.1.1 and comes with MIUI 7 that offers amazing performance and customization options. \nAs for the battery, it is good to know that it will be equipped with a non-removable Li-Ion 3120 mAh battery. No problem to power it for a day or two. \nFinally, the Mi 4c has dual sim capability and 4G LTE, which enables you to get the best out of the smartphone. - Advertisement - \nXiaomi have done it again with the latest Mi 4c. Amazing hardware all around and for that kind of money makes it an instant winner. Just hope they have enough supplies to be able to cope with the crazy demand. \nThe Xiaomi Mi 4c is expected to be released in the next couple of weeks and will be available for approximately $199 USD. It will be available in Black and White. There’s also a rumored 32GB model that should be surfacing anytime soon after the initial release.
