The 37-year-old maintains he’s always been “quite passionate about not being on it”.\n“I think if you’re not careful, it can infect your work,” he told news.com.au. “If I were to go on air and in the back of my mind is something churning about what Twitter is going to say then all I will do is betray my job, basically.\nOther Stories Model’s blackmail attempt backfires Sport Re-live: Pocock pilots Wallabies win Rugby 0 comments Crowd erupts as Salim re-elected Nsw Mum died shielding baby from blast Nsw Stepfather charged over murder of girl, 12 Nsw Hooked on monsters of the sea Nsw 0 comments “So I won’t ask the question that needs to be asked because I’m too worried that someone will get upset about it ... and I think what can end up happening is you end up being swayed into what might be a popular position, whereas if you don’t actually know what is popular then you can just be honest about it.”\nThe Walkley Award-winning broadcaster, author and academic said coming from the ABC, where there are “a lot of pressures on you to approach issues in a fairly kind of methodical way and not be opinionated about things,” led to his attitude towards social media.\nAs a frequent commentator on politics, international affairs and Islam, Aly often sparks fiery debate on the panel and divides viewers watching at home.\nLast month, he and conservative broadcaster Steve Price traded barbs while discussing the Federal Government’s plans to stop green groups “sabotaging” the mining industry.\nSimilarly, many were shocked at the strong direction taken by Aly during his interview with former terror suspect Zaky Mallah earlier this year.\nBut the co-host argues that those tuning into the popular current affairs show often “misread” what he is trying to do.\n“I think people think that I really want to change the world, and I don’t — and I’ve said this for years — when I offer a view on something, I’m actually not particularly worried about whether or not you end up agreeing with it. I’m not trying to change your opinion particularly.”\nAly said he’s never allowed himself to get sucked in by the fact that he’s in media and simply “do the job”.\n“I’m just offering an opinion and you can take it and disagree with it, or whatever,” the presenter said, adding that he has never set out to provoke or be deliberately controversial.\n“I try to analyse things, and usually when I’m trying to analyse something it’s because I’m trying to figure out what I think about something, so I find it strange when someone describes me as controversial.”\nWaleed Aly, Carrie Bickmore, Peter Helliar from The Project. While many might find it strange that such a huge presence in the Australian media landscape can operate without actually being on social media, Aly argues he operates with the knowledge that if something breaks on Twitter that he really needs to know about, “someone will tell me about it”.\nHe’s also diligent when it comes to responding to viewers via email.\nBy contrast, Carrie Bickmore is heavily active on social media and often interacts with her followers. But her online presence isn’t without concern.\n“My greatest fear with social media, I understand the benefits and all of that, but my concern is that it’s going to eliminate any real discussion because what happens is that every little thing becomes fever pitch,” the 34-year-old Gold Logie winner told news.com.au.\n“There is always that filter now, even if you want to say something that’s just slightly pushing it a bit to open the conversation for people at home and at the desk, all of a sudden you’re the poster person for a comment you just made when you are just trying to have a real conversation.”\nBickmore argued that, with just 9 per cent of the Australian population on Twitter, it’s hardly an indication of popular opinion, and yet, as social network users we are all guilty of getting carried away with what gets posted online.\n“I think that’s the danger with social media, we almost all need to take a chill pill ... so that a real conversation can happen.”\nOf her newest Project co-host, Bickmore was perplexed that viewers often referred to him as “controversial”.\n“Waleed is certainly not scared to have an opinion, but most people who come on the show aren’t scared to have an opinion,” she argued.\n“With any new person, the dynamics change but maybe Waleed challenges Pete and I in ways we haven’t been challenged before and makes us think about things differently.”\nThe Project airs weeknights, 6.30pm on Network Ten.\nThe Project crew with guests Hugh Jackman and Todd Sampson.
