Another was found hidden under the back seat.\nThe man under the bonnet was treated for oxygen deprivation after potentially hours of inhaling noxious car fumes.\nTwo Moroccan nationals, travelling in the car by conventional means, were detained.\nThe men were seeking entry to Ceuta - now heavily defended - a Spanish enclave at the very tip of North Africa's coast, used often as a stepping stone for illegal migration to the Spanish mainland.\nLike many who have suffered injury or worse in recent weeks, the Guinean men were seeking entry into an EU member country.\nThe world was shocked last week by the sight of an abandoned van on the Austrian-Hungarian border. It contained the bodies of 71 migrants who had died days earlier in a vain attempt to reach the west.\n To less publicity, about 200 asylum seekers were found off the Libyan coast last week.\n\"Some 2500 refugees and migrants are estimated to have died or gone missing this year, trying to reach Europe,\" UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said in a statement last week.\nAuthorities in Greece last month tear-gassed migrants on its border with Macedonia.\nAbout 300,000 people have tried to enter Greece and Italy this year via a dangerous route across the Mediterranean, according to the UNHCR.\nTrafficking into the EU is thought to generate far more than $3 billion a year in income for people smugglers, estimates by the UN have found.\nBy contrast, 20,000 asylum seekers are estimated to have attempted entry to Australia in 2013.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:46:39.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
