The move comes on the heels of data released by IAB Europe , which found that the European mobile programmatic ad market jumped 70.5 percent in 2014. As the market appetite for mobile advertising booms, Adelphic will bring its platform into Europe, extending its patented audience building technology and enhanced programmatic buying capabilities to this region. \nTo lead this endeavor, Adelphic has hired Nicholas Mills as General Manager, EMEA. Prior to joining Adelphic, Mills was EMEA Head of Sales for Atlas, Facebook’s buy-side advertising technology stack. In addition to running European operations and joining the company’s executive team, Mills will build a regional sales and service team to support clients and campaigns in Europe. \n“The efficiency and transparency of programmatic advertising and DSPs are redefining how marketers invest their advertising budgets,” said Nicholas Mills, General Manager, EMEA. “I’m thrilled to join the first-in-class mobile DSP and help a top-notch executive team grow Adelphic’s global footprint, delivering high-performing mobile campaigns to new audiences.” \n“Programmatic ad spending across Europe’s major markets is surging, and now couldn’t be a more opportune time to expand Adelphic’s business operations overseas,” said Michael Collins, CEO, Adelphic. “With the strong support we are already receiving from our global clients in Europe, and with an executive of Nick’s caliber joining the team, I’m confident Adelphic’s market-leading position in the U.S. will extend to Europe.” \nThrough the end of Q2, Adelphic’s revenue has surged 282 percent year-over-year, driven mainly by Adelphic’s platform now being adopted by trading desks at six of the largest advertising holding companies. In Q3 of this year, Adelphic will have active campaigns in Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom. \n“Capturing the opportunity and taking a leadership role in the mobile programmatic advertising marketplace on behalf of our clients requires both significant technical capabilities and industry acumen,” said Curtis Nishijima, VP, Global Commercial Development and Operations, Amnet Global. “We are excited to already be working with and expanding our relationship with Adelphic in Europe by bringing new levels of mobile innovation, performance and demonstrated value back to our clients.” \nAbout Adelphic: Adelphic is the leading mobile and cross-channel demand side platform, providing an enterprise-ready solution for agencies, brands and other large media buyers who aim to have meaningful engagements with consumers on the move.
