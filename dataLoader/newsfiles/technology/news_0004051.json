He said the arrangement meets the requirements of U.S. fisheries and environmental laws. \nThe 26-member nation Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, which regulates fishing from east and southeast Asia to waters around Hawaii, set a limit of about 3,500 metric tons for Hawaii longline fishermen this year. That's about 7 percent less than last year. \nThe National Marine Fisheries Service applies rules in the U.S. \nIt has proposed rules that would allow Hawaii longline fishermen to bring in more bigeye tuna by shifting some of their catch to territorial fleets, which do not face the same limits from the commission. \nIn exchange, the Hawaii longline fleet would pay the territories money to support the development of local fisheries. \nThe agency has put similar rules in place in recent years after Congress, in a 2012 appropriations bill, directed the agency to create a quota transfer program. The late Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii was Senate appropriations committee chairman at the time the bill was passed. \nLawyers in the case explained to Kobayashi their views on the validity of the agency's quota shifting rule, whether Congress' directive was still applicable or had lapsed and what federal fisheries laws require the agency to do. \nKobayashi gave the attorneys two weeks to file additional arguments. \nBigeye is one of two types of tuna known as ahi. The other is yellowfin. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
