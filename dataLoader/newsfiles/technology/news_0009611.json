( OTCPK: SSFT ), announced that it will release a new Outlook-like folder structure feature in its email archiving and eDiscovery software that will allow end-users to view their own archived email as it is organized in their inboxes. This feature will automatically generate a folder structure hierarchy within the archive that will mirror the same folder structure that end-users created to organize their Microsoft Outlook email clients. If end-users create new folders and organize their Outlook inboxes, then Sonasoft’s email archiving and eDiscovery solution appropriately will update the end-users’ archived folders to mirror these changes. This enhancement will allow end-users to locate their own archived email without the aid of a search or support assistance. Sonasoft’s new folder structure feature is server-side, and it requires no additional resources or plugins. This update will be available on October 15, 2015.\n“We are excited role out this new folder structure enhancement”, said Neil Khanna, Vice President of Client Services and Operations. “Our customers have asked for this feature, and we are happy to deliver it. This folder structure view will make our email archiving and eDiscovery solution even easier to use than before. The reaction from customers who have previewed this feature has been overwhelmingly positive. They love the familiar Microsoft Outlook-like look and feel. All the beta testers, who were not exactly power users, easily could find their specific archived email through this folder structure access. This should make any user support issues minimal and increase the adoption rate to use and trust Sonasoft’s email archiving and eDiscovery tools. We are in the final stages of our beta testing and will be ready to release this new feature in the next few weeks.”\nFor more details about the Outlook-like folder structure and other features of SonaVault Email Archiving and eDiscovery Software solutions:\nhttp://www.sonasoft.com/products/sonavault-email-archiving-software/\nAbout Sonasoft\nSonasoft Corporation is a publicly traded corporation and is listed on the OTC Markets with the trading symbol SSFT.
