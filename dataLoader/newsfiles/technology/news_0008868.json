As the availability of sandalwood oil gets scarcer with each passing year, people engaged in its illicit trading find spurious sandalwood oil a better alternative to the real one.\nFor police authorities, however, it turns out to be a daily battle as they try and track down the smugglers engaged in the business of spurious sandalwood oil. But no legal action can be taken against the dealers of spurious sandalwood oil in the absence of foolproof evidence. The role of scientists at the state-of-the-art chemical analysis laboratory for high-value oil in India thus assumes immense importance.\n\"Every month we receive about 3 to 4 samples of spurious sandalwood oil and sandalwood for chemical analysis from police, forest, custom and excise departments of different states of the country,\" says Suresh H Jain, scientist and head of CFP (chemistry of forest products) division at the Institute of Wood Science & Technology (IWST) in Bengaluru. The problem of fake sandalwood oil is deeprooted in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu as the two states account for 70-90 per cent of heartwood production.\nRampant and illegal felling of sandalwood trees, particularly in Karnataka, has over the years denuded the region of its vast reserve of the precious tree. Sandalwood oil is obtained through steam distillation of heartwood (inner core of sandalwood tree) powder. The oil has wide ranging usages for perfumery, medicine, food and beverage, essence sticks, pharmaceutical, cosmetic industries not only in India but also across the world. Though sandalwood trees of other species are widely found in Australia (Santalum spicatum) and Africa (Osyrius lanceolata, Osyrius tenufolia) oil extracted from Indian sandalwood (Santalum album L) is much in demand for its unique properties. After steam distillation of heartwood (core of sandalwood tree) powder, a pale yellow to yellow viscous liquid with persistent sweet woody fragrance oil is obtained.\nThe special properties of the sandalwood oil is attributed to two forms of sesquiterpene alcohol — a-santalol (45-60%) and ß-santalol (15-30%), both together accounting for a total santalol content of 70-90%. With production of the sandalwood oil now reduced to almost a trickle and demand ever increasing, adulteration becomes the easiest way to produce a large volume of spurious oil to feed the domestic and international market.\n\"The real challenge for us is to identify the adulterants and certify a sample accordingly so that it can stand the test of legal scrutiny in a court of law. Many a time traders of spurious oil try to escape the hands of law by claiming that confiscated oil is legally and scientifically extracted. It then becomes our responsibility to examine the sample sent to us by the law enforcing authorities,\" says IWST director V Ramakantha, a senior Indian Forest Service officer. After two IISc scientists, JJ Sudbourough and HE Watson, successfully extracted the first sample of sandalwood at the institute in 1916 the first sandalwood oil distillery was set up near Sankey Tank in Malleshwaram. In 1917, the distillery was shifted to Mysore.\nIt was later to be christened Government Sandalwood Oil Factory, the producer of world famous India sandalwood oil.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T21:42:50.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
