Those declines were caused by concerns that the Fed's decision to keep interest rates at record lows signaled a weak outlook for global growth.\nDrugmakers slumped on concern of new regulations to control pricing following comments from Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nBond prices fell, pushing up the yield on the 10-year benchmark Treasury note to 2.20 percent from 2.13 percent on Friday\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
