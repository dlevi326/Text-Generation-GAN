But it could be a duller blade than they had hoped.\nIn Europe, where such close copies of biotechnology drugs have been available for nearly a decade, safety concerns and low awareness have combined to slow the uptake of biosimilars. The launch of a classic generic drug, an exact copy of a chemically made drug, can cause sales of the original to plummet within months, but biosimilars have gained market share much more slowly.\nSwiss-based Novartis's Sandoz unit launched Zarzio, a cheaper biosimilar of Amgen's Neupogen anti-infection drug for cancer patients, in 2009, but it took four years to overtake sales of the original. Sandoz earlier this month started selling the same biosimilar in the U.S. under the name Zarxio.\nCarol Lynch, head of biosimilars at Sandoz, ascribed Zarzio's slow start in Europe to confusion over what biosimilars are. \"A large educational effort is required,\" she said. \"The naming of biosimilars doesn't do us any favors. 'Similar' already implies difference, which is a key concern.\"\nBiologic drugs, made through intricate processes involving living cells, are large molecules that interact with the body in complex ways. Minuscule differences between versions of the same molecule could, in theory, lead to unwanted side effects.\nAdvocates point out that no safety issues have yet arisen from the use of biosimilars in Europe, but worries persist, nonetheless: A recent survey found that eight out of 10 U.S. gastroenterologists believe biosimilars aren't as safe as the original product.\nWarwick Smith, director-general of the British Generic Manufacturers Association, said such fears are unfounded because biosimilars are approved to the \"same standards, by the same people\" as the original compounds.\nThe pharmaceutical companies behind the original drugs could be part of the problem, said Duncan Emerton, a senior director at market-intelligence firm FirstWord Pharma. \"My research has shown that there is a general belief among physicians, payers, patients and biosimilar developers that the branded industry is still putting out mixed messages about what biosimilars are,\" he said.\nBut increasingly, branded pharmaceutical companies whose drugs face biosimilar competition are eyeing the market themselves. Amgen has six biosimilars in the pipeline, including imitations of Roche Holding AG's cancer blockbusters Herceptin and Avastin. Pfizer Inc. recently acquired biosimilar maker Hospira, while Eli Lilly & Co. has just launched a biosimilar version of Sanofi SA's long-acting insulin product, Lantus, in Europe.\nIt takes eight to 10 years to bring a biosimilar to market at a cost of $250 million to $300 million, compared with just two to five years and less than $5 million for a classic generic. This is largely because regulators demand large-scale clinical trials for biosimilars, while generic manufacturers can prove equivalence using small human trials.\nBiosimilar versions of Neupogen have now reached levels of adoption close to those of generic drugs, but the relative cost savings are lower. Zarzio sells for a discount of 10% to 30% to the price of Neupogen in the five largest European markets, a Sandoz spokesman said. That compares with discounts of up to 80%, or even 95% in certain markets, for classic generics, reflecting their much lower development and manufacturing costs.\nBackers argue that biosimilars could still bring significant cost savings since the drugs they copy are so expensive to begin with. A Sandoz-sponsored study from 2012, published in the Generics and Biosimilars Initiative Journal, estimated that cumulative cost savings between 2007 and 2020 would range between EUR11.8 billion ($13.2 billion) and EUR33.4 billion, or 5% to 15%.\nDespite this cost-saving potential, Europe's health-care payers haven't all embraced biosimilars with equal enthusiasm. In the U.K., biosimilars have taken 90% of the market once dominated by Neupogen. \"If I write Neupogen on a drug chart, the pharmacist will cross this out and write filgrastim,\" the generic name for all of the versions, said Johnathan Joffe, a medical oncologist at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary in England. \"I don't see it as a problem.\"\n\"In general, in countries where there's a strong central payer, we have very good adoption of biosimilars,\" said Ronny Gal, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. \"In countries where there is no central decision-making and it's left to doctors, biosimilars don't do well.\"\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the Netherlands, where biosimilar adoption stands around 40%. In the case of Amgen's Neupogen, Jan Schellens, a medical oncologist at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, said this could be because the company provides a service delivering the drug to cancer patients in their homes. \"It's a very practical system,\" he said.\nStill, there is reason to believe that the uptake of biosimilars could follow a smoother trajectory in the U.S. Kate Keeping, senior director of biosimilars research at Decision Resource Group, a health-care research firm, said U.S. physicians she had surveyed were more familiar with biosimilars than European physicians were before biosimilars were launched there. \"It's less likely that you're going to see restrictions on uptake due to physicians being hesitant,\" she said.\nBiosimilars are expected to make significant headway in coming years, after a bumpy start. \"If you go back to 2005 and 2006, people were forecasting [cumulative] sales of $20 billion by 2012. [In] the end, it was $1.2 billion,\" said Jorge Santos da Silva, a partner specializing in pharmaceuticals and medical products at McKinsey. Now, most forecasters expect the $20 billion figure to be reached by 2020, he said.\nSandoz is one of a number of companies eager to win a slice of that market. It plans to launch five more biosimilars in Europe and the U.S. over the next three years. \"We still feel this market is very much in its infancy,\" Ms. Lynch said. \"The next wave of launches will be an interesting time.\"\nWrite to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com\n 22, 2015 19:59 ET (23:59 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:37:15.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
