The system ensures that these devices are not left on accidentally. This helps to reduce the risk of electrical fires, which is designed to enhance safety. The system thereby provides added peace of mind. Furthermore, it controls access to various types of electronics without measure of current consumption.\nThe original design was submitted to the Cleveland office of InventHelp.
