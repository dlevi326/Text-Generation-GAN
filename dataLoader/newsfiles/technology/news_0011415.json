The split is scheduled to be completed by the end of next month.\nHP Enterprises is trimming its payroll as part of an effort to reduce its expenses by $2 billion annually.\nEven before the spinoff, HP has been jettisoning tens of thousands of employees during the past few years to help boost its declining profits as a technological shift from personal computers to smartphones and other mobile devices reduced demand for many of its products.\nTags: TECHNOLOGY COMPUTER SYSTEMS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T04:42:40.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
