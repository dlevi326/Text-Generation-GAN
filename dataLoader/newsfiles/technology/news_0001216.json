The streamlined productivity of this test solution is crucial for rapid insertion of the new generation of Gallium-Nitride (GaN) and Silicon-Carbide (SiC) compound semiconductor technologies envisioned in key commercial and military market sectors\" concluded Shaw.\nThe Quantum SMART fixture is a programmable self-contained DC bias and RF stimulus control module capable of synchronizing independent pulsed-bias and pulsed-RF signals to a device-under-test (DUT) or remote subsystem. The signals are controlled from a user-interface compatible with Accel-RF\"s LIFETEST software. The fixture is capable of \"active\" temperature control and monitoring of a remote DUT through embedded firmware in the microprocessor.\nFor more information about Accel-RF's Quantum SMART test fixture and other products for accelerating product launch visit http://www.accelrf.com .\nAbout Accel-RF\nAccel-RF Instruments Corporation specializes in the development, design, and production of accelerated life-test/burn-in test systems for semiconductor devices. These systems are turn-key integrated instruments that provide a cost-effective and high-value proposition for measuring intrinsic reliability, process-control validation, specification standard-deviation characterization, and product qualification testing.\nTrademark Information\n\"Accel-RF\" is a registered trademark of Accel-RF Instruments Corporation.\nContacts\nAccel-RF Corporation\nHannah Going, 858-278-2074\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
