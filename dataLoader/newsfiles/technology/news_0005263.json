Sahlan Hayes Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Following a week in which newly minted ministers, commentators and tech experts fell over themselves in the rush to talk-up government support for start-ups, Niki Scevak has some sound words of advice.\nInvestors and governments can help great companies, but neither will dramatically change the odds of success, says Scevak, the managing partner of Blackbird ventures. \"Ultimately it comes down to the entrepreneurs and teams creating large, sustainable global companies.\"\nScevak runs the the only venture capital fund to have coaxed capital from local superannuation funds. He's also just launched the largest ever fund for early-stage tech companies founded by Australians.\nWhile the fund is partly designed to keep good companies from having to move overseas to access latter stage capital, Scevak says widespread concerns about a brain drain are overplayed.\n\"You can't change the rules of business gravity that draw companies closer to their market. But most Australian companies that 'move' are rarely moving wholesale, they keep the highly valuable knowledge workers such as product and engineering here.\"\nAmong the start-up community the rise of Malcolm Turnbull to Prime Minister is akin to the arrival of the Australian technology industry's messiah. It's been a heady week for big ideas involving small, risky companies.\nOn Monday, the start-up community was still publishing blogs, firing out tweets and pitching welcome op-eds and policy change wishlists to every available new site.\nOn Tuesday, the new Assistant Minister for Innovation, Wyatt Roy, suggested a strategy to get expat Australian tech entrepreneurs to return home.\n On Wednesday, Tasmanian-born, San Francisco-based entrepreneur Sam Chandler seemed to call for legislative changes compelling superannuation funds to invest in high-risk tech companies.\nLabor proposes tech-friendly changes\nOn Thursday, Labor released a raft of policies to boost the technology sector including visas to attract young entrepreneurs to our shores and an extra HECs-funded year for selected aspiring young entrepreneurs.\n\"The community enthusiasm is more about its possibilities than what's come before with Mr Turnbull's track record of technology policies like the NBN,\" board member at community organisation Startup Victoria and tech start-up co-founder Scott Handsaker tells AFR Weekend .\n\"While I remain optimistic, there is a long road yet to make Australia globally competitive.\"\nThe most recent comprehensive report into the local technology start-up sector was published by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2013. While the sector has grown considerably since, it identified 1500 technology start-ups and forecast a properly supported ecosystem would add $109 billion to the economy and 540,000 jobs by 2033.\nBut the community faces a series of challenges to continue to grow and keep burgeoning tech companies onshore. Turnbull should at least be aware of these. In May he was presented, by hand during a speech, with a comprehensive report published by StartupAus identifying and prioritising the key challenges for the sector .\nThe challenges include creating a capital gains exemption for investments into tech companies, establishing a seed round co-investment fund and enabling crowdsourced equity fundraising.\nScevak says the Liberal government had already solved the most critical regulatory hurdle for start-ups when former Minister for Small Business Bruce Billson overturned changes to the employee share scheme taxation made in 2007.\nHandsaker is similarly unfazed by the inevitable flow of people to bigger markets and said Mr Turnbull's first and most compelling task would be educating his party and the public about the need for innovation.\n\"We desperately need people to understand how fast the world is changing, so we can take the steps we need to keep up as a country,\" Mr Handsaker said.\nScevak also raised education as the key value the government could provide to the sector.\n\"Our education system needs to evolve. It creates far more lawyers and beauticians but nowhere near enough software engineers. If the government can move that forward, there would be cause to get genuinely excited.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@rosepowell", "https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711"], "published": "2015-09-25T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:18:07.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
