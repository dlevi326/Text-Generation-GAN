Credit: NASA JPL, Ed Olsen \nNASA's Aqua satellite saw wind shear was affecting newborn Tropical Storm Niala as it continued moving through the Central Atlantic Ocean. \nDespite wind shear , Tropical Depression 6C formed about 500 miles southeast of Hilo, Hawaii at 11 p.m. EDT on September 24, 2015. By 11 a.m. EDT, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was renamed Tropical Storm Niala. \nOn Sept. 24 at 7:47 a.m. EDT the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder or AIRS instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite provided an infrared look at developing Tropical Depression 6C. AIRS data showed that northwesterly vertical wind shear was pushing clouds and strongest storms with coldest cloud tops to the southeast of the center. Cloud top temperatures were as cold as -63 Fahrenheit/-53 Celsius, indicative of strong storms with the potential for heavy rain. The AIRS infrared data also showed that the system was moving through warm waters near 28 to 29 Celsius (82.4 to 84.2 Fahrenheit) which helped it strengthen into a depression and later into a tropical storm . \nNOAA's Central Pacific Hurricane Center noted that the most recent guidance from University of Wisconsin-CIMSS and ships for current vertical wind shear in the vicinity of Niala, suggest that there is moderate shear of about 15 knots (17.2 mph/27.8 kph) from the northwest. \nAt 5 a.m. EDT (0900 UTC) on September 25 the center of Tropical Storm Niala was located near latitude 15.1 north and longitude 150.1 west. That's about 490 miles (790 km) southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. Maximum sustained winds are near 35 knots (40 mph/65 kph) and gradual intensification is expected during the next two days. \nNOAA's Central Pacific Hurricane Center noted that Niala was moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 kph). TD6C is expected to gradually turn toward the west-northwest then west on Saturday, September 26 and pass far south of the Big Island of Hawaii. NASA sees wind shear affecting Tropical Storm Jimena September 8, 2015 \nStrong vertical wind shear has been affecting Tropical Storm Jimena in the Central Pacific and pushing the clouds and storms west of the center, as seen in infrared imagery from NASA's Aqua satellite. NASA takes an infrared baby picture of Atlantic's Tropical Depression 8 September 9, 2015 \nNASA's Aqua satellite captured a \"baby picture\" of the eighth tropical depression of the Atlantic Ocean Hurricane Season. NASA sees Tropical Storm Kilo affected by wind shear September 10, 2015 \nStrong vertical wind shear is taking its toll on the now weaker Tropical Storm Kilo in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean. Visible and infrared imagery from NASA's Aqua satellite shows that southwesterly wind shear has been pushing ... NASA sees formation of Tropical Depression 21W September 22, 2015 \nNASA's Aqua satellite passed over a developing tropical low pressure area in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean on September 21 when the latest depression was coming together. The AIRS instrument aboard Aqua used infrared light ... NASA, NOAA satellites show wind shear affecting Tropical Storm Ida September 23, 2015 \nOn Sept. 22 at 12:17 p.m. EDT the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, or AIRS, instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite provided an infrared look at Ida. AIRS data showed that southwesterly vertical wind shear was pushing clouds ... NASA sees a somewhat shapeless Tropical Storm Ida September 24, 2015 \nTropical Storm Ida has been dealing with wind shear and appeared somewhat shapeless on imagery from NASA's Aqua satellite on September 23. Recommended for you Study shows using oat hulls for power has considerable benefits to the environment and human health September 25, 2015 \nBiomass burning sometimes gets a bad rap. That's because many associate the burning of living and dead vegetation with human-caused fires and clearing of land that release unhealthy particles and gases that spur global warming. A quarter of fish sold at markets contain man-made debris September 25, 2015 \nRoughly a quarter of the fish sampled from fish markets in California and Indonesia contained man-made debris—plastic or fibrous material—in their guts, according to a study from the University of California, Davis, and ... UAF model used to estimate Antarctic ice sheet melting September 24, 2015 \nTo see how burning up the Earth's available fossil fuels might affect the Antarctic ice sheet, scientists turned to a computer program developed at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute. The ice would disappear, ... Researchers reveal when global warming first appeared September 22, 2015 \nThe indications of climate change are all around us today but now researchers have revealed for the first time when and where the first clear signs of global warming appeared in the temperature record and where those signals ... Global warming: Are trees going on strike? September 23, 2015 \nTrees, crucial absorbers of climate-harming carbon dioxide gas, may finally be balking at an ever-earlier spring season brought on by global warming, researchers said Wednesday.
