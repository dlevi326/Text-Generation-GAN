It is shameful that the comments posted on Facebook are brought in the house by the BJP.\" \n\"Even there are so many comments against our national leaders. But we never made an issue in the house. Our leaders ignore such comments,\" he said. \nJustifying Bharti's posts, the chief minister said the comments were not attributed to anybody.
