There was a potential for more entries to be removed as the investigation continued.\n“Most of these articles, which were related to businesses, business people, or artists, were generally promotional in nature, and often included biased or skewed information, unattributed material, and potential copyright violations,” Erhart and Barbara said.\n“The edits made by the sockpuppets are similar enough that the community believes they were perpetrated by one coordinated group.”\nThe accounts identified in during the investigation were used from the end of April to early August, but the nature and quality of the nature and quality of edits suggested that the paid-scheme was operating “for some time” before being discovered, according to Wikipedia.\nA team of volunteers tends to Wikipedia entries, which rely on crowd-sourcing for accuracy.\n“Editing Wikipedia is completely free, and only requires compliance with the project’s editorial guidelines,” Erhart and Barbara said.\n“No one should ever have to pay to create or maintain a Wikipedia article.”\n 03, 2015 1:17 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T04:45:53.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
