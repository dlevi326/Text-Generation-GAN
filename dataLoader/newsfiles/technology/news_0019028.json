We rolled out AT&T Switched Ethernet Service SM via Network on Demand in more than 170 U.S. cities and signed more than 200 customer contracts. Now, we're enhancing Network on Demand capabilities through an ecosystem of the industry's leading technology companies. And we're launching an additional Network on Demand-enabled service - Managed Internet Service on Demand. \"Businesses need agility to compete and win in their industries. They need to sense and rapidly adapt to changing market dynamics,\" said Steve McGaw , chief marketing officer, [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTloWW05MWRDNWhkSFF1WTI5dEwyMWxaR2xoYTJsMEwySjFjMmx1WlhOelltRnphV056WENJZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCMFlYSm5aWFE5WENKZllteGhibXRjSWo1QlZDWlVJRUoxYzJsdVpYTnpJRk52YkhWMGFXOXVjend2WVQ0PXw=]]. \"We're the largest global integrated carrier for business 1 , and Network on Demand makes our network dynamic and adaptive to meet our customers' needs.\" With Managed Internet Service on Demand, businesses get unparalleled control to adjust and add capabilities in near-real time. We're streamlining Internet setup for our customers. They won't need router hardware at their locations. The new on-demand service uses Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to virtualize routing in our core network and at customer locations. Network on Demand functionality makes network service set up simpler. For example, a real estate firm renting office space can turn up network services in a matter of minutes as tenants come and go. With Network on Demand, businesses can easily order more ports, add or change services, and adjust bandwidth to meet their needs in near-real time. They can do all of this online, and also enjoy up to 95% improvement in provisioning cycle times. Managed Internet Service on Demand will be available in select U.S. cities later this fall. We plan to expand by the end of the year. And we'll add more Network on Demand-enabled services in the future. 1 by revenue, FY 2014 *AT&T products and services are provided or offered by subsidiaries and affiliates of AT&T Inc. under the AT&T brand and not by AT&T Inc.
