That helps project when the snow will melt and how much water it will release into rivers for cities, farms and wildlife.\nThat's critical information in the West, where researchers say 75 to 80 percent of the water comes from melting mountain snow. It helps reservoir managers decide how much water to release into turbines to generate electricity and how much to hold for dry months. It also helps determine who gets irrigation water and who doesn't in a rigid pecking order of water rights.\n\"Once the water managers get a look at the data they say, 'I like that,'\" said Frank Gehrke, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program. NASA has been providing California with snow data from the Tuolumne Basin since 2013, and flights will resume there next spring.\nColorado signed up for three flights over the Rio Grande Basin in the south-central part of the state. The first were in March and September of this year. The third will be next spring.\nMelting snow from the basin - flanked by the towering San Juan and Sangre de Cristo mountains - forms the Rio Grande, which flows south through New Mexico and then southeast to the Gulf of Mexico, forming the Texas-Mexico border.\nInterstate compacts guarantee Texas and New Mexico a share of the water, so Colorado has to choose carefully when deciding how much to send downstream and how much to allocate for local use.\nEstimating how much Colorado snow will melt into the Rio Grande is difficult. The mountains block weather radars that could help gauge how much precipitation is falling, said Joe Busto of the Colorado Water Conservation Board.\nColorado will use the NASA data to improve computer modeling for runoff forecasts.\n\"If you give it lots of wonderful data. It will outperform the old models,\" Busto said.\nThe plane has also surveyed the Uncompahgre River Basin in western Colorado for a research project and other areas to map flood plains.\nCalifornia pays about $400,000 a season for weekly flights over the Tuolumne Basin during peak snow months, Gehrke said. Colorado is paying about $300,000 for the Rio Grande basin data, Busto said.\nTom Painter, NASA's principal investigator for the project, said it's a good investment because the projections are so accurate. Snowmelt flowing from the Tuolumne Basin into Hetch Hetchy Reservoir was within 2 percent of projections from the NASA data in 2013 and 2014, he said.\nMost of the airborne surveys have been during drought, but Painter said they'll be useful in wet times to help regulate heavy runoff.\nThe Airborne Snow Observatory, a propeller-driven plane, sweeps back and forth over mountain snowfields scanning with lidar - the term combines \"light\" and \"radar\" - and an imaging spectrometer.\nLidar measures snow depth by bouncing a laser off the surface and comparing that to an aerial survey done without snow. Coupled with snow density data from ground sites and computer modeling, researchers can project how much water is in the snow.\nThe spectrometer measures how much sunlight the snow is reflecting and absorbing. That allows researchers to project when it will melt.\nThe ground sites, scattered across the West, are the primary source of data for most snowmelt projections. U.S. Department of Agriculture employees trek to some sites to measure and weigh the snow. Other sites are automated.\nPainter said the airborne survey won't eliminate ground sites, but he foresees a day when aerial surveys become the standard. Satellites might also play a role, but airplanes can provide a level of detail and frequency that spacecraft cannot, Painter said.\n\"At least not yet. Maybe in 50 years,\" he said.\n___\nFollow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
