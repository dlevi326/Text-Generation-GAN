Picture: THE HERALD Related articles LETTER FROM CAPE TOWN: Nhleko’s empty promises spur vigilante killings POLITICAL WEEK AHEAD: Zuma leads SA delegation to UN assembly Maimane singles out graft as greatest threat to democracy in SA Cape steps up fight against alcohol abuse In this article Companies and organisations: African National Congress | Democratic Alliance People: Patricia de Lille THE City of Cape Town has taken the unusual step of exploring the possibility of declaring crime hotspots as disaster zones in a bid to reduce crime.\nIt believes that doing so will compel the national government to allocate more crime-fighting resources to those areas.\nThe Democratic Alliance-led city and the Western Cape provincial government have often questioned the crime-fighting capabilities of the South African Police Service (SAPS), saying it was under-resourced and poorly managed. The city has also said it would fight any attempt to absorb the metro police into the SAPS.\nThe African National Congress, in a white paper on safety and security, is looking into incorporating municipal police forces into the SAPS so that they report to the national police commissioner.\nCape Town’s mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said on Sunday Mayor Patricia de Lille had sought legal advice on declaring crime hotspots to be disaster zones.\nAt the moment only the provincial and national governments can declare disaster zones while municipalities can declare emergency procurement measures to allow for rapid and unplanned expenditure in the event of a major crisis.\nMr Smith said the legal opinion \"will seek to explore whether the city can declare the serious violent crime … in parts of the city as a disaster in these areas\".\n\"The exact areas will be chosen after the official crime statistics are considered,\" Mr Smith said. The statistics are due to be released this week.\n\"The legal opinion will also explore whether the City can claim additional resources from the national government in lieu of failure of the national police to secure certain communities,\" Mr Smith said.\nBut the Social Justice Coalition on Sunday opposed the City’s plan.\n\"The proposal is absurd,\" and the legal opinion a waste of public funds, said Chumile Sali, the coalition’s head of safety and justice programme.\n\"Declaring crime hotspots as disaster areas is an insult to communities that are not serviced by the city. What leads to more crime in our communities is the fact that there are no street lights in informal settlements, few CCTV cameras, lack of basic sanitation and an absence of roads in informal settlements,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:39:36.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
