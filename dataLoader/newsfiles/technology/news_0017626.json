(Photo: TiVo)\n17 CONNECT 57 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE The latest TiVo set-top box, all dressed in white, makes a bolder case to be your all-in-one video device.\nSlimmer and smaller than the current Roamio set-top boxes , the new Ultra HD 4K-ready Bolt boasts an improved advertisement skipping SkipMode feature and QuickMode playback for watching content faster than in real-time.\nThe Bolt handles current cable services and Verizon Fios -- but not satellite TV or AT&T U-verse -- and has inputs for an over-the-air antenna and Ethernet connection (it also has built-in Wi-Fi). Currently, the Bolt handles UHD 4K video from Netflix and YouTube; other apps supported include Amazon Instant Video, Xfinity and Cox on demand, iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify and Vudu.\nThe new features come at a slightly higher price than the current Roamios; the Bolt will be sold in a 500-gigabyte model for $299 and a 1-terabyte $399 model. However, those prices include a year of service. Currently, the TiVo service costs $14.99 monthly.\n\"From a hardware perspective, it’s about changing and future-proofing the platform, getting 4K and speeding up the speed,\" said TiVo's vice president of product management and strategy Jim Denney in an interview. \"From the user standpoint, it’s about getting you through your content more quickly and then really being that one-stop shop for all of your content, letting you organize easily as you navigate to it and through it.\"\nTiVo's new SkipMode lets you bypass all the advertisements between segments of a program on 20 major channels with one button push. On recorded programs, a green \"Skip\" logo will display in the \"My Shows\" list if the feature is available. Local broadcasts and sports won't be among programs with the SkipMode option. A single button push turns QuickMode on for all recordings, too.\nTiVo's new QuickMode lets you watch programs about 30% faster by speeding up video while correcting the pitch of the audio. (Photo: TiVo)\nUpgrades to the set-top box software includes channel logos in the programming guide for ease of identifying networks. Initially, Bolt will support in-home streaming with out-of-home streaming -- as current models allow -- expected early next year.\nBy early November, TiVo will also update its iOS mobile app with easier ways to find programs to watch and record by genres, hobbies, interests and curated collections. An Android update will follow.\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider\n17 CONNECT 57 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1KK5INt TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KK5INt&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791407070462740-BOLT-Right-Front-Wide-Angle.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/521cd80a4fb9f1f1edf37d025629b379daee5bba/r=500x332/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791407070462740-BOLT-Right-Front-Wide-Angle.jpg", "http://custom.tivo.com/products-tivo-roamio.html", "http://usat.ly/1KK5INt", "https://twitter.com/MikeSnider", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/516bd2763fc2e5cc3121df16deb3f7346dccb302/c=96-0-1576-1113&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791407070462740-BOLT-Right-Front-Wide-Angle.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2c8506333ee2ad561f230bbbc24e56f3062cea7a/c=598-0-4059-2602&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791409512674050-QuickMode-On.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KK5INt&text=New%20TiVo%20Bolt%20touts%204K%2C%20improved%20ad%20skipping%20and%20speed%20watching%20features&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-09-30T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:52:50.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
