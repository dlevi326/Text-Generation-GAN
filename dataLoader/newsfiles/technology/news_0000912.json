The image combines blue, red and infrared images taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC). \nPluto's surface sports a remarkable range of subtle colors, enhanced in this view to a rainbow of pale blues, yellows, oranges, and deep reds. Many landforms have their own distinct colors, telling a complex geological and climatological story that scientists have only just begun to decode. The image resolves details and colors on scales as small as 0.8 miles (1.3 kilometers). \nThe viewer is encouraged to zoom in on the image on a larger screen to fully appreciate the complexity of Pluto's surface features. New Image of Pluto: 'Houston, We Have Geology' July 11, 2015 \nIt began as a point of light. Then, it evolved into a fuzzy orb. Now – in its latest portrait from NASA's New Horizons spacecraft – Pluto is being revealed as an intriguing new world with distinct surface features, including ... Image: Views of Pluto through the years July 16, 2015 \nThis animation combines various observations of Pluto over the course of several decades. The first frame is a digital zoom-in on Pluto as it appeared upon its discovery by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 (image courtesy Lowell Observatory ... Image: Pluto Dazzles in False Color July 27, 2015 \nNew Horizons scientists use enhanced color images to detect differences in the composition and texture of Pluto's surface. When close-up images are combined with color data from the Ralph instrument, it paints a new and surprising ... Image: Pluto's majestic mountains, frozen plains and foggy hazes September 18, 2015 \nJust 15 minutes after its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft looked back toward the sun and captured this near-sunset view of the rugged, icy mountains and flat ice plains extending ... Pluto stuns in spectacular new backlit panorama September 18, 2015 \nThe latest images from NASA's New Horizons spacecraft have scientists stunned – not only for their breathtaking views of Pluto's majestic icy mountains, streams of frozen nitrogen and haunting low-lying hazes, but also ... Perplexing new 'snakeskin' image of Pluto terrain from New Horizons September 25, 2015 \nThe newest high-resolution images of Pluto from NASA's New Horizons are both dazzling and mystifying, revealing a multitude of previously unseen topographic and compositional details. The image below—showing an area near ... Recommended for you 11-year cosmic search leads to black hole rethink September 24, 2015 \nOne hundred years since Einstein proposed gravitational waves as part of his general theory of relativity, an 11-year search performed with CSIRO's Parkes telescope has failed to detect them, casting doubt on our understanding ... Black hole is 30 times expected size September 24, 2015 \nThe central supermassive black hole of a recently discovered galaxy is far larger than should be possible, according to current theories of galactic evolution. New work, carried out by astronomers at Keele University and ... ESA's Rosetta data reveals evidence for a daily water-ice cycle on and near the surface of comets September 24, 2015 \nComets are celestial bodies comprising a mixture of dust and ices, which they periodically shed as they swing towards their closest point to the Sun along their highly eccentric orbits. Revisiting the Veil Nebula September 24, 2015 \nDeriving its name from its delicate, draped filamentary structures, the beautiful Veil Nebula is one of the best-known supernova remnants. It formed from the violent death of a star twenty times the mass of the Sun that exploded ... Hot, dense material surrounds O-type star with largest magnetic field known September 23, 2015 \nObservations using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory revealed that the unusually large magnetosphere around an O-type star called NGC 1624-2 contains a raging storm of extreme stellar winds and dense plasma that gobbles up ... Comet surface changes before Rosetta's eyes September 22, 2015 \nIn the months leading to the perihelion of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Rosetta scientists have been witnessing dramatic and rapid surface changes on the Imhotep region, as reported in a paper to be published in Astronomy ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T13:18:40.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
