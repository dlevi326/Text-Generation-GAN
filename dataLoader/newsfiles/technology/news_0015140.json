Vehicles, including motorized bicycles, are forbidden in a quarter of the French capital and \"strongly not recommended\" throughout. Those who hit the road anyway must observe a 20 kilometer-per-hour (12.5 mph) speed limit. Police are watching.\nBuses, ambulances, police vehicles, fire trucks and taxis were allowed in the streets.\nParis has earlier sought to cut pollution by introducing rental bicycles in the streets, adding cycling paths, including along the scenic Seine River, and adopting a fleet of electric cars for residents to incite drivers to keep polluting vehicles at home.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:43:21.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
