Everything on YouTube have found that, unlike the iPhone 4 and 4S, replacing your iphone 5c lcd screen is actually pretty simple. All you have to do is pick up a $3 screwdriver and suction cup kit on Amazon and a razor blade. The process is pretty quick: remove the screws, pop the screen off and remove the cables. Once this is complete, you can fasten the new screen onto your phone and you should be as good as new. Unfortunately, the only downside to replacing your iPhone’s screen by yourself is the price. On Amazon, the cheapest screen replacement for the iPhone 5c we can find costs a bit over $200. It’s also worth remembering that these parts can sometimes be of lower quality than parts directly from Apple.So when you buy the iphone 5c lcd replacement ,you should choose the professional website like Flashtechllc.com When you replace a part on your iPhone, you WILL void your iPhone’s warranty, so don’t blame us if you screw something up. However, if you’re savvy with electronic repairs and can work well with screwdrivers, you’ll probably do fine with the repair. # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T12:38:34.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
