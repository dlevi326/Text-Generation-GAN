And an extremely high charge/discharge cycle and reduction of price per kW are required for \"short-cycle power storage.\" In medium-cycle fluctuations, the output fluctuates in a cycle of several minutes to one day, and high charge/discharge property as well as the balance between price per kW and price per kWh are required for \"medium-cycle power storage.\" \nAs for long-cycle fluctuations, the output fluctuates in a cycle of several tens of minutes to one month, and deep charge/discharge and minimization of price per kWh are required for \"long-cycle power storage.\" \nIn light of the above, at \"Yume Solar Kan Yamanashi,\" an electric double-layer capacitor is used for short-cycle power storage, a Li-ion storage battery is used for medium-cycle power storage and a hydrogen storage system utilizing a water electrolysis system and a pure hydrogen fuel cell is used for long-cycle power storage (Fig. 6). \nUnder this system, fluctuations in output of solar power are absorbed by the electric double-layer capacitor, the Li-ion storage battery and the water electrolysis system in this order. Therefore, when the capacitor and the storage battery are fully charged, hydrogen is produced directly by a fluctuation in solar power output. \n\"The majority of solar power output fluctuations due to changes in sunlight are absorbed by hydrogen production by water electrolysis,\" Sakamoto said. \"The major issue was whether the water electrolysis system can endure these severe service conditions, but it is functioning without any trouble.\" Fig. 6: Li-ion storage battery and electric double-layer capacitor manufactured by Nichicon Corporation (source: Nikkei BP) \nAs for the water electrolysis system, a \"Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) type\" manufactured by Kobelco Eco-Solutions was incorporated. The \"alkaline water electrolysis\" type, which performs electrolysis in alkaline electrolyte, can also be used for hydrogen production, in addition to the PEM type. The alkaline water electrolysis type is suitable for large-scale systems, and its price is low; however, the efficiency is also relatively low. \nMeanwhile, the PEM type abstracts hydrogen from water through the reverse reaction of a fuel cell, using an electrolytic cell made of a solid polymer membrane sandwiched between electrodes. It uses a platinum catalyst and is expensive, but it is suitable for small-scale systems because of its high efficiency and high followability to fluctuations. \nThe total operation time from the start to May 2015 was 2,900 hours, and the cumulative hydrogen generation volume amounted to 1,900Nm 3 . The followability to solar power output fluctuations is at the one-second-level and good, Sakamoto said. \nThe full-scale operation of the entire system was started in 2013 because the initial problems were addressed in 2012. The operation was stopped occasionally due to failure of control valves and pumps after start of full-scale operation. However, in respect to deterioration of the electrolytic cell, \"we could confirm durability of about 2,000 hours against a fluctuating power supply from the solar power generation system,\" according to Kobelco Eco-Solutions. \nThe electrolytic cell was replaced with a high-efficiency type in the summer of 2014, and the operation has been stable to present, about 1,000 hours after the replacement. The company is also considering improving the followability to the millisecond level.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:04:21.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
