Here are five to watch out for:\n1. The privacy hoax. This one, which recently started making the rounds again , has been around for years, according to CNN . Users post a status update that looks something like this, ClarkHoward.com reports :\nDo not share that viral Facebook copyright message, America, as it is a HOAX: http://t.co/zz0awPrnWx pic.twitter.com/7LPuu3kyBg\n— Good Morning America (@GMA) September 29, 2015 Photo via @GMA / Twitter \"I do not give Facebook or any entities associated with Facebook permission to use my pictures, information, or posts, both past and future. By this statement, I give notice to Facebook it is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, or take any other action against me based on this profile and/or its contents. The content of this profile is private and confidential information. The violation of privacy can be punished by law (UCC 1-308- 1 1 308-103 and the Rome Statute). NOTE: Facebook is now a public entity. All members must post a note like this. If you prefer, you can copy and paste this version. If you do not publish a statement at least once it will be tactically allowing the use of your photos, as well as the information contained in the profile status updates.\"\nFacebook weighed in on the issue Monday. \"The thing about copying and pasting a legal notice is just a hoax,\" the company wrote . Check out Facebook's legal statement here .\nWhile there may be water on Mars, don't believe everything you read on the internet today. Facebook is free and it...\nPosted by Facebook on Monday, September 28, 2015 >> RELATED: Warning: An old Facebook scam is making the rounds again!\n2. The subscription hoax. This is another one that has taken the social network by storm as users rush to copy and paste the message as their latest status update. It reads like this, according to ClarkHoward.com :\n\"Now it's official! It has been published in the media. Facebook has just released the entry price: £5.99 to keep the subscription of your status to be set to \"private.\" If you paste this message on your page, it will be offered free (I said paste not share) if not tomorrow, all your posts can become public. Even the messages that have been deleted or the photos not allowed. After all, it does not cost anything for a simple copy and paste.\"\nRelax, everyone. \"Facebook is free, and it always will be,\" the social network wrote .\nDon’t believe the hoax – Facebook is NOT about to start charging for private profiles http://t.co/WQTGDjATDa pic.twitter.com/k0Dvd1V3zE\n— Metro (@MetroUK) September 29, 2015 >> Read more trending stories\n3. The photo notification scam. This one works via email. First, you'll get a message saying you've been tagged in a photo on the social network. But don't blindly click. According to ClarkHoward.com , the scam email comes from a \"Faceboook.com\" address (with an extra \"o\") – and if you follow the enclosed link, you'll end up downloading malware. Your best bet is to delete the message ASAP.\n4. The \"dislike button\" scam. This one is also dangerous, according to ClarkHoward.com . Users post a link that claims to tell people how to get their new Facebook \"dislike button\"; instead, it takes you to another site that will take your personal information.\nHere's what it looks like:\nA link purporting to enable the \"newly introduced\" Facebook Dislike button is a scam: http://t.co/eaqEG8C7FO pic.twitter.com/k25KCQp33a\n— snopes.com (@snopes) September 22, 2015 Although Facebook really does plan to introduce a dislike button , \"you will not need to download anything from a third-party site,\" ClarkHoward.com reports .\n>> RELATED: Beware the fake 'Facebook dislike button' scam\n>> RELATED: Facebook finally listens to users, creates 'dislike' button?\n5. Other types of clickjacking. Ever see those Facebook posts with racy videos and photos, or ads promising deals that seem too good to be true? Well, they usually are.
