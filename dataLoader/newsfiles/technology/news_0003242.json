Nokia plans to work closely with Ericsson and Intel to develop and bring to market the products needed for the commercialization of NB-LTE timed with market demand. \n\"We believe in building an ecosystem around NB-LTE to speed up the take-up of the Internet of Things. This development will bring consumers benefits such as enhanced and improved connectivity of devices, and at lower cost. This is another extension of Nokia's aim to improve people's lives through a programmable world where billions of people, things, sensors and devices are connected,\" said Stephan Litjens, vice president, Portfolio Strategy & Analytics, Nokia Networks. \n\"Cellular networks already cover 90 percent of the world's population so it makes sense to leverage this global footprint to support and drive IoT adoption through the standardization of Narrow-Band LTE. Working with Intel and Nokia, Ericsson is driving the ecosystem to accelerate IoT growth and ensuring a global foundation for a vast range of new IoT applications for consumers, industry and government,\" said Thomas Nor√©n, vice president and Head of Product Management, Business Unit Radio, Ericsson. \nIntel intends to support commercial roll-out of the technology with a roadmap for NB-LTE chipsets and product upgrades beginning in 2016 that will enable slim form factors. The products will add to Intel's growing LTE portfolio. Nokia and Ericsson will provide the required network upgrades to support an extension of existing LTE networks with NB-LTE optimized for low power Machine-to-Machine communication. \n\"We are excited to collaborate with two leading network vendors Ericsson and Nokia on the next wave of wireless innovation to connect the growing IoT market segment, and to further grow the momentum for Intel's LTE portfolio and roadmap with NB-LTE,\" said Stefan Wolff, vice president, Platform Engineering Group and general manager of the Multi-Comms Business Unit, Intel. \nAbout Nokia By focusing on the human possibilities of technology, Nokia embraces the connected world to help people thrive. Our three businesses are leaders in their fields: Nokia Networks provides broadband infrastructure, software and services; HERE provides mapping, navigation and location intelligence; and Nokia Technologies provides advanced technology development and licensing. http://www.nokia.com \nMedia Enquiries:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:11:04.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
