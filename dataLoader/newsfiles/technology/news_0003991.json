Ben Rushton Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Australian consumer technology company IoT Group is set to become the first ASX-listed internet of things business, through an $18.5 million reverse listing later in 2015.\nThe business, which launched in May 2015 and has its products stocked in big retailers such as Coles and JB Hi-Fi, is backdoor listing through Ardent Resources and is also embarking on a $5 million capital raise.\nChief executive Simon Kantor said the company was joining the throng of backdoor-listed tech stocks because it was the quickest way on to the ASX.\n\"Now is the right time to get ahead of the curve. We're about six months behind in Australia in terms of technology and we want to bring it to the forefront. To do that we need capital,\" he said.\nIoT Group chief executive Simon Kantor says the business will have released a range of new products to retailers like JB Hi-Fi before Christmas. IoT Group shareholders will receive 89 per cent of the shares in the listed entity, but 10 per cent will be left for the public.\nIdentifiable name Following the reverse listing, IoT Group will change its name to Ardent IoT, because it wants a name that is more \"uniquely identifiable\".\nThe business was formed through the merger of three tech businesses , OK Watch, Roam and InnovativePTV. It is backed by Richard Branson's former right hand man Ian Duffell, who was a Virgin Entertainment Group chief executive and Sony marketing executive and is on IoT Group's board.\n The business has ambitious plans to rival the likes of Apple and Samsung, developing a range of affordable wearable technology, mobile devices and gadgets. Most of its products will cost less than $300.\nIts smartwatch product is available at Coles for $99, which is significantly cheaper than the Apple Watch.\nIt intends to launch a range of other products, including a selfie drone and children's safety watch, in stores in time for Christmas.\nWatches selling well \"We've been really successful with the Viper Watch and that's opened the door to new products. The kids' safety watch will be out in stores in the next eight weeks,\" he said.\n\"Waterproof phones, a sports watch and a fit watch will be coming out as well. The tech sitting behind these products has all been developed ... and the plan is to roll out the products to all the major retail chains, such as JB Hi-Fi, Harvey Norman, Dick Smith, Coles and Woolworths, across Australia in the next three months.\"\nThe company secured a deal with Brightstar, one of the world's largest wireless distribution companies, to handle most of its logistics.\nSales of IoT Group's first smartwatch has exceeded expectations, with 4000 sold in the first two months.\nHowever, smartwatch sales overall have been slow. Telsyte figures revealed that only 205,000 smartwatches were sold in Australia in the first half of 2015, two-thirds of which were the Apple Watch.\nThe IoT Group listing will be a chance for Australian investors to buy into the boom in mobile devices, wearables and other gadgets. Most listed tech stocks in Australia are in IT services, software development or telecommunications.\n\"We're giving the Australian public a chance to jump on the internet of things craze,\" Mr Kantor said.\n\"The potential is there for us to be one of the giants. But our ethos and our mentality needs to be that of where we've started, keeping the business in Australia and having Australian talent.\"\nJohn Birkhold, a partner at global fund management firm Origin Asset Management, said the internet of things \"revolution\" was exciting but risky, because it was a very competitive sector.\n\"As a global investor we've seen some strong momentum in hardware and device manufacturers. It's done well for us in the past few years and there's no real indication that we've seen any end to that growth profile,\" he said.\n\"But there are competitors all around the world. If you're looking to invest in these companies, [ask] is it unique? Will it provide capabilities that others don't have?\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-09-21T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:20:14.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
