I see a student in High School takes umbrage that there are rules regarding length of his hair!\nPolice are being taken out and shot in cold blood - students riot and set fire to vehicles and buildings. We (In my time) had utmost respect for our teachers and took pride in following school rules - we looked up to and admired the teachers - we looked up to and respected the police.\nThose at university gave thanks to their parents or had bursaries (if they were smart enough) to go to Varsity - by spending long hours studying.\nToday they throw human waste around to make a point, put burning tyres around necks.\nRape 3 year olds and 93 year olds. What has happened to the morals of our people? Today!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:35:30.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
