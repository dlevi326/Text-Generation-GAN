The app, MotoCarma, monitors speeding against posted limits, traffic signal risks, rolling stops and phone use while driving. The results are processed to provide behavior-based recommendations to drivers on how to improve. Teen driver crash rates have led to the adoption of Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) provisions in every state. GDL includes a Learner’s Permit phase designed to provide teens with more opportunities for driving practice. The Motolingo app automatically uses GDL requirements from the teen driver’s state to set up goals and coaches them as they progress to completion. The feedback targets behaviors with the highest risk for accidents. Speeding is a factor in over 30 percent of accidents with intersections and distractions each contributing to approximately 20 percent of car crashes in the U.S.\nThe software incorporates technology that was developed in partnership with the Injury Prevention Center at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center. The mobile platform on which the apps are built manages smartphone sensors, integration of external data content, operating system variations and optional vehicle connectivity. “I wanted to think about the features that would help teen driving safety the most. We were able to bring in data from multiple sources to do that on Android and iPhone without the hassles of developing the technology,” states Kevin Borrup, JD, MPA and Associate Director of the Injury Prevention Center at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center.\nThe app provides a non-distracting display while driving that reminds teens to not use the phone. The app will detect if the driver exits the program and records the results. “This app is not heavy-handed teen tracking though,” says Motolingo President Charles Nesser. “Teens have an incentive to record their drives to get a license,” says Nesser.\nThe platform supports rebranding and customization for personal driving safety, commercial fleet, usage-based insurance discounts and other applications. “The open, flexible and affordable platform can get telematics into as many cars as possible for safer roads,” states Nesser.
