Coders, developers, designers, entrepreneurs, hardware hackers, UX and UI specialists and others will come together and brainstorm over a couple of days to build out their ideas on the future of broadcasting.\nPartners include Twitter , Amazon , Monterosa , Genius Digital , Beatgrid Media and Streamzilla . Driven by the IBC project management team and the Hackitarians , the IBC Hackfest will offer thousands of euros in prizes, three days of hacking, livecoding contests, algorave-style performances by Alex McLean and other international audiovisual artists, two nights of accommodation at the venue and the opportunity to show work to some of Europe’s top players in the broadcast community.\n“Here at IBC we are always looking to bring innovation to the show floor amongst our many Feature Areas. We are particularly excited about the first ever Hackfest at IBC 2015 which will see the next generation of young industry experts pitch against each other in a bid to create something original and state of the art,” said Mike Crimp, CEO of IBC.\nBy tapping into API’s and SDK’s made available by technology companies currently, as well as scores of publicly available APIs, developers can work together with other participants to cultivate new ways of tackling old problems. Brainstorming together over the three days can of course also result in new friendships, new networks and most importantly, new products and services.\n“We are really thankful for our partners and IBC getting behind the concept of real time innovation and hacking to make this all possible,” said Hackitarians founder Richard Kastelein. “This is not only a brilliant opportunity for IBC Hackfest participants to get their ideas and present them to a group of influential judges and win some serious cash, it’s a great opportunity for our partners to reach out to a younger demographic of innovators and enhance their own developer communities as well as find new human resources for the future.\nThe IBC Hackfest was created to help drive innovation in both the old and the new realm of broadcast entertainment.\nSlogan: IBC HACKFEST – Media Convergence and the Future of Audiovisual Content Creation, Distribution, and Monetisation\nShort description:\nThe first IBC Hackfest is slated to kick off at IBC2015 in the Netherlands from August 11-13, in the heart of the RAI venue in Hall 5.
