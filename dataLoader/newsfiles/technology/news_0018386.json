Product demonstrations will include non-contact eddy current, confocal, laser profile and capacitive displacement sensors, as well as colour measurement sensors and the latest thermal imaging cameras. \nVisitors are also encouraged to share their design and application challenges with experts from Micro-Epsilon, who will offer their technical support, advice and guidance on selecting the most appropriate measuring technique for different applications. Visitors can also learn about Micro-Epsilon’s involvement in the BLOODHOUND SSC Project, where non-contact laser displacement sensors have performed flawlessly in both on-vehicle ride height tests at Jaguar and in high speed (up to 1,1000mph) wheel spin tests at Rolls-Royce. Smart 2D/3D laser profile analysis \nThe scanCONTROL 2610-25 SMART series of 2D/3D laser profile sensors offer a plug-and-play solution on the integrated sensor controller for simple measurement tasks such as step, angle, seam and groove inspection. SMART sensors are configured for these tasks using software and operate in standalone mode. Pre-programmed measurement applications include, for example, the recognition and tracking of angles, steps and positions, as well as the detection of adhesive beads, weld seams or grooves with dynamic tracking. In addition to measurement output via Ethernet (Modbus TCP) and RS422 (Modbus RTU or ASCII data format), switching outputs and analogue outputs are available via an optional Output unit. Colour measurement system \nThe stand will also feature a demonstration of the ACS7000 online colour measurement system, which not only recognises reference colours by comparison, but also identifies individual colours from their coordinates in the colour space. With its very high measurement speed, the system is suitable for a wide range of inline measuring tasks where colours and shades have to be examined on-the-fly and to very high accuracies. The system is equally suitable for offline R&D laboratory applications. Existing applications include automotive paint inspection, colour measurement of car interiors, forensics, printing, medical technology, and in the processing of plastics, wood, veneer and textiles. Eddy current controller with auto-calibration \nThe eddyNCDT 3100 represents a world first in eddy current displacement measurement. With its Smart Sensor Auto Calibration system, visitors can see how easily and quickly the sensor connects to the 3100 controller. All calibration data is then automatically uploaded from the sensor to the controller, with no need for any lengthy calibration. All calibration data required for both ferrous (St37) and non-ferrous (aluminium) target materials is stored in the sensor before it is shipped. User-specific target materials can also be measured accurately using Micro-Epsilon’s push-button, 3-point linearisation. Measuring to nanometre resolution \nThe capabilities of the high precision, integrated capacitive displacement measuring system – the capaNCDT 6200 – will be demonstrated on the stand by measuring the deflection of granite stone to nanometre accuracy (resolution is down to 0.002µm). The capaNCDT 6200 comprises a control unit, demodulator and Ethernet interface that supports fast and easy configuration through a web browser. The system allows up to four additional measurement channels to be added (or removed) to the base controller unit without any loss of performance or disruption. Any Micro-Epsilon capacitive displacement sensor can be connected to the controller without any additional calibration required. Best-in-class thermal imager \nThe smallest VGA-resolution infrared camera available today, the thermoIMAGER TIM 640 has dimensions of 45x56x90mm and weighs just 320g. Compared to other similar-size cameras, the TIM 640 is the only camera that enables the recording of radiometric video images at 32Hz and a VGA resolution of 640x480 pixels. The camera can detect very small temperature differences (thermal sensitivity: 75mK) and can measure object temperatures from -20°C to +900°C. \nFor more information or to book an appointment on the stand, please call the Micro-Epsilon sales department on 0151 355 6070 or email info@micro-epsilon.co.uk About Micro-Epsilon \nMicro-Epsilon is a major global manufacturer of sensors, headquartered in Germany.
