The 2016 1.0 portfolio includes the industry’s first hybrid modelling solution allowing integration of both polygonal and precise data, enhanced and extended support for multi-CAD environments, and integration of 3DEXPERIENCE Platform technology with 3D ACIS Modeler as part of a unified portfolio. \nThis unified portfolio includes integration of the 3D ACIS Modeler and Constraint Design Solver (CDS), additional integration for visualization, providing seamless implementation of HOOPS Visualize with Spatial’s 3D modelling technologies, as well as continued integration to improve data translation results. \n“There are many changes happening in the industry today; technology enablers like cloud, mobile and 3D Printing, as well as new business models, forms of investment and growth, and company expansion into non-traditional markets. We recognise these shifts and continue to drive solutions to enable our customers to stay on top of these trends,“ explained Linda Lokay, Vice President Marketing & Alliances Spatial Corp. “This latest release focuses on key technology challenges for additive and subtractive manufacturing, analysis, and cloud mobility. Our 2016 1.0 release delivers enhancements and unification of our existing portfolio. We are also expanding upon traditional 3D B-rep modelling by offering CGM Polyhedra, a fully integrated polyhedral extension of Dassault Systèmes technology.” \nCGM Polyhedra is an add-on to the 3D ACIS Modeler combining the power of polyhedral and B-rep modelling. Utilising the same interfaces that 3D ACIS Modeler users are already familiar with, existing and new customers can rapidly integrate approximated polyhedral data to their 3D printing, subtractive manufacturing, analysis, and many other workflows. \nOther new features includes comprehensive, inherent feature recognition, including holes and fillets to allow users to improve their processes by extracting these features and optimising the manufacturing paths. Spatial also continues to iterate upon the 3D ACIS Modeler, including new failsafe operations, enhanced Boolean capabilities, improved checking, and healing functions, as well as powerful stitching capabilities. \nNext generation CGM HLR has also been updated to enable users to rapidly produce high quality hidden line views, engineering drawings, and technical illustrations. \nThe latest edition also features extended CAD data support and capabilities.
