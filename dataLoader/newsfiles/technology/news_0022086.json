The training was very hands-on allowing operators to gain a higher level of understanding of the equipment, its features and operational deployment. \nTraining concluded with a 'field exercise' where operators were tested on their knowledge and application of all features and functions of the PRC-2090 systems. \nBarrett operations and field support manager Mr Rob Tweed commented: \"It was a pleasure to have worked with this class and with the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) as a whole. \n\"The SA Army Signal Formation team again showed high levels of experience and knowledge, which will help ensure effective installation and operational communication of Barrett Communications equipment whilst SANDF troops are deployed on the ground.\" Follow Us:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T22:45:29.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
