This newest business solution from Universal Companies will provide multi-level retail consulting and a greatly expanded retail product selection for their customers.\nAbingdon, VA\nGood news for the spa and resort industry, as well as for retail spa vendors: Spa supplier Universal Companies has acquired À la Mode Partners, a retail resource focused on spa retail products and marketing. À la Mode Partners—the brainchild of Founder and CEO Tracie Wertz and Chief Marketing Officer Bill Barczy—will bring a collective 40 years of retail expertise and products to the Abingdon, Virginia spa supplier.\n“À la Mode is a perfect fit for Universal Companies and we are thrilled to welcome them, ” says Universal Companies CEO Brenda Elliott. “Bringing Tracie and Bill on board will enhance our mission of delivering innovative spa solutions to maximize our customers’ success. Their background and knowledge in the spa and resort industry combined with the expansive retail collection they bring with them will help our customers embrace retail sales and increase their profits like never before.”\nWhat can Universal Companies and À la Mode do for spas?\nÀ la Mode applies proven retail strategies to the non-traditional spa retail environment for optimum results. “We want to be your retail partner,” Wertz explains to spas. “Our goal is to help YOU drive incremental, profitable revenue. We can quickly diagnose and overcome your retail challenges to provide you with immediate and long-term solutions and measurable growth. And when we help you become better at retail, you’ll have more time to focus on the rest of your business.”\nBarczy adds, “Our passion is retail because a spa’s profit is so closely tied to retail. The opportunity is huge, but it’s also challenging because spa operators often don’t have the background, time, or finances to put into retail. We understand that, and so we provide the basic building blocks of retail management: the right principles, products, and promotions at the right time.”\nWith four levels of consulting services, from complimentary assessment to full blown, custom corporate consulting, À la Mode recognizes and addresses the fact that every spa is unique and has different goals. Whether you need a fresh perspective, minor tweaks to your existing program, or a complete retail overhaul, Universal Companies and À la Mode will provide service in all areas of retail management.\nEmerging, Trendy, & Eco-Chic\nIn addition to retail guidance, À la Mode and Universal Companies will be the premiere retail resource for approximately 75 emerging, trendy, and eco-chic brands outside of skin care that inspire spontaneous purchases, client retention, and consumer connection. Wertz says, “This portfolio of products offers variety, promotional opportunities, and seasonal shifts to give you an exciting range of items that will keep your clients coming in frequently. Most of the vendors we work with have strong sustainability stories, are made in the USA, have charitable or community missions, are promotion-savvy, and provide enticing, on-trend products to keep inventory moving.”\nUniversal Companies customers will get their first look at the new retail offerings when the 2016 edition of The Spa Resource Book is launched next spring. The annual catalog is one of the most comprehensive resources available to spas. In addition to professional products, supplies, and equipment, the 2016 edition will feature more than 40 brands encompassing hundreds of consumer products in a greatly expanded collection designed to provide spas with a multitude of options for increasing revenue through retail sales.\nRetail vendors, especially those for emerging brands, also face challenges penetrating the spa market.
