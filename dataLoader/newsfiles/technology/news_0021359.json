On Thursday, however, she dropped her claims against the firm for what she said were financial reasons: “I cannot afford the risk of even more costs to fight against a firm with tremendous financial resources and massive legal and PR armies.” More Airey departs from Yahoo \nIn a statement, Kleiner said it was “glad to put this trial behind us,” adding: “There is no question diversity in the workplace is an important issue. KPCB remains committed to supporting women and minorities in venture capital and technology both inside our firm and within our industry.” \nMs Pao had claimed that she had been unfairly passed over for promotion, shut out of important meetings and subjected to unwanted sexual advances. \nThe firm denied the allegations and partners testified that she had not shown the initiative needed to move from a largely administrative role to become an investment partner at one of the best-known venture firms in Silicon Valley. \nEarlier this year, a court awarded Kleiner $276,000 in legal fees, and Ms Pao said in a statement that she would pay the costs. However, the firm had offered to waive the costs if Ms Pao dropped her appeal . \nShaking the Silicon Valley boys’ club \nRead more \nIt emerged three months ago that she had sought $2.7m in a settlement from the firm. \nThis week, she hinted that she had chosen to walk away from a settlement, though Kleiner had already said it had “no intention” of agreeing to her terms: “Settlement might have provided me with financial benefits, but only at the great cost of silence. To quote their lawyer, ‘KP is not interested in a settlement without a non disparagement provision,’ meaning I would not be free to speak the truth about my experiences.” I refuse to be silent on these important issues \n- Ellen Pao \nRaising the prospect of further potential embarrassment for Kleiner in the future as she continues to look for new platforms to make her case, Ms Pao said: “I refuse to be silent on these important issues.” \nThe case served to draw attention to the low representation of women in senior and technical roles in Silicon Valley and has contributed to a wider debate about staffing in the tech industry. \n“I feel gratified that my actions have encouraged others to speak up about discrimination in venture capital and technology more broadly,” Ms Pao said. “I am encouraged that companies are taking more action to quantify and address the disparity of opportunities for women and minorities.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
