Jasco donated 1,000 4-packs of GE branded Window/Door Alarm Kits to the NAA’s Big Red Safety Teacher Toolkit®. \nThe National Autism Association is a parent-run advocacy organization committed to providing resources and support for families and children affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). According to NAA research, 29 percent of wandering incidents happen from a classroom or school. In addition to other security products, the Big Red Safety Teacher Toolkit includes Jasco’s GE Branded Wireless Alarms as well as other helpful tools and printed educational materials for teachers. The recently announced program will be helping teachers of students with autism across the country with the free-of-charge safety toolkits. \n“Having these resources go out to 1,000 schools across the country can potentially save the lives of countless children,” said Wendy Fournier, President of the National Autism Association. “We are so grateful to Jasco for their extremely generous donation of the alarms. I can’t even begin to express how touched we are.” \nJasco’s 4-pack alarm kits can significantly reduce the risk of children with autism wandering away from school classrooms and help give family members and teachers peace of mind. The wireless alarms are easy to install and can be attached to doors, windows, cabinets, gates and more. Teachers will be alerted when specific windows or doors are opened, immediately knowing if the student has left the classroom or building. Those first few minutes can be life saving.

The Big Red Safety Kit program was developed to equip caregivers and educators with the necessary tools and resources to help them take the proper precautions to keep children safe. Since 2012, the NAA has provided toolkits to 18,000 families and children with autism. School administrators and teachers of individuals diagnosed with autism may apply for the free Big Red Safety Teacher Toolkit here . \nRegardless of any tools already in place, if an individual’s medical condition interferes with their ability to recognize danger or stay safe, it is critical to maintain close supervision and security in all settings.
