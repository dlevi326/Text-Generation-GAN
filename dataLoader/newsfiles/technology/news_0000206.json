The latest analysis suggests the new development occurred in recent weeks. \nUS Pacific Command commander admiral Harry Harris was quoted by USNI News saying: \"If you look at all of these facilities, and you could imagine a network of missiles sites, runways for their fifth generation fighters and surveillance sites and all that, it creates a mechanism in which China would have de facto control over the South China Sea in any scenario short of war.\" \nAccording to IHS Jane's analysis, China continue to build multiple structures on the island, including a seawall in the harbour, and concrete road networks. \nThe analysis sees dumping of topsoil along the side of the runway as the first attempts to grow food on the island or could be the start of landscaping designed to prevent erosion. \nThe report also revealed that China completed works on the smaller islands at Hughes, McKennan, Johnson South, Cuateron, and Gaven reefs and intalled communication and military hardware. Dredging still continues at Subi and Mischief Reefs. \nImage: Images taken on 20 September shows the presence of helipads and bearings painted on the 3,125m-long runway on the island.
