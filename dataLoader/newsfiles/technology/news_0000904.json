Related Content You can now watch Netflix on a... \nVisiting Silicon Valley this weekend, Modi sat down Sunday with Mark Zuckerberg at a townhall style meeting at Facebook's headquarters. \nModi, who has 15.2 million Twitter followers and 30 million likes on his Facebook page, said social media is a key tool for diplomacy. He's an avid poster and frequently shares pictures and information from his meetings. \nZuckerberg said Modi is \"setting an example\" for how world leaders should connect with their citizens. \nBut there are about one billion people in India -- or 80% of its population -- without Internet access. Zuckerberg said connecting them is one of \"the greatest opportunities available to humanity today.\" \nHe said it also played a key role in his own education. Modi comes from a poor family and worked as a tea seller in his youth. \n\"I wasn't fortunate enough to get a lot of knowledge, but I was able to make up for that through social media,\" he said. \"That was how my world was able to move, it brought about a big change in my way of thinking.\" \nModi is spending two days on the West Coast to take a closer look at what America's red-hot tech industry is made of. He wants India to have its own Silicon Valley, hoping startups will create jobs and restart economic growth in the country. \nModi's trip to the West Coast is the first for an Indian prime minister in 33 years. \nOn Saturday, he visited with Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk and toured a Tesla facility. Modi also met with Apple CEO Tim Cook and other top chief executives including Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sundar Pichai of Google. \nHe gave a speech about Digital India, his initiative to improve technology and connectivity in his country. \n\"There may be still some who see the digital economy as the tool of the rich, educated and the privileged,\" Modi said. \"But, ask the taxi driver or the corner vendor in India what he has gained from his cell phone, and the debate gets settled.\" \nAhead of Modi's visit, Zuckerberg changed his profile picture -- and created a filter for other Facebook users to do the same -- to support the initiative. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
