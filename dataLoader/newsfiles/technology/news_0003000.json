The stamped lamella band ensures high contact reliability and optimum conductive properties. \nThe slotted ODU TURNTAC is extremely robust and features four contact surfaces between pin and socket. Therefore, if plugged in at an angle up to 5Â°, this connector will still function reliably. \nThe newest member of the ODU family, is the ODU STAMPTAC, designed for use in IEC charging plugs. The contact parts of the stamped contact, have a high process reliability, and they are ready for further automated processing. \n\"With a high level of expertise in development and manufacturing of high-quality electrical connectors, we are constantly expanding our portfolio,\" Espertshuber added. \n\"In doing so, we test new economical materials and surfaces while retaining high electrical conductivity.\" \nFor further information on ODU and its contact technology series please visit the company website.
