CONNECT, a premier innovation company accelerator in San Diego that creates and scales great companies in the technology and life sciences sectors, continues its twenty-eight year tradition of celebrating innovation leaders in the local San Diego community. \nVoIP Armor easily installs as a VoIP gateway in the network shields the VoIP traffic against any type of WAN link performance fluctuations and link failures. The technology relies on two or more Internet links to protect the VoIP packets against loss, delay and jitter as well as against starvation from other cross traffic, by dynamically and in-real-time steering VoIP packets around network problems. The end result is that VoIP calls are highly reliable and consistent in call quality. VoIP Armor also boosts simultaneous call capacity because of the increased WAN bandwidth of the bonded Internet lines. VoIP Armor is also available as a software module for Truffle , Mushroom Networks' award winning Broadband Bonding appliance. \n\"We are honored to be a finalist in CONNECT's Most Innovative New Products Award, and are thrilled to be among such a distinguished group of companies,\" said Cahit Akin, CEO of Mushroom Networks. \"Plenty of enterprises want to take advantage of all that VoIP offers, but quality and reliability can be inconsistent. VoIP Armor directly addresses and solves those problems by creating a bonded IP tunnel that shields against negative network conditions in a very affordable way.\" \nWinners were selected from the following eight categories: Aerospace, Security & Cyber Technologies, Cleantech, Communications & IT, Life Science Diagnostics & Research Tools, Mobile Apps, Pharmaceutical Drugs & Medical Devices, Software & Digital Media and Sport & Active Lifestyle Technologies.
