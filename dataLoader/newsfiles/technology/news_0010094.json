First, #talkingtechLIVE sits down with former Apple publicist Andy Cunningham and Henry Hwong from Cunningham Collective, Andy Nielsen (Everything But The House), Vrideo's Alex Rosenfeld, Chris Vaughn from Saucey and Taskeasy's Karl Sowa.\nNext, USA TODAY Tech staff (Laura Mandaro, Jon Swartz and Marco della Cava) in San Francisco takes on Siri vs. Google, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's mini maternity leave and lousy Wifi in schools, with Atipica CEO Laura Gomez, EducationSuperHighway CEO Evan Marwell, and Philz CEO Jacob Jaber.\nWe visited Salt Lake City this week for a report (coming soon) on the thriving tech scene in the Beehive State. While there, we stopped by Goal Zero, a company which specializes in solar powered products, and got the opportunity to do our first ever podcast from a tent. A solar powered tent.\nAlso from Salt Lake: a look at new bluetooth earbuds from Jaybird.\nIn nearby Lehi, Utah, we went to a test smart home of the future at Vivint, where we asked about when home automation will go mass market.\nThe #talkingtechLIVE podcast airs live every Thursday at 8 p.m. ET on TuneIn. the Deep Dive podcast runs every Friday.\n13 CONNECT 67 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1UyZ6nr TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635770563615054889-tune-in-andy-105-of-150-.jpg", "http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/usa-today/talking-tech", "https://soundcloud.com/usatodaytech", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UyZ6nr&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/16aa7d20b4dcd21cf0c9b487f5f6b4637181db64/c=277-0-4621-3266&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635770563615054889-tune-in-andy-105-of-150-.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UyZ6nr&text=Weekend%20listening%20-%20Apple%20preview%2C%20Siri%20vs.%20Google%2C%20Mayer%27s%20maternity%20leave&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1UyZ6nr"], "published": "2015-09-05T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T19:20:11.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
