CandyShell Grip is one of Speck's most popular and best-selling cases, and it balances both protection and style so consumers never have to compromise on either. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150929/272066 \nThe outside of CandyShell Grip is covered in a series of raised rubber ridges to give consumers a no-slip grip on the new Nexus smartphones. A patented dual-layer design combines a hard exterior to disperse impact with a soft, rubbery interior to absorb shock. This unique construction allows CandyShell Grip to pack military-grade protection into an unobtrusive, slim case that perfectly complements the new Nexus devices. \nTo provide extra protection for the larger 5.7\" screen on Nexus 6P and the 5.2\" screen on Nexus 5X, CandyShell Grip has a raised bezel that shields the glass from impact and allows you to lay your phone on its face without sliding. \nCandyShell Grip incorporates Speck's Seven Signs of Protection without Compromise: -- Military-grade protection -- Patented one-piece, multi-layer design -- Patented raised bezel screen protection -- Precision-engineered slim fit -- Perimeter port and camera protection -- Lab-tested durability -- Responsive button protection \nCandyShell Grip will be coming soon for both Nexus 5X ($34.99) and Nexus 6P ($39.99).
