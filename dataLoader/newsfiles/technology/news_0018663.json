We develop social and skill games for all types of players. Our App Store games include triVios, a trivia competition app where players win real prizes, and Hey Bye, an action packed, tile smashing game. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150902/263304 \nOur upcoming release, MuncherMan, is an arcade classic designed specifically for the Apple Watch. You control your Muncher via buttons on the Apple Watch or the iPhone swipe controls, making MuncherMan the only Apple Watch game to keep all gameplay on the watch and use the iPhone as a second screen. \nThere are three Muncher avatars to choose from or you can upload your own picture to devour through the Muncher world as yourself. Also, you can design your own maze at muncherman.net . If our team approves, we'll add it to the game! \nMedia Contact: Andrew Nadhir, Purple Gator, 248-421-1158, andrew@purplegator.net \nNews distributed by PR Newswire iReach: https://ireach.prnewswire.com \nSOURCE Purple Gator", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T17:48:57.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
