But increased reliance on technology alone is not the cure-all. It must be accompanied by robust cybersecurity education, training and certification for IT professionals.\" \nCompTIA's 2015 Trends in Information Security study found that more than half of the companies surveyed said greater interconnectivity of devices has complicated their security. \n\"As organizations have mbraced cloud computing and mobile technology solutions, they've extended their security perimeter, creating new security considerations,\" said Seth Robinson , senior director, technology analysis, CompTIA. \"Legacy security systems and practices are often not sufficient to protect this expanded perimeter.\" \nCompTIA is at the forefront of cybersecurity protections, with best practices and credentials for organizations; certifications for IT professionals; and soon, cybersecurity awareness training for anyone who touches a PC, laptop, smartphone or tablet. \nCompTIA certification holders who attend \"The State of Security\" webinar will earn Continuing Education credit toward renewal of their CompTIA A+ , Network+ , Security+ or CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner certifications. \nTo register for the free webinar, visit https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&referrer=&eventid=1037163&sessionid=1&key=DC9A5D4A701E5FEDE34301119D3A8D15&sourcepage=register . \nWith more than two million certifications awarded, CompTIA is the leading provider of vendor-neutral skills certifications and education for the world's IT workforce.
