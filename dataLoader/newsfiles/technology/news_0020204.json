These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements. Among other things, completion of the Pace acquisition is subject to satisfaction of a number of conditions outside of ARRIS's control, including receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, and the approval of the shareholders of ARRIS and Pace; ARRIS may fail to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition of Pace; there may be negative effects relating to any future announcements relating to the transaction; and ARRIS may incur significant transaction costs and/or unknown liabilities with respect to the acquisition. These factors are not intended to be an all-encompassing list of risks and uncertainties that may affect the proposed combination and/or ARRIS's business. Additional information regarding these and other factors can be found in ARRIS's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-Q for the year ended June 30, 2015. In providing forward-looking statements, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update publicly or otherwise these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. \nNo Offer or Solicitation \nThis Report is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell, or an invitation to subscribe for, purchase or exchange any securities or the solicitation of any vote or approval in any jurisdiction, nor shall there be any sale, issuance, exchange or transfer of the securities referred to in this document in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. \nImportant Additional Information Regarding the Pace Transaction Filed With the SEC \nIn connection with the proposed acquisition of Pace, it is expected that the shares of ARRIS International (\"New ARRIS\") to be issued by New ARRIS to Pace shareholders under the scheme will be issued in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof. In connection with the issuance of New ARRIS shares to ARRIS stockholders pursuant to the merger that forms a part of the transaction, New ARRIS has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that contains a prospectus of New ARRIS as well as a proxy statement of ARRIS relating to the merger that forms a part of the combination, which we refer to together as the Form S-4/Proxy Statement. \nINVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE FORM S-4/PROXY STATEMENT AND OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY, BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRANSACTION, THE PARTIES TO THE TRANSACTION AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSACTION. Those documents, if and when filed, as well as ARRIS's and New ARRIS's other public filings with the SEC may be obtained without charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and at ARRIS'S website at http://ir.arris.com.

Information about the directors and executive officers of ARRIS is set forth in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was filed with the SEC on February 27, 2015, and its proxy statement for its 2015 annual meeting of shareholders, which was filed with the SEC on April 9, 2015. Other information regarding potential participants in the proxy solicitations and a description of their direct and indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, is contained in the Form S-4/Proxy Statement. \nPace and New ARRIS are each organized under the laws of England and Wales. Some of the officers and directors of Pace and New ARRIS are residents of countries other than the United States. As a result, it may not be possible to sue Pace, New ARRIS or such persons in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Pace, New ARRIS and their respective affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court or for investors to enforce against them the judgments of US courts. \nARRIS and the ARRIS Logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of ARRIS Enterprises, Inc.
