The browser, which was being bogged down by memory problems, was updated to make pages load faster and scrolling smoother. As the company announced , the new-and-improved \"Chrome 45\" has a number of fresh tricks to save memory and power. For instance, tabs are automatically restored from most to least recently viewed, if you quit unexpectedly. If your computer is running low on resources, the browser will stop restoring the rest of your tabs to save you memory. The other, more significant memory-saving technique is that Chrome can now detect when a webpage isn't busy being used, and use the free time to aggressively clean up old, unused memory. The Google team found that this reduced website memory usage by 10pc on average. “With Gmail, for example, we can free up nearly a quarter of the memory used by the tab,” they wrote. To save power, Chrome will auto-pause Flash content that isn’t central to the webpage. According to the team, tests showed a saving of upto 15pc battery power. How to upgrade Feeling convinced, but don’t know how to upgrade manually? If you’re eligible, here’s how to get it going. If you're on a computer , find the three-lined menu in the top right corner of Chrome. If there's an update available for your system, you'll be able to see an option that says \"Update Google Chrome.\" Click it, then click \"Restart.\" All your windows and tabs will be saved for the next time you re-open the browser. On Google Chrome's iPhone and iPad apps , you should be able to find an update to the latest version inside the \"Updates\" tab in the App Store. If the update is available but hasn't been applied yet, touch \"Update All.\" The Google Chrome update will download and install. And on the Android app for Google Chrome, just touch the Play Store icon and click on \"My Apps.\" If you see an app with an available update, it will be listed under \"Update.\" If it's there, just touch it to download and install the update. You can also tweak your preferences in case you want future updates downloaded automatically within the Play Store settings. @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T10:50:47.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
