The idea is to incentivise communication between employees using a rewards system and the points gained can be redeemed by users at a number of participating online retailers.\nAccording to Reffind, the transaction gives it an immediate entry into the US market, where WooBoard has more than 10 clients, including MetLife and Ultra Mobile.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Reffind will offer $1.25 million in scrip to WooBoard’s shareholders -- Pollenizer, Southern Cross Venture Partners and Elevation Capital -- six months following the completion of the acquisition.\nThere’s also an additional component of an earn-out of between 900,000 and 2.9 million Reffind shares, with the option assessed on a sliding scale 12 months from completion of deal and is dependent on WooBoard achieving set revenue milestones.\nWooBoard chairman and Pollenizer co-founder Mick Liubinskas will join the Reffind board as a non-executive director.\nThe Reffind buyout is the second successful exit for Pollenizer following the $40m acquisition of its group buying site Spreets by Yahoo!7 in 2011.\nWooBoard was developed inside Pollenizer as part of a team bootcamp called 2D2R (2 Days to Release).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T06:06:33.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
