The two main ways selfie-takers were killed this year: falling or getting hit by a train. Among the consequences of the daredevil selfie craze: landmarks and events have started banning selfie sticks or selfies entirely, a park shut down because of people taking selfies with bears , and, as Conde Nast reports, the European Union even proposed making certain types of selfies (those containing a landmark) a crime. Russia's Interior Ministry even instituted a campaign warning of the danger of selfies, Reuters reported earlier this month. Al Jazeera has a picture of the ministry's leaflet, which actually includes the lines \"A cool selfie could cost you your life\" and \"A selfie with a weapon kills.\" Says an aide to the interior minister, \"Before taking a selfie, everyone should think about the fact that racing after a high number of 'likes' could lead him on a journey to death and his last extreme photo could turn out to be posthumous.\" Actress Michelle Monaghan, left, and designer and stylist Rachel Zoe take a \"selfie\" before the Altuzarra Spring 2016 show during Fashion Week, Saturday, Sept. 12, 2015, in New York.
