But he said if anyone is buried there it is likely Kia, believed by some Egyptologists to be King Tut's mother. Egypt's Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty, left, and Nicholas Reeves, a British Egyptologist affiliated with the Egyptian expedition at the University of Arizona, centre, visit the Valley of the Kings in Luxor, Egypt, Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2015. El-Damaty said King Tut's tomb may contain hidden chambers, lending support to the British Egyptologist's theory that a queen may be buried in the walls of the 3,300 year-old pharaonic mausoleum. (Nariman El-Mofty/Associated Press) \nHigh-resolution images of King Tut's tomb \"revealed several very interesting features which look not at all natural, features like very, very straight lines which are 90 degrees to the ground, positioned so as to correspond with other features within the tomb,\" Reeves said during the visit. \nThese features would have been difficult to capture with the naked eye, he said. Possible hidden doorways \nReeves said the walls could conceal two unexplored doorways, one of which perhaps leads to Nefertiti's tomb. He also argues that the design of the tomb suggests it was built for a queen, rather than a king. \nEl-Damaty said he will seek final approval for a radar inspection of the tomb. \nNefertiti, famed for her beauty and who was the subject of a famous 3,300-year-old bust, was the primary wife of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, who tried and failed to switch Egypt to an early form of monotheism. Akhenaten was succeeded by a pharaoh referred to as Smenkhare and then Tut, who is widely believed to have been Akhenaten's son. \nReeves believes that Smenkhare is actually Nefertiti. \n\"Nefertiti disappears ... according to the latest inscriptions just being found,\" said Reeves. \"I think that Nefertiti didn't disappear, she simply changed her name.\" Foreign diplomats and Egyptologists attend the opening of an exact replica of the Tomb of Tutkankhamun in Luxor , Egypt in 2014. The original, nearly intact tomb, was discovered by Howard Carter and George Herbert in 1922. (Khalil Hamra/Associated Press) \nAfter Nefertiti died, Tut buried her, and then when he died someone decided to extend the tomb, Reeves suggested. \"Since Nefertiti had been buried a decade before, they remembered that tomb was there and they thought, well, perhaps we can extend it,\" he said. \nThe 1922 discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb filled with artifacts, including the famed golden funeral mask, made him known the world over, and boosted interest in that era, called the Amarna period. \nWhile inscriptions in tombs provide some information, they are not always helpful in clarifying a pharaoh's lineage. \n\"In the case of royal tombs they're not dealing with mortal life. They're dealing with the beyond,\" said Reeves, adding that writing things such as the family tree \"is just irrelevant.\" \nInstead, these inscriptions include things such as \"spells to enable the deceased to reach the lands of the gods,\" said Reeves. This means Egyptologists use a number of factors to develop theories, leading to divisions among experts about the period. \n\"Every Egyptologist has got a different view on the Amarna period, because we have a lot of evidence to discuss but not just quite enough to make a final decision,\" said Reeves. \n\"If we find something extra, even one small new inscription would be a great bonus, it could change everything,\" said Reeves. \nTut, Nefertiti, and Akhenaten's family led Egypt during one of its most turbulent times that ended with a military takeover by Egypt's top general at the time, Horemheb. \n\"Egypt basically fell apart under Akhenaten and it was the military that pulled it all together again,\" said Reeves, adding that Egyptians wiped out Tut's name from official records of pharaohs. \nHoremheb \"made laws to control the country and to fight against the corruption, against the police who were corrupted, against the high officials,\" said Mohamed Saleh, a former director of the Egyptian Museum who was also touring the site. \nTourism Minister Hesham Zazou said he hopes the new discovery willrevive tourism in ancient Egyptian sites. Tourism at Red Sea beach resorts is rebounding after years of turmoil following the 2011 ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, said Zazou, but otherwise \"tourism is suffering tremendously.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:13:12.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
