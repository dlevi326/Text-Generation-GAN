RELATED NEW DELHI: The country's competition watchdog has initiated an investigation against a leading taxi aggregator for predatory pricing leading to unfair business practices, a move that potentially opens a new battlefront for the fledgling sector that is already facing headwinds from multiple regulators. \"We have received information from Bangalore against one of the taxi aggregators. It was alleged that the company was aggressively cutting prices and it was going to cost a lot of stress for competition in the taxi space,\" said Competition Commission of India (CCI) chairman Ashok Chawla in response to a query on whether the regulator was probing taxi aggregator firms. He did not name the company. The commission has asked its director general to investigate the matter. If the probe reveals any abuse of dominance found, the regulator can slap a penalty of up to 10% of the company's three year annual average turnover. The taxi aggregator sector already faces a raft of issues, with regulators and state governments cracking down on it for issues ranging from the kind of vehicles they operate to driver verification. It has also attracted the ire of the traditional taxi industry which claims these aggregators offer hefty discounts to customers and incentives to drivers to expand their business. \"Basically, the point of determination for commission will be whether the party has dominance in the market. And if their pricing is below cost there will be a case under the Competition Act,\" Chawla told reporters at the Indian Women's Press Corps in Delhi. Chalwa also said India's aviation industry too could be a potential case for cartelization. \"We have looked into the issue of cartelization in aviation sector in the past-....Currently, we are looking into it as there was reference from a parliamentary panel,\" he said, when asked if cartelization in the airline sector was leading to higher airfares. Chawla said that market dominance per se was not wrong, but the abuse of dominance was something that needed to be corrected. On the case related to allegations of abuse of dominance by internet giant Google, which has been accused of adopting discriminatory and retaliatory trade practices in its AdWords programme, the CCI chief said the investigator in the case had submitted a report. \"This is just the beginning,\" he said, adding that the Commission will hear both the parties, study the evidence and then give a final order.
