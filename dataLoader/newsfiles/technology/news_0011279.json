Subtitled The Recovery Person's Guide to Unleashing Your Inner Power, the new edition features new chapters and updated information and addresses the question - \"So You're In Recovery - What's Next?\" The book offers useful advice, instructions and action plans to avoid relapse and help any person in recovery - or anyone looking to grow toward their full potential - create momentum in their lives, achieve measurable results and live in abundance. It also takes readers on a powerful spiritual journey of empowerment and self-discovery, starting with the author's own remarkable life. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150916/267055 \nWith brutal honesty, McAlister describes his descent into alcoholism and drugs as a young man and his subsequent life as a \"nomadic drug-addicted biker.\" A horrific motorcycle accident started McAlister on the road to recovery and the realization that he had a higher purpose. It also saved his marriage and his relationship with his son. After getting sober in 1990, the author became a successful businessman, entrepreneur, counselor and motivational speaker in the recovery community. He became a board member at Freedom House, one of the country's leading addiction treatment centers, where he worked with hundreds of clients and honed what would become his Full Recovery philosophy and programs. He published the first edition of Full Recovery in 2008 and soon after opened the Full Recovery Wellness Center in Fairfield, New Jersey. \nWhile the Full Recovery Wellness Center treats all forms of addiction, McAlister is particularly concerned about the growing and deadly heroin epidemic that is sweeping the country. \"This epidemic affects everyone,\" he says. \"Addiction is the great equalizer. It has no respect for wealth, race or social status. Eventually it brings everyone to their knees. I personally have lost many friends and relatives due to overdoses. My own sister died of a heroin overdose.\" \nIt also has changed the face of his clientele at Full Recovery Wellness Center. \"Today, 50 percent of our clients are in for heroin or opiate addiction,\" he says. \"And for those under 30 years old, the percentage grows to 80 percent.\" \nThere are several reasons why the epidemic is happening now, according to McAlister: \"The first is the easy availability of prescription opiates. The pharmaceutical industry bears a huge responsibility for this trend through marketing efforts geared to down-playing the addictive qualities of these drugs. For years, Oxycodone, Percocet, Percodan and other highly addictive opioid drugs have been over prescribed and easily available. \n\"Most of the heroin addicts we treat started by using prescription opiates,\" continues McAlister. \"Some were prescribed by an MD or dentist, others stolen from family or friends' medicine cabinets, and others purchased illegally just to party - but the party ends quickly. These drugs are highly addictive and when the supply runs out the problems get worse. Oxycodone is very expensive to buy on the street. Today's heroin is extremely cheap and extraordinarily pure by historical standards. It's pure enough to snort. When addicts can no longer afford pills, heroin becomes a viable alternative.\" \nThe Full Recovery Wellness Center program - a revolutionary, holistic approach that attends to clients' physical, emotional, spiritual, relationship, financial and career needs - has been astonishingly successful at keeping people in recovery clean and sober long-term. \nNational statistics show that 80 percent of all people leaving a traditional 28-day program relapse within 30 days and 90 percent within six months. McAlister and his team of clinicians and counselors have effectively reversed those numbers - 80 percent of their clients completing the Full Recovery program are still sober six months later and 70 percent one year later. \nMcAlister attributes this success rate to his staff, many of whom are former addicts who have been clean and sober for 25 years or more. \"To get addicts to buy into recovery, the treatment process must not only be medical, it also must be inspirational,\" he explains. \"That is where Full Recovery counselors and therapists excel. We help our clients WANT to recover. We haven't just studied recovery in a book, we have lived it. We walk our talk.\" \nFor more information about Brian McAlister and Full Recovery , visit his author's website.
