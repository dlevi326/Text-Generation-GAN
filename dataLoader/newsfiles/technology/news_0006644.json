Google also said it would stop censoring search results in China. The move was controversial, cutting Google off from the lucrative Chinese market especially on mobile.\nGoogle is reportedly forming partnerships with local companies to tailor the app store to Chinese consumers.\nMajor Chinese technology companies such as Baidu and Tencent control most of the app distribution in mainland China. Xiaomi, dubbed the \"Apple of China,\" has launched its own app store and phones.\nGoogle spokesman Matt McLernon declined to comment.\nFollow USA TODAY senior technology reporter Jessica Guynn on Twitter: @jguynn.\n45 CONNECT 185 TWEET 11 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1Uxk4mI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-nears-re-entry-to-mainland-china", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c4e2d30c7bcda20d4768768caa24589700965f5c/c=33-0-991-720&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635769721960572666-GoogleChina.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1Uxk4mI", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Uxk4mI&text=Google%20plans%20to%20return%20to%20mainland%20China%2C%20report%20says&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Uxk4mI&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635769721960572666-GoogleChina.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-04T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T17:55:22.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
