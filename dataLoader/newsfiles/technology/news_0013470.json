EnvisionTEC has announced the debut of the newest iteration of Perfactory Software, Version 3.1 for its additive manufacturing solutions. \nA number of new features and improvements are available in this version, including a more streamlined user experience, unification between all EnvisionTEC 3D printer families, upgraded support construction capabilities, and integration with the 3D-Bioplotter. \nDr. Carlos Carvalho, EnvisionTEC's 3D-Bioplotter specialist, commented: \"The previous version automatically added supports, which worked great for more casual users, but when specific designs came about that deviated from the norm, our engineers needed a much more finite level of control.\" \nAnother customer-requested update to the software is geared towards more serious users of EnvisionTEC machines. This new unified version of the software allows users to maintain their settings between different 3D printers, saving both design time, and the output should they wish to switch between the varied functionality of the 3D-Bioplotter, the DLP machines, and the 3SP machines. \nDr. Carvalho, added: \"Most of our bioengineering customers need to create multiple parts grids. The new updates allow users to then arrange these arrays in both the X and Y axes, and input the distance between parts. It's all organised onto one screen, and confirmed by using a mouse to click OK.\" \nYesterday the company also announced developments on the materials front with a new partnership with leading 3D printing materials specialist, Somos . The partnership is set to accelerate the production of high-performance materials for or heat resistance, durability, high detail resolution and dimensional stability. \nEnvisionTEC will exhibit its new solutions in stand C14 at TCT Show + Personalize on 30 th September â€“ 1 st October at NEC, Birmingham. EnvisionTEC founder and CEO, Al Siblani will present a keynote presentation at the TCT Show Conference at 10.15 on 30 th September. REGISTER FOR FREE .
