His parents are farmers, but they always believed their son would do something great. Sahu was a rank holder in his 10th and 12th boards. He qualified for the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Karnataka, completed his engineering, and came to Bengaluru in 2004 for his first job, at Alcatel-Lucent. Over the next few years, he also worked at Juniper Networks and Cisco, and did MBA at IIM Bangalore.\n\nAll through this period, he found that getting good accommodation was really difficult. \"I always thought if my family came to visit me from the village, they should see me living in a decent house and living well,\" he says. \n\nHe recalls house owners getting suspicious about him and security guards giving nasty looks whenever he reached home late from work. Last year, his sister came to Bengaluru and faced the same issues. He realized the problem wasn't restricted to boys. \n\nThat prompted Sahu to start an online platform for shared accommodation, in January this year, along with his college friends Jitendra Jagadev, Smruti Parida and Deepak Dhar. They called it Nestaway. \n\nSahu says they were a little too confident before starting up. \"We thought if people could give their gold willingly to gold banks, why wouldn't they trust us?\" Sahu says, half in jest. In the first three months, they only got four house owners to agree to offer their houses on rent on the platform, and two of them were NRIs. So they decided to spend time becoming a trust layer between these house owners and the tenants. In the next three months, they managed to get 600 houses. Now they have 1,500 tenants on the platform. They take 12% of the tenant's rent as commission, and the whole process is transparent. \n\nSahu's goal is to make the city more welcoming for the youth. Nestaway was initially funded by Naveen Tiwary , co-founder of InMobi, and IDG Ventures. It then raised $12 million from Tiger Global and Flipkart, in July. Sahu jokingly says that many of them funded them out of pity. \"I think they felt sorry for us and really wanted us to succeed.\" \n\nBut Nestaway is not the only business he runs. During their college days, the friends had worked on a cloud-based content delivery platform called Brizz TV . It was designed to provide content for competitive exams through set-top boxes. Although still in operation, they are not too focused on it. \"People don't mind spending lakhs on expensive coaching classes. But few want to spend Rs 50 on our platform,\" Sahu says. \n\nGiven the humble background from which he has come, Sahu says he has nothing more to prove to anybody . His family has always been beside him, trusting him and his decisions. Since he was always good in studies, his parents never doubted him. \"There are kids still struggling in my village. I wanted to do something more...something that would benefit my family , and people in general,\" he says.
