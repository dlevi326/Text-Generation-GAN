And historically Apple's mobile updates have been quickly adopted by the majority of users.\nEach year, the technology giant refines and improves its software and this year is no different .\nIs your device compatible? Sorry - if you've got one of these you won't be able to run iOS 9\nThe new operating system might be cutting edge, but only some of Apple's equipment will run it.\nAny iPad apart from the very first generation will be eligible to upgrade to iOS 9 but it's a different story for the humble iPod Touch. Only the latest iPod Touch will be able to download iOS 9.\nIf you're an iPhone user, then any iPhone from the 4s onwards will be able to get the new software tomorrow.\nWhat's new about it? It might look the same, but there's new features to be had\nWhile iOS 9 won't look dramatically different to the previous version, there's quite a few tweaks that you can start taking advantage of once you've installed it.\nFirstly, there's a new on-screen keyboard. It features a built-in shortcut bar to make typing quicker and easier. So you can cut, copy and paste or bold, underline and italicise with just one tap.\nThere's also a bunch of new emojis , including the controversial middle finger icon and the equally infamous taco (which has some distinctly non-culinary connotations).\nYou'll also get improved battery life thanks to a new Low Power mode.\nIt's designed to squeeze an extra hour of use from your phone by shutting down various non-essential processes.\nApple Apple Maps will now include public transport\nApple is also launching a news app that will replace Newsstand and act in a similar way to other news feeds like Flipboard and Feedly.\nIt will pull together all of the stories you want to read into a magazine-style aggregator.\nMeanwhile, Apple Maps has also been enhanced with public transport routes.\nSo you can finally check the bus and tube timetables on the move like you can with Google Maps.\niPad-specific benefits Apple The iPad will now be able to multitask\nIf you like your Apple gear a little bit larger, then there are some iPad-specific enhancements that you'll get from iOS 9.\nThere are new multitasking features for iPad meaning you can snap two apps together side by side rather than having to switch between the two - so that means you can watch a video while browsing the web or composing an email.\nSecurity and notifications What will make your iPhone more secure? That's right, six digits instead of four\nForget the old four-digit passcode. Apple is making things even more secure by upping the amount to six digits. That's on top of the fingerprint scanner available in several iDevices.\nAnd, for the first time, you can clear all the Notifications from a day simultaneously, rather than having to get rid of them on an app-by-app basis. Which is handy if, like us, you're really popular.\nWill it take up ALL my space? TNS /Landov / Barcroft Media \"I have the power!\"\nNo. Unlike iOS 8 which required around 4.5GB of storage space to install, iOS 9 should only come in at around 1.3GB.\nThat means that, especially if you've got a 16GB iPhone, you should still have some space left to actually install some apps.\nPoll loading â€¦\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-09-16T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T03:53:58.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
