People living in the north, where there is less sun light are more likely to struggle with depression and tiredness. Light therapy is often recommended for the symptoms that include stress, anxiety, lethargy and fatigue. It is not only used for minimizing the effect of winter blues because there are other benefits as well. \nFirst off, let´s start with wearables that will help you stay in a good mood even when the sun is not shining. \nThe Luminette is a pair of light therapy glasses that are simple to use. The best thing about the Luminette glasses are you can carry on with your daily choirs and you don´t have to sit and wait for a 30 minute therapy to be over. \nSimilar glasses are Sequinetic . They help to brighten up your day! If you wear them for 30 minutes per day it reduces effects of winter blues. They are designed with 6 LEDS and a reflector. The company claims that the reflector bounces soft white “daylight” around your eyes which improves your mood. \nA technology called intranasal light therapy is proven to help with Alzheimer´s diseases. \nIt is a method developed by company Vielight which channels the phototherapeutic effects of light into the body through the capillary-saturated nasal channel. The nose is located only 3 inches from the brain, which makes it an excellent source for direct brain stimulation.

This noncontagious chronic condition is caused by the overly rapid division of skin cells accompanied by painful red inflammation. The company claims that by using Blue Control for 4 months, 50 % of the symptoms can be reduced. \nWe all know sleep is very beneficial in all aspects of our live. Scientists at University of Buffalo have discovered that lung cancer patients respond better to a treatment if they get enough sleep. Sleep deprivation is where the problem lies, because of breathing related difficulties. Most patients’ can´t get a good night sleep, which also reflects on their poor immune system. Scientists are working on a project where they use light therapy to improve sleep in lung cancer patients. Researchers are examining if rays from shining a light into the wearer´s eyes can trigger neurotransmitters in the brain and reset participants’ sleep cycles. \nDays are getting shorter by each day. If you feel any of the symptoms mentioned in this article is maybe time to try a light therapy. We hope it works.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:21:06.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
