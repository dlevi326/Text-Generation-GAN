After just one year in business, the San Francisco startup is announcing that it's reached over $1 billion in assets managed.\nSan Francisco, CA\nUp-and-coming IT asset management company Oomnitza today announced that it has hit a milestone of helping companies manage over $1 billion in assets.\nOomnitza is growing fast. Since coming out of the Alchemist Accelerator just last year, the company has attracted more than 125 customers, including Zenefits and other billion-dollar companies.\nIT asset management is an unlikely breeding ground for the next hot new startup to emerge. But that’s why CEO Arthur Lozinski saw opportunity. “Until recently, asset management was mainly about loss prevention, virus protection, loaner laptops, and regular software upgrades,” he says.\n“But now, all of these devices are becoming sensors in the Internet of Things, constantly creating data and meta-data and talking to each other. Companies need a central repository that can help them monitor, analyze, and act on the tidal wave of data generated by this activity. And that’s exactly what we provide.”\nOomnitza is designed to be deceptively simple. Each screen has a graphical UI with a default view that becomes increasingly configurable as users become familiar with it.\nCEO Arthur Lozinski says that this makes Oomnitza a better strategic partner for growing companies than its more established competitors, who keep data siloed within IT and behind text- and form-heavy UIs.\n“Oomnitza helps CIOs future-proof by giving them the simplicity they need now, with the ability to customize anything they want as they need to. They can use any other best-of-breed tool with Oomnitza, without worrying about getting locked into something that won’t fit their needs in a year.”\n---\nAbout Oomnitza\nFounded in 2014, San Francisco-based Oomnitza was created to help IT professionals make the most out of electronic assets and the data they generate. Oomnitza provides tools that help companies monitor, analyze, and act on data from their devices with a simple, flexible UI that works on desktop, mobile, and tablets to enable the mobile IT workforce of the future.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12956519.htm\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.oomnitza.com/", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12956519.htm"], "published": "2015-09-14T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T18:06:22.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
