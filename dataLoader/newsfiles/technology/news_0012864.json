The acquisition is expected to be completed in mid December.\nArdent shareholders will be asked to endorse a change in the nature and scale of Ardent's activities, and the company will also issue a prospectus to raise $5 million.\nThe funds will be used to accelerate the development of IoT's products and pursue business development opportunities.\nSubject to shareholder approval, Ardent will consolidate its shares on an indicative basis of one for four.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T13:15:40.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
