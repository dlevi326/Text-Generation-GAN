JAL had initiated service on the route on March 15, 1999.\nThe airline will resume flying between Tokyo’s Narita International Airport and D/FW with four flights a week, and said it may expand to daily service in the spring.\n“We are pleased to announce the return of Dallas/Fort Worth to our international network, which becomes our eighth gateway in North America and our fourth U.S. service launch in just over three years,” JAL president Yoshiharu Ueki said.\nJapan Airlines will operate a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner on the route. JAL’s Boeing 787s have 161 seats, with first class, premium economy and economy sections.\n“By making full use of the efficiencies of the Dreamliner as well as capitalizing on our even stronger relationship with American Airlines, we are confident this resumed service will provide even more valuable links for commercial and cultural exchanges for our customers in both regions and beyond,” Ueki said.\nOneworld alliance partner American will continue to fly twice a day between the two airports, using Boeing 777-200 aircraft with 247 to 260 seats. Each carrier will put its code on the other’s flights.\nThe joint business arrangement means that Fort Worth-based American and JAL will share revenue from each other’s U.S.-Japan flights.\n“This new service complements American’s existing service and brings more choice for our customers traveling between Asia and the U.S., providing more opportunities to connect Asia to South America,” American Airlines’ chief marketing officer, Andrew Nocella, said. “Japan Airlines is an honorable partner and a great friend to American.”\nJapan Airlines will rely on American and regional brand American Eagle to feed passengers to its D/FW flights, just as American feeds passengers to JAL’s flights out of Narita.\nJapan Airlines’ return to D/FW Airport is the latest in a number of international wins for North Texas travelers in the past four years. Among them:\nTo the west : American Airlines launched service to Seoul, South Korea, in May 2013; to Shanghai and Hong Kong in June 2014; and Beijing in May 2015. Qantas Airways launched service to Sydney in September 2014.\nTo the east : Emirates Airline launched flights to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in February 2012. Qatar Airways launched flights to Doha, Qatar, in July 2014, and Etihad Airways launched flights to Abu Dhabi, UAE, last December.\n“We are honored to welcome back Japan Airlines to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and are excited about the outstanding connectivity and customer service they will provide to passengers flying to Japan and throughout Asia,” D/FW Airport CEO Sean Donohue said.\n“With the addition of this new flight to Tokyo, coupled with partner American Airlines’ two daily flights, D/FW Airport will further support our mission to connect the world to Dallas/Fort Worth,” Donohue said.\nAt a glance: Covering Asia The addition of JAL service will give D/FW Airport eight routes to five Asian cities.\nAmerican Airlines :\nTwo flights to Tokyo One daily flight each to Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul, South Korea Japan Airlines :\nOne flight to Tokyo Korean Air Lines\nOne flight (five days a week) to Seoul\nOn Twitter:\n @tmaxon", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/tmaxon"], "published": "2015-09-01T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:00:04.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
