With the iPad’s voice to text features, users can easily and quickly add notes for collaboration with technicians, vendors and colleagues to increase the efficiency of system design and reduce mistakes “For years, the efficient design and administration of ESS systems has been a challenge for corporate and government security managers as well as system integrators, who gather and keep system information on notepads, through cell phone pictures and paper floor plans – the information becomes outdated quickly.” said Maureen Carlson, director of marketing for System Surveyor. “System Surveyor simplifies the process and makes it easy and cost effective to manage the scale and complexity of physical security systems.”\n“Our company supports many corporate and government entities which have a wide variety of systems components across multiple locations throughout Texas. System Surveyor has greatly improved our ability to efficiently gather information in the field and retrieve it later to know precisely where every device is located as well as essential information about each device. It will allow us to streamline our design process and provide even better service to our clients.” Phil Lake, president, Knight Security Systems, a Texas based security systems integrator.\nSystem Surveyor provides support for multiple system types including:\n Electronic Access Control Systems Video Surveillance Cameras and Systems Intrusion Alarm Systems Information Technology Systems Additional use case information\nAbout System Surveyor: System Surveyor simplifies the design, installation and maintenance of electronic security systems and IT assets. The result is improved quality and accuracy of system design, faster implementations, better system reliability, lower total cost of ownership (TCO), and reduced project risk.
