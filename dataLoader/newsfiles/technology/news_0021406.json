It is used for secure voice as well as data applications with anti-jamming features and can reduce noises such as from vehicles, sirens, military tanks and crowds, so as to generate a clear message. The lifecycle of the man-portable communication system is approximately around 10 years and the upgradation related to software and hardware are done in the midlife of the systems and are interdependent on the lifecycle of each other. The future of man-portable communication systems will be the software defined radios and very small aperture terminals (VSATs).Browse the full Man-Portable Communication Systems Market report at http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/man-portable-communication-systems-market.htmlBased on the platform types the man-portable communication systems market is segmented into land, airborne and naval. The land-based systems dominate the market with major share as compared to airborne and naval. Further, the segmentation of the market according to the applications includes software defined radios, satellite communication (SATCOM), portable intercom, military walkie talkie, transceiver smartphones, encryption, two-way radios and military earpiece for walkie radio headphones. Software defined radio (SDR) technology provides flexibility, cost reduction and power to drive the communications with wide-reachability. One of the major factors driving the man-portable communication systems market is the soldier level information required by command and control (C2) systems. The C2 systems are based on service oriented architecture and built on common data standards. C2 systems integrate applications that enable the commanders and staff to seamlessly exchange a large number of tactical information between the forces. Another factor aiding the growth of man-portable communication systems market is the increasing demand for advanced communication systems with reduced size, weight, and power consumption in defense application.Get the sample report at http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=b&rep_id=4558Further, the defense modernization programs in various countries are also anticipated to lead to increased growth of man-portable communication systems market during the coming years. However, reduction in defense budgets is one of the potential challenges for this industry. Increasing focus on reducing soldier's burden is anticipated to witness innovative low power, light weight man-portable military communication system products in near future, thus fueling the demand ahead. Defense ministries around the world are investing on research and development projects for reducing the size, weight and power consumption of man-portable military communication systems. For instance, the UK ministry of defense funded a program named Reducing the Burden on the Dismounted Soldier (RBDS) which aimed to reduce the load on soldier to not more than 25 kg. Additionally, the U.S. undertook a similar program called Nett Warrior owing to which they made substantial progress in reducing the weight on soldiers while delivering highly advanced the advanced capabilities. The major technological trend in man-portable communication systems market includes integration across various platforms for smooth net-centric environment, where users can access real-time data. Defense companies are significantly improving the productivity in man-portable communication systems market, with compliance to government regulations. The need for high frequency and bandwidth in this industry will further expand the man-portable communication systems market in the future. Some of the major players in man-portable communication systems market are Harris Corporation, Rockwell Collins Company, Thales Group, BAE Systems, Aselsan Corporation, Elbit Systems, Codan Limited, ITT Corporation, Ultra Electronics, General Dynamics Company and L-3 Communications Holdings Inc.Read more Technology and Media Market Reports at http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/technology-market-reports-8.html About the Author Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company, providing global business information reports and services.
