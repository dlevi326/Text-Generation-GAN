CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who cut a deal to buy Oculus for $2 billion last year, told some 1,500 conference attendees Thursday that virtual reality is \"the next logical step\" in online sharing after text, photos and video.\n\"In just a few years, VR has gone from being this science fiction dream to an awesome reality,\" he said. \"And now we all here have a chance to change the way we play, communicate and collaborate.\"\nZuckerberg showed off a promo for the upcoming \"Star Wars\" movie showing a speeding vehicle zooming over the desert landscape of fictional planet Jakku. Users can look around in any direction using their mouse as the video is playing.\nSamsung said its new virtual reality headset will be 22 percent lighter and cost $99, half the price of its previous model. The Gear VR, which requires users to insert the latest version of a Samsung smartphone into the headset, will ship in November.\nNetflix content is available to be viewed in Oculus or Samsung headsets starting Thursday, while Hulu said it would also bring its app to the Oculus platform where users can stream 2-D content as well as an original virtual reality short film called \"The Big One,\" from YouTube star Freddie Wong's RocketJump production company. A Hulu launch date wasn't announced.\nMeanwhile, Oculus said it would begin a certification program so consumers can look for a sticker that will identify which computers support its Oculus Rift headset, which is due to come out early next year. Asus, Dell and Alienware will have certified models that cost less than $1,000.\n___\nOnline:\nFacebook's 360 video announcement: http://bit.ly/1KC86mf\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
