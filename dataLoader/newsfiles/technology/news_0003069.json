These clothes were sort of falling off their bodies. Unraveling.\" \nIndeed, many garments did lack shoulders. And they were tied together with ribbons, not buttons. \"We got rid of all the buttons,\" Hernandez said; the designers wanted it to feel like \"you pull a ribbon and the whole garment falls to the floor.\" \nFashionistas left the show positively raving about what they had just seen, and that's hardly surprising: Hernandez and partner Jack McCollough are true darlings of the fashion world, and this time they delivered yet another hit. \nThough many saw a clear Spanish influence in the innovative collection, the duo shied away from attaching a clear label. Still, Hernandez, who has Cuban roots, noted that their inspiration came from examining his own personal background. \n\"We wanted to look at my personal history somehow,\" he said. \"We've never really done that. So we were like looking at pictures of family, and there was a heat and a sensuality, all those cultures that felt sort of right and powerful and emotional.\" \nOne obvious Latin accent was a ruffle - not a typical element for these very contemporary designers, famous for introducing new shapes and using cutting-edge technology to create new fabrics. \n\"A ruffle's kind of weird,\" said Hernandez. \"A ruffle feels so WRONG. We like things that feel wrong, first of all, and (figuring out) how to turn that into something that feels kind of great. So we were like messing with ruffles, and I guess a flamenco reference comes from that.\" \nFor these famously inventive designers, in sum, there was less invention this season - on purpose. \"Less science, less technology,\" Hernandez said. \"More traditional craft. And then when it's perfect? Breaking it down. Creating something beautiful, and then destroying it.\" \n-Jocelyn Noveck \n___ \nRALPH LAUREN SETS OFF FOR THE FRENCH RIVIERA \nIn a tan leather double-breasted traveling trouser suit and beachy blue-and-white stripes, the Ralph Lauren Collection served up a trip to the French Riviera. \nLauren wanted to capture the rustic romanticism and the glamorous, sporty spirit of the well-heeled who flock there, he said in a statement after the show. The looks express a \"cool insouciance and understated style,\" he explained. \nThere was linen and crepe, cashmere and silk, organza and saddle leather for this woman on her way to her favorite vacation playground. She had towering high cork wedges on her feet in navy alligator, chic totes and leather bags, and plenty of loose, flowing jumpsuits and dresses for evening. \nHer pop of color included bright red in tops and dresses. And she's prone to ultra-wide trousers navy with white side panels, worn with striped button-down shirts. \nFor the fashionista not afraid to make a BIG statement, Lauren spoke at high volume in a geometric print of cobalt, bright yellow, red, white, orange and neon green (you read that right) for a trench coat, strapless evening dress and other pieces. He carried over the pattern in a large traveling luggage bag. \nBut much of the collection spoke to the label's heart: a classic, elegant belted day dress with short sleeves and a feminine ruffle at the neck, worn with a medium-wide brown belt, for instance. It was a look many kinds of women would enjoy, unlike some voluminous print evening looks loaded down with ruffles, slits and draping below the waist \nAre cutouts below the breast and at the midriff still happening? They are here, in red and navy for evening. \nJulianne Moore, Jessica Chastain and Alec Baldwin were among the celebs on Lauren's front row. \n-Leanne Italie Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
