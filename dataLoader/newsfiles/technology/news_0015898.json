A public hearing held by the Louisiana attorney general's office is scheduled Monday (Sept. 28) at 1 p.m., and assuming all goes smoothly, deputy parish attorney Ed Rapier said the lease deal could be finalized in a day or two.\nThe hearing is the last step that the attorney general's office needs to take before it approves -- or disapproves -- the lease. Without that approval, the parish can't move forward.\n\"The AG's office could give us a letter of approval at the end of the meeting, or take a day or two to decide,\" Rapier said. Parish officials hope to close the deal Tuesday or Wednesday, \"immediately upon receiving the AG's approval,\" he said.\nThere's a reason the parish wants to move quickly. LCMC, a non-profit hospital operator, has the right to withdraw if the deal hasn't closed by Wednesday.\nThe 45-year-lease was pegged at $565 million in cash and capital investment. But LCMC lowered its offer by $25 million in August, as the hospital's value dropped .\nMonday's hearing is to be held at the West Jefferson Medical Center's auditorium. The address is 1101 Medical Center Blvd. in Marrero.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T00:34:32.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
