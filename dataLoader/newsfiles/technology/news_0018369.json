Karam, who had waited a lifetime to make the pilgrimage to stand before the Kaaba, stood with her palms facing toward the sky in prayer. Ibrahim stood a few feet to her side, quietly reading verses from the Quran.\nSuddenly, a loud boom echoed. Karam found herself surrounded by carnage – body parts were scattered everywhere amid pools of blood on the white marble floor of the mosque.\nThe kingdom's civil defense says unusually strong winds tipped over one of the massive cranes around the Grand Mosque that houses the Kaaba. The crane crashed through part of the mosque's roof and upper floors, sending concrete slabs crashing down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:06:43.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
