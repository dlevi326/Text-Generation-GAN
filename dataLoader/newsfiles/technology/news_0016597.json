The thought of the app releasing private photos to a user’s contact list may be enough to coerce them into paying the ransom. But the question remains as to whether the malware will stop collecting data after the ransom has been paid.\nZScaler says the app will still be on the device after a reboot if the user tries to delete it and has included a step-by-step process on their website to remove it.\nA simple way to protect against malware accessing your camera is to place a sticker over it to avoid apps capturing private moments without permission, Dr Dreyfus said.\nAAP", "external_links": ["http://research.zscaler.com/2015/09/more-adult-themed-android-ransomware.html"], "published": "2015-09-08T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T09:14:13.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
