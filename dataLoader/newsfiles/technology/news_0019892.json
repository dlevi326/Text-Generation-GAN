The creditors committee is asking for a jury trial and damages of not less than $200 million.\nThe lawsuit outlines the two years leading up to RadioShack’s bankruptcy. The committee claims the defendants delayed actions that could have prevented RadioShack’s “crash-landing into bankruptcy.”\nThe unsecured creditors committee includes big companies such as AT&T, Verizon and Toshiba and dozens of smaller companies that together were owed about $500 million at the time of RadioShack’s February bankruptcy filing.\nDefendants include shareholder Soohyung Kim and his Standard General hedge fund, former CEO Joe Magnacca, Wells Fargo and RadioShack’s former board of directors.\nThe committee claims that Standard General and Kim, “with the complicity of RadioShack’s conflicted CEO [Magnacca] and faithless board of directors, delayed actions that could have preserved significant value in the company.” The suit says that allowed Standard General to acquire an insolvent RadioShack at the lowest possible cost.\nStandard General bought 1,743 stores out of bankruptcy in April and later purchased the rights to the RadioShack brand name. The lawsuit said the company was allowed to fail and Standard General cherry-picked the best stores. A spokesman for Kim and Standard General didn’t return a request for comment.\nRadioShack’s bankruptcy court hearing to confirm its Chapter 11 plan is set for mid-September. This lawsuit is unrelated to those proceedings.\nOn Twitter:\n @MariaHalkias", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MariaHalkias"], "published": "2015-09-01T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T14:57:56.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
