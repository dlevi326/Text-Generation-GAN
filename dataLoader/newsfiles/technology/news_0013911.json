This is partially as I am a white male born 10 years prior to Apartheid being abolished, so I am one of those that has been accustomed to the ‘shut up, you have no right to talk on the direction of the country’ generation (Or, in other words I have become all too familiar with my white guilt, so I take a step back like a good little white boy and allow the majority to debate without my input). The other reason I don’t usually talk up over these things is that I generally assume that my lone voice will not have the power to influence the turn of events that are to follow. In recent times I find myself becoming more and more concerned about the state of our socio-economic climate. To be specific, I am rather concerned about how self-absorbed, intolerant, selfish and short sighted we have become as a culture; led by and enshrined in our ANC leadership.\nHere-in lies part of the problem though. For twenty years I have sat back and expected the government to make correction for so many years of injustice at the hands of apartheid. And, for twenty years I have watched them fail. Dismally. Let us make no mistake here though (before those of you who are proponents of the ‘it is our responsibility’ begin to raise your voices), it most certainly is the government’s responsibility to correct for these injustices. By economic, social and political definitions, the government was created and entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring the externalities of individual actions do not breach the rights and responsibilities of other individuals. In economics, an externality is the cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. This is why we entrust the government with our taxes, such that those services that benefit us as a society are undertaken in such a way as to benefit all, equally. Alternatively, as this power was so abused in the past, they are entrusted to correct for the externalities of the past.\nThis is where we begin to hit a snag however. Our government has not been on the mission to correct for past injustices or to control for the externalities of our economy. Our government has become obsessed with the power and money that comes with that responsibility instead. Our government has taken a very conscious decision to only focus on the here and now. To focus on the current voting population of South Africa. The policies of the government, including BBBEE, quota’s and many other key decisions (which I will not go into here) are oriented around ensuring they maintain support of the aware voting age population. We need look no further than the fact that the economic the expenditure on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Higher Education and Training, Social Development, Correctional Services, Defence and Military Veterans and Transport were all higher than Basic Education in 2014. What this essentially breaks down to is very clear; “If you are old enough to vote, culturally important enough to influence society, or, smart enough to realise the ANC is not supporting the greater growth of the population – you will be looked after.”\nTo add to this, the government then engages in fostering and nurturing a racist culture.\nIt is well documented that in times of conflict, societies pull together even if they do not necessarily agree with the decisions being made. America provides a strong example of this, where in times of waning support and social difficulty conflict has pulled society together and resulted in a rather unexpected next term for the incumbent government. This was seen at the end of the great depression and the start of World War 2, toward the end of The Cold War and the beginning of the Vietnam war, and, more recently the invasion on Iraq. By no means am I suggesting they did this intentionally, however the results were the same; an additional term in power for a party that had been experiencing diminishing support and approval.\nThis is no different than in South Africa, with the exception that the government has a very easy target to aim social frustration at, the white population. It is a fact that in times of political difficulty, and / or, elections, race is raised as an issue more frequently than in times of strong growth. This is even the case when race has absolutely no bearing on the issue at hand at all. The situation Eskom is currently in, for example, was blamed on Apartheid. The reality of the situation however, if one was to actually research it, is that the government rejected growth plans at least three times between 1994 and 2009. The decision not to expand the generating capacity was a deliberate one made with the intention of keeping power prices low and expanding access to previously disadvantaged areas. Great in concept, horrible in practice as now further development has been set back years. The issue was therefore a question on policy, development and growth – not race. Yet, race was frequently used as a deflection tactic for the majority of the population. This is not only an example of the “here and now” mentality but also an example of using race to deflect the real issue at hand – poor governance.\nThis can also be expanded to sport, where we currently see the issue of the SA Rugby team containing so few black players. The emphasis is placed on the racist selector, the racist coach and the racist rugby supporting population. It is on the here and now. My question is not on why there are so few black players in the team, but why there are so few to choose from in the first place? Where are the rugby academies in rural or previously disadvantaged areas to teach them the game? Where are the bursaries / scholarships for those that are good to attend a private school to further develop? For that matter, where are the schools with facilities good enough to teach them in their own areas? With 21 years of ‘freedom’ we still don’t see these facilities. As a result we will see a large number of years to come without representation either. This is unless of course, the government uses quotas to force the change that the aware population wishes to see. In this case the change will not necessarily be due to skill, but rather by forced intervention at the highest level.\nThis brings me to the self-absorbed, intolerant, selfish and short sighted culture I now find myself in.\nWe are a population that insists on attempting to ‘build a house from the roof down’. The working age population that actually has the ability to drive change insists on generating benefit for themselves while turning a blind eye to the future. It is this same population that then get’s angry when the roof falls on their heads. The continued lack of transformation, development and improvement of social condition has led to increased frustration in the black population (understandably and deservedly so). I frequently see and hear my colleagues and friends suggesting drastic action, both black and white (do not think you are exempt from this fellow white population – you will not use this as an excuse and a way to exempt yourself from responsibility, you are as much to blame for the situation we find ourselves in). These comments run from “All white people should just give up their jobs and homes for the black person”, to “Blacks just expect to be given everything. None of them are prepared to work for it”. However I do not see, or hear, any of these comments directed at the source of the issue; a greedy, inefficient government that socially manipulates the population for its own benefit rather than developing it.\nIt is for this reason that I have finally chosen to voice my opinion in the hope that I might be able to alter just one or two individual’s opinions such that they begin to think about the future. In Economic and Social terms, the future is the youth.\nAs a population we need to stop thinking about the here and now and we need to stop thinking about ourselves. What is done is done already, you can’t change it unless you change your mentality and think about the future. Voicing the problem repeatedly doesn’t help anyone. We, as a population, need to force the media and the government into a dialogue of solutions. We need to push them into telling us how they are going to fix the issues, not to explain how they happened.\nIt’s time we stopped throwing fits like spoilt little children when we don’t get our way, grow up and act like adults.\nInstead of becoming angry and aggressive about the current situation, we need to be the catalyst of real solutions. Instead of arguing about the validity of BBBEE, ask where the expenditure on Basic Education in rural and previously disadvantaged areas is and not just the expenditure on tertiary education for students who would have gone there anyway. It is only through this expenditure that BBBEE will no longer be required.\nInstead of arguing about the merit of a black player in a sports team now, ask where the rugby academies in rural and previously disadvantaged area’s are.\nInstead of blaming all our problems on the opposite race, engage in real and constructive conversation on development. Learn each other’s cultures and languages. When someone blames the problem / issue on race we need to avoid the deflection and ask them how they are going to fix it in the future, we need to ask them what they are really afraid of, because I can assure you race is merely an excuse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:16:23.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
