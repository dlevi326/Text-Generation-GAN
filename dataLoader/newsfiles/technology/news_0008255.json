Distraught families waited weeks for the injured to arrive and months for the dead. At a memorial service at Gallagher Estate in Midrand yesterday, Mantsebo Sefali (23) said she was still angry at her mother for not heeding her pleas not to travel to TB Joshua’s church.\n‘I get angry sometimes when I think that, had she listened to me, maybe she would be alive today,’ she said. Kulani Mathebula (18) blamed her dad for going when she had asked him not to because he’d been the year before. Many of the families have found forgiveness, but they won’t forget.\nBirthday is now death day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:29:31.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
