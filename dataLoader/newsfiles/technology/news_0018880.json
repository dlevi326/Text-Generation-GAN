RELATED BERLIN: Sony's new Xperia Z5 Premium is the world's first 4K-resolution display-equipped smartphone. Packing more than 800 pixels per inch, the phone's display features 4 times the pixels of a full-HD phone screen. It's also one of the first Sony phones to feature a fingerprint sensor. We spent a day with Sony's big-screen flagship and here are our first impressions... First things first, the highlight of the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium is its large 5.5-inch 4K (3840x2160p) display. It seems to be an overkill for a small device as at times it's hard to distinguish 2K displays from full-HD ones. However, it certainly is one of the best displays we've seen on a smartphone judging by how the 4K content pre-loaded on the phone, looks. It offers super sharp images and crisp text, accurate colour reproduction and wide viewing angles. The sunlight legibility of the display was also good. The phone also upscales lower resolution content to 4K but we could not test the feature. Since you can also shoot 4K videos with the phone's rear camera, you'll get to see how they shape up without the need of transferring them on a 4K-capable device. While it's still early days for 4K in India and the Xperia Z5 Premium is comparatively more future-ready than other flagships. Having said that not everyone requires a 4K screen. For top-end Sony phones, water resistance is almost a standard feature. The X5 Premium is no exception and offers IP 65/68 protection. On the design front, Sony is still sticking to its OmniBalance philosophy but has improvised a few things. For the first time in many years, Sony's flagship phones don't feature the watch-crown metal power button. Xperia Z5 Premium (and the other two variants), comes with a pill shaped metal power key that also integrates the fingerprint sensor of the phone. It's located at the middle on the right edge so we didn't find it cumbersome to use even on this big a phone. The volume rocker and camera shutter button are right below the power key and offer good tactile feedback. The 3.5mm headset jack is at the top edge while the micro-USB port and a holster slot is at the bottom. A flap hiding the nano-sim slot and microSD card slot is at the left edge. At 154.4x76.0x7.8mm and 180Kgs, Xperia Z5 Premium is anything but compact, however, you have to remember it fits a 5.5-inch display and some top notch hardware. Our chrome coloured demo unit looked unconventional yet premium, with its sturdy metal frame, mirror finish back and unique colour. The mirror finish also makes the phone susceptible to smudging though and attracted fingerprints easily. Sony Xperia Z5 Premium is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, 64-bit octa-core processor with Adreno 430 GPU, 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage expandable up to 200GB via a microSD card. It runs Android 5.1 Lollipop with Sony's own UI. Sony's UI skin is not very heavy and doesn't hog on system resources. The experience of navigating across the UI was very smooth. Unlike some new flagships, the phone comes with 3GB of RAM but we did not encounter any issues while multitasking and playing games. The phone supports 4G LTE, 3G, Bluetooth 4.1 and NFC connectivity options. We'll have a detailed review of the phone's software performance very soon. Xperia Z5 Premium comes with a new 1/2.3'' 23MP Sony Exmor RS for mobile sensor camera at the back. The camera has a few neat tricks including 5x Clear Image Zoom and up to 8x Digital Zoom. It also boasts of SteadyShot, Sony's name for Optical Image Stabilization that takes care of distortion while filming with shaky hands or shooting while moving. It's also capable of focusing in 0.03 seconds. In our brief use, we found the quality of pictures shot with the phone to be excellent with great detail, accurate colours and optimum contrast. The low light performance was also good. However, we observed that the phone starts getting warm after prolonged use or while capturing 4K video. The 5MP front camera also performs well while taking selfies and wide-angled pictures. There's no doubt the Xperia Z5 Premium will give some good competition to recently launched flagships. However, a lot depends on the pricing and availability of the device when it comes to India, which we expect to be on a higher side. We'll have a detailed review of the phone very soon. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Sony Xperia Z5 Premium,Sony Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T07:43:35.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
