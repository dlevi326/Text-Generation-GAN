I'm so glad that they came to rescue me,\" he told public broadcaster NHK. \nAkinori Nagaoka, 39, returned home with his son to find the first floor of the house flooded with muddy brown water. \n\"I have never seen anything like this before. I wonder when we can come back and live like it was,\" he told AFP. \nLater in the day, police found the body of a man in another river in Miyagi, northern Japan, a police spokesman said, bringing the death toll to four. \nWhile police have yet to identify the man, he was was believed to be a 62-year-old missing in the prefecture where people also suffered floods, local media reported. \nAs the water receded, police officers wearing life vests shoved poles into thick muddy ground to locate possible victims. \n\"The city is completely destroyed - we need people's help,\" said 47-year-old Shinichi Ishizuka. \nOn Saturday morning, Abe visited the disaster-hit town, about 60 kilometres (37 miles) outside Tokyo, as some 2,000 troops, police and firefighters were deployed to rescue more than 100 people still trapped in water-logged buildings, the bulk of whom were patients and medical staff inside a flooded hospital, local media said. \n\"We're doing our best to make things safe by reconstructing the broken (river) bank as quickly as possible to prevent a repeat of this disaster,\" Abe told reporters. \n- Picking up the pieces - \nThe Japanese leader reviewed the extensive damage from a military helicopter and met with evacuees at a shelter. \nSome 4,500 people were forced to stay in more than 20 facilities such as schools, public halls, gymnasiums as the region was suffering a halt to water and power supply for the third night. \nAs the sky cleared, water levels began to return to normal at the river, after the heaviest rain in years pounded the country in the wake of Typhoon Etau, which smashed through Japan this week, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. \n\"We are working hard to rescue people trapped in buildings and find those who still are unaccounted for, while pumping out water,\" a local government official said. \n\"But water levels are still high in many areas so that has hampered our operation.\" \nThe number of missing in Joso declined from 22 to 15 after police found more victims alive, including a pair of eight-year-old children. It was not immediately clear where the children were found, but some of those missing appeared to have been among those trapped in flooded buildings. \nIn Kanuma city, north of Joso, a 63-year-old woman was killed in a landslide, while a 48-year-old woman was also found dead in Miyagi prefecture, officials said. \nPolice said the third victim was a 25-year-old man helping to clear clogged drains in the city of Nikko, which is known for its historic shrines. \nAnother river in Miyagi on Friday burst its banks and flooded a populated area but many residents had already been evacuated. \nJapanese authorities were on Friday grappling with the aftermath of massive flooding that killed at least three people, as thousands of rescuers frantically searched a shattered community for almost two dozen still missing. \nThe heaviest rain in decades pounded the country in the wake of Typhoon Etau, which smashed through Japan this week, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. \nHundreds of thousands were ordered to leave their homes and at least 22 people -- including a pair of eight-year-old children -- were still unaccounted for late Friday in disaster-struck Joso city, which lies about 60 kilometres (37 miles) outside Tokyo. Another person was missing in a northern prefecture. \nRyosei Akazawa, a member of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet, acknowledged that emergency personnel still did not know the whereabouts of the missing, as fears grow that the death toll will rise. \n\"We are in a situation where we have yet to confirm where these missing people are,\" said Akazawa, the Cabinet Office's state minister, after visiting the devastated area. \nParts of Joso, a community of 65,000 residents, were destroyed Thursday when a levee on the Kinugawa river gave way, flooding an area that reportedly spans 32 square kilometres (12 square miles). \nJiji Press news agency reported Saturday that almost 11,000 homes had been flooded. \nDramatic aerial footage showed whole houses being swept away by raging torrents in scenes eerily reminiscent of the devastating tsunami that crushed Japan's northeast coast four years ago. \nDesperate Joso residents waved towels as they stood on balconies trying to summon help, while military dinghies ferried dozens of people to safety, and helicopters plucked individuals from rooftops. \nHundreds of people are believed to still be trapped in buildings, while more than 600 had been rescued in Ibaraki prefecture, where Joso is located, by Friday evening. \n- 'News about my family' - \nSome frightened Joso residents took to social media on their smartphones to beg for help as the muddy brown waves swirled around their doomed houses, while trees were uprooted and cars bobbed in the dirty water. \n\"I don't know what to do as my house has been inundated,\" 23-year-old nurse Kentaro Sato told Kyodo News. \nOne woman said she was anxiously awaiting details about her family at an emergency shelter, after leaving her husband and children to go shopping Thursday morning. She was unable to return home due to the flooding. \n\"I have been here since yesterday morning... and I do not have any news about my family,\" said the woman in her 60s who gave her last name as Furuya. \nThe government started drainage operations at the swollen river while repair work on its dykes were reportedly expected to take about a week. \n\"I still feel the trauma\" from the tsunami, a woman told public broadcaster NHK from a shelter in Minami Soma, one of the areas hit by the 2011 disaster that also triggered reactor meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear plant. \n\"I was ready to run away as soon as the evacuation order was issued.\" \nSome 5,800 troops, police and firefighters have been dispatched to flooded areas where rescuers continued to work through the night. \nPeople were seen wading through waist-high water to reach evacuation shelters, where thousands are staying across affected regions. \nAnother river in Miyagi prefecture, north of Ibaraki, burst its banks and flooded a populated area but many residents had already been evacuated, reports said. \nIn Kanuma city, north of Joso, a 63-year-old woman was killed after being swallowed by landslides triggered by the heavy rain, while a 48-year-old woman was also found dead in Miyagi, officials said. \nPolice said the third victim was a 25-year-old man helping to clear clogged drains in the city of Nikko, which is known for its historic shrines. \nThe heavy rains also affected those who are still in temporary shelters following the 2011 tsunami. \nFlooding further complicated a contaminated water problem at the crippled Fukushima plant, where the site's drainage pumps were overwhelmed, sending radiation-tainted water into the ocean. \nAs the rain let up on Friday, pumps were no longer overwhelmed, according to the site's operator. \nAutomaker Toyota temporarily shut three production plants in affected areas Friday, but said they would reopen later in the day. \nJapan is no stranger to natural disasters, and is frequently rocked by typhoons. \nHowever, nothing in recent memory has compared with the tsunami of 2011, when more than 18,000 people were killed. \nbur-qt/pb/st/cb", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T08:20:36.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
