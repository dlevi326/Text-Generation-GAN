Nearly two-thirds of American adults now own a smartphone, according to Pew Research Center .The underlying infrastructure that supports all of our favorite new gadgets and services is evolving, too. Inside the data center , performance and connectivity requirements are developing as swiftly as our consumer electronics. To keep up, business leaders are investing in the future. What does that future look like ? For one thing, it requires a higher percentage of distribution from the edge, or the periphery of the network. “Performance comes down to distance,” said Drew Leonard, vice president of Colocation Business Development at CenturyLink. “If you can put the right content or applications at the edge or deliver the content over the most optimized network path , then you enable a better end-user experience.” When Speed And Reliability Matter The importance of network capacity and proximity to the edge is evident whenever your connection times out as you try to stream the latest episode of your favorite movie, show or sporting event. Or perhaps a frequently viewed YouTube video takes longer than usual to load. Deploying at the edge helps mitigate this by allowing data to take a more efficient, optimized path to the end-user.The same IT solutions that streamline the delivery of on-demand entertainment to our PCs and set-top boxes also ensure the fidelity of financial transactions and enable technologies such as high-frequency algorithmic trading.“A significant differentiator for our colocation business is our broad geographic footprint, especially in the New Jersey , Chicago and London areas, which gives us our ability to bring financial institutions and banks within close proximity to each other so they can complete transactions with minimal latency,” Leonard said. “The same concepts employed by the financial community for well over a decade to increase performance are now being leveraged by every industry to distribute all kinds of content.” Networks Evolve With Demand With organizations shifting away from centralized IT architectures in favor of a more distributed model and hybrid IT, the complexity of managing these next-gen datacenter topologies can rise exponentially. To address this concern, service providers are embracing similarly next-gen frameworks and technologies for networks, such as software-defined networking , or SDN, and network functions virtualization , or NFV, that connect data centers together.In a nutshell, SDN is an infrastructure connectivity technology that enables a more flexible network architecture within the data center. Meanwhile, NFV allows physical network appliances such as routers to be virtualized into software applications.SDN enables rapid deployment and configuration change by controlling the network through logical, centrally managed software changes rather than physical cabling or device-specific configuration changes. Likewise, NFVs enable faster deployments and more flexible architectures by moving functions performed by dedicated appliances such as firewalls, load balancers and VPN termination to software instances on a scalable cloud platform.“SDN and NVF are going to redefine connectivity in the data center. The bottom line is you really do not want to have your network delivery and infrastructure connectivity managed manually. You want it as automated as possible so that it’s always optimized, which ultimately saves time and money,” Leonard said. “Within our data centers and across our own network, CenturyLink is making significant investments in SDN and NFV for the benefit of our clients.” Building Security, Layer Upon Layer For many organizations, embracing an edge-centric IT architecture, not to mention new technologies such as SDN and NFV, poses a legitimate security challenge. After all, companies are going from (in many cases) a single, local data center to multiple data centers around the world, and then handing over control of the whole thing to automation software.Whether a company opts to take advantage of next-gen data center solutions or maintain the status quo, Leonard cautions there’s no silver bullet for security .Security can’t be bolted onto a fundamentally insecure data center—it needs to be a key element to every level and component. Organizations must clearly define security policies as well as the procedures to monitor and enforce them. A big piece of this is technological: firewalls, encryption, real-time monitoring and patch management. But physical security is also crucial. Does the facility have multiple layers of security: a single point of ingress and egress, bulletproof lobbies and doors, mantraps to eliminate tailgating, dual forms of authentication including biometrics?“It really is about multiple layers, both at the physical and virtual level, to eliminate any single point of failure,” Leonard said. “We provide 24/7 secured access to the data center while ensuring all of our policies and procedures align with the strictest levels of compliance to meet any client’s needs.”As data centers continue to evolve to support new mobile innovations and the IoT, the message for business leaders is clear: The future lies at the edge.
