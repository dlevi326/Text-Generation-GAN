Users can securely store and organize important documents related to a property - including home maintenance records, insurance policies, rental agreements and payments, utility bills, contracts, and receipts - making them quick and easy to locate. The site automatically generates an historical timeline, which lets users efficiently track past and current projects, communications and transactions. \nIn addition, AbodeStory users can access information from local contractors and other home service providers, including a description of services, reviews and ratings, photos and a contact link. Users can choose to work with their own service providers through the site or contact providers who've already created a listing on the site. \n\"AbodeStory has streamlined interactions with my tenants, contractors and other service people, making property ownership less time consuming and stressful.
