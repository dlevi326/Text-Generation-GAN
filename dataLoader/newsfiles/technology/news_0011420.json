Services such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Viber and Google Chat encrypt messages as they are sent between users. \nThere was widespread outrage over the threat to privacy and the possibility of prosecution for those who refused to save their communications. \nTelecoms Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Tuesday said the anti-encryption policy would be redrafted and would not affect most people. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
