These guidelines do not apply to all atheists. The majority of them are highly intelligent, educated people who debate maturely and from whom I have learned much.\nOthers, however are not so good. These guidelines were formulated in a study of their style of commenting.\nGUIDELINES FOR WANNABE ATHEISTS\n1. Delete is better than defeat\n2. When in doubt, insult, insult, insult\n3. Verifiable evidence. Always ask for verifiable evidence.\n4. Hypocrisy is not a word that applies to you.\n5. Always stress that you have been a believer, especially a preacher, but that you have seen the light. This creates the impression that you saw the “truth” through all the religious fog.\n6. The earlier you started, the bigger the bragging rights. Top marks if you can say you thought your parents were stupid by being believers.\n7. When believers talk of God’s love even for you, the atheist, respond by rejecting and ridiculing this love. If they get angry and attack you, ask them what happened to their religious love for others and tell them they are not true believers.\n8. Twist respondents’ names into something that you find funny. Numty is not so good, only two syllables. Ignoramus is better!\n9. Create a false FB identity, then accuse believers who do the same of being false Christians.\n10. The most important measure of your cleverness is the number of thumbs up. Creating multiple FB identities to support your main one helps. Rule number 1 is very important here.\n11. Defend your cronies, for you are few\n12. If you lose an argument, say: “Do some research, read some articles, read these hundreds of books”. It creates the impression that you have all the knowledge contained in these sources, but you prefer not to waste your time any longer.. Then hope you are rid of this believer.\n13. When you have been argued to a standstill, start a circle dance with your chronies and do serious back-slapping. It helps to rebuild self-confidence.\n14. Mock the believers on their language usage, even though your own may not be that sharp.\n15. Google arguments that prove there is no God, of which there are thousands written by people just like you. File a huge collection of these arguments on your computer, then just copy and paste. Remember, if it is written in Wikipaedia, it is true!\n16. Repeat the same arguments over and over, they will get tired of responding. Some may even have to work.\n17. Ask more questions than a wise man can answer.\n18. The last word! Always have the last word!\n19. Label any answer to any question you ask with a thinly disguised swear word referring to excrement.\n20. Tell anecdotal, sad stories that support your non-belief. Play the role of the wise person the believer has approached in tears for guidance.\n21. Generalize! Use one absurd action by any believer and make it generally true of all believers. Hitler is a valuable source for this.\n22. Quote: anything that suits you from anybody or from any obscure website. Even if you Quote: what your parrot said, it doesn’t matter, as long as it fits your argument. Give only its name as reference. Try ending its name with ...stein or ...kins.\n23. Deliberately misunderstand a word or phrase used by a believer, then use it to ridicule the believer.Use different religions to discredit one another.\n24. When posting an article, it helps your comment count if you post numerous short replies instead of one long response to your own article. Some people have reached the skinner badge by talking to themselves!\n25.
