The site blends exclusive news, business insights, research and crowdsourced databases for VARs, managed services providers (MSPs), cloud services providers (CSPs), ISVs and emerging channel partners. Launch sponsors include CA Technologies, Continuum Managed Services LLC, Datto, Ingram Micro Inc. and LogicNow. \nChannelE2E's comprehensive offerings include: - Exclusive news and insights: Driven by Content Czar Joe Panettieri - Case studies: Tracking IT service providers and best practices across the five stages of business (startup, growth, sustained performance, pivot and exit). - Crowdsourced databases: Channel partner programs, event calendars and more. \"Built by us. Crowdsourced by you.\" Note: After Nines Inc. monitors submissions for quality and accuracy. - Quarterly research: Tracking the most lucrative opportunities and best practices for IT service providers, VARs, MSPs and Total Service Providers (TSPs) that achieve complete customer account control. - End-to-end coverage: Spanning small business, midmarket and enterprise opportunities. - Podcasts: Exclusive access to the IT channel's most innovative CXOs and leaders. \nChannelE2E's Technology \nChannelE2E is built on After Nines Inc.'s exclusive COSE (pronounced \"cozy\") cloud technology. COSE (Content Operating System Engine) optimizes all advertising, content, research and databases for all screen sizes. The technology can host media sites serving any vertical market or audience. COSE gives visitors a rich, fast and complete user experience on any screen (smartphone, tablet, notebook, PC). \nChannelE2E's Launch Team \nChannelE2E co-founders Amy Katz and Joe Panettieri have more than two decades of IT media experience. The duo previously co-launched, built and sold MSPmentor, The VAR Guy and Talkin' Cloud. A recent 15-month hiatus from running IT media brands allowed Katz and Panettieri to quietly observe technology market trends, pursue a new path toward life-work balance, and contemplate the IT channel's next evolution. \n\"Our entrepreneurial journey -- and the entrepreneurial journey of IT channel partners -- ultimately inspired ChannelE2E's launch,\" said Amy Katz, president and CEO of After Nines Inc. \"Our exclusive content, research and crowdsourced databases show channel partners how to build their businesses.
