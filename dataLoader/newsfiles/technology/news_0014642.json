Unknown hackers infected legitimate programs by persuading app developers to download a tainted copy of the tool kit. It was the first time a company executive has talked about efforts to secure the App Store since the attack surfaced late last week.\nChinese app developers have told Reuters they resorted to downloading the tainted software kit for developers from unofficial, third-party sources because of slow speeds downloading from Apple's official servers located overseas. Many complained the U.S. tech giant should do more to support developers in the company's second-biggest market.\nSchiller also said that Apple plans to list 25 tainted apps that the company has identified so that customers can delete and update them, according to the Chinese-language site.\nHe said the company knows of no cases where tainted apps have been used to transmit customer data.\nThe company announced that it was moving to clean up its App Store on Sunday, after several cyber security firms reported finding a malicious program dubbed XcodeGhost that was embedded in hundreds, possible thousands, of legitimate apps.\nIt is the first reported case of large numbers of malicious software programs making their way past Apple's stringent app review process. Prior to this attack, a total of just five malicious apps had ever been found in the App Store, according to cyber security firm Palo Alto Networks Inc.\nResearchers said infected apps included Tencent Holdings Ltdâ€™s popular mobile chat app WeChat, car-hailing app Didi Kuaidi and a music app from Internet portal NetEase Inc.\nApple removed the malicious versions of those apps from the App store and those developers replaced them with clean updates.\n technology latest Mobiles and tabs apple App Store Also Read Take a virtual reality tour of your apartment before buying, renting Reserve Bank of India plans pay bill anywhere Missed the Google I/O 2014 Keynote yesterday?
