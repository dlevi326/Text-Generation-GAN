This is certainly their right (although I suspect it is more because of political pressure than anything else).\nI’ve enjoyed reading the comments ( not that I always agreed with what was said, Sakkie ), but this, is after all, a democracy, and we are supposed to enjoy freedom of speech.\nI have always maintained that if it gets too hot in the kitchen, you are free to get out. I’m getting out.\nBe that as it may, I would like to say goodbye to everyone – and I do mean everyone – with whom I have shared comments (good and bad) on these pages. Believe me when I say I shall miss you one and all.\nI have been banned more times than I would care to remember, but I’ve always managed to dry my crocodile tears, and return under yet another nom de plume .\nSo here it is, goodbye from a few of my pseudonyms – you might even recognize some of them: Irukandji, Eric de la Vega de Castro, Kopi Luwak, Pinky Buycycle, Siriru Kandji, Zane Jones, Majas Ramokgata, James Matome, Lance Lot, Maseko Thurform Sabisa, Ubu Ntu, Watt de Faq, Archivaldo Loera, Nannies Koepella, Oki Doki, Babbacombe Lee, Le Coq de la Marche, Sacha Coquelin, Eric de Carlos, Brand Knight, Elias Sofe, Ezee Wart, Jackie Killian, Knotta Gupta.\nLastly, to: Crabbie, Colleen, Sir Ram, Attie, NoeNoe, Hendrik, Irish Mike, Wessel, Guy, Margaret, Satis, Ruud, Deeked, you are great people – I love you all.\nSo long, and thanks for all the fish...\n*Sob, sob, snot gurgle, sob, sob, sniffle, and all and all*", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T16:16:27.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
