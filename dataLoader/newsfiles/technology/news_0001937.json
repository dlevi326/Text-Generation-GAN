These fully integrated, intelligent security solutions are designed to capture, record, control, and analyze surveillance video and audio while addressing the specific business needs of customers in the Retail, Education, and Public Safety vertical markets. \nPanasonic security solutions being showcased in booth 3709 include: \nEducation —Panasonic offers a variety of security solutions for education users, including Video Insight’s Video Management Software (VMS) and the recently introduced i-PRO Privacy-Ready Camera (WV-SF448). Video Insight VMS and the new Privacy-Ready network security camera, as well as its innovative 3E mobile device, lampless projectors, interactive whiteboards and A+ classroom audio products, are all part of Panasonic’s complete 21 st Century classroom solution aimed at providing a secure and collaborative student-centered learning environment. \nTremendously popular in the education market —and now a member of the Panasonic Group—Video Insight’s VMS solution is a comprehensive, easy-to-use video management software that includes an intuitive user interface, robust client options for Windows, MAC and mobile devices, and its own built-in access control. Video Insight VMS also supports more than 3000 camera models from over 100 manufacturers and integrates with the industry’s leading access control systems. In May 2015, Panasonic began offering unlimited camera licenses with most late model Panasonic IP cameras, making its complete video surveillance solution an attractive value proposition for the budget sensitive education market. \nPanasonic’s new i-PRO Full HD 1080p 360° Privacy-Ready network camera (WV-SF448) features an opaque eyelid that can be closed to activate a privacy mode, completely obscuring the lens and providing full surveillance privacy in school environments. For education applications where surveillance needs must be balanced with classroom privacy requirements, Panasonic’s WV-SF448 enables video capture and recording to be controlled by the educator via an alarm input or invoked by the instructor via a wireless body worn pendant. The WV-SF448’s built-in microphone also allows sound occurring near the camera to be recorded together with the images, as well as the ability to achieve two-way communication, if desired. \nPublic Safety and Transit Surveillance —Offering customized capture, recording and storage solutions for fixed, mobile and body-worn video surveillance applications, Panasonic is displaying its next generation Arbitrator® BWC (body-worn camera) and enhanced Unified Evidence Management System (UEMS). Designed and built based on direct feedback from law enforcement organizations, the Arbitrator BWC features 720p HD video resolution and a 130° field of view—capturing high-quality video and providing unbiased evidence of officer interactions. \nIntegrated with Panasonic’s industry-leading Arbitrator 360°™ Full HD in-car mobile video evidence capture system, the new body-worn camera solution offers the industry’s most complete and cost-effective platform for personal video evidence capture and management. The Arbitrator BWC can offload seamlessly via Wi-Fi and other methods to Panasonic’s Unified Evidence Management System, which allows officers to easily and securely manage all video evidence—including in-car, body-worn and fixed surveillance—using a single, unified platform with flexible storage options. \nAlso featured in the booth is Panasonic’s integrated i-PRO Transit Recording Solution and new High Definition Rugged Mobile Transit Cameras available in both HD (SBV111M) and Full HD (WV-SBV131M) versions. Designed for use directly on the exterior of transit buses and other public transportation vehicles, the new cameras include an integrated environmental housing and a scratch resistant dome coating over the lens to protect against tree branches and vandalism as well as an expanded temperature range to ensure optimal performance in both hot and cold environments. Like the existing compact dome (WV-SW155 and WV-SW158) and optional 360° (WV-SW458) cameras, the new Rugged Mobile Transit cameras are IP6K9K and EN50155 rated for transportation applications. Panasonic’s i-PRO Transit Solution has been successfully deployed with The Denver Regional Transportation District (RTD) Police Division and used as a blueprint for other transit agencies across the country. With the Transit Solution in place, Denver RTD is effectively protecting riders, drivers and physical property while successfully investigating criminal activity, safety violations, accidents and liability claims. \nFinally, for public safety and transit agencies challenged with managing and storing growing volumes of surveillance video data from multiple sources, Panasonic is also demonstrating the LB-DH8 Data Archiver—a scalable optical disc library that satisfies the need for long-term evidentiary data storage. This robust storage solution helps transit and public safety agencies manage the exponential growth of data and associated retention policies related to surveillance video from fixed, in-car and body-worn cameras. \nRetail —Panasonic is demonstrating advanced business intelligence tools for end users in retail environments with its i-PRO ULTRA 360 panoramic indoor (WV-SFN480) and outdoor IP66 rated weather and vandal-resistant (WV-SFV481) fixed dome 360-degree cameras. Based on Panasonic’s new, 12 megapixel sensor and 4K ULTRA HD engine, the ULTRA 360 produces a 9MP (3K x 3K) Fisheye image at 15fps and a 4MP Fisheye image at 30fps—effectively providing the same resolution and coverage area as four conventional 720p security cameras. \nProviding valuable insights into the movements of customers and employees, the ULTRA 360 camera’s built-in analytics suite provides heat mapping capabilities that combines the history of movement in a particular area, providing a color overlay of traffic patterns and dwell time in a single easy-to-understand view. In addition, a 12-area bi-directional “people counting” function is included which can quantifies the both the quantity and direction of movement of people in a scene. These advanced analytics capabilities provide useful insights into floor behavior, giving retailers actionable data that can help improve customer service and in-store marketing strategies as well as enhance loss prevention efforts. \nCombined with its popular embedded recording solution (WJ-NV300) and ASM200 i-PRO Management Software, Panasonic can provide retailers with a convenient, easy-to-use surveillance system-in-a-box, maximizing their surveillance investment by delivering both operational awareness and advanced business analytics capabilities for marketing, operations and business process management improvement. \nPanasonic’s entire portfolio of security solutions for businesses, schools, public safety and retail organizations are on display at ASIS International 2015, Booth 3709. \nTo learn more about Panasonic’s solutions for vertical markets or its entire line of integrated security solutions please visit www.us.panasonic.com/security and follow us on Twitter at www.twitter.com/PANSecurity . \nPanasonic Solutions for Business \nPanasonic delivers game-changing technology solutions that deliver a customized experience to drive better outcomes—for our customers and our customers’ customers.
