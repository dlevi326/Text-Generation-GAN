But according to Uber, an Uber without surge pricing produces a less-than-optimal service. \n“Surge pricing has two effects: people who can wait for a ride often decide to wait until the price falls; and drivers who are nearby go to that neighborhood to get the higher fares. As a result, the number of people wanting a ride and the number of available drivers come closer together, bringing wait times back down,” says Uber. \n“We found that, without surge pricing, Uber is not really Uber — you can’t push a button and get a ride in minutes.” \nUber looked at a period right after a packed Madison Square Garden concert and compared it to last New Year’s Eve, when Uber experienced a technical glitch causing surge pricing in New York City to fail for 26 minutes. \nHere’s what Uber found : \nOn the night of the concert, even though the number of people opening the Uber app experienced a 4x increase, the number of actual ride requests only rose slightly. In other words people decided not to request a ride. Meanwhile, 100% of ride requests were completed and ETAs were virtually unaffected. \nBy comparison on New Year’s Eve, without surge, ride requests skyrocketed and only 25% of these requests were completed. ETAs also increased sharply. Without surge pricing, rider and driver behavior did not adapt to the increased interest in getting a ride. \n“The best evidence for the effectiveness of Uber’s surge algorithm is the remarkable consistency of the expected wait time for a ride. Regardless of demand conditions, the surge algorithm filters demand and encourages supply such that a ride is almost always fewer than 5 minutes away,” says the research paper . \nBasically, without surge pricing, according to Uber, you’d be waiting for a ride for a long, long time. \nThis report comes just months after a well-publicized report suggested that Uber is “disingenuous” in the way it handles surge pricing – using “predictive” algorithms instead of responding to genuine supply and demand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T03:17:20.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
