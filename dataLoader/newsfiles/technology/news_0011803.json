I do believe the assessment of Pakistan that the Haqqani network has been disrupted\" he said. \nAziz's comments come at a time of tense relations between Kabul and Islamabad with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani recently accusing Pakistan of sending \"messages of war\" following a spate of attacks on the capital city. \nIslamabad responded by summoning Afghanistan's ambassador over what it called a \"smear campaign\". \nThe Haqqani network was set up in the 1970s as an Islamist force to oppose the Marxist regime in Kabul and its Soviet backers and fought in the Afghan civil war. \nThe Haqqanis are seen as close to hardline elements in Pakistani military intelligence and the group's leader Sirajuddin Haqqani was last month named as one of two deputy leaders of the Afghan Taliban. \nSirajuddin has long been one of Washington's most important targets and was joined last week by his brother Abdul Aziz Haqqani on the blacklist of \"specially designated global terrorists\". \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:09:11.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
