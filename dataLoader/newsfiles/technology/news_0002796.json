The large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) project will enable Bloomberg L.P.’s global headquarters in midtown Manhattan and its downtown data center to partially convert to clean solar energy. The ribbon was cut on the project this week, on which Bloomberg’s sustainability team, alongside purchasing, facilities, and legal collaborated.\nThe project utilizes “Remote Net Metering”, a program that enables sites with poor solar characteristics but significant energy consumption to benefit from a solar system on an alternative site. This project is sited on three warehouses in the Springfield Gardens section of Queens near JFK Airport. It is expected to produce 1.8 million kWh of energy annually, enough to power 244 homes, and eliminate 535 metric tons of carbon.\nThe project is being developed by NYC-basedEnterSolar, whose managing director, Peyton Boswell, said, “While Manhattan often presents challenges for solar energy, we are proud to be partnering with Bloomberg, one of the world’s most recognizable brands based here in New York, on this renewable energy project.”\nIn addition to being the largest remote net metered project in the city, this project is the first to use remote net metering to power a midtown Manhattan skyscraper with a remotely-sited solar PV system. The JFK Airport Park project is being noted for utilization of remote net metering, which allows sites with poor solar characteristics but significant on-site load to benefit from solar systems installed on an alternative site with excellent solar characteristics.\nRead Entire Article at: http://realstreettech.com/on-the-horizon-solar-power-for-bloomberg-nyc-hq/\nAbout Us:\nTechnology’s impact on commercial real estate is moving at an exponential rate.
