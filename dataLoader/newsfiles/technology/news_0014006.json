Picture: Hollie Adams Source: News Corp Australia\nThe average user on the National Broadband Network is not your pimply next-door neighbour with an addiction to high-speed online gaming. It’s Phillip Roddom, a retired truck driver who lives alone in a small, one-bedroom apartment next to the glassy waters of Lake Macquarie in the northern NSW town of Belmont.\nMr Roddom has just become one of the first in the nation to experience the NBN’s new fibre-to-the-node network, which will officially be switched on today by the government-owned business building the largest infrastructure project since the Snowy Hydro.\nMr Roddom was selected as one of 43 homes in Belmont to test services on the FTTN network as part of a multi-million-dollar deal between Telstra and NBN to trial the technology before its commercial rollout.\nBefore the NBN came to his home, Mr Roddom was accessing download speeds of less than 20 megabits per second on his Telstra broadband connection. On the NBN’s new FTTN network that has catapulted to 96Mbps for downloads and 36Mbps for uploads.\n“A neighbour of mine just downloaded the full third season of (TV show) Arrow. He did it at 10 o’clock at night and it took him three hours and 24 minutes. So I thought, that was a good challenge, so I did it myself with the NBN, and it took me an hour and two minutes to download 5.6GB. So that’s how fast it is,” Mr Roddom said. “I didn’t do a lot with it before. I’m just a basic, decrepit old bugger that has a computer to play games on. But now I do everything on it. Once you get on it (NBN), you’re hooked.”\nThe switching-on of the FTTN network is a milestone for NBN and the Coalition government, which is using existing assets like Telstra’s copper and HFC networks as the basis of the build, instead of replacing all existing infrastructure with an all-fibre network as was promised under Labor.\nThe Coalition wants to cut the cost and time by rolling out fibre to nodes that will connect to Telstra’s copper network for the last few hundred metres.\nOnce its complete in 2020, some 38 per cent of homes and businesses will be passed by the FTTN network, 20 per cent will be passed by FTTP and 34 per cent will be passed by what used to be Telstra’s and Optus’s cable networks.\nWhile the NBN’s technology mix was supposed to be vastly cheaper to deploy, the NBN recently revealed that construction costs would exceed its $41 billion budget by as much as $15bn.\nThere has been much criticism of the government’s decision to go with FTTN, with critics arguing Telstra’s old copper network is too decrepit to deliver the broadband speeds that will be needed.\nBut the FTTN trials have produced good results for the NBN, delivering download speeds of 100Mbps and upload speeds of 40Mbps for residents who live within 400m of a node.\nHowever, both upload and download speeds drop off further away from a node. For example, the slowest download speed in the Belmont trials came in at 49Mbps and upload speed of 15.7Mbps for premises 728m from a node.\nAccording to internal NBN data, about 90 per cent of the nation’s premises lie within 700m of a node, while 70 per cent are within 500m.\nNBN FTTx architect Stefan Keller-Tuberg said most users in the FTTN footprint would receive the 100Mbps promised by the technology.\n“There’s a misconception around the lengths of copper loops in Australia. If you look across the entire country, there’s around about 60 per cent lines at less than 400m from the current pillar. So the vast majority of lines are expected to be in the range where 100mbps is decent,” he said.", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/21/1227536/171076-f7bc56f4-5f46-11e5-b65c-9d734000beb9.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-21T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T02:31:41.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
