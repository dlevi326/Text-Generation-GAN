The CEO, who survived a palace coup five months ago, faces customer and official questions about his knowledge of the emissions scandal at the same time as longstanding sales problems in the U.S. and a recent slump in once-booming sales in China hurt profit.\nA Volkswagen spokesman rejected speculation that Mr. Winterkorn may lose his job this week.\nMr. Winterkorn, who runs Germany's biggest company with nearly 203 billion euros in sales and 600,000 employees, faces demands for explanations from those who once sought his counsel. Some worry the VW scandal could damage Germany's economy.\n\"Millions of people in the world trust our brand, our cars and our technology,\" Mr. Winterkorn said in a video message Tuesday. \"I am endlessly sorry that we have betrayed that trust.\"\nVolkswagen shares are off nearly 35% since Friday, when the Environmental Protection Agency publicly accused the car maker of cheating on emissions tests of some diesel-powered cars sold by VW and its Audi unit.\nThe company's top shareholders had planned this week to approve an extension of Mr. Winterkorn's contract through 2018. But the outcome is now less certain.\nThe Porsche and Piech clans, heirs of Beetle inventor Ferdinand Piech, control nearly 51% of Volkswagen's voting stock. Wolfgang Porsche, head of the clan, supported Mr. Winterkorn in April, when his cousin, former chairman and Volkswagen patriarch Ferdinand Piech, tried to oust Mr. Winterkorn. But the clan chief's backing is uncertain, said a person familiar with the situation.\n\"It depends on how deeply Winterkorn and the rest of the management board were involved in the affair,\" that person said.\nMr. Winterkorn on Tuesday acknowledged \"misconduct\" on Volkswagen's part while pledging \"Everything will be put on the table at this time, as quickly, thoroughly and transparently as possible.\"\nU.S. environmental authorities alleged Volkswagen had installed software in nearly 500,000 cars that made them appear to run cleaner in emissions tests than they do on the road. The company is now subject to an EPA and U.S. criminal investigation and could face more than $18 billion in fines.\nConcerns that the scandal could lead to broader damage for the industry has hit the shares of car companies across Europe. Daimler AG, BMW AG, and French car makers Renault SA and PSA Peugeot Citroen have suffered sharp stock-market declines since the EPA announcement.\nThe undoing of Volkswagen's ruse traces back to at least 2012, when EPA officials and California regulators were in touch with European counterparts about high emissions in diesel vehicles. California regulators tested Volkswagen cars and continually found them to pollute more on the road than in the lab.\nIn spring 2014, Drew Kodjak, executive director at clean-air advocate International Council on Clean Transportation, met with a senior EPA official and told the official that a 2012 Jetta and 2013 Passat had significantly higher nitrogen oxide emissions during normal driving conditions than what was certified with EPA. Another car the researchers tested, a diesel-powered BMW, did not have higher nitrogen oxide emissions.\nThe researchers also alerted Volkswagen of the test results.\n\"We went to Volkswagen and said, 'You guys should know that at least two of your vehicles, there are some really high emissions here, you might want to look into that,'\" Mr. Kodjak said.\nOver the next year, Volkswagen insisted the disparities were the result of technical glitches, even issuing a voluntary recall in December 2014 that included nearly a half-million diesel cars. But additional testing earlier this year found the steps Volkswagen took did not resolve the emissions discrepancy.\nIn early August, a senior Volkswagen official flew from Germany to an automotive conference in Traverse City, Mich., to meet with a U.S. executive for the auto maker and a top California regulator to discuss the discrepancies, said a person familiar with the matter. At a resort in the northern Michigan town, suffering from power outages from an intense thunderstorm, the Volkswagen officials repeated claims that the failing emissions tests were the result of technical problems.\nCalifornia regulators continued questioning Volkswagen about the higher emissions. In August, at a transportation and energy conference in Pacific Grove, Calif., a U.S. Volkswagen official approached the senior California regulator again, this time with a disclosure: The German auto maker had been using defeat devices to circumvent emissions tests, one of the people said.\nOn Sept. 3, California regulators, EPA officials and Volkswagen officials convened a conference call. Volkswagen gave a detailed presentation showing nearly a half million cars sold since 2008 had dual-calibration software allowing vehicles to meet emissions tests but pollute more during normal driving conditions, one of the people said.\nEven after that call, Volkswagen pleaded for certification of its 2016 models, claiming it had swelling inventories that it needed to get to showrooms, the people said. Regulators refused.\nMr. Piech, who tried to oust Mr. Winterkorn last spring, is stepping up his role. The Porsche and Piech clans have nominated Volkswagen finance chief Hans-Dieter Potsche to succeed Mr. Piech as supervisory board chairman.\nThe move, putting the CFO in charge of his current boss, was a strong indication that Mr. Winterkorn's position was not secure. It also showed that Mr. Piech still wielded some power in the background.\nThe emissions scandal may now have sealed Mr. Winterkorn's fate.\nAccess Investor Kit for \"Volkswagen AG\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007664039\n 22, 2015 21:41 ET (01:41 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007664039"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:32:06.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
