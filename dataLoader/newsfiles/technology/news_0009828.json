Swart will continue to invest as a key member of the Polaris team nationwide and serve as the primary technology investment presence in Silicon Valley and San Francisco. Polaris Managing Partner Dave Barrett recognized Swart’s contributions thus far, citing his partner’s passion for building businesses and his strong cultural fit with the Polaris team as key success factors:\n“Over the past year, Gary has added tremendous value to our firm and our portfolio companies,” said Barrett. “He has contributed additional, meaningful operating chops and domain expertise to our technology team, mentored countless entrepreneurs, and helped to fortify our West Coast presence. As an operating executive, he experienced exceptional success and developed strong empathy for the entrepreneurial journey which we, as partners, pride ourselves in having. At our core, Polaris is about building extraordinary relationships. Having known Gary for the last 20 years, working with each other in our past operating lives, I can attest that he ‘walks the talk’. We are all super-proud to have him as our partner.”\nIn his general partner role at Polaris, Swart will support his portfolio while actively seeking additional opportunities primarily in San Francisco but nationally as well. He will continue his coaching and mentoring initiatives with company founders and innovators in pursuit of transformative endeavors in the Bay Area entrepreneurial ecosystem.\nRemarking on his partnership at the firm, Swart shared his enthusiasm for continuing to do the work he loves:\n“Today’s company builders are not looking for just money; they want a partner who has walked in their shoes and is willing to roll up his or her sleeves and work right alongside them when they need it,” Swart said. “It is here that I am most gratified - offering support to the entrepreneur who is seeking to transform the status quo. I am thrilled to have found a home at Polaris with opportunities to do great things together with our founders and teams.”\nAbout Gary Swart\nGary Swart is a partner with Polaris Partners, and serves as an advisor and mentor to dozens of companies.
