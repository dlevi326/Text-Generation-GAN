Through working with Valve and the Counter-Strike community, SteelSeries is delivering an inspired mouse design featuring the Fade skin found in CS:GO along with a new textured surface. “The Rival has become one of the best-selling optical mice on the market and it’s a perfect mouse across so many games, but especially for first-person shooters. We worked with Valve to build something really special for the CS community that would garner excitement,” said Ehtisham Rabbani, SteelSeries CEO. “We tested this with a limited sale during ESL One Cologne and the fans went crazy on social media channels asking for it to be available immediately and globally – we’re thrilled to make that happen.”\nThe Rival delivers unparalleled precision through its industry-leading optical sensor and SteelSeries switches – with a 30 million-click lifespan. It is these features, plus the unique right-hand ergonomic form factor, that assisted team Fnatic in winning back-to-back majors in Katowice and Cologne this year.\n“The CS:GO Fade edition of the Rival mouse is one of the most exciting pieces of gear I’ve gotten right before an event. Since the event, the community has been going wild,” said Markus “Pronax” Wallsten of Fnatic.\nOptimized Precision & Performance\nThe SteelSeries Rival boasts a modern, optical sensor that delivers precise tracking at any speed. Gamers can configure the Rival’s hardware, including resolution settings that can reach up to 6,500 counts per inch (CPI) and down to one millisecond of customizable response time, equaling zero lag time. The sensor delivers zero acceleration and the ability to reach movement speeds of up to 200 inches per second at 50g of acceleration.\nMaximum Personalization\nWith SteelSeries Engine gamers can access and customize features for a fully personalized experience. The downloadable software suite has a quick and easy start-up, using very little CPU and RAM resources, so that while the software is running it does not slow down and affect the users game and computer performance.\nThe Rival also equips users with options for setting color and effects. With a choice of 16.8 million colors for two independent illuminated zones, users can assign colors and illumination modes to profiles. The mouse also features GameSense, which allows real-time game events to be displayed via illumination settings on the mouse.\nPrice & Availability\nThe Rival 300 CS:GO Fade Edition Mouse is $69.99 / €79.99 MSRP and can be pre-ordered now on the SteelSeries Web Shop.
