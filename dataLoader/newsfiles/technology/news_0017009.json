Rightscorp (OTCQB: RIHT), a leading provider of data and analytic services to support artists and owners of copyrighted property, announced that it has the technology to combat Aurous' music streaming app and website which is set to launch on October 10 th . Aurous is built on similar technology to Popcorn Time aka \"Netflix for pirates\", a software application which has become popular for illegally streaming movies and TV shows. It has an easy-to-use interface like Spotify, but the music streams from the millions of users on the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing network.\nAurous' technology will be unaffected by take-down notices, site blocking and will not use Pirate Bay or any domain names that can be blocked. It will distribute the music search metadata via the peer-to-peer networks, allowing the ability to stream large amounts of free music illegally and providing a very easy-to-use interface to the BitTorrent network.\nChristopher Sabec , CEO of Rightscorp stated, \"There is a lot of concern on the launch of the Aurous technology as it directly targets the music industry. Due to music piracy, the U.S. economy loses $12.5 billion in total output annually, while streaming has not come close to replacing that revenue. The Aurous app allows for access to a large amount of free music, acting like a Spotify, however, offering zero payments to the rightsholder. Our mission is to educate the industry and protect creators and owners of content on their rights to determine how their content is distributed. Rightscorp's ability to get individual seeders to stop seeding will be the only scalable way to stop this next explosion of free music.\"\nIn August, the Company launched its Popcorn Time Mitigation (PTM) service for broadcasters and content owners who want to prevent unauthorized rebroadcasts of their content via Popcorn Time.\nAbout Rightscorp, Inc.\nRightscorp (RIHT) is a leading provider of data and analytic services to support artists and owners of copyrighted Intellectual Property (IP). The Company's patent pending digital loss prevention technology focuses on the infringement of rights to digital content such as music, movies, software, books and games and ensures that the rights of owners and creators are protected. Rightscorp works closely with its clients to develop programs of education and notice, and as necessary to pursue copyright infringers for their illegal file sharing activities via notifications sent through Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company's technology identifies copyright infringers, who are provided information about copyrights and the importance of Intellectual Property and offered a reasonable opportunity to terminate their activities and pay a nominal settlement option that is generally a fraction of the statutory minimum in an effort to avoid the need for expensive litigation. With minimum statutory penalties of $750 and up to $150,000 per infringement, Rightscorp's technology and process of notice allows all parties to efficiently and economically address copyright infringement without the costs and burdens of litigation. Based on the fact that 22% of all Internet traffic is used to distribute copyrighted content without permission or compensation to the creators, Rightscorp's technology and process provides one of the best and most cost efficient means of addressing this issue for both the artists and those who have infringed their works.\nhttp://www.rightscorp.com/\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release may include forward-looking statements.
