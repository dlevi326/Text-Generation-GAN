As ZMDI announced today, the company’s business development in the third quarter 2015 is significantly above plan. Drivers of growth are strong licensing business in the \"Digital Power\" division as well as a dynamic development of the \"Mobile Sensing\" division with growth of more than 50 percent over the previous year. Due to the backdrop of the positive business development, the Management Board has raised its full-year forecast for 2015 and now expects revenue growth in the double digits at over 70 million euros. The previous full-year forecast had put growth for 2015 between 5 and 10 percent in prospect. In 2014, ZMDI showed a turnover of approximately 61.1 million euros, following 59 million euros in 2013. Despite increased costs in the course of the workforce expansion, the outcome will clearly be positive.\nOperationally, ZMDI has driven the capacity for customers further. The new ZMDI location in Munich has now begun work and has a capacity for 40 staff. At present, there are about 20 employees working in Munich for ZMDI; globally ZMDI employs around 400 employees.\nZMDI expects further growth in particular due to upcoming product launches for the automotive sector in 2016. In 2014, ZMDI had received large orders with a total volume through 2025 in the triple-digit million-euro range for transaction volume. The focuses of these large orders are mainly high-performance circuits for automotive sensor technology and industrial applications. In order to secure the growth path and create new alternatives, ZMDI has announced its intentions to promote the generation of internal capital. The spectrum of options ranges from the issuance of a bond, via a capital increase, to an initial public offering.\nThilo von Selchow, CEO of ZMDI: \"The current business performance in 2015 shows that ZMDI is in good shape. We have achieved some growth targets earlier than planned; this confirms that we are on the right path. Our investments in the development of future fields are starting to pay off. This is demonstrated by the large orders in the licensing business in ‘Digital Power’ with strong partners, such as the market leader for FPGA circuits Altera, as well as dynamic growth in the ‘Mobile Sensing’ division. And it shows that a semiconductor business with products from East Germany and Silicon Saxony can be very successful. Even for a ‘fabless company’ such as ZMDI, this is possible and can be done for the most part without subsidies. Our company's history is particularly characterized by innovation; this mind-set even today determines our value creation. Essential courses for sustainable growth at ZMDI have been undertaken. In the coming year, the long-term automotive contracts will ramp-up. Medium and long term, the strong market position that we have achieved in the field of mobile sensing will help us to utilize the enormous potential for growth through the Internet of Things (IoT).\"\nSteffen Wollek, CFO at ZMDI, underlined that \"The development of business in 2015 is very encouraging and above expectations. Nevertheless, we will keep a cool head and not lose sight of the costs. Our goal is clearly defined: we want to continue to grow profitably. We do not exclude targeted acquisitions in the background of observable consolidations in the sector, but we will not rush things. We are not under time pressure.\"\nAbout ZMDI\nZentrum Mikroelektronik Dresden AG (ZMDI) is an award-winning global semiconductor company headquartered in Dresden, Germany, and specializing in enabling energy-efficient solutions.
