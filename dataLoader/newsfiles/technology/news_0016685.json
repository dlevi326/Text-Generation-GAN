The arrangement of magnetisation in the synthetic material assumed very different states at different temperatures – just like molecules in ice are more ordered than in water, and are in turn more ordered in water than in steam. Credit: PSI/Luca Anghinolfi \n(Phys.org)—It has been a very interesting week for physics, particularly for those researchers working in applied areas, one team at the Paul Scherrer Institute created a synthetic material out of a billion tiny magnets that mimic steam, water and ice . And a pair of researchers, one in the U.S. and the other in Iran, found that a spinning ring on a table behaves more like a boomerang than a coin —they believe it is due to the hole allowing air to pass through. \nAlso, another pair of researchers, one in China and the other in the U.S., offered a way to put a living organism into a superposition state —by sticking a bacterium to an oscillating membrane used in a prior experiment. And a team at NIST broke the distance record for quantum teleportation —they \"teleported\" light particles over 100 kilometers, quadruple the previous record. And a team a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory described a new theory of stealth dark matter that may explain the universe's missing mass —they combined theoretical and computational techniques to come up with a model that describes the \"stealthy\" nature of the mysterious stuff. Also, a team working with ALICE at the LHC announced that they had confirmed fundamental symmetry in nature via measurements of particle mass and electric charges. \nIn other news, a team working at Harvard University announced that they had come up with a rechargeable battery to power a home from rooftop solar panels —they claim it is cost-effective, clean and safe, since it is not flammable. And in a rather eerie study, a group working at the University of Washington reported on a study in which they linked two human brains for a question-and-answer experiment . Volunteers had their brains connected and were then able to ask questions and \"hear\" what the other person gave as an answer. A team with the U.S. Geological Survey published a report describing how El Niño and La Niña will exacerbate coastal hazards across the entire Pacific —as global warming continues. \nAnd finally, if you are feeling anxious, researchers at the University of Illinois suggested you check your orbitofrontal cortex and cultivate your optimism —grownups with larger OFC, they found, tend to be less anxious and more optimistic. Experiment confirms fundamental symmetry in nature September 21, 2015 \nScientists working with ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment), a heavy-ion detector on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) ring, have made precise measurements of particle mass and electric charge that confirm the existence ... Physicists break distance record for quantum teleportation September 22, 2015 \nResearchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have \"teleported\" or transferred quantum information carried in light particles over 100 kilometers (km) of optical fiber, four times farther than the ... Research pair offer a way to put a living organism into superposition state September 24, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—A pair of physicists, one with Tsinghua University in China, the other with Perdue University in the U.S. has come up with what they believe is a viable way to cause a living organism to be in two places at the ... New theory of stealth dark matter may explain universe's missing mass September 24, 2015 \nLawrence Livermore scientists have come up with a new theory that may identify why dark matter has evaded direct detection in Earth-based experiments. Spinning ring on a table found to behave more like a boomerang than a coin September 25, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—A trio of researchers, two with the University of California, the third with Sharif University of Technology, in Iran, has found that a common ring, such as is worn on the finger, spins differently on a tabletop ... Recommended for you Female genital cutting is based on private values rather than social norms September 24, 2015 \nWorldwide an estimated 125 million girls and women are cut despite the fact that female genital cutting leads to serious health problems throughout life. Development agencies spend millions of dollars every year on interventions ... Two-million-year-old fossils reveal hearing abilities of early humans September 25, 2015 \nResearch into human fossils dating back to approximately two million years ago reveals that the hearing pattern resembles chimpanzees, but with some slight differences in the direction of humans. Blog comment, collab help man attack old maths problem September 26, 2015 \nChris Cesare in Nature reported on Friday that Terence Tao successfully attacked the Erdős discrepancy problem by building on an online collaboration.

Archaeologists find bone fragments in hunt for 'real' Mona Lisa September 24, 2015 \nItalian archaeologists trying to solve the mystery behind one of the world's most famous paintings said Wednesday they had found bits of bone that could have belonged to the 'real' Mona Lisa. Women's perceptions of professional advancement may influence career outcomes September 24, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—The underrepresentation of women in positions of power in organizations is well documented, but addressing the causes and finding remedies is complicated by a number of factors. Most of the research into workplace ... Best of Last Week – Dark matter hiding in stars, a new tree of life and smarter bike pedaling September 21, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—It was another good week for physics as a team with members from Germany, Austria and Australia conducted the most precise test of Lorentz symmetry for a photon and found that the speed of light is, indeed, constant—no ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:33:14.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
