Although floodwaters are now receding, thousands of residents from Joso and surrounding areas remain in evacuation shelters. \nThe flooding resulted after Tropical Storm Etau dumped more than two feet of water in towns and villages on Monday. The storm left at least 27 injured. Rescue operations continue for victims stranded on rooftops and homes in Joso, one of the worst hit areas. \n“As victims begin to return home after forced evacuations, we would like to extend our services to assist where we can in recovering lost data from damaged computer storage and mobile devices,” said DriveSavers President Scott Moyer. “DriveSavers has nearly 30 years of experience in securely retrieving photos, financial records, videos, tax documents, contact lists and other critical information stored on all kinds of storage devices.” \n“We are honored to partner with DriveSavers to help the Japanese people salvage any data from hard drives that were destroyed from rising waters.
