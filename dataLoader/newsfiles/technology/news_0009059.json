The company also announced deals with China Electronics Technology Group Corp., Shanghai Oriental Pearl Media Co., Sichuan Provincial Government, and the Xi'xian New Area development zone.\nTensions between China and U.S. have flared up as of late, and Microsoft has been caught in the middle on several issues, from piracy to cyberspying and regulation. The company is the subject of a continuing probe by Chinese regulators over suspected monopolistic practices, and it continues to battle pirated versions of its software. In 2014, China's Central Government Procurement Center banned government agencies from purchasing computers loaded with Microsoft's Windows 8 software.\nPresident Barack Obama last week said he would press China's leaders to prevent hackers from stealing U.S. corporate secrets. Mr. Xi is expected to meet with Mr. Obama by week's end.\nWrite to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com\n 23, 2015 18:25 ET (22:25 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T16:00:35.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
