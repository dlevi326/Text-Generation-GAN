Should he be compensated for damage?\nThe Eagle Vale man acknowledges he didn’t take out insurance or pay for “signature on delivery”. But he argues it’s not good enough that the driver “basically stopped the truck and threw the box over the fence”. The four hours spent packing the turntables had been for nothing.\nEXPERT LEGAL ADVICE: FREE AND LIVE IN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER Q & A NOW\nOther Stories Mum saw son shot dead by police News 0 comments JT: No qualms boycotting Dally M Awards Nrl 0 comments ‘Burgers and babes’ joint coming soon Central Coast 0 comments Leigh Sales’ cutting question for Abbott Television Brayden’s desperate dash for survival West Why being an escort has made me a better mother Rendezview 0 comments He complained to Smart Send and Australia Post’s StarTrack , which did the delivery. He got nowhere.\nIn contacting The Daily Telegraph, Mr Ristevski said: “I thought it was important for your readers to know what can happen to their valuables.”\nSmart Send says it “compensated” its customer by refunding the $60 postage fee he paid. But it won’t cover the $1000 to $1500 of damage done to the turntables.\nDoor to floor ... one of the turntables after it was dropped. Picture: supplied “I am not saying it is the perfect situation by any stretch of the imagination,” Smart Send director Christine Madden told Public Defender. “I feel sorry for Mendo. I know that he is out of pocket.”\nBut “surely he has some responsibility to cover the goods in transit just as you wouldn’t drive a car without insurance. If something happens to it you don’t blame anyone else”.\nThe gates to the recipient’s property were closed, Ms Madden said. The package could not be left at the nearest post office because it would not be accepted due to size. And there was no obligation to take the box back to the depot because Mr Ristevski did not pay for signature on delivery.\nThe courier “put it on the other side of the fence thinking he was doing the right thing”.\n“Live a day in their shoes.”\nAuthority to leave ... but is this good enough? Picture: supplied. An ACCC spokesman said consumers are protected by a guarantee that a service will be provided with “due care and skill”. If it isn’t, the remedy can in some cases include “compensation for damages and loss” but only if a business “could have reasonably foreseen the problem”.\nA business only has to pay for damage or loss it caused or when the goods have “left their control”, the spokesman said.\nWhich puts StarTrack in the crosshairs.\n“We are taking this matter extremely seriously and are investigating and talking to all parties involved,” a StarTrack spokeswoman said last night.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b20ebac2dbd0771c3fff64e31e0e5f87?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f23786665476c47df95deaedd2138b41", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e78268fafe15e2c9e8ceb1a131b25833", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a8ce13e17ee0e9937cb99bf97de7acca", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/845b521c44c797b5094a8e3607c6b479?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cd6495223d9a3c63ad714d8a3630e6a4", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/921957778a82877b19f900e4d4d48742", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&maxRelated=6&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-09T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T07:22:32.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
