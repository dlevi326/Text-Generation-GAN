In May 2012, as partners were fleeing the firm to work at competitors, the firm filed for bankruptcy, owing creditors $245 million.\nThe trial of the three men in New York state court in Manhattan comes at a pivotal time in prosecutions for corporate malfeasance. This month, the U.S. Department of Justice said that it will seek to prosecute individuals for corporate crimes in addition to pursuing their employers.\nThe charges against the three men, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr., were in part based on e-mails, cited in the complaint, in which the men referred to “fake income” and “accounting tricks.”\nVance alleged that Dewey cut costs by mischaracterizing payments to salaried lawyers, reversing disbursements that had been written off, double-booking income, encouraging clients to backdate checks and delaying expenses, according to court filings.\nThere’s also an allegation that a $150 million bond deal that Dewey sold to the public in 2010 was based on inflated revenue and hidden expenses. Prosecutors say the three men stole almost $200 million from 13 insurers and two financial firms.\nThe bond deal is the subject of a separate lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in federal court in Manhattan. That case has been suspended pending the outcome of the criminal trial.\nDavis, DiCarmine and Sanders have maintained their innocence and pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nSeven ex-employees agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with Vance’s probe. Former finance director Frank Canellas said in his plea agreement that he had helped decide “which appropriate and inappropriate accounting adjustments to make” to help Dewey meet its financial obligations once it became apparent the firm was failing.\nSome of the e-mails introduced as evidence showed that there were some second thoughts about the accounting techniques. “I don’t want to cook the books anymore,” Sanders said in a Dec. 4, 2008, e-mail, according to the SEC. “We need to stop doing that.”\nBut in a June 27, 2009, e-mail, Sanders asked Canellas, “Can you find another clueless auditor?”\nWhile the New York prosecutors had more than 40 witnesses, the defense lawyers presented none. The defense tried instead, through cross-examinations of government witnesses, to convince the jury that their clients didn’t know about the fraud, or that the accounting was more complicated than alleged. The defense pointed out that Ernst & Young, the firm’s lead auditor, wasn’t called by prosecutors to testify.\nThe criminal case is People v. Davis, 773-2014, New York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Davis, 14-cv-01528, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).\nSidley and Skadden Work on Starwood-Colony American Deal\nSkadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP represents Colony American Homes,\nand Sidley Austin LLP is advising Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust in the merger announced Monday.\nThe companies -- two of the largest U.S. single-family home landlords -- when combined will create a company with $7.7 billion in assets.\nThe Skadden team includes M&A partners Howard Ellin and Kenneth Wolff, counsel Timothy Fesenmyer, corporate partner Jonathan Ko, banking partner David Kitchen, executive compensation and benefits partner Regina Olshan, labor and employment partner David Schwartz and associate Anne Villanueva, intellectual-property and technology counsel Jessica Cohen and real estate partner Evan Levy and counsel George Fatheree III .\nThe Sidley attorneys representing Starwood are led by partner Michael Gordon and include partners Richard Astle, Gabe Saltarelli, Jason Friedhoff, Christian Brause, David Miller and Edward Prokop and counsel Neil Horner and Robert Hardy.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Colony America’s stockholders will receive 64.9 million shares of Starwood Waypoint in exchange for all shares of closely held Colony. Starwood Waypoint shareholders will own 41 percent of the combined business and Colony American investors will hold the rest, the companies said in a statement Monday.\nThe new company, which will have more than 30,000 homes, will take advantage of the demand for rental properties as tight mortgage standards and rising prices hold back home purchases.\nFor more on the deal, click here.\nLawsuit News A former Uber Technologies Inc. driver has won another victory against the ride-sharing company.\nIn June, the California labor commissioner ruled that the driver should be considered an employee, not an independent contractor. And on Monday, a San Francisco state court judge also sided with the driver, and rejected the company’s bid to force the driver into arbitration.\nThe judge held that the company’s arbitration clause is unenforceable, echoing a federal judge in the same city who blocked Uber’s bid to derail a group lawsuit on behalf of thousands of drivers and force them to fight the company individually in arbitration proceedings. Uber is appealing the federal court decision.\nSuperior Court Judge Ernest Goldsmith in San Francisco said Uber’s contract with drivers is “flatly inconsistent” because one provision states that a private arbitrator should decide whether the dispute belongs in arbitration while another states that the choice is to made by a judge.\n“I’m not going to fly in the face of a stark inconsistency in order to massage this into arbitrability,” the judge told lawyers during a hearing Monday. Goldsmith issued a tentative ruling before the hearing, then made it final in court.\nUber will will ask a state appeals court to review the ruling, Jessica Santillo, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.\n“The Uber partner in this case agreed to resolve disputes of this nature through arbitration when she joined the platform last year,” Santillo said. “The right to arbitrate disputes has been confirmed multiple times by the Supreme Court.”\nThe case is Uber Technologies Inc. v. Berwick, 15-546378, California Superior Court, San Francisco County. The federal case is O’Connor v. Uber Technologies Inc., 13-cv-03826, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).\nFor more, click here.\nComings and Goings Bracewell & Giuliani LLP is adding four partners from Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP to its environment and natural resources practice.\nSara Burgin, Kevin Collins, Matt Paulson and Whit Swift, who are all joining as partners, will work primarily from Bracewell’s Austin office.\nBurgin advises industrial and municipal clients on water quality, including permitting, compliance and enforcement matters.
