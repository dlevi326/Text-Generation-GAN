It is into cloud-based software solutions that help retailers engage with customers through mobile, social and in-store channels. \nEarly this year InnoVen Capital (formerly SVB India, a venture debt arm of Silicon Valley Bank), which was recently acquired by Singapore government’s investment arm Temasek, invested an undisclosed amount in Capillary. \nIn July 2014, Capillary had raised $14 million in its Series B round of funding led by existing investors Sequoia Capital and Norwest Venture Partners (NVP). This round came barely five months after the firm netted $4.5 million in funding from American Express Ventures. \nThis was preceded by a $15.5 million in its Series A round of funding from Sequoia, NVP and Qualcomm Ventures in 2012. \nIncubated by IIT Kharagpur with a soft loan of Rs 15 lakh, Capillary had raised its first round of angel funding from Harminder Sahni, Naresh Malhotra and Qualcomm ($100,000 as the winner of QPrize). In January 2011, it raised a second round from Sahni and Malhotra besides new investors Rajan Anandan and Venkat Tadanki, along with a few others. The company had paid back the incubation loan to IIT Kharagpur in February 2011, after it became profitable in mid-2010. \nCapillary has offices in India (Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai), Singapore, the UAE (Dubai), the UK (London), the US (California), and South Africa (Johannesburg). \nFor Warburg Pincus this is the third deal this year after it invested in Piramal Realty and Ecom Express and raises its exposure to new generation technology space. The PE firm had previously backed Quikr and CarTrade in the consumer internet space.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T10:33:58.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
