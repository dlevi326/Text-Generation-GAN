The sofa, back yard or coffee shop is the new work station, and the Logitech K380 Multi-Device Bluetooth Keyboard and Logitech M535 Bluetooth Mouse fuel the freedom to create anywhere without compromising precision and comfort.\" \nLogitech K380 Multi-Device Bluetooth Keyboard \nThe Logitech K380 Multi-Device Bluetooth Keyboard brings the comfort and convenience of desktop typing to your computer, smartphone and tablet. Express yourself on any computing platform anywhere in your home, and connect with up to three devices, instantly switching among them with the Easy-Switch™ buttons. The keyboard will recognize your connected device and automatically map keys to supported functions and shortcuts – making your typing experience familiar and comfortable. The Logitech K380 Multi-Device Bluetooth Keyboard provides up to two years of battery life from the two AAA batteries included, and will be available in blue or grey for a suggested retail price of $39.99 USD. \nLogitech M535 Bluetooth Mouse \nThe Logitech M535 Bluetooth Mouse lets you create on virtually any computing device, whenever and wherever you choose. Its programmable navigation button puts control in the palm of your hand, allowing you to switch between applications, change between desktops, drag-and-drop files and images, replicate the three-finger swipe gesture that brings up mission control on a Mac computer, and bring up Task View on Windows 10. The mouse tracks reliably on just about any surface – from metal café tables to tile countertops to your favorite study desk – thanks to a laser-grade optical sensor. It is portable, includes a tilt wheel, has a curved shape and textured rubber grips that provide lasting comfort, and it can keep going for up to 10 months on one AA battery. Offered in black or blue, the Logitech M535 Bluetooth Mouse will be available for a suggested retail price of $39.99 USD. \nBy downloading Logitech Options Software, you can customize both the keyboard and mouse to enhance your experience and unlock a world of possibilities. Although they aren’t dependent on each other to work, the new keyboard and mouse look great together, featuring matching colors and a distinctive design. \nAvailability \nThe Logitech K380 Multi-Device Bluetooth Keyboard is expected to be available worldwide in September. The Logitech M535 Bluetooth Mouse is expected to be available in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, New Zealand, and the U.S. in September, and in Latin America in October 2015.
