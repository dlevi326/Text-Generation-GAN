The lawsuits accused Visa and MasterCard of fixing the fees they were charged each time customers used credit or debit cards.\nMerchants also claimed Visa and MasterCard prevented retailers from encouraging customers to use cheaper payment methods.\nU.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn in 2013 approved the deal, saying it provided significant monetary award and meaningful relief.\nThe settlement provides for cash payments to merchants and lets them begin charging customers a surcharge when they use Visa or MasterCard credit cards.\nAround 8,000 merchants, representing 25 percent of the transactional volume at issue, opted out of the deal, driving its value down to $5.7 billion from $7.2 billion. Over 30 lawsuits by those opt-outs are pending.\nThose retailers say a broad litigation release in the settlement forces current and future merchants who accept Visa or MasterCard to forgo rights to sue over various current and future policies and practices.\nThe deal's approval was thrown into further flux after Keila Ravelo, an ex-lawyer at MasterCard's law firm, was charged in December with engaging in a fraud scheme.\nFollowing her arrest, the firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, discovered an exchange of communications between Gary Friedman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, and Ravelo.\nSome retailers say the exchange of confidential information tainted the deal. Similar communications between Friedman and Ravelo resulted in August in a federal judge rejecting a separate antitrust settlement with American Express Co.\nThe case is In Re: Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 12-4671.\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:27:57.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
