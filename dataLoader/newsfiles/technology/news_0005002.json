Phil Hearne PJH Share on twitter by David Ramli One of the surest signs of the national broadband network's success, trial user and retired Tip Top Bakeries truck driver Phillip Roddom says, are the impromptu visits from his early-20s granddaughter.\nOnce she was too lazy to visit his humble 60-year-old flat in the lakeside suburb of Belmont, near Newcastle. But now his family come around for the odd chat and sneaky download television shows using the new NBN connection, which gets internet speeds of 100 megabits per second – more than five times faster than the ADSL broadband most Australians use.\nNBN will launch its first services on Monday using fibre to the node , which has been derided by critics for its reliance on Telstra's copper phone network. About 38 per cent, or 4.5 million homes and businesses, will be forced to use this type of technology.\nIts success or failure will either cement Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's legacy as the builder of Australia's digital future or sink him as the man who set it back by installing slower broadband across the nation.\nWhere Labor wanted to connect 93 per cent of all homes and businesses directly to fibre cabling, Mr Turnbull has backed fibre to the node as a cheaper and adequate alternative.\nThe technology works by running fibre to streetside \"node\" cabinets, which then switch over to the existing copper phone lines. By bringing new technology and fibre closer to each home, internet speeds are increased – all but one of the 42 trial services got download speeds of 50Mbps or more.\nAbout 30,000 nodes, each of which requires a dedicated power feed to work, will be placed on kerbsides across the country. Just 2200 premises will be ready on Monday because NBN wants to slowly connect customers without overwhelming the system - this will rise to 200,000 by March 2016.\nOne of the lucky ones Mr Roddom, who was a case study put forward by NBN, is one of the lucky ones, with broadband speeds of almost 100Mbps. The company says any customer within 400 metres of the node should get a similar experience.\nMr Roddom spent 15 years working 14-hour nights driving trucks to Coffs Harbour and was born around the corner from where he lives. In retirement he turns to his favourite TV show Arrow and cruise ship holidays – both of which get looked up online.\n\"It used to take me about 40-50 minutes to download an hour's TV and now it takes me about 11 to 12 minutes,\" he said. \"It's three to four times faster. I just set it up, go and get a piece of toast and it's finished.\n\"Once you get on it you're hooked.\"\nBut he adds it took four site visits to get his speeds up to scratch, with the initial speed tests coming in at 60Mbps. He's full of praise for the Telstra technicians who got him online.\n\"The two blokes who did it were unbelievable,\" he said. \"They were in and out of here that many times it wasn't funny until he got the speeds where he wanted it.\n\"[They said] 'if we charged you for this stuff it would cost you a fortune ... and we just want it working properly'.\"\nAdequate the first time An NBN spokesman told Fairfax Media later the speeds were adequate the first time and Telstra were just testing different set-ups, with the usual experience being one visit per premise.\nNBN staff spoke of one other trial location in Belmont that was getting much slower download speeds than expected. After several visits the problem turned out to be the home's botched internal wiring, caused by owners adding phone lines to different rooms and not the main line.\nThis could become a potential cause of cost blowouts if the problem was replicated nationwide and NBN is responsible for the final broadband speed within the home, but the company insists the costs are accounted for.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-09-20T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:07:11.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
