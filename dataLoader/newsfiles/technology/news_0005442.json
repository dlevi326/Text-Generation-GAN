(NASDAQ: KLIC) (“Kulicke & Soffa”, “K&S” or the “Company”), a global leader in the design and manufacture of semiconductor, LED and electronic assembly equipment, today announced its fourth fiscal quarter revenue is expected to be below the company’s previously reported outlook due to broad-based industry softness. The Company now expects fourth quarter revenue to be in the $100 to $110 million range, compared to the previously expected $135 to $145 million range. \nThe industry has continued to experience high inventory levels and low equipment utilization rates. The Company believes this softer industry environment is largely driven by reduced demand within consumer and communication segments such as PCs, tablets and smartphones. This lower end market demand is anticipated to limit near-term semiconductor unit growth and decrease the industry’s immediate need for incremental production equipment. \nThe Company will continue to be vigilant in reviewing its cost structure and has initiated measures to address the current market situation, including execution of near-term operational improvements. The Company expects to continue to return capital to shareholders through its existing repurchase program. Additional details on the progress of these initiatives will be provided during the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter results conference call scheduled on Nov 17, 2015. \n“K&S has a long and proven track record of reacting quickly to the industry’s cyclicality and is well prepared to handle the current market environment,” stated Bruno Guilmart, Kulicke & Soffa’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our flexible manufacturing model and our focus on cost containment continue to be critical in enabling this resilience. Additionally, our efforts to expand market reach into the higher growth advanced packaging segment, are anticipated to drive sustainable and fundamental through-cycle performance enhancements in the long-term.” \nDespite this revised outlook, K&S continues to anticipate a favorable tax benefit of approximately $20 million to be recognized in its fourth fiscal quarter. \nAbout Kulicke & Soffa \nKulicke & Soffa (NASDAQ: KLIC) is a global leader in the design and manufacture of semiconductor, LED and electronic assembly equipment. As a pioneer in this industry, K&S has provided customers with market leading packaging solutions for decades. In recent years, K&S has expanded its product offerings through strategic acquisitions and organic development, adding advanced packaging, advanced SMT, wedge bonding and a broader range of expendable tools to its core ball bonding products. Combined with its extensive expertise in process technology, K&S is well positioned to help customers meet the challenges of assembling the next-generation semiconductor and LED devices.
