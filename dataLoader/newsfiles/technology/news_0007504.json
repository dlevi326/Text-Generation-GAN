My DX....canna senor justugh Well-Known Member hi first of this is not a ad to sell it or anything like that i am a stoner been here for about 3 years i own one and i am writing this to share with others here it is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography so basically u seal up a small sample of the weed in this tray thing (40-50 mgs) the system sync with your phone ....then it starts by taken a base line sample of the air (this set the factors to zero for the readings)....after that it shots a steam of air into the sample and then pass the air over the senor getting the readings ....then the system has to flush it out so the senor last awhile by then the readings come up on your phone it is pretty fricken cool u get a thc cbd cbn and terepenes readings the tech is sound the idea is sound now the down side 1 it heats up my cpu (droid maxx) 2 u have to have a account to log in to use (side note u pick the info to share or not too) 3 no lists of terepenes effects have to look up on own 4 the read out bars are misleading (mine look low but when i look at the closest matches in the system i have lvls higher then some of theirs or at 50%) ....so check the numbers not the bars 5 the data is not able to be printed out (all your tests are stored not sure if it stored locally only on that phone or in the account for the app) last note the program is only in the 2.6 so i think they will fix issues with more feed back on products other then that i would tell ppl to buy it if they are growers and want some hard data on feed formula tweaking....or for medical smokers looking to get most out of the plant finally cartels so they can make sure not shipping crappy 8% thc brick crap (come on have some pride about it)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T07:07:57.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
