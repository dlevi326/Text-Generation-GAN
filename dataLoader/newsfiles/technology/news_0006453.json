(NYSE:KEYS) today announced its donation of Keysight EDA software to Chungnam National University (CNU) in Daejeon, SouthKorea, as part of the Keysight EEsof EDA University Educational Support Program . This is the third software donation this year, following earlier donations to South Korea’s Sogang and Dongguk Universities, and is intended to help CNU foster well-rounded electronics engineering experts. \n“We are proud to partner with top South Korean universities through our Keysight EEsof EDA software donation program,” said Duk-Kwon Yoon, Keysight’s country general manager in South Korea. “Our software will help CNU’s research engineers and students acquire the skills they need to positively impact industry and advance quickly in their future research.” \nKeysight EDA’s donation to CNU was formally announced during a ceremony at CNU on Aug. 18. The donation comprises three licenses of Keysight EMPro 3-D electromagnetic (EM) simulation and analysis software . In return for the donation, CNU agrees to develop RF and microwave research projects (e.g., advanced RF microwave components) using circuit-3D EM co-simulation. CNU will also use the software for academic purposes, and to create technical papers, examples and webcasts. \nCNU recently released a microwave circuit design book using Keysight EDA’s Advanced Design System software. The book was written by Dr. Kyung-Whan Yeom, professor in CNU’s department of radio science and engineering and a Keysight Certified Expert . The book is a compilation of Dr. Yeom’s studies and insights from his 20 years of expertise using ADS design software. \n“CNU is among the best RF and microwave research universities in South Korea,” said Sang-Chul Jung, president of CNU. “Partnering with a company like Keysight is key to maintaining our leading position, along with having the best teachers and facilities. CNU looks forward to developing RF and microwave talent using the industry’s leading Keysight EDA software and hardware tools.” \n“Keysight has played a pivotal role in advancing technology and we are excited to see this tradition continue with CNU,” said Jun Chie, general manager and vice president of Asia-Pacific Field Operations, Keysight. “RF and microwave research is the foundation of South Korea's leadership in commercial communication.
