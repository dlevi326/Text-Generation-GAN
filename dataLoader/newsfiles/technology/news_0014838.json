Some U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the OPM attack originated in China.\nNational Security Agency chief Michael Rogers testified that there was no evidence of further North Korean cyber attacks on U.S. companies like the one on Sony Pictures last year. But he said there had been North Korean cyber attacks on other countries, though he did not name them.\n(Reporting By Mark Hosenball and Matt Spetalnick ; Editing by Susan Heavey )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T19:29:27.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
