Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup The Australian Taxi Industry Association is enraged after the ACT government decided to legalise uberX​ on Tuesday, accusing the government of trying to piggyback on Uber's popularity.\nATIA chief executive Blair Davies said the ACT government wanted to \"become popular off the back of Uber\", rather than creating regulations that evened the playing field.\n\"We're very disappointed with the decision by the ACT government. They haven't really thought through many of the issues,\" he said.\n\"It walks like a duck and quacks like a duck. It's a taxi service. The ACT government should have taken the same view as the Australian Taxation Office .\"\nUber Australia and New Zealand general manager David Rohrsheim applauded the ACT government's decision and said the low licence fee would keep driving for uberX a low-barrier employment option. Peter Braig New laws to come into effect on October 30 will require all ride-sharing drivers to be registered, undergo police and vehicle safety checks and to pay relatively small accreditation and application fees. Ride-sharing drivers will pay a $600 application fee and a $50 accreditation fee.\nAt the same time taxi licence fees will also be reduced, but not to the same rate.\nTaxi drivers will have their licence fee reduced from $20,000 to $10,000 from October and will pay only $5000 from October 2016.\nSame rules for all Mr Davies said there should be the same rules for all drivers and that these regulations would result in lower taxi fares.\n\"Overseas, where the taxi industry has been deregulated fares have gone up ... when there is an oversupply of taxis and substitute services like uberX, this introduces inefficiencies to the system and that has to be factored into the price people pay,\" he said.\n\"It also beggars belief that in 2015, a government can introduce legislation that doesn't look down the track to incorporate autonomous vehicles ... If you're passing regulation that could be redundant in five years' time you have to ask who is responsible for taking such a myopic view of the world.\"\nBut Uber Australia and New Zealand general manager David Rohrsheim​ applauded the ACT government's decision and said the low licence fee would keep driving for uberX a low-barrier employment option.\n\"We're pleased with the process they undertook. They did it rapidly, took the time to meet us and get to know the business and relied on the facts,\" he said.\n\"Everyone with good driving records should have the ability to share the seats in their car. These regulations seem to keep that in mind.\"\nThe spat between the taxi industry and Uber has been going since Uber launched in Australia in March 2014.\nATO ruling Earlier in 2015 the ATO ruled that from August 1 uberX drivers had to begin paying the goods and services tax. Uber challenged the ruling in the Federal Court, but has let drivers increase fares by 10 per cent to account for GST.\nUberX drivers have also been taken to court in Victoria, NSW and Queensland and there is a push for Western Australia to start cracking down on these drivers.\nReviews of Uber's operations are under way by other state governments. Victoria's review has been completed and the industry is waiting on the results from the government, while NSW is part-way through a review and Queensland is just starting.\nMr Rohrsheim said he was confident that if the other states took the time to talk to and understand Uber they would come to the same conclusion as the ACT.\n\"The taxi industry is running an almighty fear campaign and they're pretty noisy,\" he said.\n\"But there are more than 50 jurisdictions all around the world now where regulations have all been put in place [to legalise Uber] and nothing has fallen apart.\"\nConsumer advocacy group CHOICE also welcomed the ACT government's decision, after an investigation by the body last week that found uberX was safe, reliable and nine times out of 10 cheaper.\n\"We hope other jurisdictions follow suit to rapidly legalise innovation and not outlaw competition,\" CHOICE director of campaigns and communications Matt Levey​ said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-09-30T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:17:53.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
