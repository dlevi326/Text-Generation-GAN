No, but really. \nIn the Bureau or Meteorology 2013/2014 annual report, after 14 pages of introductions and assorted official blurb, there is a graph on page 22 of the report which reveals much. Here’s that graph. Year on year, the graph is creeping just a bit towards the right. Image: BoM Source: news.com.au \nThe graph is a little hard to read, but what it shows is that the bureau now forecasts maximum and minimum temperatures at all Australian locations to within three degrees almost all the time. \nThe bureau is still far from perfect, but it’s definitely getting better, as you can see above. You can also read all about it for yourself here in its 2013/14 annual report . \nBut two new innovations announced today could take the Bureau of Meteorology to a whole new level of accuracy and awesomeness. The innovations are both pretty exciting. \nOne is the mega satellite. That’s not its official name. It’s actually called the “Himawari-8” satellite and the bureau says it’s the most advanced dedicated weather satellite in the world. It’s actually an operational Japanese satellite, which we’ve just been given access to use. Click here to see the amazing enhanced view it provides . You can even play with the resolution, which is great fun if, like this writer, you happen to be a bit of a weather nerd. Australia today as viewed through the new super sat. You can almost see the whales that the Japanese catch for sushi, errm, we mean scientific purposes. \n“Himawari-8 is one giant leap in satellite meteorology: it’s like switching from black and white TV to high definition colour in one jump,” Bureau Director and CEO Dr Rob Vertessy says. \nDr Vertessy is rather excited today. You shouldn’t interrupt an excited meteorologist. Please continue, Rob. \n“You could compare it to switching from the grainy images of the silent era to IMAX. You can see unfolding weather in detail we’ve only dreamt of in the past. \n“But it’s more than just eye-candy for our forecasters. Himawari-8 generates about 50 times more data than the previous satellite. Our forecasters now have access to 16 observation wavebands that capture important detail from many layers of the atmosphere. \n“Previously we received a satellite image just once every hour, now we get a detailed scan of our part of the globe every 10 minutes. It brings the conditions on earth to life.” The previous satellite was basically just a Coke can with an antenna which fell up into space. \nBut there’s more, as they say in the infomercials. Not content with Satellitezilla, the bureau is also about to upgrade its supercomputer. \nAs Dr Vertessy says: “The better the data we put in, the better the forecast that comes out. Our forecasters are now starting to make use of the vast quantity of new data. One of the most immediate benefits is the ability to see storms as they develop. We expect to see continual data over the coming years.” \nAll of which is good news. But there’s bad news too, and the bad news is this. Despite the ever-expanding suite of accurate forecasting data, the weather apps we use often dumb down all that info. \nHow many times have you cursed the weatherman (or woman) for a cloudy sky when your weather app had a little smiling sun? Or vice versa? \nOur weather info is being smarted-up but the message continues to be dumbed down. \nIn an age where our attention span is about three seconds, the next major challenge for the weather bureau could be to make all that sophisticated information presentable to the public in a manner we can all understand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:37:55.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
